The company is shrinking, everybody is leaving and they're not being replaced.

The company seems to have a lot of money to burn on pointless initiatives that do nothing for the business. Management seems clueless about tech and business in general. 

No communication, no direction. Feels very contractor-y, literally just need bodies to smile, nod and do the work. No team atmosphere, wins or career development. Managers are mostly focused on themselves.

Ambivalent about meeting any measurable objectives. If you don't mind being jerked around left and right by managers, this is the place for you."

40,TrueCar,The most honest review of Truecar,2020-12-19,2.0,Sales Manager,"Employer paid benefits. Good enough pay in comparison to similar organizations. Quality attempt at employee events. Great offices (until WFH). Occasional swag. Solid work from home accommodations. Additionally, there are some great people who work for the company and I have formed some of the best friendships and work relationships with many of them.","Where do I begin? It starts at the top. Leadership in this company is absolutely abysmal. From CEO down to EVP, SVP, directors and alike - the wrong people are making decisions. Don’t be fooled either, a director title used to mean something but not at Truecar. They hand out director titles to lazy and unqualified individuals like Oprah hands out gift bags. The message has been made clear by the organization - unless you’re in Santa Monica or best friends with The SVPs or EVP you have no place at Truecar. The rest of the organization is replaceable and they’ll let you know that regardless of your work ethic and performance. For years they have elevated individuals who consistently run their business units into the ground. Not to mention “key acquisitions” and partnerships that amount to no profit and major losses. But sure, let’s give you the keys to more areas of the company to screw up. 

HR is a mess. Don’t ever think they’ll have your back. They only want to protect the company from a lawsuit. Employees are not a top priority. They were aware of relationships between leaders and reports and never did anything about it. The recruiting team doesn’t even notify internal applicants of progress or outcomes so don’t expect any response as an external applicant if you are waiting. 

The product is antiquated and stale. For years they’ve had tech engineers with capabilities to make necessary adjustments, but here’s leadership coming around the corner to reinvent the wheel again. 

The marketing team is clueless on who their target audience and demographic is. Just because you let a 6 year old fill in some letters and call it a new logo, does not mean you’re going to somehow make more money. 

The company has been through two layoffs in the last 2.5 years and the only employees impacted are the ones who provide quality work. The fraternity is real at Truecar. There were more promotions after the layoff than at any point during my tenure at Truecar. It’s not a good look to fire 70% of your staff and then start handing out new titles and pay increases like Halloween candy. 

The only outcome for Truecar is to go back to becoming a privately owned company or to sell to someone who actually knows what they’re doing.  If you see a job opening here, run, don’t walk as fast as you can. You may make some money for a little while but in the end none of it will matter. 

Until every single member of ELT has been fired and new, competent individuals take over, this 15 year old “startup company” is the last place you want to work. 

Hell, even the CFO they hired ran away within a year because of the hot mess he inherited when he came on board."

The best work culture I’ve ever been around.,2020-12-17,4.0,Business Development,"Good pay, lots of fun, free lunches on Wednesday, great insurance, and amazing people across multiple offices.",CEO did not impress me and failed to get USAA contract.

Apart from that, there are no redeeming reasons to work here. Dishonest management, high employee churn, high upper management churn, very little if any career opportunities available, and of course, commission theft.  My lawyer has advised that it no longer makes sense to pursue my final commission so, at the very least, I'm happy to be done with them for good. This is among the worst places I've ever worked so if this post can spare one person from joining TrueCar it's a win. Good luck."

51,TrueCar,Leadership,2020-07-28,2.0,Dealer Sales and Service,"If you've done enough to suck up to the right people, they will keep you in place regardless of performance simply because you are ""theirs"".

If you worked in the field, your compensation was on the higher end. 
Fully paid benefits.","From my time with TrueCar I have been able to experience the wide gambit of horrible, ethically questionable behavior that you hear about from bad TV tropes and sitcoms. Countless re-orgs, shuffling of leadership, and a constant disregard for employee and customer feedback has lead this company into the gutter. Just look at the stock price and business outlooks. Even prior to the pandemic, TrueCar lost the partnership with a company that effectively accounted for over 30% of its revenue driving business with no plans or outlines of how to recapture the market. 

There are easily 4-6 people within the Dealer Solutions team that no one can simply say how they impact and benefit the business other than just being in the big bosses inner circle. 

Shady sales deals, tons of inter office relationships dictating inbounds and operational priorities that it is a wonder how anything gets done ""above board"". But then you look at the HR team and realize that they are inept and powerless due to the executive team having bullishly operated in such a broken way for so long that there is no help in righting the ship unless there is a fundamental tear down. 

We have had 2 massive rounds of layoffs within the last 2 years, and it doesn't look like anything positive has come from them in terms of streamlining, shifting business plans and practices, or becoming more efficient in terms of spending and overhead. We are 2 months past our last major layoff, and there still is major confusion and no direction given to outline how the company is to survive and build or grow. Sentiment seems to be that the leadership is treading water until the major partner deal expires at the end of Q3 to then be bought out or sold.

Its a ship without a rudder, compass, or any semblance of competent person at the helm. TrueCar constantly speaks about transparency, yet there is none practiced when it comes time to act on the words."

But that was 2015 and 2016....right around 2017 the company took a nosedive, and it’s been in a tailspin ever since.","An absolute burning sinking ship.  If you’re in sales stay away. From losing the USAA partnership, to botching the rollout of their overly complicated trade appraisal product TrueCar Trade, to pushing a C- digital retail product Dealer Science onto their dealers, to fluctuating their dealer’s monthly billing based on absurd attribution reports, this is a company that has made a staggering sequence of bad decisions over the last four years.  They just laid off 200+ employees, and the stock is at $3.  Avoid at all costs."

Car industry experience is paramount. Something to consider when considering long term career moves. If you have car experience, and are looking to start a career in tech, I highly recommend it."
58,TrueCar,Where your skills and professional growth will come to die,2020-06-16,1.0,Product,"When compared to other workplaces, I'm not sure there are pros here. You will get paid and you will have benefits. Outside of that, nothing stands out at TrueCar.","Unless you are really in a desperate spot, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. I know COVID has been hard on so many people, but taking a role at a company like this is going to hurt you more down the road.

The company growth/promotion cycle revolves around a small group of inexperienced ""leaders"" who are only looking out for their next payday on the foundation of your work. They do not know how to manage or grow talent, but instead rely on convincing executives that they are experts in fields they know nothing about.

TrueCar's employee turnover rate is incredible and yet they still have to conduct layoffs each year because every initiative they come up with, fails. You will never hear any follow ups to goals or OKRs because either those working on them quit in the middle of the year or TC comes nowhere close to meeting them, ever.

I was not laid off, but I wish I had been. Coming to TrueCar was the worst mistake I have ever made in my professional career. I learned nothing, the company has achieved nothing, and it was all a big waste of time.

These statements are even more true than they have been in the past. As soon as I find an exit, I'm hitting the door and I believe this holds true for more than half of the people left here.

If you still don't believe me, just look at the stock performance since 2018. Well before COVID ever existed, this company has been losing hundreds of millions in value. There are reasons and those reasons still work at TrueCar."
59,TrueCar,Don't waste your potential.,2020-06-16,1.0,Anonymous,Pay and benefits can be good.,"Terrible management, uninvolved unwilling and degrading. Pointless HR, report with or without documentation and it seems to be counted against you by management immediately. HR rep doesn't seem to take anyones complaints seriously, management proceeds with same behavior. There were many pointless events that focused on individual departments, and most events seemed centered around alcohol. Delayed transparency of impactful changes for dealerships. Advancement seems to be saved for whoever management favors. Maybe the repeat layoff cycle could potentially be avoided with less frivolous spending. What kind of company has annual layoffs!?"
60,TrueCar,Great executive team and culture,2020-06-14,5.0,Business Development Manager,"TrueCar is a highly innovative company that recognizes hard work. The executive team has changed quite a bit over the past few years. They have landed on a lean but fantastic core team that plans to expand the executive team soon. The product and tech organization went through a platform rebuild that was completed in late-2018. This presented short-term challenges for the organization over the past couple years, but now it is all about product innovation to benefit users and spark growth. I have enjoyed working with almost everyone I have crossed path with over the years. It is a highly collaborative organization that is open to taking good ideas from all levels. TrueCar is transparent with weekly all-hands from the executive team, in which they field questions from all employees. The offices are located right in downtown Santa Monica, with beautiful ocean views. Currently the company is remote due to covid. Compensation/benefits are competitive for the LA market and highly competitive nationally.","TrueCar plays in a highly competitive industry and is working to grow to profitability as a publicly traded company. This results in a ""work hard"" environment with minimal flexibility for employees that are not producing strong results. It is not for everyone, but if you perform well you will be rewarded."
61,TrueCar,Getting rid of customer-facing employees makes no sense,2020-06-11,3.0,Client Success Manager,"Enjoyed co-workers, great performance-based product, TrueCar differentiates itself by having customer service reps visit dealers monthly to go over numbers and training.","I really enjoyed working here, people were great and the product had a lot of value.

I am at a complete loss as to why the company would lay-off all their customer-facing sales reps, yet keep Executive Mgmt, VP's, Managers (managing who?) and training dept (training who?). This makes no sense, and they could've let a lot of highly-paid Managers go, and kept the people who actually interact with the dealers who generate the revenue.

Losing USAA was a big blow, and whoever is responsible for allowing this to happen should've been the first to be fired.

Management saved their own jobs, but might be at the cost of the company failing."

Nobody at this company feels confident with the current Human Resource Business Partners. They simply delegate all tasks, take zero responsibility of their own and are cold, unresponsive to suggestions and have driven the culture of the organization into a sterile, unfriendly, ego driven environment. I have never had so many coworkers say ""I don't feel comfortable approaching my HRBP, she does seems cold and nonsympathetic""."

There is no career growth here at all.","- Empty promises of promotions. Managers will state that you are getting a promotion the next cycle only for it to never happen. All promotions have been cancelled for non-higher ups. 
- Layoffs happen every single year. If you don’t get laid off, be prepared to do extra to cover for those laid off. Laid off employees are chosen based on politics. 
- Bonuses cancelled! Only execs get retention bonuses. NEW! The rest get MVP awards. Looks like we work for badges now. 
- So many have left or are leaving. With so few senior level engineers left, architects are forced to do IC work to cover for all the senior folks who have left. 
- Barely anyone cares about code quality. Most are so disillusioned due to reasons mentioned above.
- Don’t get fooled by reviews posted by management. The company depends on a fresh flow of talent since layoffs happen annually (every year for past 4 years)
- Stock has lost most of its value
- Absolutely horrible leadership
- Pretty abysmal business outlook since the biggest partner is leaving October 2020"

67,TrueCar,Don’t look anywhere else.  This is the place for you!,2020-06-03,1.0,Software Engineer,"1.)	I don’t know about you, but I like gambling. I always enjoy my annual trip to Vegas to play the slots and push my luck. When I can’t get to vegas, truecar has given me my fix. You see, every 6-9 months, we have layoffs. Some of us like to place wagers - who's getting canned next. The layoffs don't seem associated with skill or performance, so it's more like a roll of the dice on who will go. All the more exciting, you know?
2.)	I also like adventure sports. While most of my friends like it when their stocks rise, for me it's been fun watching the freefall. Watching my stock price drop from $20 per share down to the $2-$3 level reminds me of skydiving. Which is awesome! One of my favorite hobbies. 
3.)	I don't know about you, but I love meeting new people. Here, leadership changes every year. We've had multiple ceos, cfos, ctos, and chiefs of any department you can think of. Also, vps, svps, and middle management is a revolving door. Awesome! It’s made for an exciting atmosphere, always adapting to new vision and direction from the ever changing leadership. 
4.)	Very forward-looking product when I joined. While we haven't really changed the product much over the last few years, I personally like the retro vibe. Oh, we did update our brand. New imaging and logo. Really pretty much the same product, which is all the more awesome. 
5.)	Culture. What can I say that hasn't been captured in other reviews. HR is the dept that’s probably seen the most turnover. How many heads of hr have we had since I’ve been here? I’ve lost count.

Even if you seek it out, it’s difficult to find as managers want their teams to stay intact so they don’t have to hire new people. My goal was to work in a different department and I had been very open during  my interview to my first day as to what I was looking for in my career.  When I would seek out development opportunities, I’d be told that’s not the reason I was hired. I had to sneak around to get learning and development opportunities.

There is a lack of direction from management which causes a lot of finger pointing, targeting individuals for not bringing on more clients (when this wasn’t a sales role! And there’s an entire separate team whose job this is!).

PTO is advertised as “unlimited.” But it is hard to even take a few days off for vacation especially when you have to make sure you hit monthly goals. It is hard not to fall behind on the tasks/expectations set if you take time off. As dealerships are open late and on weekends, one is expected to be on call.

Pay is OK (but won't likely last much longer), benefits are good (but again, for how long?), and you get to dream about the opportunity this company once offered.","As the title mentions, the Titanic is the best analogy I could possibly think of. By all publicly available metrics (earnings call transcripts), this business has already hit the big iceberg and water is filling the hull. Everyone that works here is constant fear of what's next. It really isn't a fun way to wake up every single morning and even the weekends are worse (from all the anticipation).

I'm getting off of this ship quickly, as are many others. Those that are left, the often backstabbing, lying, political heathens are all going down with the toxic environment they have created.

There's another very large group of people at this company, the incompetent, who are stuck dealing with this mess because they aren't able to find suitable jobs elsewhere. I do feel bad for them, but their hiring as been a large reason this ship is sinking.

This place is awful. It lacks any executive vision or leadership. The people you work with on a daily basis will be the first to attack you and try to cut you short the first time you show any progress with what you are doing. Yes, they are all scared too and they know the way to continue the journey for as long as they can is to make others who are succeeding look bad.

The board of directors set back and watched the previous executives completely dismantle this company and did absolutely nothing for nearly three years except approve layoff after layoff after layoff (there were at least three).

Many people included in these layoffs could have actually been very useful in helping TrueCar create value. It was so ridiculous that, they were laying off people (some in director+ level roles) that were just hired 2-3 months prior. Total and complete idiocy.

Mid-level managers are often just as clueless and ICs have very little direction. There's a new set of executives but it is too little too late. We need a real CEO (currently with an interim), but I doubt they can find one to take the job.

If any of this sounds appealing to you, by all means join TrueCar."
88,TrueCar,absolutely toxic culture,2019-09-05,1.0,Director,"Decent benefits, provide lunch every Wednesday.","Extreme micromanagement and horrible cargo cult agile practices in the engineering organization.

Free lunch every Wednesday. Full mental healthcare benefits provided to you (you will need them).,"The product is awful and everyone knows it but no one knows how to fix it. Though basically all of the executives were fired over the past 2 months, somehow it got even worse to work here.

Everyone is leaving this place as fast as they can. We still lose 1-2 quality people every single week whether in marketing, sales, or technology. Partners are jumping off quickly as well and other revenue areas are dying.

We have three new executives in place and I would say the jury is out on two of them. We desperately need a real CEO who has a strong vision and is willing to take risks.

For those of us that have stayed in spite of the chaos, it seems as though some kind of financial incentive that is actually equal to the punishment we have been put though is in order. At least one that would allow us to live in very expensive Los Angeles.

Like others, I remember a time when this company was about pulling together and getting stuff done while trying to actually disrupt an industry. All that happens now is TrueCar's product has become obsolete and unnecessary and consumers no longer have any reason to use it.

Know that when you join TrueCar, you are joining a house of cards that is getting ready to tip over at any moment. You are joining an organization where the executives couldn't care less about your actual contributions or support you. If you're one of the many political players that kiss your way to the top, then perhaps it is a fit.

The culture is that of a dead carcass being violently ripped to shreds by 5 different vultures all fighting for the same last rotten piece of meat."

Boss 1 left, HR became interim Boss 2 (despite zero sales experience) and she promptly went on an extended leave. Boss 3 slept with a subordinate and fed her inbounds, suffering embarrassing weekly meetings, until qualified reps quit. Numerous HR complaints fell on deaf ears until this consequence. A new quarterly pay plan is a given, along with revised targets, at management’s discretion. Forced to sell non-TrueCar auxiliary company contracts as part of target, but given neither the collateral nor methodology to do so. Lay-offs are a yearly norm, this last one being significant ... unless you’re an ISR, in which case they allow under-performers to fester into morale-sucking leeches, robbing you of any levity you may have left with their personal misery and established cliques.

Even though my department is great, the morale at the company is pretty low.  It takes forever for something to be completely built. From the idea of conception to final delivery, things take way too long. It's also embarrassing to me that we're a public company for four years now, yet nobody knows who we are and what we do. The executives are so risk adverse, so we test things to death. And by doing that, it adds so much time to our final delivery.  The dev team is shorthanded like crazy, which is also a contributing factor to why things take so long to build. It's an endless cycle of problems. Sometimes I have to worry if the products that will bring us forward will be built, because it takes too long and management is scared of change.

Lazily shake with the skills of an incompetent local Santa Monica bartender, and viola - you have Truecar. 


- Worst executive leadership I have ever seen, where arrogance meets failure

- Somewhat ""worrisome"" mismanagement (google ""TrueCar insider sales lawsuit"" and form your own damn conclusions about a now $5 stock)

- Pointless, declining business model that will get wiped out (mercifully) in the next recession (current business strategy: we don't actually get you anywhere near lowest price, we make car dealers haggle with you, our website sucks... but hey, we have commercials with a pervy-looking dude with a beard and old people use TrueCar to buy Dodge Trucks at Sam's Club). 

- Culture of morons and unaccomplished managers firing people for personal reasons

- Culture of idiotic executives who should have been thrown on their arses long ago for making a bad company worse

- Astonishingly bad tech stack and capabilities that defy Moore's Law and get worse over time

- Culture; notice how a slew of generic ""we love it here"" 5-star reviews popped up early this year? There is a string of anonymous gmail accounts somewhere crying for their daddy. I'm here to keep it real, baby.

- HR; its like living in 1930s Soviet Union. People just get fired at random here, usually on the advice of less competent managers looking for scapegoats. Take that chain all the way upstairs, but stop short of the CEO, who is at best inert. 

- HR; when you are done dishing out millions for executive stock options, feel free to lay-off your tech people in mass waves. Who needs that stuff anyways?"

Benefits: they pay full for individual benefits.

Parking: parking is paid for in full","Everything else. There's no much in the way of leadership or culture at this company. The executives are great at flip-flopping and not knowing how to take our mediocre product and make it something competitive.

The culture is a toxic wasteland. I work in the business operations/marketing side of the house which is bad, but not as bad as the engineering/product org (thank goodness they are in another building). Those guys managed to shut down product innovation for more than a year and now we are even further behind than we used to be.

Layoffs are a yearly (if not an every 6 month) kind of thing here. Since so many people are leaving each week you likely won't have to worry about them for a while.

I remember when we had an executive team that knew what they were doing with big ideas and ways to disrupt the market. The former CEO was an idea guy with a little craziness added (think a shade of Elon Musk). The new CEO plays it safe.

I will make this simple. You will get more of a ""vision"" by asking the transients that sit outside the office in Santa Monica than you will from any executive here.

The environment is very political. Expect to do what you are told, when you are told or be gone. Also expect to throw your coworkers under the bus at every opportunity in hopes of a 5% raise that may or may not happen.

I wouldn't say above for sure, based on my team's salaries. The location of the office is both a pro and a con. It is on Ocean Ave. right next to the beach, but that beach is filled with bums.","Ask yourself if you want to work for a company that would rather write fake reviews on Glassdoor than address the actual problems with the culture.

The leadership team is mostly composed of under-qualified people who weaseled their way into the roles they have. Only the CEO has actual experience in his role, but he is so out of touch and, frankly, no one cares what he has to say internally.

The big monster at TrueCar is the horrible leadership/management within Product/Tech. They fired the CPO a good year or so ago (along with several other VPs) and since Product has been led by a group of extremely careless and untalented individuals.

These individuals are mostly ""rest and vesting"" hoping that their direct reports can figure out ways to grow the business, as they clearly cannot.

On top of these guys (and they are all guys), new VPs that have been brought in have turned the culture here even more toxic, including a new(er) individual who seems to think the Amazon way of kissing up, infighting, and playing politics is the way you should run your business.

Though this role is now the de-facto leader of product, there's zero leadership skills, but instead a fake nice demeanor that is a facade so you can be terminated the moment you don't bow down.

At TrueCar, you're not here to grow your career, but fight for your place so you can keep paying the bills.

On the marketing side of the house, there is a small group of people that have 3-4 jobs each. This means that no one actually specializes in anything and therefore execution is poor. Branding has been an after-thought here. Feel free to try and find TrueCar on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc. They are there, but the numbers are tiny compared to others in the market. 

The turnover here is incredulous. Lost both the CFO and Chief Human Resources Officer on the same day (just a few weeks ago). As other reviews have mentioned, lost 30-40% of Product/Tech last year alone and people are leaving by the week. They can't get anyone to stay and based on the culture described above, who would?

I feel bad for the new hires who failed to read Glassdoor reviews before joining. I can only assume they realized after weeks 2 or 3 that they made a big mistake."

- Good benefits package (minus the worthless stock options)
- Lots of free food (if you like bulk crap bought from Costco)
- Nice view of the beach
- Pretty good restaurants in walking distance (if you can avoid getting hit by a scooter or transient)","- Company is being made irrelevant by competitors run by smarter people with a better product; TrueCar is getting by as a fairly well-paying employer of almost last resort that happens to be located in Santa Monica and survives by having a few old partnerships with companies that clearly don't need TrueCar. From a product standpoint, most of your time will be spent doing silly things for these partner companies, or pointless things for TrueCar's lousy stand-alone platform. And you will have completely inadequate resources to do these things, with completely unfocused requests, while the company can't decide if they want to make car buyers or car dealers happy. 

- Fairly long hours spent inefficiently on collectively low-quality work; poor work-life balance considering how unimportant and low-impact TrueCar is in both e-commerce and in auto retailing.  Kind of a culture of seeing who can stay in the office the longest while actually doing nothing important or innovative. Worse places, sure,  but few combine mediocrity with these hours.

- A really laughable core product that looks like an e-commerce suite from 2005 and has remained virtually unchanged for years, despite noisy initiatives to take us to 2010 e-commerce levels without the resources to do so. 

- Second-tier, immature ""tech bros"" and older, confused AutoTrader.com veterans make for uniquely awful leadership and internal experience. A weird combination of totally inadequate leaders who cannot run anything important mixed with people who should be selling cars at dealerships (and a weird amount of people who previously did second-tier finance or accounting jobs now in important operational and product positions). No wonder there is a different leader of HR almost every quarter as it would have been hard to design a worse combination of collective leadership if you tried. Also, feel free to mix in a minority or female in a real leadership role on occasion, its not the 1950s anymore.   

- Culture of paranoia and inferiority-complexes on the product side; culture of paranoia, inferiority-complexes, micromanagement, immaturity and meaningless reports on the business side. Aside from the CEO, I have encountered perhaps two or three ""star performers"" or even effective leaders at the Director level or above. Some good product people, but often led by people who have no business there and were a favorite of some executive who knows no better. 

- The CEO means well and is a definite step up from the immature leadership of the founders, but seems about 20 years behind the curve. It feels like we are an AOL dial-up era tech company with a auto dealer network. 

- Having a few executives sell MILLIONS of dollars in stock options right before our stock plummeted was kind of a bad look. Also, I've lost track of how many VPs, Directors and even founders have resigned in the last year or so...

- Weird organizational structure with VPs and Directors who don't have a single direct report, and other leftovers from the founding era and a tiny, bankrupt acquired company that are leading things they clearly can't manage well.  Net result is low morale, secrecy, lack of transparency, and high turnover. Definitely no focus, aside from all the core values crap they once slapped on the walls.

- Hard to find a real pro in the office, or anyone who is into impartial and honest development of their employees. They don't do regular feedback here, they do blindside accusations that have crushed many of my coworkers. It seems nobody in leadership here has accomplished anything but building hype about a crappy tech product (aside from the CEO, who did his thing well before the Iphone was invented). 

- While I don't work for them directly, it seems some of the other business groups here ( like operations, partner, accounting) are extremely micromanaged and stale, and lose/fire lots of talented people while keeping yes men who can crank out powerpoints to pat each other on the back with (and confuse product with). Lots of power and attention is placed in the auto-dealer group, which are good guys but as far removed from tech as possible. None of this mixes well. Judging by the stock price, maybe that strategy isn't working so well.  

- Unhelpful culture; pockets of good people mostly led by passive-aggressive arrogant people who wouldn't be able to cut it anywhere else, yet act like they are at Google (minus the whole world-class excellence and hard-driving growth and accountability part). HR is completely untrustworthy. Hard to believe this company has been around for 13 years, given how amateur it seems in almost every respect. I've never been at a place with more undeserved arrogance."

Benefits are good, not quite as good as other companies I have worked at, but not poor. Free lunch on Wednesdays, free gym (up to $50/month). The do-ers at the company (the worker bees) are actually really cool and easy to get along with.","If you want to work just for the money, have to deal with politics and spend your time on a brand that is at the bottom of the market, you should join the team here.

Any review can be done by someone who had a bad eval or something like that, so let me give you some estimated numbers/facts.

Since I started at TrueCar:

-New CFO, CPO left, two SVPs have left, 3 directors have left.

-Another two VPs are leaving in the next 3-4 months (announced)

-Last year, the total number of just product/tech people that have left is around 25-30%. This not an exaggeration, it was announced by HR. We were told that most of these ""we wanted gone"". I'd beg to differ and it shows you how incompetent this company is.

Not convinced?

-Budget is very difficult to get here. The company is doing so poorly that any amount requested has to wait for the next QTR to help ease expense on the current one. 

-Leadership is very bad. Zero strategy, product  is years behind, favoritism. You name it.

-On this note, there are many who have a title/role they are nowhere near qualified for.

-The people they are bringing in to lead departments are mostly talking heads. Some of them are coming into the organization from day one and trying to tell everyone how to do their jobs. I haven't been directly impacted, but I know people who are on the way out (by choice) because of it.

I implore you to look at financial statements/earnings and listen to the calls. Then go and listen to the competition. That will tell you all you need to know.

In summary: lots of bad change, lots of politics, and no innovation. This is the worst company I have been employed at and I will not be employed here much longer."
132,TrueCar,The Most Amazing Place To Work...,2018-10-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"...If doing relevant work, learning, and your career are not your priorities. I know that sounds cheeky, but I say this as pragmatically as possible. A lot of people actually don't prioritize these things, and want a clock-in, clock-out job where the overall potential of a company and expectations are low enough where you can get buy with minimal effort and care. 

Truecar compensation is fair, so are the benefits, so if this is what you're looking for, it might be a good fit. 

The nature of the work, being tied to the business that it's in (Dealers, cars), doesn't really present anything impactful, so it's pretty easy day to day within product and tech. There's nothing really meaningful to solve = not too hard on the brain.

Benefits are pretty good, although they steadily took away perk after perk in my time there. Most recently I heard they locked down working from home, which by far was the best perk.

Work life balance was really really good. Maybe too good due to the lack of interesting projects.

Like a lot of companies with  immature cultures, the best ""Pro"" tends to be that you and your coworkers suffer through the same experiences, and that ironically creates it's own benefits of working with empathetic people. If only that teamwork could be applied to something worthwhile...","In my time there, Truecar never really had a strong tech and/or product leader. It's currently being run by inexperienced acquihires from a smaller, less-relevant company that  was going under. Unfortunately their poor decision making  and lack of experience has painfully shown in a record number of people leaving.

Record, numbers. I know you see/hear this a lot on Glassdoor for various companies with poor cultures, but in my entire career I have never seen such a voluntary exodus of talent relative to the size of the department/company.

There's a severe... severe... severe... lack of consideration to diversity within management. Everyone is white, and everyone is within this inner circle of acquihires. Every... one. It's gotten so obvious, that even the other white people have been vocally uncomfortable about the optics of it all. It's evolved to the point where we used to just hopelessly joke about it, because what else can you do?

As written in another review, it's a bad sign when your own HR department is writing scathing reviews about the company. I felt bad because i used to see HR people constantly behind closed-door exit meetings. I can only imagine how that wears you down to always have to bear the brunt of the poor leadership.

No mobility in career. Titles at truecar do NOT indicate ability or aptitude. They're essentially awarded to coincide with whatever your pay scale is. I've seen VP's there only have 1 direct report, directors have none. 

While the CEO seems to have done a good job for what he was hired for and has generally received good ratings, at this point the lack of intervention to help fix the culture and leader issues for the other c-levels has to be factored into that opinion."

147,TrueCar,Business Development Executive,2018-02-15,2.0,Business Development Executive,The benefits are great!,"Truecar has built a comeback on its Dealer Pledge.   Within a year of the Plede promises made to dealers, the management team completely back pedaled leaving the sales and service team to field dealer concerns with little confidence in their answers.      

Most states operate on a pay per sale parity.  In some states, they are unable to charge per sale due to regulations and legalities.   In those states, historically, Truecar has been unable to accurately project sales.   As a result, it is exponentially challenging to calculate rates that would be comparable to a like-make dealer in a similar market area.   For the Sales and Service teams, it is unneccessarily laborious and taxing to attempt to relay rates to a dealer that are inflated and discuss results that are unattainable.   Without sufficient data to support the exorbitant rates and rate increases, the dealer is defensive and uninterested creating a horrible experience,  distrust,  and high churn.

Historically, it has been evidenced that promotions have little to do with what you know and what you can do, but rather your tenure and your inclination to show loyalty and adulation to people in positions of influence.   If you are looking for advancement opportunities,  this is not the place for you.  

The stock options you are granted are generous.  However, when the stock is stagnant, the grants and options mean very little.  

REPORTING and EXPECTATIONS:   The emails and requests by a couple members of the management team  are COMPLETELY unrealistic!  Sending emails late at night and on weekends demading information and reports within hours at THEIR request was simply more than I could handle; Especially when my manager would NEVER answer or respond to calls, texts or emails for a minimum of 24 hours (during normal business hours).   Spending 3 hours of my Sunday preparing reports for him was beyond what is reasonable to ask and excessively intrusive on my already limited personal/family time.   There is NO consideration for work/life balance.   Don't be fooled by the ""unlimited time off"" policy.   You can take all the time your manager will approve, but don't expect help or concessions with the mounting work-load.   If you are in sales, you better hit the blue-sky goal that has been set forth, and service folks need to see the conglomerate of dealerships assigned to them.   With regard to reporting, why should we be exchanging valuable time with dealers to document in a WORD document the same information that is in SalesForce?   The micro management is getting out of control!  This is a team of seasoned professionals unlike any other in the industry.    If the sales and service team that is in place isn't getting the desired results, maybe it's time to take a look at the management, policies and processes."

Communication between remote offices is sparse and poorly handled.
Layoffs seem to be a yearly thing, and very much a popularity contest.  If you are good at your job, but not popular, you won't make it through the next round of layoffs.

192,TrueCar,Huge upside for Company and Individual Growth,2015-09-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"* Great Location

* Competitive Compensation

* Upside potential with stock options

* Data driven company, both inside and out

* You are given autonomy to make decisions.   And to be a master of your area.

* Ability to feel you are making an impact to the company each day.  

* Not locked into a rigid growth process - I'll explain in more detail.  I've worked at big companies where its almost like a pre-set path for everyone (i.e after 2 years, promoted to senior, another 5 years ->manager, etc).  Here you make your path.  If you are good, you will get more responsibility.  If you aren't, you will languish and come back to Glassdoor in 5 months and write negative review.  Basically this place is not for people that have the victim mentality (those that don't achieve something because of someone else).  If you want to succeed and are good, you will succeed.  In general, one's success is usually not anyone's fault but your own.  And all you can ask for from a company is to give you an environment where being good and working hard can be rewarded.   That's TrueCar. The rest (80%) is up to you.","* There are some people here who think ""There's no I in Team, but there is a 'me'"".  They spend more time positioning themselves than actually producing results.  Its a downside to a culture that rewards people so well.  Everyone's natural self-motivated instincts kick in.  if you opened up a cookie jar in a room here, you'd get a lot hands all stuck in that jar trying to get one out.

Overall its a great company to work for. Every company/family/person/[substitute another entity] has problems.  Key is finding one that has the most positives for you."

Now that your CEO has jumped ship it's just a matter of time before this company goes under.  Your stock price has dropped 46% and is currently at $4.85 as of today (Aug 24, 2015).  Your higher executives I'm sure are worried since they have stock that is not worth anything now.  You almost went out of business once, I don't think you can survive a second one.

The Santa Monica location is nice if you live within city limits or an adjacent city.","The internal politics at TRUECar make other places look like playground antics. There are execs, managers, and directors who cannot be in the same room with each other. A third party is required to mediate.

When a manager or higher up is let go or resigns, it's a high probably that everyone under that person will also be let go. That's not an exaggeration, it's happened three times in the last year. Whole teams and departments will disappear. 

Department reshuffles happen roughly every 6 months. Your boss is only your temporary boss. Your ""team"" are only the people you sit next to, don't get attached. And your desk will be relocated every 3 months (Not joking). 

TRUECar management will change the direction and development focus at the drop of a hat. It will be disguised at being agile, but it's just fire fighting. Full agile/scrum is not followed.

There are technology ideologues at the company. It's no longer ""What tech helps us solve the problem.""  It's now ""Our problem is the technology we are using. Rewrite the entire thing in this language/framework.""

Cross team communication is severely lacking, and the solution seems to be ""Let's call an all hands meeting."""

Keep that in mind before drinking in all the kool-aid. Salaries are very high. Benefits are good. Location is by the beach in downtown santa monica. If that's all you care about, then TrueCar is the company for you!","Where to begin. The recruiting team is the pits. The only decent candidates we interview in tech and product come from internal referrals, everyone the recruiters bring us is garbage. Someone decided it was a good idea to let the senior management that ran our main competitor into the ground come run tech and product. You can imagine how well that's going. Morale is extremely low, turnover is growing and there are lots of people looking to leave, it's depressing. TrueCar spent all of this time and money creating a new intern program and recruiting for it from a bunch of fancy universities, and most of us are expecting it to fail big time. If managers can't even effectively manage their current teams, most of us are confused about how they're going to also properly guide and mentor these interns. 

There seems to be a fundamental disconnect of vision and execution between the senior management, lower level people are starting to notice and it's not being received well. Overall communication between departments is poor, and doesn't look to improve any time soon. Entitlement and narcissism seems to be prevalent at the upper levels."

Fortunately my manager really cares about my growth as an employee, and continues to look out for my best interests. I have only been around TrueCar for about six months, but already feel like an integral member of the team with a significant responsibility. 

Leadership on my team is great, and there are no weak links in my department. If you are capable and motivated, you will succeed at TrueCar.","Everyone works towards goals, not necessarily the greater good. There is a lot of talk about receiving the twice-yearly bonus which is dependent on hitting your goals. 

Executives are far removed from the rest company. There is a very little interaction between the top of the food chain, and the rest of company. Certain employees (upper management) are making money hand over fist, yet there is no employee stock buying program. 

Food! Seems petty, but when the wonderful kitchen full of snacks goes away due to cost cutting measures, you start to questions why certain teams continue to get daily lunches and dinners."
226,TrueCar,"Passionate, visionary leadership coupled with a culture of synergy and empowerment.",2014-11-25,5.0,Dealer Development Representative,"Aside from the most amazing benefits packages and a performance base compensation plan that is only limited by your ability to set and accomplish your goals, the best reason to work at TrueCar is the opportunity to truly revolutionize an industry. The culture of transparency, teamwork and excellence are visible throughout the entire structure of the company and encouraged at every level.","The goal we are pursuing as a company is bringing dynamic change to the culture of an entire industry. It is sometimes an arduous journey, and because it takes a pioneering effort to forge new practices in the culture of an industry, you can sometimes grow weary, but from the core leadership down we are continually encouraged to keep on task, support each other, and be willing to commit to each individual's continued mastery of what we contribute to our company's goals and vision."
227,TrueCar,TrueCar Is Awesome!,2014-11-24,5.0,Manager,"TrueCar is different and a very special place to work.  TrueCar is focused on making car buying easier, which feels ""higher purpose"" than many other tech companies whose focus is getting users to click on more ads.  Transforming the largest retail vertical, helping consumers save time & money and helping dealers sell more cars profitably results in an endless supply of fun and challenging problems to solve.  TrueCar sets a very high bar and has accumulated an amazing roster of exceptional people.  People who like solving big meaty problems, collaborating and posting results do well at TrueCar.","The culture is not for everybody – it is intense and there is a debate style approach to discussing and solving problems.  If not a high performer and/or move at a ""big company slow"" pace, TrueCar is not a fun place to work as the culture pushes back hard on mediocrity, hiding and slowness."

What I don't know, I learn from my peers and co-workers because egos are left at the door.  I share my strengths and they are welcomed rather than dismissed.  Upper management is easy to communicate with, without feeling intimidating.  The benefits are the best I have ever had, and the work environment makes it easy to come to work every day.  Santa Monica is a busy place, and paid parking is a huge plus.  A chiropractor comes to our office once a week.  Who else offers that!  You are expected to work, and work hard, but it's easy to be motivated and love what you do when you are part of exceptional teams and in an amazing environment.","The company is growing, and some that have been around for a while tend to be stuck in the old ways of doing things."

Obviously the free lunches, athletic benefits, and trips to the LA Auto Show are nice benefits as well.","As in any company who's rewards are based on performance, the level of effort required on average is substantially higher than that of a 9-5 job.

240,TrueCar,Like working at the hunger games...,2014-11-21,2.0,Senior Engineer,They pay well.  Office location looks good as appearances go.  Nice snackroom and pop machines.  Benefits are great.  Flexible work hours.  Good bonuses.  The Operations team is well run and you won't get stuck being on-call all the time.  They are pretty willing to get you training for things and to send people to conventions and stuff like that.,"Culture is severely broken.  Every day is another fight, every project another way to get thwarted by one technical aristocracy or another.  The company is divided into factions and it makes day to day life unpleasant because you don't know who you are supposed to make happy.  It feels like you are always in between one political struggle or another. The company culture seems to encourage competition between teams and between individuals and the management seems to think this makes for a good culture, but it creates a terrible work environment where only the strong can survive or only the incompetent can thrive because they don't threaten the aristocracies.

On the technology side, everything seems to be an overly-complicated technical mess which never gets fixed because the teams are too busy trying to destroy one another and many of the technical managers seem to encourage it because it helps their agenda.  Even simple projects will end up being complicated because technical direction changes every minute and nobody has ownership of anything.  Your opinion won't matter on any technical matter whatsoever unless you manage to somehow work your way into the few inner circles.  Ridiculous technical mandates will be imposed on you. Endless meetings, processes, edicts, policies will make it so you have can't make any progress on your projects even after you get through the latest architecture committee meeting of the day.

But as long as you don't make any trouble you can find a way to hide and remain safe which eventually any smart person learns to do because if they speak up they will be punished by shunning or simply left out of important meetings.  The other reviewer who said everything is on a ""need to know"" basis wasn't kidding. They say they are about transparency, but that's the opposite way the management seems to run things."

HR Team is awesome and provides a great experience in catered lunches for the whole Company every week, catered breakfasts each month, and a host of other really great events. This is a Company that is going somewhere where you can be proud to work.","TrueCar is a demanding place to work. You have the opportunity to change the world here. But, the expectation is that you want to and you are capable of it. Work hours are somewhat flexible depending on role.  But, it is not uncommon for work to follow you home via after hours and weekend calls from Executives with new requests. Executive Team is overall pretty personable.  But when work has to get done - it does. TrueCar also has a lot of smart people, many of whom have very strong opinions and even stronger desire to be heard.  It is sometimes a place where the best ideas don't always surface to the top.  Newer employee, but staff doesn't seem to be very social.  I haven't been invited to do anything yet.

Because of the small size, and huge growth, lots of opportunities for advancement and great to work on high level projects with huge impact.

Ive worked here for several years and seen lots of changes along the way, nearly all of them have been for the better.

Benefits (I'd say above average benefits)","Where do I began.  I think I'll just list things out in order so you have a clear idea of what you may be stepping in.
- Pending the department growth is a possibility along with work-life balance.  However lets be clear and growth is almost dependent on how many hours you are around.  From what I've seen promotions normally were awarded based on basically living there with the managers.  There are an extreme and I mean ""EXTREME"" amount of politics at this corporation.  It doesn't matter if you work in tech, finance, HR, accounting or the dealership team.  They promote there ""friends"" from within so let's keep this clear.
- To reiterate, work-life balance just plain doesn't exist and it's even more extreme for tech, finance and accounting.  Turnover has been literally unreal in those areas and the employees who've worked in those areas literally run out of that place whenever they can.
- Management - There are a few very good managers in almost all areas so if you happen to work under a good one then congratulations.  When I say few you probably can count them on 1 hand, let's put it that way."

The work is challenging but totally manageable and we're creating a worthwhile product that people can really use. My coworkers are smart and committed to making TC the best, and the benefits are really great! The location is spectacular (especially for lunch options) and the offices are really nice inside. 

The company culture is great. Working within the product sphere, my co-workers have a great sense of humor, are helpful and collaborative. I look forward to coming to work every day.

Hours are flexible. Many of the developers work on a later schedule. The paid time off policy is fair, and there are other perks like reimbursements for your gym membership.

There are free lunches once a week. Some of which have some pretty great food. It's all free so I'm not complaining!

I feel very fortunate to be working at TrueCar.","As a public company, some belt-tightening started happening with spending, and I found it difficult to get equipment that I needed for ergonomic reasons. But in the end I did get what I needed to work comfortably, it just took a while.

276,TrueCar,Start-up growing up,2014-09-10,5.0,,TrueCar is a great place to work. All of the perks are amazing. The Health benefits are awesome and totally free. There are plentiful days of PTO. The team is insanely smart and doing some ground breaking work in technology and in the automotive business at large. Oh... and being able to see the Santa Monica Pier from the office isn't bad either.,The cons only stem from the rapid growth. The company is quickly trying to streamline processes while they grow at exponential rates which can get a little bumpy. That also makes it exciting.

The employees here are great. A high caliber of employee makes others work hard and makes you proud to be on the team. In general, everyone is very smart and very friendly - it's a fun place to work!","It is hard to find a con. We work really hard and the hours aren't short, but when you enjoy what you do, that's not a bad thing."
278,TrueCar,"Great at first, but once you see the favoritism it's disheartening.",2014-06-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Nice office.  Casual dress.  Good benefits.,"Lots of favoritism.  Hires people who are ""friends""  Cliques.  If you're not in the clique you won't be happy.  Expect you to be ""on call"" 24 hours a day.  Not much work life balance.  The CEO is very stuck on himself.  Won't engage in conversation unless you're a VP or upper management.  He likes to to very generous but only to people who are in his club.  He can't even muster up a hello to you.  The HR team is a joke. If you're not pretty and petite forget it.  They're more interested in looking ""cute and adorable"" then being a true HR dept."
279,TrueCar,Painful,2014-05-13,1.0,,"The only ""Pro"" for truecar was its benefits package.","I have nothing good to say about this company. During my tenure there I witnessed gross abuse of Scott's ""authority"". He constantly had employees going to his home to perform menial labor tasks. Executives treated IT as their personal home tech support, even went as far as going to non Truecar employees/executive homes. The CEO looking for someone to send to court in his place because he had too many speeding tickets (because you know this is totally legal). Good luck asking for an increase in your budget for day-to-day operations, but seeing Scott drive up in a new Tesla. Developers programming on small single 19"" monitor with dated equipment. The list goes on..."
280,TrueCar,"TrueCar is fun, crazy, interesting, and slowly growing up.",2014-04-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"TrueCar is a fun, growing company with a great mission that you can get behind (make car buying easier and more transparent for everyone). We have fancy offices with unbelievable ocean views. We have fantastic benefits. And despite growing up, we still occasionally behave like a startup and host margarita-fueled happy hours right inside the office.

The HR team at TrueCar is among the best I've ever encountered. They know your name, they are responsive to your requests, and they actively seek out employee feedback. They are a genuinely top-notch team and I really appreciate that they don't sit still. They are constantly testing out new ways to improve life at the company (new benefits, free lunches, cool parties, fun happy hours, process improvements, etc).

Overall, TrueCar is a great place to work but you need to understand that we are a company in the midst of a major transformation. As I write this in early 2014, I'd say that TrueCar is too mature for those seeking a hardcore startup experience and too fast-paced for those seeking a cushy nine-to-five. But if you are looking for something special in between - a place where your contributions still very much matter and where you can be super proud of the progress that your company is bringing to the world - then I’d heartily encourage you to apply. There’s plenty of ocean view for everyone.","- The level of bureaucracy is steadily increasing as we add more staff. This is an inevitable part of growing up but may frustrate you if you're seeking an authentic startup experience.

- There is still little to no work/life balance and the expectation is that you will be available at virtually any time. If you check your email at 11pm on a weeknight or at any point on a weekend, you're almost guaranteed to have a few messages waiting for your response. This is slowly getting better as the company matures but now there is some tension between the teams that are still working crazy hours and those that have managed to relax the pace. Overall, you need to be prepared to WORK if you join TrueCar.

- The organizational structure changes drastically every January and is marked by a 3-month long period where nobody knows who is responsible for what. Momentum and accountability vanish until the dust finally settles in March/April. You'll get used to it.

- The performance review process is long and tedious and lacks accountability. We try to use an orderly SMART goals-based process but SMART goals work best for stable, consistent, slow-moving companies. TrueCar changes direction quickly and frequently, so there’s always plenty of wiggle room for those in charge to turn the process into a popularity contest. To the HR team’s credit, they have been listening to employee feedback and have been making changes (manager reviews were added in 2013, for instance, and we are now allowed to edit our SMART goals midway through the cycle). I’d like to see a peer-review component added because I think that it will close the loop and make the possibility of a popularity contest less likely."

Great, hard-working and collaborative team members have kept me motivated.",Executive level management is disorganized. Company goals and strategies change constantly resulting in minimal security or stability. Salary increases and bonus scales are ridiculously difficult to attain even for super star workers. Very politically driven and appears that promotions and compensation are determined by politics rather than talent.

The folks who have been there awhile are supremely dedicated and knowledgeable, but they need to open up the discussions to some of the other talented folks in the building.",People are not being properly led. Many of the leaders fall into highly political behaviors as there seems to be a complete backlog of trying to get anything done.  Technology team is old school thinking and can't get out of their own way - they spend so much energy trying to explain themselves  and discussing how to make it seem like things are progressing - when they're not.  The product team is all over the map - some very strong folks and others who are simply hard to work with.  Way too much finger pointing in the wrong directions that everybody acts like they're constantly on their heels.  People who are actually succeeding are not even recognized and many of the folks who are kicking ass are being directly blamed as the problem.... terribly strange.
299,TrueCar,Strategy changes with the wind,2012-10-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,A few  smart people still remain. Free snacks and games.,"There is little direction and weak leadership. The company goals change nearly every week and most time is spent butting heads with other departments jockeying for a prominent role in the devolving mission. At one time, TrueCar was an innovative and forward-looking company.  After it 'reorganized' itself a few times , several talented people have been redirected to perform functions for which they lack experience or, more commonly, left the company. The CEO called the remaining staff  'crusaders' and the former staff  'mercenaries'.  Many of the mercenaries should be more appropriately  labeled 'heretics'. They once believed in the mission, but either no longer believe or are unable to pin down exactly what the mission is/will be this/next week."

Employee attrition is reaching critical levels, no one will disagree with CEO and is inappropriately afraid of presenting mixed/bad news to CEO (who is competent, bright, has a solid vision, and open to suggestions).  Highly political organization where silence is golden, innovation is discouraged, interdepartmental ""turf wars"" slow progress, invite discord, demotivate talent, and embraces a 90's tech infrastructure that poorly recognizes  current strategic opportunities in favor of the the ""know-how"" and myopic vision of current staff. Two days ago, there were 28 job available on the Truecar site, that seems odd to applicants, particularly to those who are aware that these are ""backfill"" vacancies.

CTO is very accesible and is always willing to sit down and discuss ideas with line-level employees and managers alike.","The absence of a solid product/development process and overall sense of direction contributes to developers being in near-constant ""crunch"" mode. Company's culture glorifies and reinforces this behavior; TrueCar veterans boast about the number of hours they've put in during crunches, and management lays on the praise for those who've sacrificed their social/family lives for the company.

I found myself spend many hours working late and from home, but we were all given a certain amount of stock. That made it feel like it was our company.",The dress code was casual.

Ask to shadow someone that does something similar to you for one day. That place is a disaster, they have to use all external recruiters because they can't keep people in fast enough. 6 months makes you a veteran. No workers is right way too many directors. I don't get it. They're also super unprofessional. Sott Hansesn (COO) thinks his Ari Gold, swore at my coworker in a meeting with our department. All in all, if you can flip burgers at McDonalds for $8/hour do it because you'll be happier than making $200k at TrueCar."
