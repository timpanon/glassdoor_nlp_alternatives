0,Trulia,One of the best places I've worked at,2022-03-14,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Amazing work-life balance
- Exciting and rewarding work
- Great pay",None that I can think of
1,Trulia,Great Culture,2022-01-10,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"All highly friendly colleagues, great to work with and be friend with.",Career progression is a bit slow
2,Trulia,a long time ago,2021-03-14,3.0,Sales Associate,fun place to work while it lasted,comoany got bought out... take over
3,Trulia,Trulia sinking fast...really fast,2019-06-07,2.0,Data Scientist,"free food, commuter benefits, Health","In short a lot that you can count.  I am highlighting  a few. ....
To start with, politics and favoritisms are two big things which is letting Trulia down. So many people are leaving and Management is so scared that they are not allowing them to write a farewell mail to their colleagues. Its has become boy's club.

Constantly changing directing and technology is killing the productivity. 

Zillow's biggest mistake is Trulia.

Work from home is a myth and non existing. (Do not be fooled if your recruiter tells you it exists)"
4,Trulia,Lack Leadership and Integrityy,2019-06-06,1.0,Marketing Communications Manager,The time off policy is very generous.,"Lack of true leadership
Cult like culture
Step sister brand to Zillow with no true future path forward"
5,Trulia,Meh,2019-04-13,2.0,Trulia Engineering,"Culture is generally positive. 
Location of the downtown SF building is great, it's a special place to be.","The flex vacation policy is a myth.  You are told that higher ups - including our general manager -  are watching how much vacation people are taking and that if you are high on 'the list'  it gets noticed.  There is an unstated limit of 4 weeks.

I have found it to be political and unforgiving.  There is no warning on something to improve, you are directly dinged on performance.

Not all roles and responsibilities are well defined and no desire to fix it.

There is some tension between product and engineering, with painfully untechnical product managers hard charging engineering.  Product managers are generally more directly than collaborative."
6,Trulia,Great Place to Work,2018-09-26,5.0,,"Very open work climate: hierarchal structure almost seems non existent. VPs working next to interns, easy to communicate with anyone and everyone, and great team environment .",None that I can think of
7,Trulia,Best Place to Work,2018-08-31,5.0,Software Development Engineer,"- Great coworkers - smart, helpful, and kind
- Competitive pay and benefits; rewards for good effort made
- Semi flexible workday schedules 
-lots of room for growth in both skill level and responsibilities
-awesome senior management","- Too many meetings
- Some remote work was possible when needed, but more would have been better :)"
8,Trulia,Marketing Manager,2018-08-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The recruitment process was both streamlined and thorough, and there was active communication from both recruiting and the hiring manager.

The company really does abide by their core values - focusing on collaboration, innovation and transparency. 

There is a visible emphasis on employee satisfaction, as evidenced by the breadth of benefits offered, and the general demeanor of fellow employees.",No observed cons to date.
9,Trulia,Cutting-Edge Tech Stack,2018-08-12,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The people you'll work with end up being your friends
- Great leadership team
- Leadership team solicits feedback from (what seems like) everyone
- There is a focus on using cutting-edge tech like React, Nextjs, GraphQL, Typescript, and AWS","- Not everyone sweats the small details
- Sub-optimal managers continue to drive good talent away from the company
- It's becoming less fun to work there (fewer happy hours, very few team outings, hard deadlines and huge pushes to get to those deadlines)
- I see people working on the weekends (submitting pull requests, responding to emails, reading and replying to Slack messages, etc...)"
10,Trulia,Great Tech Talent but ineffective mid level managers,2018-08-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great Tech stack.
Good Engineers.
Free snacks and Fruits.","Most Mid level managers are ineffective and make poor decisions.  Caring for employees is one thing and pretending to be caring is another.  The culture has more imposters than genuine Leaders.

No Bonus at all. 

Work from home policy is Terrible. Leadership has no trust in employees and unwilling to make exceptions. These three reasons cause a lot of frustration and great Tech talent leaves the company."
11,Trulia,Smart and Amazing People,2018-07-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Everyone that works here says the same:  they love the people here. 
People are smart, kind, and care about you on the personal level. Its an innovative company to this day and we only hire the best because we want to create an environment that will lead to success. The CEO of Zillow Group creates a culture that is employer focused and it resonates down to the managers of the individual contributors.","Not too much cons in my opinion. The only main comment is that career paths are not always super clear. However, our management encourages career development discussions so if you want to get this feedback you can if you initiate it."
12,Trulia,Senior Software Engineer,2018-05-07,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The company is great to work for, they have great benefits, good compensation and an awesome culture, I recently became a parent and their support both personally and professionally is outstanding.

Technology wise they are constantly trying to improve and have a lot of resources for growth.

Finally they have the best diversity I've seen in my career, there is almost always at least a 50% female representation and in general all around welcoming to diversity.",They don't have everyday lunch.
13,Trulia,Amazing culture,2018-04-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Culture, smart colleagues, interesting work",Needs to make more profit
14,Trulia,Senior Software Engineer,2018-04-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"You are always surrounded by brightest minds in the industry and a great culture. Trulia does a good job of keeping its employees happy and motivated through a mix of competitive salary, benefits, and interesting work. Career development and growth is of utmost importance to the Management and they take extra care to see employees happy and content. Excellent work life balance and flexible vacation policy.","While moving at a fast rate, burn out is inevitable."
15,Trulia,Inside Sales Associate,2018-03-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"great team, well structured salesforce and process, fun office","no room for growth, looked down on inside sales"
16,Trulia,Great place to work at,2018-03-21,5.0,Software Engineer,"Great coworkers and managers. 
Great company culture.
Interesting consumer facing projects to work on. 
People cares about you and help you develop in your career. 
Can bring dogs to work. 
A lot of company & team events, monthly happy hours.",No cons on the top of my head.
17,Trulia,Amazing Experience,2018-03-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Trulia is a great place to work. 

As a designer, I feel challenged every day and have a chance to participate in strategic conversations early on. There is a real openness to different points of view and contributions are always listened to. 

I also really value our executive leadership, they really care about employees well being and will go out of their way to recognize the team's efforts. I have been very happy here.",I wish we could ship things a little faster than we do now.
18,Trulia,One bad apple really can spoil it,2018-03-04,2.0,,"There are some really smart, inspiring, nice people working here. 
Office space is nice, and the pay/benefits/perks are good.",Two stars given because I witnessed/experienced unprofessional/immature behavior multiple times by a manager. Directed at me and many others.
19,Trulia,Falling Star,2018-02-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Really top notch benefits and great office. The engineering teams are kind, passionate and poised to execute.  If you are  focused on climbing a rickety  corporate ladder, then this is a great place.  Despite obstacles, I was able to build productive relationships, add value, and acquire great experience,  hence the 2 stars given.","If you want to build or support a great product,  then this might not be the place for you.   Trulia struggled through all of 2017 to  hire a VP Product, meanwhile losing some exemplary managers.  The differentiating vision of a ""vibrant neighborhood community"" is fading fast, as actual product changes are weak. Ask hard questions if you interview here. Ask to SEE what they've done lately, don't settle for the PR version.  Ask if there is more than a subtle chance that Zillow will swallow Trulia."
20,Trulia,sales,2018-02-14,5.0,Sales Associate,"Took care of there employees, fun and positive atmosphere","phone sales is horrible, real estate agents want nothing to do with you"
21,Trulia,"Great culture, average standards",2018-01-04,4.0,Software Engineer,"Amazing benefits. Great culture. Very smart, friendly people. Lots of events to meet people at. Good management. People here really care about you, and it is evident. Discretionary Time Off is also nice.","Engineering standards/standards in general are not very clearly set, and there are a few unsavory characters."
22,Trulia,"Amazing People and Benefits, Tough Sales",2017-12-12,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Working with great people
-Great benefits
-Things got worlds better after Zillow aquisition",-Focused a lot on selling right now products versus the right products for clients
23,Trulia,Senior Manager,2017-12-07,2.0,Senior Manager,"- Great Benefits. 401K matching starting the first day, great health insurance, dog friendly office.

- Company trying to redefine itself and their mission in a red ocean of competitors with a similar service. Opportunity to be part of a ""turnaround story.""

- Interesting customer-facing product. Real estate is an undiscovered frontier full or opportunities to explore the intersection of technology and location/sense of place.","- Zillow's intentions for Trulia as a business are unclear. Zillow has increasingly become more and more involved in the day-to-day operations of the business, which is confusing, as Zillow is a competitor. Trulia continues to lose market share to Realtor.com and Redfin.

- Lack of a sense of urgency to fill key leadership roles. Several key leadership roles (like VP of product, VP of design) remained open for 8-12months. It's impossible to build great products when the right leadership is not in place. 

- Crippling technical debt results and an  inability to execute on the strategy. Lion's share of the development work is used to pay down technical debt instead of developing new, differentiating features. Leaders talk ad nauseam about a new strategy that sounds great, but is nearly impossible to  implement due to technical debt. 

- Anti-Agile. What to do and how to do it is dictated by executive leadership, especially from Zillow execs.  The technical competence and organizational clarity that are required for teams to work effectively in an agile fashion do not exist, and the leadership does not philosophically behave in a way that aligns to agile ways of working. They are unwilling to surrender any sense of control. Teams feel disempowered and lack a sense of passion and personal investment in the work."
24,Trulia,Amazing Tech Company With an Even Better Culture,2017-12-07,5.0,"Senior Director, Software Engineering","The people are by far the best part of the company. Everyone from Spencer, our CEO, to our newest members. It honestly feels more like a family than a company. Our sendoffs for employees leaving the company are just as big, if not bigger, than our welcome events. Employees really have a chance to take ownership of their work and their teams, and everyone has opportunities to influence the entire company.",There is a LOT to do in the real estate space and only so many hours in a day.
25,Trulia,Intern -> Full Time. Love coming into work everyday.,2017-12-05,5.0,Associate Software Engineer,"I'm highly engaged and get to work on what I like as well as learn something new everyday.
Very very good work/life balance.
My team is awesome and we have become friends outside of work.
The progression from intern to full-time has been very smooth and everyone wants you to succeed.
Our CEO is everything I'd want as the leader of our company.","A lot more focused on product than technology (lack of open-source projects). However there seems to be a growing interest in hosting tech gatherings.
Would like better office-amenity-parity. The seattle office seems to have a lot more food choices, and fun spaces. That being said we get to have dogs.
Greedily would like more scheduled free lunches (currently only offered on fridays, and whenever we have company meetings)."
26,Trulia,"Caring, Collaborative, and Innovative",2017-12-04,5.0,Manager,"Trulia has a great equity and belonging program (aka diversity and inclusion). I've never seen the level of support at other companies as I see here. The company also invests in the people - for instance, we just all went to Seattle for an internal company conference. It was a great experience and I got to meet several Seattle colleagues for the first time and have meetings scheduled for future conversations.

The vast majority of people I reach out to are happy to answer questions or help out on projects. People care about the work that they do and the company is actively encouraging innovation and collaboration.","As for cons, I've heard there's an old code base, but there was a re-org a little bit ago and everyone I've talked to feels like it'll improve things."
27,Trulia,Sr. Account Executive,2017-11-28,4.0,Account Executive,"Great way to break into a career in sales if that's what you're looking for. They've spent a lot of time developing a solid training class so that you have the ability to sell with confidence once you're on the sales floor. Recruiters tend to hire well a fun group of people, this makes coming to work fun. Lots of perks for high performers. Great overall company culture.",It can feel like a call center at times and it's very competitive. The role itself can be a bit redundant and become dull fast.
28,Trulia,Call Center,2017-10-26,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Easy product to sell.  You learn how to cold call,It is a call center.  If you enjoy that or can mentally handle it then there isn't many cons
29,Trulia,Sales Manager,2017-08-20,4.0,Sales Manager,"Benefits, People, Commissions, technology, support staff, culture were all awesome!!","HR gave too much leniency to employee's that were under performing, and it lead to putting management and other sales people in a tough situation...work hard and get great commission...don't work hard and get 3-5 months of pay for doing nothing."
30,Trulia,Amazing company and leadership; great benefits,2017-08-03,5.0,Marketing,"+benefits are amazing
+unlimited PTO
+great supportive culture
+fun to come to work
+commuter benefits
+opportunities to move around company
+market value salary leveling
+CEO is awesome
+equity and merit increases frequent",-a lot of changes in leadership (mid-tier managers)
31,Trulia,Awesome place to work,2017-06-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"great culture, very talented co-workers, and company was on a very exciting trajectory",some lower caliber or less productive employees were in the mix that sometimes slowed progress
32,Trulia,awesome place,2017-05-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,all things are great at Trulia,no cons as far as i have experienced
33,Trulia,"Great team, great people, hope that continues",2017-05-05,5.0,Manager,"Solid environment, TONS of employee perks",Kind of concerned how the integration with the Zillow Group can change Trulia's excellent culture
34,Trulia,Account Representative at Trulia Inc,2017-02-22,3.0,Account Representative,"Great co-workers,
Great atmosphere,
Free snack and drinks and plenty of random lunches supplied by management","Too much gossip, and behind the scenes talk among co-workers, had a kind of ""high school"" feel to it.
Company is great to those that blow out the monthly revenue goals but make the people who are struggling feel like an outcast. Those unfortunate people feel definitely underappreciated and coming to works is no longer a passion"
35,Trulia,Great company,2017-02-07,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"People are awesome at Trulia
Lots of learning opportunities
Excellent benefits that include health/dental, 401k match, $500/month transit
Convenient office location","Legacy code base can be hard to work with
Inter-departmental communication needs improvement"
36,Trulia,Great place to work,2017-01-17,4.0,Senior Manager,"Amazing perks and benefits. In-office perks, like food and workspace are extra awesome. Fun, nice people.","Company lacks a little direction. A little bit all over the place. Engineers, like everywhere else in Silicon Valley, get preferential treatment."
37,Trulia,Software Engineer,2016-11-25,5.0,IOS Developer,I really loved the culture at Trulia and Zillow Group. I started with a summer internship and ended up working as a full-time employee. My team was amazing and so were many other people at the company. The perks were great including the holiday party in Seattle. I really loved how it was dog friendly too. I enjoyed pushing code from day one of my internship to being allowed to work on large features which allowed me to be hired as a full-time employee. It was awesome talking with VPs and the President of the company from time to time. That's pretty unheard of at a lot of large companies. It was definitely difficult for me to leave.,I can't say there were too many. They seem to have a lot of trouble keeping Senior UX Designers around though. Things started feeling more corporate with time but that was natural with the acquisition. Some of the teams also seemed a little bigger than necessary. I didn't leave because I was unhappy with the company. The Bay Area was unfortunately just too expensive for my family and I.
38,Trulia,Heavy work load with great culture,2016-11-02,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Excellent company perks and culture
-Supportive management
-They provide lots of opportunities to grow into different roles","-Salary was lower than the average for my field
-The workload was heavy to bare at times"
39,Trulia,Missed opportunity,2016-11-02,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Competitive base salary, good RSU compensation.
There are people who still care about the company.
Snacks variety is great.
Good health insurance.","Most of the best people have left.
Politics and some really nasty egomaniacs.
No ESPP.
Lunch is free only a few times a month."
40,Trulia,"Great Place To Work, Great Pay and Benefits, Could Innovate More",2016-10-24,4.0,Software Engineer,"I love coming into work every day. I work in an environment that promotes risk-taking, daily learning, and ownership of your work. I feel like my voice is heard when I want it to be heard. I feel respected by my peers, despite the fact that I am in my early career.","I don't feel like Zillow Group innovates anymore. We have every possible feature related to real estate and are only redesigning pages, or re-engineering features. There haven't been that many new, game-changing products being released (besides Premier Agent, which I don't work on)."
41,Trulia,Software Engineering Intern,2016-10-03,5.0,,"Just an awesome place to work, people are incredible friendly, the environment reinforces the ideals of innovation and practicality. You have to be a willing to be open and friendly with your coworkers and have fun.",Honestly I didn't foresee any issues that couldn't be solved outside of a simple conversation. People are approachable and helpful in fixing issues.
42,Trulia,Best workplace I've been in,2016-08-19,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Management has done a remarkably good job of selecting colleagues who are both smart and a pleasure to work with. The atmosphere at the office hits the sweet spot of being motivated to succeed and also cooperative, valuing the well being of each member.","I dislike commuting to downtown SF, which is hectic, and wish I could work from another location. If I ever leave, Bay Area commute/expense will probably be why."
43,Trulia,Contractor,2016-06-10,5.0,File Clerk,"Great snacks, great people, they are always having fun events. I was a temp contractor though so my experiences or not really representative","There is not much I can really say, as mentioned before I was more of a temp contractor on an assignment so I can't say that I ever got a sense of what was 'wrong' with the company"
44,Trulia,Onboarding,2016-06-04,5.0,,"Pre-start communication and support has been second to none. 
Really friendly recruiting team willing to go the extra mile to help and provide advice.",None so far. The experience has been very smooth.
45,Trulia,Great place,2016-05-11,4.0,,"Awesome culture, benefits, and leadership",Quick growth and disorganization. Politics sometimes got in the way.
46,Trulia,inside outbound call sales,2016-04-25,2.0,,"Good concept, great benefits, included from start of job on full time...","Doesnt put belief in employees, made promises didnt keep, changed pay After hire."
47,Trulia,Mobile Engineer,2016-04-14,5.0,Software Engineer,"I started at Trulia before IPO and left before Zillow acquisition. Trulia has great culture and people. It's very fun to work there. Innovation week, mind body spirit day, easter egg hunt..etc.",I don't have much to say.
48,Trulia,Truly one of Denver's best places to work!,2016-04-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Zillow Group is consistently on several ""best places to work"" lists and for very good reasons. I have been with several organizations throughout my professional career and Zillow Group has hands-down done more for me than anywhere else I've worked. First off, the culture is second-to-none. From free food and beverages on a daily basis to incomparable perks and bonuses, Zillow Group truly has an amazing culture. The leadership, starting with Spencer Rascoff on down, the management, and the employees make it a truly great place to work! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic career opportunity! I can honestly say I look forward to going there each and every day and contributing to my team and the organization as a whole!","Being a tech-based company, you must constantly change and adapt to stay ahead of the competition. Our CEO, Spencer says that if you get complacent, you will get blindsided by the competition. With that said, change is the only constant at Zillow group. If you are flexible and adaptable, it is a very fun, exciting, and challenging atmosphere, but if you prefer the status quo and do not do well with change, it would most certainly not be a good fit."
49,Trulia,"All in all, it's been fun but exhausting. The work and people are great, but too many social politics.",2016-04-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,There are some amazing people there. I love coming to work to see them. I love the work I'm doing- when I get to do it.,"The upper level management seems to exist on its own island, far away from anything else. Their decisions lately have seemed arbitrary or poorly communicated. They spend more time worrying about what each other thinks then thinking about helping or working with or managing their employees, which leaves most middle management feeling a little aimless and frustrated, which of course trickles down.

The highest level management seems to move too fast and lack focus, which leads me and others to think they are making fear-based decisions, which is bad for morale.

Feedback is also given in a condescending, confrontational manner, which is really not necessary."
50,Trulia,Once in a lifetime experience,2016-02-27,4.0,Product Director,"I joined Trulia in the early days, in 2010. I fell in love with the company and I stayed in love until it became public. After IPO, focus shifted into pleasing shareholders (rightly so) but that meant that short term projects took over and the customer-value related projects were left behind. Still, it was a career changing experience, particularly from 2010 to 2012. Loved the people that worked there, although a lot of them left when Trulia was acquired by Zillow.",Any company has pros and cons. The pros usually compensated for the cons. I guess the thing I disliked the most was the short term focus the company had when I left.
51,Trulia,"Great Company, Great Culture",2016-02-24,5.0,Finance,I worked at Trulia from Dec of 2013 until they were acquired by Zillow.  It was a great company with a fast pace and some of the best coworkers I have ever had.,"After the announcement of the Zillow acquisition, work slowed to a crawl, as we were awaiting the inevitable acquisition."
52,Trulia,Trulia,2016-02-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,The Zillow brand has a strong management team. Spencer has a clear vision for the future of Zillow Group and does a great job communicating it during all hands meetings. The Zillow Group benefits package is one of the most competitive in tech.,"On the Trulia brand, the management team is not strong. Since the Zillow acquisition, morale has been low among Trulia employees in the San Francisco office. Trulia's management team is aware of it, but aims to suppress information instead of trying to address the problem. Here are two examples:

-Historically, departing employees sent a goodbye email to the entire company. After the Zillow acquisition, employee turnover and goodbye emails increased. Trulia management thought it brought unwanted attention to the fact that many employees were quitting every week, and directed managers to prevent their departing employees from sending goodbye emails.
-Since the acquisition, Trulia's management team has fired numerous employees. This by itself is not necessarily bad, but on multiple occasions the employee's co-workers were never notified, and in an extreme case, people didn't realize for over a week that someone was fired."
53,Trulia,Great place to work,2016-02-18,4.0,Inside Sales,"Once you leave, you get a true appreciation for how great the environment was.  Every company will have some positive and negative, but for sure the people and the culture was the best I've ever experienced.",Not much to say here.  Minor office politics and growing pains but that was to be expected.  Glad to see they finally cleared out the orange demon that was polarizing that place.
54,Trulia,Sales,2016-02-18,5.0,Sales,"I am fortunate  to work for the former Trulia now Zillow and i can honestly say they hits the sweet spot between ""startup culture"" and ""big corporate culture."" There is the small company vibe, wherein you can talk to everyone and get things done. And there is enough room for flexibility in processes for individuals and teams to choose what works best for them, while having the support of the larger organization.

in short friendly atmosphere, Great benefits, competitive salaries with limitless earnings in sales","Like Most growing companies there is a lot of change... most for the best but need to be able to adapt and pivot on a dime if needed.  

Free bagels and cream cheese along with alot of other food: must use a lot of will power to avoid them ;)"
55,Trulia,Fun,2016-02-17,5.0,,"Great people, great sales training and good food was enough for me",There was a commission cap and that was annoying for me
56,Trulia,Great Place to Work!,2016-01-31,5.0,Software Engineer,I love the direct impact my work has on both the users of our site/app and the productivity of other engineering teams.  Your work does not go unnoticed and management goes out of their way to praise your contributions.  The people around the office are extremely friendly and always willing to help or share insight into whatever you ask them whether that be software design practices or the industry in general.,"I drank the kool-aid, and I liked it.  Is that a bad thing?"
57,Trulia,Was great,2016-01-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Trulia is a great place to work because of the culture and environment. Open office and fun people to work with.,The pay is not that great and there is always something changing.  Most of the managers are only interested in doing whatever it takes to move up not elevating their employees.
58,Trulia,Strategic Account Execuive,2016-01-27,5.0,Strategic Account Executive,"great career path, awesome people, wonderful management, and all around great experience","Sometimes lack of oversight. The mass layoffs were unexpected, unfortunate, but it happens."
59,Trulia,"""Glorified Telearketing Job""",2016-01-16,1.0,Advertising Consultant,"Free Food. CEO is inspirational, but I believe unaware of unethical business practices and misrepresented ""corporate culture"" in Colorado call center.","Local recruiter basically misrepresented the position, causing me to leave a job making good money for over a decade. Deceptive business practices. ""Boiler Room Approach"". Preach about their incredible ""culture"", but lead by fear. Offer little to no coaching and/or solutions for success first 90 days."
60,Trulia,"Awesome culture, people, work, and benefits!",2015-12-26,5.0,Software Engineer,"Engineering team culture is great.  Small, autonomous teams.  Open communication throughout the organization.  It's nice to be surrounded by very talented engineers in every department.  Meaningful work... who doesn't want to help people find the home of their dreams?  Innovation week once a quarter to work on a project or improvement to existing products.  Also, the benefits are amazing.  Medical, dental, vision, and life insurance.  401k match, stock that is actually worth something (Zillow Group), paid maternity and paternity leave, discounts on restaurants, etc, etc, etc...  Honestly, there are a ton of pros to being an engineer at Trulia.","Depending on your team, you could be working with some older technology but there is a real push to get newer tools in place."
61,Trulia,Account Executive,2015-12-14,4.0,Account Executive,Fun people and positive work environment. Very sufficient training and organization of inside sales team.,"Little visibility to the inside sales role and lack of opportunities to move within the organization, even when recognized as a top seller."
62,Trulia,Remember the Titanic?,2015-12-09,1.0,Account Executive,Benefits are the only thing that I would recommend this company for.  There is nothing else worth mentioning to anyone.,"Their management and sales techniques are a complete joke.  Bait and switch sales tactics, a good ol' boys club, rampant drug use in management and sales and customer service reps.  Commissions have continued to tank over the past two years.  Managers encouraged to write fake reviews to beef up glassdoor rankings to cover up the real reviews."

66,Trulia,Best corporate culture I've ever been a part of,2015-10-20,5.0,Senior Team Lead,"I can't say enough about this company.  We have some of the best leadership I have ever had the pleasure to work with.  We have all weathered some storms and changes yet we have done it together and with clear expectations and probably faster then anyone expected.  The core values and group make this a great place to come to everyday.  I've been here over two years and I can honestly say I have never dreaded showing up to work.  The moment I knew this was the place for me is when I went thru some personal health related issues and I had management and senior leadership all step up and support me during that moment.  I have worked for several large ""corporate America"" environments and I have never felt the way I feel here.  This office feels and acts like a family, we care about the individual which helps us achieve all our personal and corporate goals.  That is something hard to find at a company of this size.","I don't know what to put in this part.  Sure every job has bad days, days that are a grind, days where you just feel beat up.  The difference is here when I come in the morning I feel like I can start all over and leave the negative behind me.  I can manage my own outlook on things which reduces the ""cons"" that most people would have.  Never let a bad day lead to a bad week, or bad month..."
67,Trulia,Account Executive,2015-10-18,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great atmosphere, wonderful people to work with, great hours, fun job overall,  potential to make a lot of money if you work hard","Must make 80-100 calls a day, need to make a sale a day or they keep a good eye on you, can be difficult to meet quota, and if you don't meet it you don't get paid"
68,Trulia,Beware......,2015-10-09,1.0,Sales Manager,"It was awesome when it was Trulia. Snacks, games, fun environment. Most of the people that work there are good people. Pay is good if you are a top seller - good benefits.","Shortly before, during and after the merger. They began to weed out some of the top talent across many levels of  Trulia, for several reasons - most notably asking questions and ""rocking the boat"". The leadership now, prefers to surround themselves with ""Yes"" men & women, rather then be pushed to improve processes, revamp policies and be challenged to correct issues. Upper management that was brought in shortly before the merger is more concerned with appearances then with reality - they prefer people that ""look"" the way they think they should or ""dress"" the way they think they should, people that always go along with their plan, when specific members were brought in they brought with them homogeny from past jobs at stuffy bureaucratic corporations and Trulia lost a lot of what made it so great - both in people and culture. Before this change in the Denver office - feedback was not only encouraged but rewarded, the EVP at the time promoted a culture of no politics, best idea wins and unity. The new leadership promoted a culture of office politics, ""professional"" appearance over substance and little to no new ideas. Team members were chastised for questioning policies or changes to commission structure, told to ""be company men"" and promotions were now based on amount of brown nosing as opposed to actual value brought into the organization. Upper management promoted sales reps to management positions that would not challenge them intellectually or politically. Fun, close relationships and caring were replaced with a notion of ""professional"" meaning, cold, heartless, bottom line strategies. People from every level that had built the company were told to  ""go with the flow"" , not raise concerns or ask questions and were fired with no cause and no justification. Overall this new management, took a fun company that was burgeoning with young diverse  talent, had an amazing, caring culture, and was truly an amazing place to work and reduced it to just another call center/phone sales job where kissing up and wearing a tie will get you promoted faster then producing results and improving the company. They got rid of a smart, diverse and dedicated workforce and hired robots, college kids who don't know better, ambitious brown nosers or people that are too scared to or don't know to ask questions about changes made that negatively IMPACT them. Maybe that is what they wanted? Just don't kid yourself into thinking this is a ""start-up"" culture with upward mobility or a place where you can advance without having to sacrifice your morals and dignity - it simply isn't anymore and the current management they brought in pre-merger has everything to do with why. So if you are an intelligent, ambitious, fun person who wants contribute ideas, learn, and make an IMPACT while working with awesome upper management that respects your ideas and values you as a person - work at Trulia 3 years ago. If you want to work a phone sales job, being micromanaged, berated and disrespected - where the only way to get promoted is to actually have your head..... you get the idea, then by all means - work here now.  OH, and side note - as someone that personally witnessed the top leadership at the Denver site encourage the managers to leave multiple positive glowing reviews on this site, to combat the actual reviews (remember that whole caring more about appearance then reality thing?) beware of the ""glowing"" reviews with no negatives - let's be real, even the best job in the world has cons."
69,Trulia,Zillow Group Culture is the best!,2015-10-08,5.0,Senior Sales Executive/Foreclosure Specialist,"Working for Zillow Group has been a phenomenal experience. I've been helping real estate professionals grow their business for over a decade and the solutions we offer change peoples lives. The culture and work environment are top notch. You couldn't ask for a more positive, supportive environment, and the income opportunity is second to none.","I've worked a lot of places and there are no Cons. Great environment, great people, great income, great benefits."
70,Trulia,Best Workplace in Denver,2015-10-06,5.0,Sales and Training Leader,"I have worked in a corporate setting (Wells Fargo, Chase, Countrywide) and also in a boutique setting (small investment firms and private lenders) and this is the best company that I have work for, hands down!  It is the perfect blend of an innovative start up culture coupled with the brand dominance of a Fortune 500 company.  Training and Development second to none.  Upward mobility, meritocracy, benefits cannot be beat.  Leadership is transparent and values employees.",None.  There are absolutely no glaring weaknesses to report.
71,Trulia,Awesome Internship Program,2015-09-30,5.0,Software Engineering Intern,The software engineering internship program is a great way to get development experience in a fun company with great culture! The mentorship at Trulia is great and the people that work there make the company amazing.,"Very few cons, as everyone is flexible and really open and easy to talk to."
72,Trulia,Trulia Software Engineering Intern,2015-09-30,5.0,,"One of the biggest reasons I chose Trulia was because of its healthy culture and atmosphere. The company encourages employees to get to know each other, and everyone is easy to talk to. On top of that you're given a lot of responsibility on very interesting work that always feels like it is making an impact.","I came in almost half a year into the Zillow merger, and while most things have been sorted out there was still a little confusion on how to accomplish certain business tasks. I'm sure this will be sorted with time."
73,Trulia,Great place to work,2015-09-29,5.0,,"Definitely a great company and office.  Refreshing to work for a company that sells a great product and has a culture in place to support their employees.  No job is ever easy...if it was, everyone would do it.  There are high expectations but they come with fantastic rewards and career growth which is what a true professional should be looking for.  I've seen the company time and time again both pre and post-integration do everything in it's power to do what's right for their employees.  If anything the integration has just added additional opportunity.  Total compensation is in line with what you would expect a top-tier company would give for real talent.  The Denver office in particular is definitely a fun place to work with a great vibe and friendly people in multiple departments.  The HR team is one of the best I have ever seen in terms of being approachable and fair while having a nose for what's really happening.  Management is encouraging and supportive.  Senior management is fantastic.  The execs from HQ make regular visits to Denver and have face time with everyone, no matter what role you are in.  It is obvious how deeply they care for the success of the Denver team and our clients.",Very few things to complain about as nothing is ever perfect or goes according to plan all the time.
74,Trulia,Business account executive,2015-09-28,1.0,Business Account Executive,"Food, ping pong, happy hours, cool co-workers, did I already say food? That's just because they dont want reps breaking for lunch",No longer Trulia. Zillow bought Trulia and there were mass layoffs in April 2015. The few remaining top Trulia reps have been fired or quit and are replaced with new ones for lower pay. Zillow is not what I signed up for! Very unhappy with the way this company is headed
75,Trulia,Sales rep,2015-09-27,4.0,,great office location and culture,low pay and lots of cubicles
76,Trulia,Senior Account Representative,2015-09-24,2.0,Inside Sales,"TRULIA was an amazing place to work when it was still Trulia. Free snacks, and they get their employees drunk during office hours and let them drive home that way as well. Trulia's CEO Pete flint is a complete sell out to the new greedy CEO of Zillow, Spencer Rascoff. TRULIA AND ITS CORE VALUES ARE NOW NON-Existent: it's happy people, its happy customers, and it's happy environment has been demolished all together. Zillow is over saturating Trulia's markets and exposure for agents like their own company has done for years which is causing chaos in the real estate industry. Spencer also makes all employees chant a cult-like ""saying"" together in sync to praise him and his accomplishments at every company meeting. It's not only weird and extremely creepy, its completely unprofessional and demeaning to all people employed under him.","Since the merger with Zillow in August, everything downward spiraled out of control for reps AND agents. No warning of the immediate and EXTREME changes to each individual roles along with massive failure combining agent profiles/accounts. Agents are now being double/triple charged in just a few weeks, over drafting thousands bank accounts thousands of dollars while cutting top brokers exposures down by at least 80 percent. Rascoff has pathetically tried twisting this disaster of a merger into a ""positive light"" which they few of us left in this company with a brain see right through his lies. Recently Zillow has been weeding out Top Producing Trulia reps with irrational reasoning causing extreme panic around the entire sales floor - the reps who helped build Trulia from the ground up are getting the short end of this new merger. Comp plans ""reward"" fresh out of college 21 year old inexperienced kiddos that are currently being hired in the masses to replace the top, long term, high revenue producing Trulia reps at a much lower rate (they are ok making 2k a month because they don't know any better). There is very few of us left that have dedicated our hard work, blood sweat and tears into making what once was ""trulia"" an extremely successful company. We won't last long...and most of us are currently looking for better opportunities for a company that respects their employees AND their long term clients. 

Not to mention Zillow Stock is plummeting at a staggering rate. Another topic Spencer fails to discuss with the company employees at all. Very frustrating. BUT, it's probably a good job for you if 2k monthly sounds exciting to you, you live with your parents, are a part time junkie or advancing in you job from the restaurant/server industry to cold calling. Maybe. Good luck!"
77,Trulia,Hard to recommend,2015-09-18,2.0,Account Manager,"Beautiful building, good benefits, close to BART, free food, lots of happy hours.","While there used to be a modicum of concern about the paying agents, that has gone by the wayside. Agents spend their money to appear on the website, and when there is an issue they now only get voicemail saying everyone is in a meeting. If you like disparaging your paying customers, then this is the right place for you. But if you have an ounce of integrity, think about going elsewhere."

The kitchen is always stocked with free fresh food and the work hours of 7:30-4:00 are awesome for those wanting to get things done in the afternoon.","Like any growing company changes will be made, Trulia changes constantly (especially with the zillow integration) but those that can adapt to change won't find that as a CON at all."

GREAT benefits","Change - i get it, a fast growing company is always evolving and changing ""usually"" for the best. that being said the denver office has seen to much! since january i have had 5 different managers and now 3 different directors. i cant speak for 100% of my Performer/Account Development team but we were so excited to be working for the best unit director once we heard he was moving back from the seattle office, best 3 months at Trulia were under him however he was moved to run a new team and yet again i was moved to a different manager and under a director i don't think could sell Trulia to someone who handed him there card and said i want to sign up please. ""since we just lost our director to a new pilot i have a feeling a lot of us are looking for new opportunities. Also i have heard we are getting standing desks for the past 4 months, now this is something petty but whats frustrating is how its ALWAYS brought up and hey 4 months later here we are… seems to be a lot of false promises made at Trulia right now…  Pay - now i could go on all day around this topic, as i said above the pay potential is uncapped and ALOT of money can be made here, that being said, before you interview ask how many sales executives hit quota..  its less then 50% and at $14 an hour you better have a second job…  i think i made more in SPIFFs then actual pay in MAY, which is kinda sad when i cant even tell you how i won the SPIFF  money as every other day they rolled out something new to try and mask the truth. i hate to spend more time on the con section so this will be my last comment, and i can only speak for denver but i am sure every one is unsure of what the future hold for them after being bought out by zillow. we would like to hope that there will not be a second round of layoffs but i guess only time will tell"

It's all Zillow now so go apply at Zillow ( have heard it's very micromanaged and most inside sales people are very stressed working there due to it being ALL about the numbers, if your good they like you and if your medium it's a horrible pressure cooker place to work have heard).

Since the merger with Zillow, everything has been awesome. Nothing but wonderful further positive changes have come since Z came in. The pay is great, the benefits are great, the people are great, the extra amenities are great (free fully stocked kitchen (its like going to 7-11 several times a day, just no cash register), games, massages, amazing on demand fresh ground organic coffee, just to name a few).

But it's the way they treat employees that really stands out. A month after starting here my wife was diagnosed with cancer and we had another child. With so many companies I would have to fight for even somewhat of a life work balance. But here I'm allowed time off when I need to be with my family. 2 days ago, she had surgery, I had time off with Trulia's blessing, beautiful flowers from my team and a gift from the SCEO himself. 

Management really promotes employees success.  We're encouraged, trained, and given help when needed. You feel like they really hear you.

I made around $6,000/month take home after commission, it was sweet!

-Super Lax management, if you're selling they don't even bug you. They also don't hound you about the calls + talk time if you're selling. 

-Cool incentives like 1.5 days for your sales, counted towards your metrics to help you hit quota. Instead of getting 100% credit for the sales ($400/month, you would get 150% so that $400 is actually $600 with 1.5!)

-Beer at work all the time.

-Great people, ping pong, foosball, UNLIMITED food & drinks. 

-Casual work environment","-The shift is early, starts at 7am and goes until 4pm. 

-Outdated information with the properties at times so that makes it hard to sell. 

-Lots of customers have been burned in the past and are very reluctant to come onboard again."

You are expected to make lot's of dials in order to to put you in a position to make the company more money but put more money in your pocket. Biggest con, after a while is can be a very repetitive sales cycle which most may get tired of. Another con, they sold out to Zillow, so you'll be working for Zillow now."

+ Lots of parties, if that's your thing
+ Swanky new office worthy of SfGate article
+ Lots of smart engineers, PMs
+ Mostly nice people, egos of most people are checked at the door","- Ads/sales team pillaged the site, and the leadership failed to keep them in check. Trulia had something special going and it was strip-mined by banners, interstitials, and paid placement. CEO Pete Flint and COO Paul Levine take the ultimate blame here for a deficit of vision and lack of reverence for the product. The tail was wagging the dog.  
- Dysfunctional compensation. Few people at Trulia cared about the IPO except super early employees and senior management. Talent was often seeing leaving for more generous pastures.
- Managers, even first-level, were mostly helicoptered in from outside instead of promoted from within."

Post IPO IMPACT values died.  Sales team encouraged to lie to agents to sell a sub par product.  Support staff so bogged down with valid agent issues and a ""no care"" attitude regarding agents from most of the management.  Constant site glitches made even the most simple task impossible.  A constant cycle of frustration between agents, sales and support staff killed any moral.  Flat out lied to regarding the impact the Zillow merger would have, now the mass lay offs are a reality.  This was a great company until it became all about money.  Any 5 star rating has been posted by HR or management don't be fooled."

They started learning rings which was nice but they don't accomplish anything.  The managers couldn't do the jobs they expect their subordinates to do and they sit in taller desks to make sure their workers know they are the overlords","Selling a sub par product.  You will have 2 other teams who can poach your sales at any time.  They have ""sales collisions"" and if you are on a favorited team you will get the sale.  Imagine working on an agent for months and you go to lunch and come back and someone else booked the sale.  You would think you would get it because that have I M P A C T values.  Nope.  You are out of luck.  Lunch just cost you $200.   Just look at how often they are trying to get new reps in.  It isn't because they are growing.  They are replacing.  2 people remain out of my class that was hired less than a year ago.  There were 15+ people in that class.   Very telling"

Easily the best experience I've ever had working for an employer.","It can be hard to know what opportunities are available, as there isn't always clear communication.

Lots of booze-filled events, if you're into that.","Micromanagement. Managers will pace back and forth staring at your computer, talk in your ear while you're on a sales call and send text messages at 6:00 a.m. with irrelevant information. 

Quotas fluctuate and go up constantly but pay outs are the same. One of the lowest salaries in SF for a comparable position elsewhere. 

Managers are constantly playing favoritism and cliques are a result of it. If you're new, half of the sales floor won't even acknowledge that you exist. It makes for an uncomfortable environment. 

Policies change based on whether the managers like you or if you're considered someone they party with."

phony culture. 

saturated market, (when interviewing for sales ask them how many real estate agents can actually afford their product...15% of agents can afford $400 or more / month, don't listen to the great opportunity of 1 million + agents, most sell 1 house a year and make less than 30k).

RE agents very very very unprofessional, this is not b2b, just b2c, very transactional, 100+ calls a day to people who are getting 100+ calls a day, they don't understand business, they don't trust you and they don't want to talk to you. and most of the time you're not helping them, you're just talking them into something that will never work for them. and then they call you and cancel, all the time, no one sticks with their contract.

157,Trulia,Ask Questions. Ask a lot of Questions,2014-10-05,1.0,Account Executive,"The departments are great. Professional, creative talented, and hard working. The only department that does not meet up to this is sales/acquisitions","Transparency is not something the leadership team is used to on the sales floor. If you are applying for a job in acquisitions ask a lot of questions. I mean a lot of questions. Ask questions like what are the realistic salary expectations and how is bonus structure set up. Ask questions like how often does it change? They change a lot. What happens if you do not meet expectations and how often does that change? Then ask about the management staff. Some of them act like used car salesmen, most of them are helicopter managers and buzz over you, another one is a jittery spaz, aka a lot of drugs but HR seems to look the other way,  constantly micromanaging you through 6AM texts to make sure we get to work.  All of the managers seem to tolerate people being late, hung over, and people being entitled. The management team will also look the other way if you are doing something shady but you are making sales. If you have a trip planned in your 6 months there is no such thing as quota relief and management makes you feel guilty about taking any time off including sick days because we have an obligation to the stockholders   If there is a company event the sales management team discourages you from going even if you are doing well.  Training is a joke.  Learn everything you can on your own and not from those around you. I have been there for almost a year and the thing that is consistent is the endless amounts of dials, horrible quick sales pitches, and new scripts to guilt agents into buying.  You do not learn any new skills other than to close hard and fast. This is a boiler room environment. Take this job if you need money and do not have a degree because if you do it is not valued on the sales floor. Word of advice, just read the script."

Upper and mid-level management are micro-managers who are clueless about selling the product and motivating their teams.  The product is a joke....Agents beware:  100% of a market means nothing.  Waitlists are misleading and there's probably a good reason why your zip opened up - someone else let go of it because it did not work for them!  Quotas are unrealistic and change regularly.  Rarely are they shared until the month has already started.  This company was a pleasure to work for at first.  Then greed set it and the entire culture changed.  The only people / employees who are making money are the shareholders, managers and salaried employees.  If you are considering a sales position at Trulia, you would be better off applying at McDonald's because that's about how much you will make with your hourly wage and NO commission paid!"

Trulia has burnt its bridges with a majority of them with a product that doesn't work. Almost every day I would talk to agents who said that the tried us(within the past 6 months) and wouldn't use our advertising again. The response from management is that these agents just are not good at their job. The only opportunity to move up is to become a team lead. Of the direct management team(8 people), all but 1 were outside hires, including one hired at the same time as me. They lied in the interview and said turnover was non-existent, but are hiring up because they are growing so fast....when I started there were 25 people in my training class...out of a total sales team of about 200 I saw 2-3 people fired for not meeting quota or quitting every week.

172,Trulia,Realistically optimistic - Review after 6 months of employment,2014-06-04,3.0,Inside Sales Representative,"An extremely down to earth work environment. Most everyone is very laid back and outgoing. The training program is bar-none, one of the best from a grassroots approach. For the most part you're provided with the tools to succeed within your given position and continually encouraged to reach out for help when needed. A select group of Managers and Trainers their will be the ones to go to when you need them, find them.","Elitism - There are several different business lines within Trulia. If you're low on the totem pole, you're treated like as such. Lack of continuity - Too many mixed messages, your manager will deliver a different message to you than most of your training. Close minded - For the most part, if you're not ""crushing quota"" you're nothing more than expendable. The reality is, the ones ""crushing quota"" are numbered in the 5%-10% range. Trulia misses out on an immense amount of opportunities from those who are meeting quotas, but have industry experience and innovative ideas. Archaic - When it comes to technology from a customer interface, they are right there with anyone at the top however, there internal functions are almost negligently behind and in need of a severe overhaul."
173,Trulia,Good info if thinking about working for Trulia,2014-05-28,4.0,Account Executive,"Good people working there. Managers are very open and always available for questions/help. Generally had a 1on1 meeting w/ manager once a week to discuss numbers and your current quota, pacing, projecting, etc.. Also great benefits and perks with excellent training program.  However, if you do not like to cold-call 75-100 real estate agents/per day...this job is not for you.",Too aggressive of quotas (sometimes). When I worked there- 2 parts to quota: 1. new subs (new subscribers) and 2. Rev (revenue).  The quotas would change month-to-month (as most sales jobs) but would constantly change prices of products we offered and add or discontinue others. My advice- go in as an AR (account rep) vs. an AE (account exec). Yes base salary is a little lower but so is quota which will allow you to exceed your overall monthly quota to make more money vs being an AE and having trouble hitting numbers month in and month out.

Ever increasing goals/budgets to hit....to make money.  Quotas that go up mid month.  Constantly changing goals and initiatives keeps $ out of reach.    You would think they manage to try and not pay you a commission.  Seriously. 

Seems like they solely manage to the stock price.  Goals skyrocket when they need a good quarterly report.  Trulia seems very happy to constantly keep the commission check just out of reach.   Even though we are hitting record sales numbers the commission checks have becoming more elusive."

They double your quota slowly...but surely!!! They do not reward their top reps in any real way. The best you will get are crappie  RSUs. Ooo a prize here and there! Get real!!! I would rather earn 20k move a year for what I am worth, instead of some crap speaker set. THIS JOB IS HARD!!!!!!!!!! LIKE REALLY,  REALLY HARD!!!! IT GETS HARDER EVERY DAY! STOP GIVING US CRAP PAY SO YOU CAN HIRE MORE WORK HORSES! LEADS ARE GETTING THINNER BY THE DAY, BUT QUOTA GOES UP!"
180,Trulia,Great company. Love working here!,2014-04-24,5.0,Front-end Software Engineer,The engineering department is talented and innovation plays a key role.

Easily the most incompetent executives I have ever seen operate. If you want to work for a company where "" not rocking the boat"" and automatically agreeing with the highest paid person in the room is rewarded - apply here! It is unfortunate that they would hire so many leaders with a lack of imagination. A once promising company has become just another place to work. If you enjoy blending in and agreeing to get by - this is the place to be. If you have any real ambition or independent thought - beware. Additionally - it is well known that management is asked to write positive 5 star reviews to this site once a month, so be aware when reading all the ""awesome"" feedback."

I'm a single parent who has a manager who is flexible if my child is sick and i need to leave.  The benefits and time off are amazing.  This is the first corp i have worked for where i believe my voice can be heard.  You can beat an easy 8 hour day quotas that are attainable.,"We cold call, cold calling is never fun but i have been in this industry for years and Trulia is well known in Real Estate so it isn't that bad."

It's absolutely incredible and needs to be witnessed first hand (Monthly Happy Hrs, costume days, Corn-hole and ping pong tournaments, Top-Performer 'get aways' in Cabo, monthly recognition dinners, just to name a few)

Upward mobility: Constant internal promotions from all departments

Incredible hands-on training during your first 30 days (as opposed to being thrown to the wolves)

Ongoing training and reinforcement to make you an overall stronger sales professional.

Health Benefits are tough to beat (Trulia really does care about their employees)

People Matter: Your voice is always heard and the best ideas win. Tenure does not play a big part of decisions, Trulia puts the right people in the right seat.","Like any sales job it can be a grind at times, mentality is everything."

Although it's competitive, everyone here is super cool and more than willing to lend a hand at any time. The trainers are great too! I had very limited experience in sales before I started here, now after only a few months I feel like an expert in my field. and that's a true testament to the dedicated trainers we have on staff. It's super exciting and fun to work for an organization that is constantly evolving and growing. Although Trulia is a publicly traded company and there are like 300 people who work here, It truly has a small business family atmosphere. On top of all that, Trulia gives its employees the best benefits imaginable.","Because we are growing so rapidly, we are also hiring like crazy. As a result, sometimes our leads can be scarce because they are being distributed amongst so many people. However Trulia is about to launch a multi-million dollar advertising campaign, so leads should not be a concern for much longer."

Colorado-based Sean, Alex, Chris, and Dwight all do an incredible job of preparing new training classes to hit the ground running as soon as they're introduced to the sales floor. And, once on the floor, the company does a great job of showing they care about their employees long-term. Awesome benefits as well as in-office perks (yoga, fully stocked kitchen, etc.) are all great incentives to do your best here everyday. 

Management has a genuine work hard/play hard mentality. When you work hard, you will be rewarded with go-home early goals, happy hours, and special events. Your manager will also do everything in their power to help you progress your career at Trulia. With uncapped commissions, the sky is truly the limit here!","Because the company is growing so quickly, sometimes the space at our office feels a little tight and disconnected."

From first Friday happy hours at the penthouse, to fireside chats with keynote-level speakers, Trulia truly went above an beyond to keep employees happy and motivated. I literally liked everyone I met while I worker there.","The only thing I didn't like about Trulia was the employee turn around (specifically for inside sales). For a while, the inside sales team was a revolving door of mediocre talent. This was mostly due to the type of sale Trulia catered to, but it still was hard knowing 8/10 people hired weren't going to make it past the 3 month mark."

Sales force is just a worthless front for all those other people in the organization that are more important and worth more to the company IE Designers, Network engineers, Web/Mobile based development, VP's, Marketing/Advertising...anyone not in sales basically.  You will be treated well in the beginning but by the time your out of training you quickly become just a drone dialing away."

Still the start-up culture I loved, with a lot of upside on things that suck in a start-up.","We are growing fast, space is tight (looking for bigger/unified location). At times new processes pop-up that can feel like a slowdown, however it is usually good business practice that a company of our scale should be doing. Still it looks like red-tape at times. Yet much more transparency as to ""why"" it has to happen."
196,Trulia,"Nasty meat market, getting out now!",2014-02-25,1.0,Account Executive,"Trulia had great benefits and a solid work schedule, but being a female in that office of men and always being harassed was not a good experience.","If you are a female, don't even consider Trulia.

Besides the previous issues, the commissions continued to drop over the past 6-8 months.  I once made pretty good money, but it feel apart.  The job used to be fun, and I was dreading going into work once everything changed.  I just don't feel like management appreciates the sales reps anymore because they have so many reps that they aren't needed like they used to be.  We have become numbers to the company.  Since Trulia went public in late 2012, everything has changed for the negative."
197,Trulia,Looking for another job with everyone else!!!,2014-02-25,1.0,Account Manager,"Easy to find drugs if you are into that stuff.  I get to leave at 4 every day.  The health benefits are good, so my kids are taken care of but that is useless if I can't hit my quota and get paid respectable.","There are so many people who abuse drugs during work and managers don't even realize.  I've been there 6 months and everyone I talk with who has been there longer than me says that their commission checks have been cut in half for selling the same amount.  People aren't happy, are always updating their linkedin profiles.  I was recruited from someone telling me that I could make 125K a year, but in 6 months I've only made 30K and I'm doing better than some of my co-workers.  My quota has been changed mid month 2 out of the 6 months, when I wasn't even going to hit quota and before you say ""that is because you can't hit quota in the first place"", over 60% of the reps I work with in account management aren't going to hit quota!

The only people getting promoted are people are kiss up to management, but don't typically know the products or the job as well as others."
198,Trulia,unhappy trulia employee,2014-02-25,1.0,Senior Account Executive,Their benefits are very nice.  Sales reps are overall good people.  I haven't seen many other positives since I've been there.,"Insane quotas.  They have doubled since I've worked there in the past 8 months.  Managers are arrogant and don't know how to sell themselves.  Commissions are cut in half for selling much more.  These other reviews are fake.  Read the negative reviews, they are MUCH more accurate.

I know multiple people who have quit from account management and strategic accounts because quotas are out of control.  We don't learn our quotas until one week into the month.  I know for a fact people who cheat the system are rewarded, while others are disrespected and talked down to.

You won't be happy selling to agents when you know it won't work but you have a crazy new sub quota for Wall Street to think we are doing well and have long term growth.  Agent cancellations are higher than ever."

The office is definitely changing, I have been here for almost 3 years and there is gradually a shift towards more structure - good and bad comes with that. The office is growing, almost 250 people work here now - for the most part I think people are happy. The company pays 100% for health benefits, matches 401k, pays for your gym membership, provides great opportunities to move up and travel and there is a good work/life balance. There is constant change and always something new combined with how rapidly the company is growing it is too much for some people. Overall they hire good people and the company takes care of the employees.","Office Location is far from downtown. Change and growth definitely make for uncertainty at times. A few ""bad seeds"" that complain about almost everything. Some people that have been with the company for a long time have a definite sense of entitlement, makes for a more negative environment at times. I am certain a lot of the negative reviews here are from these handful of people (Perfect example is the most recent review I read, they state they have worked here over 3 years - the office hasn't been open that long). There has also been a push for more productivity - which makes it seem less like sales - but to be fair the goal is 3 hours on the phone in an 8 hour day.  There are cases where it seems like some of the ""shady"""

This may seem surprising with all of the positive reviews on Glassdoor. The good reviews where all ratings are 5 stars, those were written by HR.

Sort the reviews on Glassdoor by date. On October 20 & 21 you will see a series of reviews that say ""I love this place"" or ""best company ever.""  These reviews were written by the HR department in Denver to make themselves look better. You can tell because the reviews with unidentified reviewers list really detailed information about benefits and vacation. A real employee wouldn't be that detailed."

221,Trulia,Working Hard to Offer The Worst Employee Experience in America,2013-10-01,1.0,Account Executive,"Free food, Good benefits, Flexible Hours","Management is absolutely delusional. If you are a top producer, you're commission statements should be viewed as evidence of a crime. Here's the thing... A lot of the supervisors and executives come from Dish or T-Mobile, and think that Trulia's commissions should be on pace with call centers. When salespeople complain about the payouts they talk about how they are fair because they are on pace with Dish or Comcast. Dish was literally ranked by Glassdoor as the worst company in America to work for... Way to set the bar real high guys. And then management has the audacity to constantly talk about how they are building a professional sales environment and not a call center. 

Dish ""salespeople"" are order-takers who set-up customers who specifically called in to set up their Dish service... not even a real sales position. People on top teams at Trulia are asked to sell like 50K/mo of their services. Basically, trying to convince Real Estate Agents that it is a good idea to spend anywhere from a few hundred/mo to upwards of a grand/month to have their picture show up in a tiny box with 3 other agents. Not exactly the easiest proposition in the world. Even when you hit their ridiculous quotas, you're gonna be slated for a payout of like $2,500. Yes you are reading that correct, even when you hit their absurd expectations, you are looking at about a 5% commission... Downright criminal.

If you are quality salesperson who can actually generate meaningful revenue, stay as far away as possible because the more you sell, the more cheated you will feel. And don't be fooled by the relatively good overall score for Trulia on Glassdoor, it's a well known fact that HR WRITES A TON OF FAKE REVIEWS TO COMBAT ALL THE REAL BAD ONES... Just read how generic sounding the good ones are and you'll see what I mean.

Because there are so many unhappy employees, Trulia's mantra has become, ""if you don't like it, then quit,"" Welp you guys said it.... Thanks for the sage advice."

The people I've worked with are extremely friendly, passionate, and knowledgable...Great combination

The product: everyone needs a home. Our tools to help get people in them are innovative (like commute maps) and work at scale. 

Perks: great benefits, food is often bought for everyone, nights in (boardgame night) and out (summer party), scheduled fun days, a kegerator on two floors, and plenty of adult beverages nearby. Good social scene. Some good snacks and drinks.

The pay is good and commensurate with what you'd expect in the valley/SF

Senior Management: has an excellent vision, are very transparent and approachable. They've created a great, open culture that's reflected by the fact that anyone can come up with an innovative idea and communicate it freely to anyone, even the CEO. Also there are no offices...just desks. That goes for senior management as well.","The main building is older and has crappy bathrooms, no AC, and slow elevators. However, the engineering team is moving across the street to more modern digs. I'd expect a whole lot more if we get a new building in the future...like views of the bay and bathrooms that can handle more than two people at one time.

Conference rooms can be hard to book and we need more space"

I am constantly amazed by all the super-smart and creative people that I work with. Even as we've grown as a company, I love that our fun culture has remained intact.

But more than that, I've been able to take on new challenges and have never been pigeon-holed into a single role..unlike other companies that I worked for where you aren't allowed to venture beyond your job description. And more importantly, the company continues to invest in me as an employee -- helping me grow in my career.

Oh and did I mention that we have the best vacation policy ever. It's called Trulia Time Off -- which is basically code for unlimited vacation days (but with manager approvals). In the last year alone, I've been able to take two, two-week vacations. Normally, it would take 3-5 years before I could ever earn enough PTO days to take off for that long.","This is definitely not the place for people who are looking for a basic 9-5 job.

That rapid growth leads to a lot of change but also opportunity.  Just as people who joined Google or Facebook during the early days ended up with huge opportunity to grow, you can have that same type of growth in many roles at Trulia.","Now as a public company, Trulia is more focused than ever on results.  While there's huge opportunity for those who can deliver, the pressure may be tough for some."

2. Too much estrogen at the top in Denver.  
3. There for 2 yrs and the IMPACT VALUES were sold out when the company went public!
4. You can get on the inbound calls if you are gal pals with one of the managers
5. You can get on a team you want...if you are friends with one of the sups
6. If you want to really be on top....  lie to the agents to get it sold.
7. Anyone who is respected in the real estate world has left the company, so they're left with a  
    bunch of kids that are fresh out of school giving advice to agents.
7. If you have a question and the sup or manager did not like it because if revealed a truth...
    Plan on getting on the crap list.  Oh.... they know who you are.
8. Believe me... the guys who are still there from 2011 don't really like it.... they just know how to 
    play the game.
9. If you want an easy job... be a SUP! You don't need to have sales experience and you'll get to
    surf the net all day!

From the training they provide all the way to the grind we do on a daily basis with cold calling our prospects.","1.) If you are not okay with change then this career path is not for you.  Trulia is constantly changing to achieve and to be the #1 company in our vertical.
2.) It's a grind.  To be successful and to continue to grow your career you have to be a hustler and want to succeed.  We are constantly making 70+ dials a day and dealing with indifference with our prospects.

I never dared imagine that an organization like this exists. They offer an abundant amount of love and coaching without micro managing. For you skeptical professionals that are out there, I was one of you just over 2 years ago. I waited and waited for the other shoe to drop but the fact of the matter is working at Trulia means lots of hard work that is rewarded with great pay, lots of fun, monthly happy hours, team outings, great benefits, tons of support and great opportunities for promotion. To be honest I do not remember the last time I woke up and was not excited about going to work (rare indeed).","If you hate change, Trulia is not for you. I have been in sales for over 10 years and am very accustomed to rapid change in pay, products and org structure but I have never seen anything like this. 
Having said that, a couple things to note: 
1. In the past two years we have not had 1 change that did not make things abundantly better for the customers, employees and the business. 
2. If you have a great idea, you may find yourself pitching it to VPs and rolling out within a week of thinking it.  Innovation is probably the best part of the business. You are always heard and responded to. You will find yourself surrounded by tons of talented individuals. Con: makes it a challenge to stand out."

They completely respect your work/life balance and if you are producing, they will not hesitate to allow you to take vacations or days off should you need them.

As the company continues to grow, it maintains a start-up family type feel.  I've been here for quite awhile now and have never once woke up and dreaded the workday.  I work with some amazing people and have had the opportunity to make a difference in many different ways.  They take care of us really well with a stocked pantry full of breakfast foods, refrigerators full of drinks, buying breakfast and lunch on a lot of occasions, drawings, prize give-aways, trips, etc.  So far, it has been a great experience.","I wouldn't necessarily call it a con, but things are constantly changing and evolving.

254,Trulia,Won the Jack Pot on this Company!,2013-05-01,5.0,Inside Sales Representative,"A company that is rare to find today especially in the Denver Market.  Amazing benefits, culture, and opportunities in all business lines.  I have to disagree with many of the poor reviews written and will prove to you why.  What company wins ""Best Place to Work"" two years in a row and moved up to 14th place and now up for the National Award in the Country?  Not a company like Dish, Comcast, or other companies who have inside sales positions. Also not many companies still spend money on things like taking their top performers to Cancun Mexico which was quoted by most"" best trip of their lives.""  Very unique type of experience, very start up and innovative even with going public.  Opportunity to make 6 figures in sales (certain business lines) if you are hard working with a great work ethic and have some talent.  Beginning level pays around 40-60K. Most reviews on here are written from employees who are not talented sales people and who have trouble fitting in any work environment (poor attitude, no accountability, and lack sales skills).  Look at the comments- talking about snacks, happy hrs, etc.  They are young and have not experienced the real work world.  

Other pros: Incredible people to work with at all levels.  Leadership keeps the company at a fast past, innovative changes that somehow always seem to work out.  If you are not a positive person, have a strong work ethic, love changes every month, and like to live in a company that is focused on being #1, do not apply.","Very fast past so many can't keep up with it b/c although everyone says they love change, most do not love it and would rather work for the boring, structured company, and always know what to expect."

There is now a military vibe which dictates that everyone work every second of every day. The work day starts at 7:30 but now we must get in at 7:15 so that we don't ""steal time"". Just an example of how the sales staff are being treated. The new product that just got launched doesn't work, and only two weeks into it, agents we have sold are complaining that they are getting nothing for their 
money. 
So unless you enjoy being treated like a child and  being screamed at by dissatisfied customers all day, this is not the place for you."
260,Trulia,"Worst Place To Work, 2013.",2013-03-26,1.0,Account Executive,None.  Don't bother with this place.,"I notice that the best star reviews aren't necessarily resounding endorsements of the company.  The reason for this may be that the management who writes them aren't very bright.

The problem with this company is its management.  At first I thought ""employees beware"", now I'm even thinking ""stockholders beware!"".  This company as a sales organization is the worst I've seen.  It's run by people who have no clue about the industry they're in.  Anyone who is respected in the real estate world has left the company, so they're left with a bunch of 'startup kids' running the show.  The department that runs Sales (Marketing) is in constant last-minute-crisis mode, which should not be the case when a company is beyond a small startup in size.  The problem is, they don't know what they're doing, and the sales floor suffers from it.  They hire the worst managers possible and then give them a raise for surfing Facebook and Youtube while their salespeople work hard.  This company has a Mind, Body and Spirit day, which is supposed to be a day focused on health and happiness, started by one of the co-founders who is no longer there.  During the latest MBS day, we were told to work through it as if it wasn't happening.  Why bother having a Mind Body and Spirit day?  Oh, and dear president of Trulia, thanks for coming to the sales floor to call listen!  Instead of lifting our spirits, you reaffirmed what we all think and know... that you could care less about your sales staff.  We took your appearance as hostile, not as friendly.  If you think otherwise, you're a joker.

If you are an optimistic, forward-thinking, innovative, hard working professional individual that wants to make a really good living, then this is NOT the company for you."

263,Trulia,"Trulia is a con to agents and employees since new
employees in upper management have joined the company!",2013-03-22,1.0,Account Executive,"We have a fully stocked kitchen for employees. The sales reps are awesome for the most part other than the few that want to ""suck up"" to management and try to further their career, which is a lost cause.","Where do I begin, first of all since we went public the company has done a complete 180. Trulia is no longer interested in doing right by the customer or employee. They are only concerned with making sure their stock shares continues to grow. Which would be acceptable, if they were concerned about the people who made the company what it is today (the employees and agents). Trulia claims to have an open door policy for its employees, but the moment you inquire about something you are told ""thats the way it is and if you don't like it quit"". The pay structure has been adjusted month after month to allow management to benefit financially, but the sales reps have no opportunity to maximize their pay due to unrealistic quotas. If you do excel at your position the management team and company will no longer reward you, they will insist it is your role to make up for others who are not meeting their quotas they have set forth. When they hire new employees they paint a picture of a company that is one ""where you can make upwards of 70K and eventually move into a management role. I have been there for quite some time (a little under a year) and I have seen one sales rep move into upper management. Other than that they hire managers from the outside who more than likely have beefed up their resume that is false. Most management can't even speak proper english,
let alone grasp how the products actually works. I could go on for days about how this company is conning employees and agents but I will leave with this. Today March 14, 2013 we released a new product that no longer offers agents exclusivity. Rather than being upfront about this change the sales reps are told to manipulate their words so that agents won't become upset and file a class action lawsuit against them for selling a product that is not what was represented originally. We
are told to sell products that everyone on the sales floor knows will not benefit the agent, but are forced to convince the agents that we speak to the product is a great starting point for them and will bring them quality leads just to get new subscribers in the company. It is my personal opinion from working there, that Trulia has one focus, do whatever they can to make their stock price raise. Which would be completely acceptable if we were selling a quality product that would actually benefit a customer rather than the companies stock price."

-Sales training is useful to people who are new to sales
-Some nice people","There are a lot of problems within this sales organization.  Rising quotas that have little logic or reason and management offer little explanation as to why.  Micro-management is increasing every day to get more out of their reps (more results for less or equal pay).  Really the worse part about this job is the product.  Trulia does an excellent job of talking up their products.  In reality their products are completely miss leading towards the agents they sell to.  Across the company they have about a 25% retention rate because of the poor results.  This is mainly cause by over saturation of paying agents within major markets.  All the good markets have been sold out a long time ago, so you are force to sell small junk markets to agents that will never see a return on their investment. You will constantly hear from management that Trulia is ranked #1 return of investment in the industry based on an article from Citi Financial.  You will never find this article; it was only mentioned in a small blog post with no citation.  Personally if you are going to use this ""fact"" as a staple in your sales culture, it would be nice if it was true."
270,Trulia,A quickly sinking ship. Call center exploiting sales team,2013-03-10,2.0,Inside Sales,"40 hours a week, not an hour more or less. Good people at the office, easy to meet and make friends. Awesome training and support if you're new to sales. If you're happy talking on the phone all day for very LOW OTE, then this is a good start.","Where to start? Since we've gone public, making money is virtually impossible. Each month the quotas double, but the payout remains the same. Because you're getting paid hourly, commissions (bonus) each month gets taxed at 40%! If you hit quota, you can expect to make $1350. But what do you end up with after taxes? $800. Given that 50% of the floor did not hit quota last month, you will decelerate very quickly from that amount. 

A 24k base with this kind of commission is ridiculous. You will have to have a phenomenal year to break 40k. Don't let their company culture fool you into thinking people are happy. Their top sales rep has already left. This company values short term gain over long term sustainability. They reward sales reps for setting agents up with bad programs that don't do anything for their business. I've sold over 80 agents. I can count on one hand the real estate agents who are genuinely satisfied with the product."
271,Trulia,"Was good, now really really bad.",2013-03-10,1.0,Account Executive,"Snacks, ping pong, happy hour every day.  That's about all I have to say bout that... Other than I like the snacks!","This company caps and decelerates commission, so there's no way to make money. They also are ignoring the major issues that would accelerate the growth of the company.  Being on the sales floor there gives you the feeling that the managers have no clue what they're doing... It's confirmed when you talk to them.  For a real estate website they sure don't seem to know much about real estate.  That transfers to the sales floor where the sales people are most effected because Trulia can't figure out how to make their salespeople happy.

Trulia says that they have an open door policy, and when Management is approached with an issue, they tell their people ""if you don't like it, quit."" Like I was.  It's even well-known at the company that the leaders of the sales department don't care about their employees, and it's well known on the floor that if you're not a top 10 salesperson, the leaders of the sales department don't want to know you, by saying things like ""I don't even want to know your name if you're not top 10."".  Great.  I can't be sure, but I'm sure the moves they have been making lately would be called Attrition."

The company has a superb team of talented people, particularly in product and engineering. People who work there love the company and everyone works together to make things happen. It is results driven and focuses on delivering amazing products.",Trulia pushes people to grow into their role and career which  may not be for some people.
273,Trulia,Inside Sales Rep,2013-02-27,2.0,Inside Sales,"Active environment
great location
company values
stocked kitchen","Do not do a position like this if you can't handle rejection! 
It is cold calling so if ou can't make 100 calls a day and make quota then your out.
No support from upper management"
274,Trulia,Better than a lot of call centers... but still a call center.,2013-01-07,3.0,Inside Sales,"-Everyone is very candid about the job itself, no surprises from interview to first day
-Legitimate opportunity to make uncapped commission if the desire and sales ability is there
-Products are innovative and can really assist a client's career if value is established
-Unbelievable benefits package, well-stocked kitchen, rec room with ping-pong table and foosball
-Solid work hours (7:30a.m. to 4p.m.) allows you to pursue other opportunities without having to take time out of your  expected work day
-Its sales, so of course its a number game. However, if you are putting up consistent monthly numbers there are opportunities to move into more specialized departments that highlight your talents and provide a nice break from straight cold-calling (ex. inbound teams, closing specialists, lucrative real estate agents with high priced listings, etc.) 

Trulia's founders and current executives have tried to create  a fun work environment with having a kitchen full of snacks & soda. The ping-pong table is a nice way to blow off some steam. It is also, extremely hard to find a better health & benefits package than the one offered to employees at Trulia. The once a month happy hour is a nice attempt to foster some sense of camaraderie in addition to the occasional in-office sales raffles.","-In order to meet monthly quota expect a minimum of 100+ calls a day
-Dynamic commission structure that sometimes benefits your strengths or highlights your weaknesses (varies for everyone)
-As it's been stated, you are selling to real estate agents. A lot of pressure to push an expensive product onto a semi-struggling agent within the first conversation
-Wide range of co-workers from fresh out of college to fourth ""career"" change;  affects the overall morale of the workplace. 
-High stress. It's not a glamorous sales position, you will more times than not be aware of where you are and where you are supposed to be. It takes a toll on your mood and can carry over once the day is done
-It's a call center! You will cold-call real estate agents all over the country and deal with every personality type imaginable. 


While I was only there a few months I took the reviews I saw of Trulia into account and was actually surprised to hear a lot of my concerns addressed unsolicited throughout the hiring process. There was  no bait and switch. I knew exactly what the job was going to be. So it's hard to be extremely negative about a place that didn't sell me a bill of goods. If you can handle rejection, don't mind making a 100+ calls a day, there is a lot of money to be made. Everyone knows who the top performers are and its an environment that encourages teamwork instead of pitting you head to head against your peer. 

It was one of the most stressful sales environment I've ever been in. There is a reason why there is a ridiculous turnover rate. By the time I left there were only 4 of the original 12 people I started with after 3-months. Every day is the same routine. But each day I felt like I was losing a piece of my soul."

291,Trulia,Trulia Rocks!,2011-09-26,5.0,,"1) The People - Down to earth, friendly, worldly, passionate and very very smart is how I would describe Trulians.  People are always what makes a company great and Trulia has assembled an amazing crew of very cool folks who have a ton of energy and focus. It's also a very International which makes it all the better and a lot more interesting than most companies.  Most of the management team isn't from the U.S. and it's built a culture that is extremely open minded and a lot of fun.  
2) The Product - Trulia is one of those few sites that is really helpful, innovative, and is actually changing the crappy experience of buying, selling, and renting homes and making it much better.  Revolutionizing the way real estate is done is something you can really get passionate about.
3) The Atmosphere - The atmosphere is lively, energetic, and just a fun place to be.  Think bright colors, cool bikes racks, ping pong, hip kitchens with espresso machines etc.
4) The Business Model - There are a lot of start-ups out there that sound very sexy but, they just don't have a solid business model and are still figuring it all out.  Trulia is way beyond that point - it's a solid profitable business that is rapidly growing. 
5) Cool Events - First Friday of every month a fun happy hour, Mind, Body Spirit Day where there are tons of fun activities from biking, golf, yoga, surfing etc., Fun parties ( Summer party, Holiday party, and some very cool conference parties)
6) Benefits - Trulia has a very generous vacation plan.  I guess that's what happens when both the founders are from Europe.  They want people to take vacation and have balance.  The co-founder is a hardcore triathlete who competes in Ironman's (and wins them).  He takes time off to train and compete and really is open to employees taking time to vacation, take adventures, or of course go for a bike ride!","Easily the best company I've worked for and I've been working over 10 years for both very large and very small technology companies.  I would say you need to ready for a fast paced environment that changes rapidly and for some people that is not always the best fit but, personally I like it since it keeps things exciting.  Trulia hires people who can make an impact and they expect you to step up and if there is a challenge figure out how to solve it.  It's still a very lean company in many areas even though we have grown significantly.  As with any start-up there are still resource constraints but, that is part of being in a fast paced technology company."
292,Trulia,"Employee centric, fun environment, passionate people, successful trajectory.",2011-09-21,5.0,,"The People - Almost all employees are super helpful, collaborative, friendly, and sharp! The passion people share for the company & industry is impressive and I haven't personally experienced this before. The company tends to celebrate everything! (social crowd) which makes for a fun environment.
The workspace - Great location (near downtown SF), the office itself is open, light, there are kitchens in each area/department (stocked with drinks & snacks), and ""the penthouse"" (aka, top floor space) is reserved for recreational activities like Ping pong, videogames, happy hours, etc.
The work - The company is making a big difference, applying cutting edge technologies to make residential real estate search more personalized, fun, simple, and interesting. Trulia's mobile products are impressive, and real estate agents seem to truly benefit from Trulia's ad products (selling well)","Cultural divides: The speed in which the company has built its Inside Sales teams started to create a seperate culture, one that worked different hours, had a different type of job (sales vs. development), and most people on these teams were pretty new to the company and didn't get entirely acclimated with the dev teams. There is tons of work to be done in this area as this team continues to grow."
293,Trulia,"Awesome place to work and learn, fast paced.",2011-09-11,5.0,,"Awesome work/life balance. They have great perks, benefits, 401K, commuter benefit, dental, vision, etc... Core Senior Management has been in place since inception, but have added some amazing talent (COO, VP of Sales) that have truly accelerated our growth and revenue. They listen to feedback and do their best to change direction or adjust very rapidly.  Whole company has clear goals and they really let every employee know what is going on - each week.

HR and internal support teams really care about making you feel wanted and special.They have gone through a lot of growth in their training and hiring process for Inside Sales. The office has changed a lot in the past year. All I can say is that those people getting hired now and in the last 3 months are way better than the ones brought in previously. The compensation plan has been a steady and really fair plan since March of this year.","There are two divisions. Working in Inside Sales is very different than being an engineer, or mid-upper level management. Finally, the biggest con is that they do not do much for employees who have been here a long time in terms of career development. They rather hire outside talent than groom their own employees - especially on the sales and management side. Engineers are treated really well, so this is a con if you are not an engineer."
294,Trulia,A beginning phone sale job for newly graduated college students with no experience.,2011-09-01,1.0,Inside Sales Associate,"-They have an awesome location, and parties every first Friday of the month are great.
-Always have a stocked fridge of the same food, but nevertheless it's food.
-Great location next to the financial district in downtown San Francisco.","-A pump and call inside sales role where you are asked to make 80 calls per day.
-A constant fight between management and low level employees to get the products right for the customers.
-No real advancement in career other than team leader, supervisor, trainer of the sales floor."
295,Trulia,It is a great up and coming company with wonderful leadership that care about you and your well-being!!!,2011-08-14,4.0,Account Executive,"extremely collaborative and fun group of people, free food","real estate industry, make over 100 dials a-day in a call center atmosphere"
296,Trulia,It was just OK......,2011-08-11,1.0,Account Manager,"Great place to work if you are just graduated college and really looking to get your feet wet in the work force or if you are just desperate for a job! Here are some perks:

-Cool spiffs for making sales
-Relaxed environment (almost too relaxed at times!)
-Happy hour the first Friday of the month

That's about it......","Ok I'm rating this so tough because I have a few years of work experience under my belt so I look at things a lot differently than some of the recent college grads who work here. Also, had I known that this was such an ""entry-level"" job/company I would have probably skipped the interview.....so
where do I begin???? For starters management needs work! Some managers micromanage and watch their team members like hawks, others would rather be your best friend than your boss!! They try to boost up the employee's heads as if it’s a privilege to work for the company because they provide free bagels and cereal in the kitchen but in all actuality it's just a way to keep the newbies who work here happy and engaged. Here are some more cons:


-Outrageously high turn-over! I started in a class of 12 and by the end of my first month over half the class had either quit or been fired. The sad thing is they started a class of 11 a month after my class and now they are hiring for yet another class to start in the next few weeks! Had I known about the turn-over rate I would have never applied!
-Rules and standards change like the wind. Pretty much they live by an ""impact"" standard which really means nothing to the employees!
-There is no real structure on account management which means either guard your accounts with your life or they may be stolen by the person who sits next to you and then they will get the credit for your sales!
-Not a professional environment at all! Employees play, run around and even curse while on the sales floor!
-No opportunities for advancement. Meaning if you stay with the company for a year you will more than likely be doing the exact same thing that you did on day one.
-The 80 dials a day is strongly enforced but good luck trying to make that happen with 4-5 ""pow wows"" a day in between. In other words management makes it very difficult to accomplish your daily goals with pointless meetings!
-Your first 3 months is the ""probationary"" period, which means you are expected to close sales but won't get paid out on your commissions until you convert to full time. In order to convert you must remain at the company for 3 months and close at least 14k in sales. They have a very low conversion rate because of the high turn-over rate! Which means only one thing....cheap labor! I find it very unfair to put in work and not see any reward!

To sum it all up...

Just by by-pass Trulia when job hunting unless you have no other options or just need to get your feet wet. 

Trulia – Great concept and platform, terrible place to work!"
297,Trulia,its ok,2011-07-13,3.0,,good people...good training..very fun place to work,more like a call center...all cold calling with bad leads
298,Trulia,"Very typical of many entry level sales positions of start-ups, but more disappointing.",2011-03-11,2.0,Inside Sales,"-Great and affordable product that works. Somewhat easy to sell; has a good reputation amongst Real Esate Agents.
-Training, albeit brief, is very good. Especially on product and sales pitch. Learning curve is high.
-Very easy to get hired. They hire anyone with any kind of sales or customer service experience. 
- Easy job to do. Especially if you've had past sales and customer service experience.
- Free food and beverage. 
-They provide you leads. No having to farm and fish out leads on your own.","-Dull, monotonous, and repetitive work. No variety and not very challenging. Day in and day out cold calling and not much else.
-Very little to no chance of promoting up and out. No management roles to promote up to in the first place. ""Promotion"" only happens as far as base salary and type of leads you get and its small at best. 
-Outside of initial training, there isn't much employee growth, training, or nurturing. You're literally thrown to the wolves and left to fend for yourself. ""Coaching"" you get throughout is brief and half-hearted.
-Leads are distributed by performance. Meaning that consistently high performers are given the best leads while average to low performers are stuck with ""bad"" and are thus ""trapped"" into low performance.
-Very high, steep, and somewhat unreasonable monthly quota. Especially for your first 90 days. 
-Very low base. 30k to start. 45k for top performers. No quarterly or yearly bonuses.
-Too youthful atmosphere. Feels like High School/College. 
-Very little to no connection and coordination between Sales and engineering.
-Non-existent internal Customer Service, Renewals, and Retention. You as the Inside Sales rep are responsible for all three for every account you open as cancellations effect your churn. This is sometimes a major waste of time and a major source of stress and consternation among reps.
-Very high turnover and burnout.

To sum up briefly: If you are fresh out of college on your first/second job, or can't seem to find anything anywhere and are desperate to find a job, then give this a try, although they will ask of you in your first 90 days to sell high and sell hard or you're out. 

If you're older (as in over 25), have more job experience, not too good at sales,  or have other opportunities lined up where you'll be compensated higher than 30k, then you should pass. Having Trulia on your resume is not worth the disappointment and stress you endure at this place."
299,Trulia,Great Entry Level Sales Position,2011-02-14,5.0,,The spiffs and competition were a real motivator. People here were amazing and alone kept me around for months. The product proved to work.,"The rules, commission structure, and goals constantly changed. One thing one week and the one thing the next.
