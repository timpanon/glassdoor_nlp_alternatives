- You can make an actual impact and actively engage management with your ideas
- Fast-paced, growing, young and dynamic
- Internal mobility opportunities
- Great name to have on your CV

1,Trustpilot,Great Company and Culture,2022-04-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"People, ambition and mission are all tied together well",Doesn't always move as quickly as other tech businesses
2,Trustpilot,Low salaries,2022-04-03,1.0,Customer Success Manager,Possibilities of remote or flexible work.,Salaries are very low. It seems impossible to negotiate higher salaries. Difficult/impossible to create changes that make ones job more efficient.
3,Trustpilot,2 years review,2022-04-01,5.0,Service Delivery Manager,"Value- based company. Serious attempt to build a company culture based on trust, transparency and inclusion.",I don't have so much cons to be honest. A bit political in high level of management maybe.
4,Trustpilot,Incredible failure. BEWARE,2022-03-26,1.0,Senior BDM,None. The culture is toxic.,"Where to start. Mass sackings. Toxic culture. Weak leadership. This outfit is the worst of the worst in almost every sense.

The only reason people used to be happy here was due to a good bunch of people long since led to slaughter so others could grasp power and maybe a below inflation payrise. That's now gone. The 'HR' team... are truly shocking and almost relish trying to run the place like a police state.

Countless genuine examples of leaders in many functions doing things for their own self promotion at the detriment of mid or low level staff. Let's not get started on sexual harassment topics... video evidence is floating around rest assured.

If you're selling and enjoy double glazing sales processes give it a go. If you want to be micro managed you will love it! Want to pitch a product that is nowhere near a SaaS solution? Come on board. Want to work with junior sales managers and ring a bell like 1990 when you blag a client into paying you 1k aov then sign here and your onboarding will be done in the pub after you sign your pip.

You'll not hit target either way as this is nothing but an automated sell nowadays in a market that quite frankly has moved on. Seen an advert with 4.5 stars plastered on it? Yeah you can get that for free... Trust on the Internet? Come on... reps make up the pricing remember?

I can honestly say some of the most horrendous human beings I've ever crossed paths with in life reside at this place. I can not stress how unhappy myself and many others were here. Its not a spring board to SaaS sales despite what your told. Try getting a decent job at a comparable level / title elsewhere... no chance.

Hope anyone internal reading this takes a good look at themselves. Anyone thinking of joining you are insane. Final note, I fully expect this review to be taken down so screenshot it while you can, this place I hear has a storied track record of removing glassdoor reviews (yes it's quite possible) Accept what you are and it would be nice to see this one remain as a genuine flag to people considering this place as somewhere to invest their time. #trust

5,Trustpilot,Best company,2022-03-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Very agile way of working, strategic decisions very often on point.",Sometimes slow execution against plans
6,Trustpilot,Good company to work for,2022-03-22,4.0,IT Support Specialist,"Salary, bonus and working from home",Pay reviews tend not to match inflation and bonuses are always a given.
7,Trustpilot,Where is the Trust?,2022-03-18,1.0,Sales,"- Met very nice and smart people in the company, although not consistently and very dependent on the team/organization. Unfortunately, this comment does not apply - with few exceptions - to the management team.
- Paradoxically but true: some GREAT people in the HR team, who cares.
- Nice office with a good view
- Very good work life balance.","- High pressure and expectations (which is fine) but not matched by a balancing level of support and compensation package. The compensation is subpar Vs the market, the tools and processes are not - in my opinion - enough to enable Salespeople to work at the speed and ambition required
- Mass firing people in waves since COVID'19. While they do some initiatives to support you to find a new job outside, I have experienced, and this is my opinion, a lack of consistent commitment (more talking the talk, than walking the talk)
- Baffling enough, even high-performance individual contributors and managers were fired! By high performance, I mean a mix of delivering numbers but also contributing to a positive culture.
- Lack of backfilling creates a massive and unsustainable workload
- In my opinion, managers are stripped of their power, at least in Sales. 
- The Culture should be based on Trust but I witnessed massive micro-management
- In my opinion, there is massive siloing: departments do not communicate with each other enough.
- I have never experienced and felt such a low psychological safety. I was afraid to speak fearing from my job, although I did when I witnessed things that went against my values. The colleagues I spoke with, which are several, were also afraid to speak.
- In my opinion, processes are not fair. An example: leads and accounts, at least when I was there, were distributed arbitrarily by the manager instead that by an Ops Team. This created room for favoritism, demoralization, and a general lack of trust toward the management.
- ""Lone wolves"" were usually celebrated, over the perhaps slightly less performing but cultural enhancing people in the other teams
- I have often heard ""corridor stories"" of people gossiping and even physically fighting
- Politics and gossiping, in my opinion, is at endemic levels and really too much for a company of this size

- There is unfortunately so much more, and I suggest you to read other reviews to have a more complete view of the company"

- Amazing office with lovely views
- Great name to have on CV","- Lack of resources. Trustpilot has mass fired employees yearly for the past 3 years in our department, and has never replaced them, leaving team members like me with so much work to do and not enough time, not to mention huge mental health issues. So many of us are feeling burnt out but don't have any choice but to keep going
- Leadership in my department change direction drastically every year and everything changes so often that employees have no idea what they're meant to do and can't keep up. I'm all for change but it's getting so bad that people are joining calls and have no idea what's being discussed because no one informed them of changes before
- No communication. Leaders don't communicate with each other or with their teams, and employees are getting so many different messages and hearing different things from different people. Nothing's ever crystal clear, and this is affecting people's projects and strategies hugely"

41,Trustpilot,Toxic Environment,2021-11-04,1.0,Account Executive,"I learned a lot about high volume B2B SaaS sales which inherently instilled some grit and grind in my work ethic. There were some good people working with me but they never lasted long. The end product is good and affordable (for software). This had the potential to be a great job if the right people were in leadership cultivating a healthier/safer culture and work environment. It's a decent opportunity for a BDR right out of college to learn how to work efficiently, hunt, prospect, and other basics of an entry level sales role then find an opportunity to sell somewhere else where you can really develop your career.","I knew within my first 2 days that I had made a HUGE mistake in being there. 
- The culture is very toxic (think ""Frat"" meets ""Wolf of Wall Street"" but no one is making any money).
- There's a lack of professionalism across the board. 
- Sales leaders are resistant to change when the status quo is clearly not working and targets are consistently missed. 
- No accountability of management. 
- Condescending and patronizing leadership and communication styles from management. 
- Leadership leans into the same playbook that has never proven to work. 
- Little opportunity for growth and development.
- An AE had better odds of being put on a plan than hitting a single monthly quota in their first year."

- Down to earth culture and humorous
- Well known brand and a great product that I stand by
- Clear career path in the commercial areas

Overall I was proud to say that I worked at Trustpilot, but it was for very superficial reasons.","- Very little structure and standard operating procedures despite the company being almost 800 people
- Little to no priority from senior management in HR/People to work on recruitment procedures to support exponential growth in the business = super overworked recruiters
- Diversity and inclusion is flagged as a priority for the business but it's only employees taking initiative and organizing efforts 
- Salaries are as low and benefits are minimal 
- No focus on professional growth (in People)

Overall I experienced suboptimal leadership from top down and was surprised how easy the top management overlooked clear red flags. Retention all over the company is low and instead of focusing on salaries, benefits and the managers' capabilities, HR/People was just asked to recruit faster. Despite recruiters flagging this to HRBPs and own management, focus was elsewhere. 
I'm not saying they ignored the red flags - I'm just saying that for the one year I worked there, no initiatives were made to increase retention and minimize workload...

As most work happen remote, I struggled a lot with the sense of belonging. Despite being vocal about it, I didn't get any support."
45,Trustpilot,I wish this was a positive review.,2021-10-25,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Great colleagues in team and the business
-Brand recognition
-Product I stand by
-Work tasks
-Good work life balance is possible if you set clear limits for yourself
-Passionate, approachable and strong CEO. I never got a negative impression of Peter specifically.","Really a shame that none of the pros come close to outweighing the cons.

-High workload with resistance to hiring more people until it's desperate
-Lots of people leaving (so no surprise it's a high workload) since salary is as low as they can get away with
-Culture continuing to become more corporate and political
-Diversity and inclusion efforts are organized by employees (which is great on them) with no real commitment by senior management

In general there is poor people leadership from the top down, in multiple areas of the business from what I saw, including the HR/People team ironically. General lack of respect, recognition and overall not genuinely caring about employees - again ironic considering the product is all about authenticity and a key value of working there is being what they call, positively human.

These issues were raised/known repeatedly but unfortunately with no or minimal action.

I would never describe my experience here as being ""positively human"" and will not be recommending it to anyone."

47,Trustpilot,Frat House,2021-10-13,1.0,Sales,"Not many, if any come to mind with the exception of a few smart people.","Frat house culture. Immature team and ping pong games more important to most than business. Poor leadership across the board for SDR and AE roles. 

Very top heavy sales org where a very small % of AEs/SDRs hit even 80%. CS team does very well and has good leadership. High turnover.

Training exists but is poor. Poor SalesOps support based in NYC for Denver team.

Lightest equity incentives you will find in tech."
48,Trustpilot,No thank you,2021-10-08,1.0,Sales,Not actually relevant. They have a ping pong table. No idea why that matters.,"The diversity here is terrible, the pay is awful, and the culture is bad. You'd be better off being homeless then working here. 

Also, it is a legal requirement that every job listing in Colorado have the compensation listed, and Trust Pilot doesn't do that. You can be fined 10,000 dollars per violation, and they don't care, because they hate their employees so much they'd rather risk a fine then let their employees know their disgusting pay rate."

You get to work with many different industries","Don’t be fooled by the job title, you are simply a debt collector. Trustpilot uses extremely aggressive auto-renewal policies hidden in their contracts to threaten small businesses with 300-400% increases. When I questioned these practices I was told “Well we don’t actually do it, we just want to scare them into thinking we will.” Here’s another kicker, if one of your struggling customers asks for an invoicing hold, it comes out of YOUR pay so you are disincentivized to help them. Most are not even given this option and you are instructed to tell them that they will be immediately sent to a collections agency if they do not pay their invoices. Due to new rules, defamatory reviews will not be removed even when it is painfully obvious that they are fake. This will cause you countless headaches as you have to deal with furious customers whose reputation is being unjustly slandered. For the sake of your happiness and mental health I implore you to steer clear of Trustpilot."

Flexibility work styles (from home/in the office early/late)","Maybe, that we will never come back to the time before Corona, where we all worked at the office. The nice and relaxed atmosphere at the office was one of the reason why I decided to join TP."
69,Trustpilot,Best place I've ever worked!,2021-08-12,5.0,IT Support,"It's hard to list all of the great things about working here in one little paragraph. The people and company culture are definitely the core of what makes Trustpilot so good. There's a hard working, but positive and fun culture that is driven all the way down from senior leadership. This is reinforced with exceptional work-life benefits like company parties; volunteer opportunities; and a pleasant office environment that includes snacks, meals, coffee, and beer. There's also very competitive financial, vacation, and medical benefits.

Before working here I had never really put any thought into why it would be beneficial to work for a company that's based out of any other specific country, but with Trustpilot being based out of Denmark, which is well known for its social programs, the difference is very obvious in its treatment of employees. When you hear most domestic-based companies talk about why they have good benefits, they talk about wanting to be competitive in the market and attract good talent. When I hear any of the leadership in Trustpilot talk about why we have good benefits -from my direct supervisor to Peter, the founder and CEO- the tone is essentially, ""Well that's just how you should treat people. Why would we not do that?"" I think, when judging the caliber of a person or a company, it's not just the what that's important, but the why.","It's honestly pretty hard to find downsides to my experience here. One thing I am aware of though, that could negatively impact some people's experience here, is the relative lack of diversity. As far as I'm aware personally or have heard from my colleagues of color, the treatment of all people seems to be fair and equitable, but I think there's still work to be done in recruiting more diverse talent. Fortunately, the company seems to be very committed to making whatever changes are necessary to accomplish this. They removed the employee referral program after realizing that it was reinforcing our current and lopsided demographics, they've created multiple Employee Resource Groups with representation in leadership, and the internal messaging shows a continued focus on improving.

Other than that, the only (very small) negative that I can think of is that sometimes I have to wait for answers on certain things while working with people in different global offices due to time differences, but that could be said of any international company. It's certainly not Trustpilot's fault and can't really be avoided, it's just a part of the experience. I'm kind of having to be nit-picky here because there's genuinely not many cons to pick from."

If you are proactive you are seen and you can really develop personally within the Company.

The ADR team in the UK really is overlooked, Sales Managers in the UK are quick to try and point the finger at the function and pick when they feel necessary (I never understood why?) 

Trustpilot are lucky to have such a strong and resourceful ADR team (it really is noticeable outside the organisation). The Senior ADRs on the team are doing a brilliant job and I'm sure they'll develop the team.

Matt was a great manager for me, he cared about my development and the team's development also. He does a fantastic job of holding things together.

The product is fantastic, with the brand awareness the sale becomes easier (no need for pitching). The market Trustpilot appeals to is never ending, it is such an exciting time for the company.","In terms of cons, I'd say the company is growing very quickly but some processes are slightly overlooked - communication throughout the whole company should be transparent.

The People team seem to be taking action and investing in their current managers to improve their skills - this is long overdue as not all are natural leaders. 

I would say that some of the management team have an easy ride. Being a sales manager is all about investing in your team and taking action on how you can make your team's work life better, this in turn will provide you with an even stronger number (only a select few are doing this)."

Staff are spoken to with absolutely no respect and offered no guidance to become better. Some are never in the office and are dining off previous success as reps, couldn’t care less about how you are doing and offer no support. The lack of people skills is absolutely astonishing. The VP is aware and has received numerous complaints leading to HR issues but gets washed under the carpet. Imagine being a manager and detested by everyone... it’s sad"

There’s a real hunger to be successful, both as individuals and as a team. With that said, it’s not for everyone. People have come and gone that were looking for an easy ride, and whilst that may be acceptable elsewhere, it falls far short of the bar set by the long-tenured and successful people this company has hired, produced and nurtured.

The culture here is one that embraces all, and celebrates success. I’m not sure you can ask for more from a company you work for.

If an individual is struggling, there’s a plethora of experienced people readily available to help; from seniors and team leads to managers to the VP of the UK and the VP of training. All of which have their own approach to help. To current employees reading this - just ask for support, you won’t be let down.

Some things that are consistent here are what defines success (you know your job and your KPIs), the awesome culture, and that no matter your status or situation, the UK VP is not only approachable but welcoming and on hand to help or advise, reflected in him being on first name terms with everyone whether it’s to motivate or ask how someone is. I know this is appreciated across the floor, and much of the success of reps or the brand should be attributed accordingly.

That is the kind of teamwork and leadership that reverberates around the business and breeds success.

It’s an honour to work for Trustpilot, both the culture and the brand are absolutely first class.","To potential employees reading this, I implore you to take a common sense approach to most of the negative reviews. As with any business, you’ll find one or two underperforming reps looking to cast blame. Unfortunately, even Trustpilot isn’t immune to the immature pettiness of failing salespeople.

We’ve obviously outgrown our current office, so somewhere new befitting the company’s status would be ideal..."

162,Trustpilot,A glimmer of hope?,2019-11-21,2.0,BDM,"The brand is really going somewhere around the world. 

Some of the new C level hires are pretty incredible, so I think there’s a new wave of possibility. 

In London we have had a new sales manager join recently who is showing everyone else how a sales manager should operate. I think my career would progress more and I would learn more working for him. His team seem much happier than the rest and they are performing really well.

We just had a new HR person start in London as well. I have not spoken to her yet but tbh it’s just nice to have HR in the office. 

A while ago the new C level HR person showed us the plan for how employee stuff is going to change and be better, and I believe it as it looked realistic.

A handful of really good people who you can trust and enjoy working with. 

Training is great. It’s good fun when you are in a group of new hires.

The office managers are amazing with the environment and perks.

The CS team are really impressive. A really good team vibe, and they work hard with good team leaders.","When I went back to my desk though, my belief started to go again because of the immaturity and low intelligence from some of the current managers. I do not think many of the current manager team can help change for the better. There are two managers who have been around for some years and it looks like they are going to be promoted to sales directors. It is quite unbelievable, especially for one of them considering how many HR complaints there have been about him, mostly bullying stuff, inappropriate comments and conversations and recently a bit aggressive with other managers. 

Everyone knows there is favouritism and double standards, and the VP does not even hide it. When someone junior made a mistake or behaved badly, HR would be called straight way. But if you try and report something about your manager it stops at the VP who gives a verbal warning which means nothing. Hopefully this can change how we have HR in London. 

I think no one else has been considered for the director jobs, the two managers have been told they are going to get it. At my last company when a new role came up, it was announced to the office. It was open for people to apply to internal and externally because the company really wanted to get the best person. At Trustpilot it looks like you can be promoted even if you have obvious and regular complaints and do not yet have the skills to do the new job. Everyone is talking about it and seeing it as a test if the company really has changed or if we’re still stuck in the start up ways from years back."

Interview and job itself are so different it's scary. Someone on my team got let go for swearing on the phone to a client when he thought phone was disconnected, but manager never here so literally you can do what you want apart from that. When I started i really liked it but now it's so bad and only a few people make money by playing the system. There is massive pressure on one or two people to book calls in for one of the senior reps for money. It was supposed to have stopped but just carries and management dont seem to wanna stop it even though it makes the whole sales process unfair. And they are supposed to book for the whole team and not one rep but they are worried about saying anything. Its crazy, basically being bullied to hand over their work. No one says anything coz the rep does well but I think some other reps are startng to realise whats going on and some of my team wont put up with it for long.
Training is really bad and managers donr worry coz theres another ten people waiting for a chance. Most managers never even seem to be there so it's a just chaos a lot of the time, like three hour lunches or gym sessions and then we get told to work harder. The irony! one weird woman even walks about vaping, I left my last place as it wasnt professional but this is something else! Also I wasnt able to take one day holiday with three weeks notice, but then a manager took three days just to have a long weekend away, with no notice. Hows that a fair workplace?"

In my time I have seen the CFO cover up the firing of someone involved with a sex scandal by emailing the whole company pretty much saying the person involved just 'wanted a change of job'. 
I have seen an individual start numerous fights and even use the 'n' word about another colleague, whilst also being the second guy involved in the sex scandal, but guess what this guy has good sales numbers so he's still there.
Hiring and promotions very much follow the same pattern, absolute no due diligence done. Hiring people that have been seriously fired from their last job and asking no questions about it. 
We have two career development schemes that don't even work or get followed through with. I know it doesnt work because everyone who has got promoted has missed all the steps of the ladder, for example someone coming in at a junior level magically gets to be a team lead without going through 2/3 roles before. Promotions are randomised and again they will promote the worst person but if their sales numbers are good thats fine.   
Same with their hiring, some of us had to go through so much screening and interview processes to get the job, while now, you pretty much just turn up and the next week you're in. This is a sure fire motivation killer.
Also someone got an award for the reason ""they dont complain"" (actual quote there) - ironically Trustpilot is a feedback company but rewards a person who doesn't give feedback."

What the recruitment team sells and what the job actually entails are two very different things. If they were honest upfront it would still be a great job, but the fact you have lied just leaves a bad taste.

1.) You will in fact cold call until you are blue in the face and will hate your life doing it. The majority of accounts you are reaching out to are recycled accounts that several colleagues have already failed at closing. 

2.) Extremely unprofessional work environment. The people you will work with are complete and utter tools who think they are on the set of Wolf of Wall Street. Everyone gossips and there are literally cliques during “lunch time” in the kitchen areas (yes that’s right, you do NOT get to choose when you go to lunch. Management does.) There is rap/EDM playing constantly with the same songs on repeat and it’s impossible to concentrate or even hear the prospects you are attempting/forcing meetings with like a used car salesman.

3.) let me just start off by saying that I was one of the top performers at Trustpilot (don’t really care if that narrows it down regarding who is writing this review). Anyways, I worked my tail off and out performed most people. I still was making less than 45k a year (salary including commission). This is IMPOSSIBLE to live in New York City with. Without exaggeration I barley afford to eat at times and I was late every single month for rent because I was completely broke and had no cash flow.

4.) Management is AWFUL. Absolutely horrendous. Never have I ever in my life been so incredibly micro managed it was an actual nightmare. You have ZERO privacy considering you will be sitting next to your boss majority of the time and they can see everything on the computer. If you happen to be off the phone or not “prospecting” new clients you will have a serious problem on your hands and will be spoke to. Oh, don’t you DARE even show up at 9:01 instead of 9:00 because you may be fired for this. So unbelievably irrational you will be stressed out to the max even before you get to the office everyday, while you are rushing to office.

In conclusion - I may sound like the textbook “salty employee” but I want to reiterate that I was very successful at Trustpilot. Nothing I wrote here has anything to do with my career not working out here and I can honestly say I did learn a lot. That said though, I moved on finally and I since have NEVER been happier. I now work for a company that appreciates me and I get paid 4x what I did at Trustpilot for a fraction of the work. I’m just being realistic. Do not settle for a company like this there are WAY TOO MANY awesome opportunities out there. Especially in New York City. only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because I at least learned some skills here (no surprise since I was forced to make 80-100 cold calls a day) . Other than that, This place is TERRIBLE!!!"

The London sales office though is breaking, covered by semi impressive revenue. The truth is, bad decisions are being made led my inexperienced sales managers mostly promoted on their sales numbers not their leadership or management ability. The senior sales leadership in London is the root of most of the bad behaviours by being unapproachable and not visible most of the time. Poor standards are being set which encourages corner cutting, laziness, ‘do as I say, not as I do’ management.

Diversity has improved for the most part. There is a team which struggles with it, yet it’s excused and allowed by senior leadership because of who the manger is. We are a forward thinking, modern tech company with progressive views… unless you’re on that team. 

There is an incestuous group of “leaders” who protect each other and ignore the rest. Decisions are made by this small inner circle who pretend to trust each other.

""As far as completed demos, about 70-75% of the team hits quota every month.""
- There have been months where no one on the team has hit their goal. Each month there is usually one (sometimes two) people who hit quota out of a team of 15.

""We don't see a lot of overturn""
- In six months over 11 reps have left. Seven reps have either quit or been fired just over the last six weeks. 

""Rapid growth, lots of opportunity for promotion""
- Because of the immense amount of overturn, barely anyone stays past six months in this role. There has not been one person promoted from Account Development Rep to Account Executive since October 1st. 

""We look for people who are eager to learn, care about the quality of the product, invest their time to find good fits and work hard.""
-Value quantity over quality. No matter how much money you are bringing in for the company, they see you as nothing but a number. Ready to replace you at any point.

""Because this is your first job in Sales, give us 6 months to invest our time in you.""
- Putting reps 3-5 months in on performance plans (a plan that sets you up to fail). Gives you 20 days to hit an unobtainable quota or you're out. 
- ADR Management does not have your back.

If you take the time to get to know people and listen to the advice and support you can receive (if you ask for it) it's the kind of place that gives you a real leg up in your future career.

Market leading brand in the review space which makes prospecting calls easier as most people tend to know how Trustpilot is and you don't have to explain in too much detail who you are (most of the time)

Office is in a good location in the City of London, and the majority of people across the sales floor have a bit of personality, and usually up for a joke and a laugh (although it does become a bit of a zoo in there at times, which can be distracting if you are in the middle of a demo and you can hear a lot of commotion in the background, or perhaps having a football kicked at your desk, usually by one of the seniors or managers)","A real dog eat dog enviroment with everyone trying to steal accounts/deals from one another, both in your own team and across other teams as well. Everything often feels on top and very chaotic. The leadership come across cold which makes them seem unapproachable, which if I have read correctly is something other employees/former employees have felt too.I feel the entire UK management team lack any real people management skills, and were just promoted to there roles because they started at Trustpilot when employee numbers were scarce and now there are certain managers who think the rules don't apply to them and you can feel their ego's as they swan up and down the sales floor. I feel they can be condescending and very quick to bark down orders to the team to cover their own back, but lack any real skills which are helping the team develop professionally. The lack of integrity from my manager doesn't leave much hope for the team leader who evidently lack any real abilities to lead by example either! 

Trustpilot haven't exactly demonstrated some of the external values they represent from an internal standpoint and what I mean by this is the majority of operational business decisions get made behind closed doors, without any real explanation and we as a team are just forced to comply and will get reprimanded if you even thought about voicing your opinion on the subject matter.

All in all, a bit of a let down if I am honest from a company who are very good at singing their own praises and subsequently polishing their rust!"

Office location 

Office space is nice","Management are incompetent, entitled and lazy for the most part

No carrier progression, where you are hired is where you will stay

Salaries are dreadful well below market average 

You are made to feel like as a non Danish speaker you have nowhere else to go to get another job and you should be grateful that you have a seat in the building

No one cares about any working conditions, stress is high, harassment is an accepted norm, targets get higher and higher, micro management is enforced by completely incompetent managers, workplace bullying, staff continually going down with illnesses due to work related stress, the list is endless

Repeated complaints to HR about working conditions fall on deaf ears

No expats in high management positions, only incompetent entitled nordic people apply

Base salaries stay firmly rooted to the same very low rate, while targets get higher and higher and commission plans are stripped bare and clawed back, so you end up having your overall salary decrease year on year while you perform better and better and make more and more money for the investors 

No benefits whatsoever, you get what is a legal requirement in Denmark and that is it, often the legal requirements are not met, you have to fight for it and double check everything to make sure it is legal."

- BOYS CLUB- Individually most people are lovely at Trustpilot but it can be a really intimidating environment to be in if your a female. The boys club is highly provoked by management going along with it (or pretty much leading it) making others think it is OK too make the place a boys club. Certain management think because they have done such a good job with selling back in the day and driving the growth of Trustpilot they can act how they like. Basically the more money you make the more reckless you can act 
- You're pretty much expected to sell in your first month- if you're not selling you're manager doesn't really have time for you (some managers may be different to be fair) 
- There is hardly any training- some who do the training should really brush up their knowledge themselves- you get the odd hour here and there but no follow up really
- Managers have favourites and don't seem to understand in sales it swings in roundabouts. Therefore they are not capiable of getting their employees back on track (again some may be different) 
- ADMs are under appreciated. The Seniors seem to get most of the praise for closing the big deals (as they do a good job) however the ADMs who open the business in the first place don't really get a second looking- This isn't fair"

We're talking about full autonomy to get your work done, constant incentives, constant give aways and free lunches (just for working here), and the people. 

What a great set of people to work around. It is apparent that a positive working culture can be spread throughout an office if it is properly implemented. Everyone at Trustpilot lives and works by this ethos. 

I'm off to go work for myself, so I am happy I can say that I have worked for this organisation. I'm at a time in my life when I feel I must be my own boss - but if the shoe didn't fit, I'd be more than happy to continue working for Trustpilot. I've already referred a friend to work here as I know they'll thrive. 

If you're a company who provides products or any track-able services, I'd say you should get in touch with Trustpilot. We're in a day and age where customer feedback matters more than ever; People do not want to hear how good a company is based on what their website says or what it says on the back of the tin, people want to hear from other people that a company, service or product is a good choice to go with, and Trustpilot is the most reputable platform to make those experiences possible. 

Anyway, I'm off and will leave you all with a smile.

The bait and switch of how successful the company was became apparent right after I joined and realized nobody on the sales floor was making their quotas.  IYou can't blame the 50 sales reps; there was clearly something was wrong with the quotas, process,  product, and most importantly leadership.  I soon learned that Sales Leadership was leading with an iron fist.  We were hiring and firing good people left and right so it was impossible to  develop a rhythm at all. Teams were changing almost weekly and the ""sink or swim"" attitude created a fear and paranoia.  As a sales manager, I was having to ensure people were at their desks by 9:00 am on the dot and make sure they weren't texting.  What kind of culture is that?    Felt more like babysitting.  When I offered up strategic ideas from my prior experience as a manager in a large corporation the executive leaders would suggest we just stay on top of the reps to ensure they ""keep dialing"".  Again, babysitting not leading through strategic vision and change.  
I truly think culture is how you treat people.  It isn't bean bags and free snacks.  Unfortunately Trustpilot's ""culture"" wasn't healthy or productive.  I watched leaders from recruiting, sales, and marketing leave monthly and sales reps turnover weekly.   The leadership in Copenhagen has no clue what's happening in New York.   The leadership seems they have trouble knowing what direction to take the company at any given moment and they are burning through cash hiring, training, then firing people.    I'm honestly surprised the company is still running (though it isn't actually profitable).   They have lost so many great people.  Had they invested in long term strategy and dedication to those amazing people they could have leveraged their expertise, drive, and knowledge to watch the company truly soar.   Unfortunately they could only look at the day-to-day output at the end of their nose and it led to all those great people leaving.  Smart folks don't stick around around on a sinking ship..."

- The processes are lacking or non existing.
- Promotions, salaries and bonuses are all depending on politics. I've found out that all the company is relying on a politic schema, favors and people covering other people to gain something. This is about the management and above. Promotion policies are not clear. I see a lot of people in the management levels (managers and above) being in the company just to grab as much as they can, not caring about the company growth. Politics it's the biggest reason which makes me not recommending this company, the biggest issue. 
- The CEO is not on the ground regarding the previous point. Probably he is not wily enough to understand his bad employees intentions. 
- People leave or get fired often. Are we hiring wrong people or not retaining the good ones?
- The bonus was difficult to understand, and small.

253,Trustpilot,Great opportunities at Trustpilot!,2017-08-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I feel like a lot of these negative reviews are definitely representative of Account Development Reps that probably felt entitled and didn't work as hard as they should have, and wound up quitting or getting fired because of it. 
Having worked at several companies ranging from early stage start up, mid size, and large corporation, I can safely say that Trustpilot is the best place I have worked, and it's been a relatively short time since I started here. 
I'm not being naive. I understand that the beginning is the ""honeymoon period"" and the sh*t will come. Of course, that's just life. You roll with the day to day punches and you deal. 
That being said, Trustpilot (at around 500 when I joined) has provided us with every opportunity to work in a comfortable and collaborative work environment. Free lunches on Friday's and the last day of every month, cold brew keg, beer kegs, unlimited snacks, bagels on Monday, bean bags throughout the office to switch it up from your desk, ping pong, foosball, darts, standing desks.... this honestly doesn't even begin to cover it.

Note to millennials right out of college: put in your time, be patient and good things will come to you. Don't be in such a rush to get to the next best thing.... You're here now.",I haven't come across much. I would love to see sales and customer success be a bit more collaborative on deals in the future though!

- The company was fair to me when I decided to leave","-This company is so poorly managed I don't even know where to begin, however I've come to learn that it starts at the very top. Upper management is stubborn, condescending, childish and mainly based in Copenhagen, making it very difficult to get face time in NY.

-The sales department is not well run. The team is micromanaged and has poor and condescending leadership. They can't seem to figure out how to consistently hit quota.

-The customer success team is slightly better, but many people haven't been happy there for years.

-As for the marketing department, it's a mess. Tons of turnover in the upper management; two failed VPs, no direction"

- Autonomy for choosing best technologies, with a focus on the latest ones
- Bright colleagues
- 20% time to develop personal projects
- Budget for conferences
- Flexible hours
- Tons of social events
- A lot of fun in the office (foosball, beer,  ping-pong, etc.)","There is a strong focus on sales, which can affect engineering teams"
258,Trustpilot,Great place to work,2017-04-12,5.0,Strategic Account Executive,"- Incredibly helpful culture, everyone is willing to pitch in always.
- Fun place to come to everyday. The folks in the Denver office are so awesome, it makes it hard not to smile all day.
- The software works and the mission is real
- Like in any sales job, there is a correlation between hard work and success which allows those who want to be the best to achieve their goals.
- It feels like a family at this point and the entire Denver office supports one another.","- Like all startups, there is a ton of change.  You have to have a glass half full mentality to do well.
- There has been very little marketing to date so almost everything is sales driven with outbound effort.  You have to be ready to work hard to do well."
259,Trustpilot,"Great Environment, Not So Great Compensation",2017-03-14,3.0,Account Executive,"Trustpilot did an excellent job hiring for the Denver office. The culture is in line with what I'd assume most sales people are targeting in their next career. The hardest part about leaving was that I wouldn't work next to really talented and personable folks every day. 

Similar to NY, Denver also provides lunch on Fridays and snacks during the day. Go ahead and just plan on gaining 10 lbs during your first year at TP (wait, is that not a pro?). 

Denver moved multiple successful people from the NY office - this decision allowed new hires (and not so new hires) to dip into knowledge that would otherwise have been unobtainable. These individuals' willingness to assist throughout the day and answer questions was a key factor in my own personal success at TP.","Unfortunately, the success rate at TP is not in line with what I understood it to be during my interview. My belief is that a quota should be achievable and a regular occurrence for the vast majority of the team. However, it was very rare for a US Account Executive to hit quota. And it was even more rare for that same person to consistently hit quota. (Yes, I know there is a rockstar AE in NY, but he is the exception and not the rule). I wish I had known this information prior to accepting my offer at TP. What this ultimately means is that I accepted a lower salary with the belief that my OTE would be possible. Though not impossible (i.e. the aforementioned rockstar), it is not likely and should not be sold accordingly during the interview. 

Additionally, I have concerns about the future of the company in the US. At one time, I really thought we would be a household name by 2018. In my opinion, the win rate in conjunction with competitor growth (who, by the way, have a pretty slick product) and internal attrition rate are quite disconcerting. Though I hope TP can pull through, I just couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel while I was there. 

Lastly, I went through 3 different managers and 3 different commission structures in less than 1 year. As much as I'd love to go with the flow, I think this was a bit excessive."
260,Trustpilot,Fast-paced environment with great people and opportunities,2017-03-02,5.0,Software Engineer,"The people in Tech are the most talented I've ever worked with. You learn from other people every day, and there is a very high level of professionalism. Everyone is very helpful and open to questions, and the culture promotes knowledge over opinion. Everyone who has a good idea can be heard.
The 20% time is also a great way that you can grow as a person, and there is a budget for going to conferences and education.
Lunch is usually really good.","Sales has too much influence. Trustpilot should be selling the great product organically, but have a hard time moving forward, because sales is holding any initiative towards getting a clear pricing model, self-service, and similar things, back. Even when shown proof, things can drown in politics, usually caused by sales being afraid of change and losing commissions."

Major strategic changes almost every quarter which kind of breaks the flow of building products.
263,Trustpilot,Pros and Cons but Overall Positive,2017-01-30,4.0,Account Executive,"- Good sales training. If you're serious about SaaS sales you can build your skill set significantly
- Good comp plan when you hit your numbers
- If you're willing to put in the work Management will make you successful
- Several top performers were promoted while I was there 
- Good culture, most startups have snacks and beers so nothing new there but work was fun for me and the days moved fast","To anyone reading the bad reviews, keep in mind the people that leave these were probably fired for not hitting their numbers. Trustpilot is a serious Sales office where you are expected to prospect, cold call and sell. If you want something else, go somewhere else but don't talk trash after the fact when you weren't putting in the work to begin with. 

To the people not happy with the review responses, what do you expect them to say when you write what you do? Things are definitely not perfect there but don't throw rocks if you live in a glass house. 

I had good months and bad months at Trustpilot and ended up leaving for a higher base salary but I can say that they have a professional sales floor that they do not lie about in the hiring process. Similar to every serious sales floor our there, you are rewarded when you perform and you aren't if you don't.  If you can't be honest with yourself on your own performance then maybe you should just get out of sales."
264,Trustpilot,TOP Sales people leave constantly.....,2017-01-28,1.0,Account Executive,"Free snacks. Other cool 20-30s age ranged people work there, but smartly leave or are canned after barely given a chance.","Management is just so bad. AWFUL. There's really only two guys so you can make your assumptions about who I'm speaking of, but they pass it on down to the Sales Managers. The only Sales Managers that survive are the ones who kiss the...play nice with the top managers. TOP SALES PEOPLE LEAVE CONSTANTLY. What does that tell you????? It tells me that your so overwhelmingly awful at managing...even talking to people in your organization that even they decide that it isn't worth it to deal with you. I'm sure the compensation has A LOT to do with it as well. WHY ELSE WOULD TOP SALES PEOPLE LEAVE??????  If you need a job take the offer. Otherwise you're NOT going to have a long successful career here unless you really believe what they do is otherworldly (which it is by no means)"

News flash -- there are a lot of former employees that were not treated well and want to use this outlet to share similar opinions (including myself). Stop getting defensive and if you actually care about Trustpilot, take the feedback professionally (and seriously) and use it to help improve the company. Just because it's not what you want to hear doesn't mean that it's ""unprofessional"".

Reviews and responses aside, I found the environment at Trustpilot to be toxic and difficult to work in. Change is not welcome and most new ideas are shot down quickly. Eventually you just succumb to doing things to way they've always been because you get tired of the uphill battle. Stay very clear of this place -- they claim to be ""open"" and ""transparent"", but trust me, they'll never actually change. Just take another look at their responses to negative feedback and you'll see what I mean."

When you come to work, you come to make money not play blocks on a lego wall or sit on wacky bean bag chairs.  It's actually sad.

Nice office with tech perks (food, keg, ping-pong) and nice location in Flatiron.",You must be adaptable and flexible to work at a start up. Sales can be grind with ups and downs.

You always learn something new from them, and by working with the latest technologies and processes. Benefits like flexible hours and workplace, 20% time in which you can explore whatever idea/passion you want (as long as it is tech related, at least :P ), team/department events,... only make it better. Moreover, everyone is very helpful and available, being for a small work-issue or for hanging out and chat about life: it feels like working with friends, not colleagues.","Working with the latest technologies has its downsides as well, and if you are not at ease with struggling because of the novelty (lack of tooling, new approaches to learn, constant change), it can feel stressful and unpleasant. This feeling can be increased by the frequent changes of strategy in the organzation, due to the fast pace and start-up nature."
273,Trustpilot,An awesome place to work (Technology),2017-01-24,5.0,"Software Engineer, Backend","What I like most about Tech, is the way that each team gets to figure out how to best reach a certain goal. There are seldom any specific feature requirements, but it's up to the individual teams to figure out how to reach certain goals (ie. 10% increase in retention or something like it).

There is a saying in Tech: ""It's not a failure. It's an experiment."".

Besides that, there is a lot of focus on the individual to continue to improve. 1 to 1 conversations every month where the manager actually follow up on what you talk about, and makes you feel valued.

And to top it all off, the colleagues are second to none. Always willing to brainstorm if you're stuck on something, and provide a fresh perspective on a given problem/solution.

Did I forget to say that there is breakfast, lunch and dinner in the canteen? Negligible additional cost.

The way management has been responding to these reviews (specifically one of the more recent ones) really indicates how unwilling they are to listen to their employees, and how little they value input that they don't agree with. There is some serious Stockholm Syndrome among the more tenured crew where they actually believe that being a culture of fear and submission is the best way to be. They genuinely think that people should be grateful that they were given the time of day and the ability to work there. They don't understand the value of differing opinions or other work experience, and there is zero humility (although they would claim otherwise). Stay far away.

This was the worst sales job I've ever had.  The sales floor is very quiet, definitely not ""electric"" like previous reviews claim.  People quit all the time, people get fired all the time.  I think 10% of AEs were hitting quota when I left.  You will spend your whole day  prospecting only to find companies that have been reached out to by previous reps 100s of times.

-It's a great place to start your career or a great pit-stop in your work journey. I've seen people who voluntarily leave, move on to great companies. 
-I don't know people in other offices, but NYC has some good people to work with. 
-Opportunity to get involved in various projects 
-You can move up in the company if you demand it. Just click your heel three times and you become a manager. 
-Some of the newer leadership that has been brought in seems promising.","-Limited vision for the company which is partly because the company is very reactive. They aren't proactive or bold enough to push the envelope or try something new. I think this is partly due to the Danish culture which unfortunately affects the organization. The brand is not known, which is a problem in the U.S.

The product team is sorely lacking in vision and capabilities, and is either unwilling or unable to listen to feedback from internal employees who know the clients best. Nothing worthwhile has been added into the product in two years.
Management seems to think the sell now deal with the consequences later model is the best fit for successfully scaling a company.
Most sales people are here then they're gone without a trace. They like to hire ten people a month with the intention of only keeping maybe 5-6 long term.

There is a tremendous amount of shared confidence in the company's direction, and it's hard to not be excited to contribute towards that. 

The team I was on was fantastic, and in general everyone is invested in the success of others. Big on celebrating wins. Managers are knowledgable and helpful, ours in particular I found to be extremely insightful and driven to see us succeed. Upper management is steering Trustpilot in the right direction, and this is embodied best in the CEO who is very approachable, involved, and focused. Lot's of opportunity for growth. 

Perks are nice- kegs, snacks, lunches on Friday, events, etc. Also the new bonus structure they rolled out provides opportunity to make some nice checks.","Most of the complaints you'll see here are an indictment on the job type and not the role itself. It's inside sales-- as long as you are aware of that going in (which they are very transparent about) you will find it to be a rewarding and positive experience. 

I felt like some of the sales approaches set at a company level are more applicable to the 2013 landscape than today. Representing Trustpilot has evolved a lot, and while the focus should always be on having quality conversations, the metrics and KPI's to get there could use a re-examination in my opinion."

Great supportive managers who are there for your success, makes a bleeding change from other places I have worked. Comms is uncapped, loads of celebrations around deals with hooters going off periodically, two president clubs a year for the top sales reps in the office. Great product to sell, really feel that you are making a difference daily, not just selling something to make some money. Bottom line, I sleep at night knowingly selling a great product, love coming into work everyday, I am very happy.","There was an issue with progression, was a start up in London a year ago but now there is a ladder to climb and two of my buddies are now team leads and are moving into management. The company has grown fast, so is tough for those that come from a corporate back ground and can’t adapt to working for a company that is moving so quickly. There is a corporate gym membership but it would be great to have a nicer gym choice and a better deal for us fitness fanatics.

There's a lot to learn here, and it's been an incredibly rewarding experience. I've grown so much in the time I've been here because of the team we have. I won't lie, it's definitely challenging - there's a lot of work to be done, but it's worth it because of what we're building and the people you get to build it with.

One of the only jobs I've had where people actually want to stick around and hang out with their co-workers. I have some really great friends that I've met here. The product works and when you're speaking to the right people it is a pretty straightforward sale. It is also worth noting that with almost 500 people our CEO knows just about everyone by name and takes a genuine interest in you as a person and how he can make your life easier.

 I've read some reviews about this being a chop shop or boot camp but that is ridiculous. This is sales and like any other job, you are expected to work hard. The person that complained about 9-6 being ""long hours"" clearly doesn't belong in a sales role. We get out what we put in. We are given all the tools we need to be successful (marketing collateral, training and some awesome advice and help from peers). Also, it doesn't hurt that we have a keg in our office and regular social events.","For the most part, the cons that I would bring up are things that are being addressed by the executives and upper management. For a period of time, I had some issues with managers being hired externally rather than internally. They have since addressed this and are very focused on career tracks.

I grew a lot at Trustpilot, but was never given formal objectives. At all times, my peers and supers expected me to understand my role in solving the problems which my group had responsibility for, and as a consequence I matured a lot as an engineer. Furthermore, I loved the relaxed vibe around the office, the international working environment and the parties.","An online service that collects service reviews can be implemented in many different ways, and as Trustpilot is quite a young company, this would occasionally show. My role was not related to product design, however, and I never felt this was a pressing issue."
336,Trustpilot,CHOP SHOP,2015-12-08,1.0,Account Executive,Start Up Environment- beautiful office- great CEO,"For the NYC offices. I noticed Trustpilot start to hire 5-7 new employees a month. They would train them, let them work for about 3 or so months, and then chop off the ones that didn't put up there unrealistic numbers to hit after only being there for a small amount of time. Their recruiters lie and tell you that they want to help you become a better salesperson but the moment you don't hit a number your head is on the block.There Managers play favorites to the people who were their from the start. They also hire managers from the outside rather then internally. I am not convinced about room for growth because chances are you wont last more then a half of a year anyway. I know more people fired then kept at Trustpilot NYC. Goodluck"
337,Trustpilot,Account Executive,2015-11-19,5.0,Account Executive,"-The culture is amazing. While sales is a rough gig for anyone, there's just a tremendous amount of enthusiasm in the office. I've worked in other sales environments where I worked alone and was responsible solely for my own business. At Trustpilot, I have so much support I sometimes honestly don't know who to go to because of options.

-I've been in sales offices that treat their salespeople terribly. Anyone who thinks working a 9-6 day and being expected to produce is the extent of bad treatment clearly hasn't done much sales. The company has great benefits, brings in free meals, throws parties for its employees, and is generally one of the most supportive environments I've ever had the chance to work in.

-Pay is comparable, if not better, than the other positions I worked/interviewed in. But it's sales. The commission is the important part. You're not supposed to just make the base or you're doing something wrong.

-Wait...some guy was late and had to tell a joke as punishment? That sounds awesome! He's just mad because he doesn't have a sense of humor. At one sales job I was reprimanded for wearing the wrong color shirt and had a door slammed in my face for being 1 minute late to a meeting. Get better jokes buddy.","-Long days. But that's not a Trustpilot issue so much as just the lifestyle of sales.
-I'm going to get fat on free seamless orders after hours/free kegs
-It's a tough sell, and there's a strong negative reputation out there sometimes because we're selling a solution a lot of people don't understand, and are dealing with for the first time. So you have to be prepared to be kicked around. But again, that's sales."

Part from this, they are very sneaky, shich means they smile in your face, but give it to you later in the form of an official warning. Lots of people got fired and lots of people leave because of this. The only who stays are the ones who are working there from the beginning of the start of the company and who have some immunity. The Management wants to make you believe how much they want you to succeed and how much they're doing to suport you in this - but the ugly truth is that everything they do demotivates you even more."
344,Trustpilot,OK so far,2015-09-21,3.0,Account Executive,"- Decent pay & commission structure for AEs
- Great product to sell
- Great trainings happen often - the product is complex, so this is very necessary
- Everyone seems genuinely nice, smart, and wants you to succeed
- Snacks, kegs, ping pong, and all that Jazz
- Just received a ton of VC funding, so it's definitely got a bright future","- Need more of these great trainings! I know they can be a bit of info- overload, but you shouldn't have reps in their 2nd and 3rd months who still don't understand pricing flexibility and basic features simply because they weren't taught how it all works.
- Sometimes expectations are unrealistic - quotas seem very hard to hit, same with KPIs. Managers tend to micromanage based solely on certain KPIs, which makes no sense. 
- Benefits could be better. I was stupid to not ask or negotiate them in my interview/offer, but they are slightly subpar compared to similar NYC startups. For instance, only 10 vacation days (as opposed to industry standard of 15+), no gym subsidy, no 401k match, NO OVERTIME. While health insurance is free, it's also not the best - super high deductibles, etc."

Nothing else is good about this place.","Turnover is crazy high, and few people here have been here for more than a year.  This is not due just to growth, but a lot of people leaving, even from the management and executive teams.

Little to no support from management to complete projects to the point of being obstructionist.  At times I could swear they have their fingers in their ears."
347,Trustpilot,Business development manager,2015-08-18,2.0,Business Development Manager,"Good location, ambitious people. Copenhagen office is very well managed but London is awful.","The UK office is really badly managed with a very high staff turnover. You'll be chained to your phone and have to log how many calls you've made every hour. It's a telesales role, not business development. You work from a script and can't deviate. 
It's a review company so they get enployees to write good reviews on glass door."
348,Trustpilot,"Great, exciting company",2015-08-14,5.0,Account Executive,"The people are great and the solution is just that. Everyone is more than friendly and helpful in any questions you have. 
The environment is really dynamic and exciting with lots of opportunity","You need to be willing to adapt. This is a new, exciting company so things are ever changing. That said, they're very open to new ideas, and you're encouraged to bring your ideas to the table."
349,Trustpilot,Awesome,2015-07-23,5.0,,The people and the product are amazing,It's cold sometimes in the office but just bring a jacket.
350,Trustpilot,"Best company i have worked for, ever.",2015-07-02,5.0,Software Developer,"multicultural company, so many interesting colleagues and social activities going on, which is super important in my opinion.

Everyone is very professional, and in Technology we collaborate a lot, which has taught me much through the years. We get to spent 20% of our work time on projects that does not need to be work related. We have hackatons, social events, and can attend two conferences a year. And we get to work with cutting edge technology. To sum it all up, Trustpilot is just an awesome workplace.","I'm having a hard time finding any cons. Perhaps that it sometimes feels like the rest of the organisation is becoming a bit too coporate.. We have always had a unique startup spirit, and i really hope we can keep this as we continue to grow, tho it might be far fetched to believe this is possible."
351,Trustpilot,Onion disguised as a candy apple,2015-06-16,1.0,Sales Executive,"Bagels on Monday and catered food on Fridays, free snacks and amazing sales managers willing to go above and beyond to help you. Nice office as it is new, Two kegs which are changed every month and a wine club. Let's not forget the cool Lego wall, ping pong table and Xbox","Everything that you think will make your job choice a wrong one, this place has it, their internal process for NY office is completely flawed. They are fully setup for failure even though they just received a large amount of funding.
High pressure sale, extreme pressure from upper management, quotas that are unrealistic. I was informed pre hire that over 50% of the sales floor hits quota, reality is less than 18%. 
Commission on sales is lousy until you hit quota, otherwise expect only Pennies on the dollar.
Ps. If you are not hired as a senior sales person, Good luck finding leads and prospects to call.
Expect 50+ hr week with only guilt being pressed on you if you leave at exactly 6pm."
352,Trustpilot,Everyone works hard and they take good care of us,2015-06-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I really like working at Trustpilot. Its a cool product that you can definitely feel good about telling your friends and family. It makes sense in the market and you know there is alot out there to take.  I am learning alot about what goes into building a successful company (the good and the bad) Everyone genuinely likes each other which is pretty rare. 

Its split 50/50 now with sales and non-sales, and we all sit in an open floor plan. There are alot of visitors from the other offices and we send alot of people abroad too. We all share in celebrating the closed deals. Actually everyone has a noise they make when they've hit a target ( can get kinda rowdy some times- but in good fun) At the end of the day the sales team is selling a new product to a new market, I'm sure its hard, but I assume that's what everyone signed up for... figuring things out and building.

Overall we have a pretty cushy set up, nice office, standing desks, plenty of food, international travel, lots of parties/ social events etc. Plus we got a new huge round of funding so i'm excited to see what else happens and continue riding this ride. 

If you are good with work hard daily, learning the things that will make you invaluable to the next company you work for, and can deal with actually working at a start-up then this is for you. Otherwise wait until we are alot bigger.","Most of the leadership is sales focused, which is understandable with the quick growth i hope we get more influence outside of that sooner than later since non-sales is growing just as fast.

Sometimes the office gets pretty loud but hopefully the 2nd floor will remedy that. 

Long term benefits - people are invested in this company, would like to share in the success we are building."
353,Trustpilot,Deceptive Company,2015-05-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Absolutely none. One of the worst professional experiences of my life. I came from a successful sales role at a similar company and Trustpilot made not only me but dozens of others leave a sales career for good.,"This is specifically in regards to the New York Trustpilot office. I was repeatedly lied to during the interview and onboarding process. They swore that 50% of the team makes quota every month, which hasn't been remotely true since 2014. They also had the audacity to claim ""Turnover is not an issue here"" when the numbers show that they experienced a 70% turnover rate in 2014 alone.

They will make you feel guilty for not working 50+ hour weeks and staying late when nobody on the floor is hitting quota. One of the most demoralizing experiences I've ever had."

360,Trustpilot,Great company to work for,2015-01-06,5.0,Account Executive,Trustpilot has built an awesome office environment here in NYC with a fun culture. The management team is easy to work with and will help you along the way. Trustpilot's solution is the best in the business and the new office here on 5th avenue only helps to make it an easier option for you to put in the necessary time to be successful.,You have to put in the time to hit your goals. You will have to work overtime if you want to hit quota and earn a strong commission.
361,Trustpilot,Complete Lack of Transparency,2014-12-18,1.0,Account Executive,"- Free Lunch on Friday
- New Office Space
- Free Snacks/Beer","For anyone considering the Account Executive role at Trustpilot - Please proceed with caution. As another person mentioned, there is a complete lack of transparency between sales reps and management at this company. Culturally, if they don't think you fit in or mesh well with others, they will find ways/excuses to push you out the door. Managers have their favorites, and will coddle others based on personal preference, which is completely unprofessional. On a side note: my manager actually asked me who I thought the hottest girl in the office was - Really ?

Compensation here isn't the best, and you don't actually earn decent checks unless you're hitting over 100% of your quota. Reps don't start earning commission until they hit at least 50% of their monthly goal. They heavily promote a ""Process"" that will lead to your success here. It's funny though that none of their top performing reps actually follow this process. The nepotism in the office is crazy, and though their is a steady stream of inbound leads, these are all distributed among the same senior reps. 

Since reps are broken down into different verticals, and there are strict guidelines regarding what is considered a viable lead - expect to find a majority of the ""perfect fit"" companies either already have seller ratings in Google or are being worked by another rep. The process of prospecting/qualifying accounts is a very time consuming and arduous job in itself, so expect working well past six to accomplish your prospecting goals. Also expect enormous pressure from management in hitting daily metrics (calls, talk-time, meetings booked, etc.)

The sales style practiced here is over the top aggressive, and I've had many companies say they would never work with Trustpilot based on this approach. Also be prepared for the same awful music being blasted by your desk the entire day - another distraction making productivity more difficult at this company. 

Overall, don't expect support from management unless you go out of your way to make friends. There is a ton of childish behavior from managers that makes getting your job accomplished extremely frustrating, so make sure to do your due diligence in researching Truspilot before committing to the interview process."
362,Trustpilot,Think twice! Poor commission structure and no paid holidays!,2014-12-04,1.0,Sales Executive,"- Nice office location
- Copenhagen is a cool city","- Commission strucure is a joke; Attainment under 50% means no commission at all
- No paid holidays for foreigners that relocate to CPH. Not a nice suprise when used to a good number of paid holidays back in UK.
- Both the commission and holidays issues are not communicated during the interview process
- Hire and fire policy, people get fired all the time
- People are leaving as well
- Very simple product, not as competitive as leadership makes it out to be 
- Poor company culture in general, people fighting over leads"
