2,Turo,Amazing Company & Getting Better Everyday!,2022-03-16,5.0,Manager,Turo has maintained true to its values but is also open to listen to everyone’s concerns.

3,Turo,Fun startup,2022-03-16,4.0,Senior Claims Associate,Cool people. Fun & relaxed culture.,"There were many problems in our department during my time there, but management finally began to resolve most of these issues by the time I left the company. They've likely continued to improve things since then."

8,Turo,Top company,2022-02-17,5.0,assistant administration des ventes,Great product and great material advantages,not really noticed any inconvenient
9,Turo,"Great company, but benefits can really improve",2022-02-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Highly collaborative culture
- Down to earth, approachable leadership
- Good product with strong momentum","- Poor parental leave that’s become more apparent as many companies partake in the #ShowUsYourLeave movement (just 8 weeks for men / 12 weeks for women vs 12-24 weeks everywhere else)
- Only up to $1500 in annual 401k match when other tech companies offer a 100% match on up to 4-6% of salary"
10,Turo,There is a reason company reviews are so high,2022-02-04,5.0,Senior Revenue Accountant,"I have been at Turo for over a couple months now. Here are my list of pros:
-Orientation: It is important for your new employer to make a good impression on you because that gets you excited for a new job. I have worked at much larger companies, but no orientation process has been as organized, informative and smooth as this one. Bonus, you pretty much get the best laptops money can buy when you start;)
-Systems/Applications used: Turo is still growing very rapidly and it is very exciting to be a part of. We use very good applications for communication (slack), databases (DataGrip), accounting software (NetSuite), accounting close software (FloQast), and many other very useful applications that make life very easy. Everything is shockingly well integrated and everyone is very responsive to system/application changes.
-Managers: Based on my experience working in Accounting and cross-functionally (mainly with the data team), I can confidently say that all Managers I have worked with are very supportive, patient, hard working, and will make you feel appreciated. At Turo, people listen to your opinions and hear you out.
-Pay/Benefits: Pay and benefits are great and only getting better! Unlimited PTO (not hard to use), good base and equity incentives, health insurance covered completely for almost everyone, $100/month Turo credits, $75 in misc gifts every month, and lunch catered every Wednesday. Not to mention the office is beautiful and stocked with healthy and unhealthy snacks and drinks.
-Transparency: Our CEO and the other company executives make the time of day for anyone that has questions. They are very honest about the companies performance and what they are looking to accomplish. On a biweekly basis, the CEO or other executives speak to the entire company about performance, new hire intros, and business strategies we are working on implementing. Nobody is left in the dark!
-Overall, the atmosphere at the office and among all teams is top notch and I have loved working here and learning from managers and peers.",This is really tough as I would need to be a real stickler to think of something. I guess more lunches is always good:)
11,Turo,Excellent place to work,2022-01-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Such a diverse, inclusive workplace. Very fun and relaxed as long as you get the job done.",Want better pay even though it’s decent the rent is skyrocketing and give people the option on taking the vaccine don’t mandate it
12,Turo,Great!,2022-01-13,5.0,Machine Operator,Easy flexibility to rent cars on here,"None, i approve of everything"
13,Turo,"Amazing company and culture, wonderful co-workers/management, exciting outlook",2021-12-17,5.0,Senior Data Scientist,"Working at Turo feels like being part of a family, that has your best interests at heart. Lots of interesting and intellectually stimulating marketplace problems to work on. Happy and motivated co-workers that are excited to be working towards the same goal. People tend to stay here longer than other tech companies, and if they leave you often see them come back. Lots of autonomy and exposure to exec team. Great culture and an exciting product to be a part of.",Upper management still hasn't yet come to terms with the fact that remote work is the future. Working from home policies aren't yet as flexible as I believe they eventually will be. Benefits aren't yet as attractive as many SF tech companies.
14,Turo,"Great co, lots to appreciate",2021-12-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Culture, traction, management, collaborative, nice folks","Operational complexity, only in 3 countries"
15,Turo,Great place to work,2021-11-19,5.0,Account Manager,Great environment. Good people. Fun work getting to know hosts.,There are not too many down sides.
16,Turo,Best place I’ve ever worked hands down.,2021-10-22,5.0,IT Support Specialist,"A real human experience, people can be themselves at work and outside of work and are still recognized as professional. The culture is amazing, leadership goes above and beyond to check in on their team and offer support and guidance. The pay is great, growth is highly encouraged and there’s no fake “we encourage diversity,” nonsense that’s only on paper. It’s a safe space and the diversity is organic. I enjoy going to work everyday and feel like my work means something to me and my team. I’m still in awe over the great time we all had at Turbo Week.","Can’t think of any, love it here."
17,Turo,Great Startup Feeling Company,2021-10-21,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Surprisingly very inclusive and welcoming culture
- Good benefits
- Modern office
- Employee first approach
- Huge emphasis on safety
- Surprisingly flat organization, no real sense of hierarchy","- Onboarding experience could be more organized but it's not bad
- Benefits election could be consolidated and easier for the employee, but maybe it's just me who is not used to selecting benefits; it's a one time thing."
18,Turo,"Fantastic culture, company CEO and leadership. Growing pains of a start up.",2021-10-20,5.0,Senior Account Executive,Turo has a fantastic group of people running the company from the app developers to C-level execs all the way down to the entry level employees. There's not a single day at Turo that isn't 10x better than any day I've worked anywhere else. The culture is rich and everyone loves everyone else. I've never had issues with another employee.,"As with all start ups, you're building the company from the ground up. There's no framework for how things go when you're literally creating the industry. At times you feel you're a guinea pig for success and when things fail to happen as predicted it impacts your work vibe and paycheck."
19,Turo,Best Place to work,2021-10-19,5.0,Claims Processor,Working at Turo has been a great learning experience. You get a community feel as well as working independently on your own work and there is no feeling of micromanagement. The training is great and your colleagues are always there to cheer you on and help you out if you need help.,Wish there was more opportunity for working in office and becoming a Turo host.
20,Turo,Found My Drive at Turo,2021-10-18,5.0,Senior Manager,"Amazing culture, great benefits, and room to grow. 401k match, Fringe benefits, competitive salaries, and so much more. Every member of Turo is passionate about our foundation and the road ahead.","No cons, but this is not for the slow and steady. Each role is so vital to the success of our business that you have to be ready to keep pace and execute with quality. #Turbo"
21,Turo,One of the Best Places to Work at,2021-10-18,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Best co-workers I have worked with recently. Lots of opportunities for growth. I get appreciated every time for the hard work I put in. Company recently gave bonus and pay rise according to the Radford study. Turbo week (annual company get together) is really cool and with full of enjoyment. By far the best interview process. This was one of the reasons I considered joining Turo over other companies which offered the similar positions. Another reason is the business model and company growth. I believe this company is soon going to skyrocket in popularity that I won't have to tell people that I work for ""Airbnb for cars"".",None so far. Love working here.
22,Turo,Changing,2021-10-18,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pay is great, great benefits, company lunches, yearly reviews, cross departmental collaboration.",Mandated Covid vaccine and refused to provide religious accommodations. Starting to veer away from the culture that was originally introduced. Hard to get assistance and proper training from management when needed as everyone is always busy. While the company is racially integrated there isn't ANY diversity when it comes to management positions. Current employees are often bypassed when applying for higher positions as management would rather hire from outside of the company.
23,Turo,Your work matters,2021-10-18,5.0,Senior Claims Supervisor,"401k match, June bonuses, Radford compensation adjustments, an incredible Turbo Week, and fabulous coworkers",No cons that are apparent right now.
24,Turo,Awesome company!,2021-10-18,5.0,Verification Specialist,Leadership is transparent. Benefits are competitive. Colleagues are awesome.,"None that comes to mind, honestly."
25,Turo,So far so good!,2021-10-18,5.0,Trust and Safety Ops Associate,Relaxed work environment and nice people. Very competitive pay and great additional services. Have yet to regret going in to work a single day since I started 4 months ago.,"Still slightly new company/business idea so some things seem like they are figuring it out, but nothing negative has arose so far."
26,Turo,Amazing onboarding experience!,2021-10-18,5.0,"Director, Recruiting","Collaborative, friendly, open, fast paced, high energy, fun",Haven't seen any; need to be a self-starter as no one is looking over your shoulder
27,Turo,"Amazing leadership, great culture of hiring smart and kind people",2021-10-18,5.0,Marketing Manager,"-good work life balance
-huge TAM and good future prospect
-great culture
-empathetic and strong leaders","-compensation below market
-team is slow to scale"
28,Turo,Great company and great team!,2021-10-18,5.0,Trust and Safety Specialist,"Pros:

Competitive compensation and amazing direct and indirect benefits
Flexible time off
A CEO who believes in transparency
A management team that invests in our growth and development
Great work culture","Cons:

The office needs more space and more inclusive restroom options"
29,Turo,Great place to work!!!,2021-10-18,5.0,Senior Manager,"Turbo Week, happy hours, collaborative and friendly atmosphere, Turo really cares about you. The management and executive team are always approachable and open to questions about company strategy. Everyone truly cares for the company and is very motivated.","As with any startup, there's ambiguity when it comes to work and data. This also translates to the fact that you get to make your own work and are able to champion new ideas and identify areas of improvement, for which you are always recognized."
30,Turo,Best place I’ve worked!,2021-10-18,5.0,Senior Government Relations Manager,"I’ve been in both public/government as well as private/corporate sectors, varying in size and industries — and the biggest pro I see at Turo is its culture. Leaders are humble, transparent are fiercely passionate and incredibly thoughtful and smart. I feel my manager leads with warmth and genuine care — and I feel I can show up authentic and true to who I am every day. That sounds simple but this makes for a culture and environment that works super hard but also enjoys the company of each other, collaborates and is singularly focused toward the big picture and mission. On top of that, there are seemingly small things like the fact that we get a monthly delivery of treats (who doesn’t like stuff sent to their house!?), a matching 401k, and how about a CEO that dj’s!? That just shows the fun we have here but how we are cared for here… which makes me want to make sure I’m always doing my best.",Can’t think of one at the moment… perhaps it’s that we are growing and we just need to continue to be cognizant of how we maintain our grittiness as we grow. Not a con but something I love about how hungry and hardworking we are.
31,Turo,Best Company to Work for,2021-10-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Competitive Salaries: They recently hired Radford to revaluate our compensation so salaries are extremely competitive. 
Transparent: Always aware of Turo's plan for the future thanks to amazing leadership. I've never been on a first name basis with a CEO before! Andre is awesome and DJs!
Culture & Values: All the Turo gear you could ever imagine and we spend a week of nonstop activities in AZ for Turbo Week to enjoy with the best group of people. This year the main event was a night in the desert and there was even a hot air balloon!",Turo hadn't had competitive salaries but they recently hired Radford to revaluate our compensation so salaries are now very generous.
32,Turo,Best company I've ever worked for,2021-10-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Mission is meaningful and embraced at all levels of the company.
Leadership is authentic, caring, inspirational, and committed.
Team is incredibly collaborative, supportive, and just generally so fun to be around.
So much opportunity.",Missed by colleagues during the pandemic
33,Turo,Amazing Company!,2021-10-18,5.0,Junior Account Executive,"Even at a Jr. level, I feel like my input is really valued, and I have never been talked down by any peers or supervisors. It sounds cliche, but Turo really feels like a big family, and I have yet to meet a single person who isn't engaging, eager to help, and enthusiastic about the company. Despite the company is north of 400 employees at the moment, it still feels very small. As a result, there are plenty of opportunities to grow professionally and there is a strong focus to promote from within.","Due to the rapid growth of the company, each day can be a little bit different from the next. Because of this, lots of programs and procedures are still being tested and developed, especially in the sales department. The office can also be pretty loud at times. If you love a very regimented office/daily routine, Turo might not be the place for you."
34,Turo,Salary & Benefits increase,2021-10-18,5.0,Trust & Safety Investigator,"Turo recently increased our salaries via Radford Compensation leveling, instituted a $2,000 tuition reimbursement program, a mid-year bonus, and increased the Company sponsored 401k match to $5k. Not bad for a Company that is the Market Leader in the car-sharing economy!","There is a need to promote within our Company, especially for women of color and celebrate our diversity and inclusion in leadership positions."
35,Turo,"Joined recently - fantastic culture, inspiring leadership, friendly colleagues",2021-10-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Inviting, inclusive, transparent, ambitious culture-
Just attended company all-hands spanning full week - great way to acquaint and learn about company, mission, vision
Active and effective communication channels - making it easier to navigate onboarding process",None to mention at this time
36,Turo,Responsible growth for both employees and business,2021-10-18,5.0,Software Engineer,"- WLB is fantastic, never felt pressured to stay late
- Coworkers are a pleasure to work with
- Little office politics
- Good stock options","- Base compensation is below market rate
- WFH policy needs to be updated for the post covid era"
37,Turo,Great place to learn and grow,2021-10-18,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Supportive team members, transparent leadership, continual iteration on benefits to provide things that the employees want.","Historically it has been hard to balance working on tech debt with new features because of a lack of understanding of how long engineering tasks take. Thankfully in this past year, leadership has invested in many quality initiatives to enable the engineers to find a balance and really improve our systems."
38,Turo,The happiest I have been at a tech company,2021-10-18,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Right off the bat I was impressed with Turo during my interview process. The Android team was able to show me code snippets of what the codebase looks like. Something no other company has ever done.
The remote hiring and onboarding process went super smooth.
I really love the culture and the team I work with.","I wish we had a dedicated QA team. Sometimes handling a full release on your own can be a bit daunting.
Also wish the company was more open to working partly remotely for those who have a longer commute."
39,Turo,Amazing Company,2021-10-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great perks, pay, benefits. One of the best corporate cultures out there.","You work really hard here, and there may be times where the days can be long."
40,Turo,Great company & great culture/leadership,2021-10-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good benefits, great culture, recently performed a compensation study to make sure everyone was getting paid properly and then Turo actually executed pay adjustments afterward, fun office environment, still a start-up vibe amongst the company, leadership is approachable and dedicated",nothing really besides that we're growing rapidly so just need to make sure we can keep up with that growth. Hasn't been any issues thus far so not a true con
41,Turo,It's a wonderful life at Turo,2021-10-18,5.0,Public Affairs and Legislative Communications Strategist,"After working here for about a month, I can already tell this place is home. I just came off of a weeklong work retreat and took away a few more things... here are my thoughts: The people are the best— welcoming, caring, brilliant, resourceful, helpful and fun! I’ve had the pleasure of speaking one-on-one with CEO Andre Haddad on several occasions already, and his vision for this place, this brand, this platform is blindingly clear and inspiring. I am thrilled and excited to work for a company that values employees, consumers, and industry partners alike. 

I am grateful for the opportunity to work for not just any tech company, but one that is looking out for the consumer and for the average family that is just trying to make ends meet. The people who host and book on Turo are what inspire my team (Turo Government Relations), giving us a real/meaningful purpose to do our best work. I am looking forward to seeing Turo EVERYWHERE because that means opportunity for financial independence and consumer choice for all is superabundant.",None to report. I'll get back to you if I find any.
42,Turo,Such an Amazing Place to Work For!,2021-10-18,5.0,People Operations Coordinator,"- Everyone is so very driven to do their job and the company shows so much effort to make the work setting fun and exciting every week. 
- Every year, there are two conferences that brings everyone from all locations of the company together and it helps rejuvenate and remind employees of the company's mission. 
- The perks and benefits are really nice
- The company really focuses on hiring people that aligns with their values.","It is a start-up company and that being said, if you are not looking into working in a startup environment then this place isn't for you. It is a fast paced environment but everyone is very supportive in helping each other succeed."
43,Turo,Amazing company leading the P2P car sharing revolution,2021-10-18,5.0,Engineering Manager,"Incredible attention to culture: colleagues across all departments are intelligent, driven, and down to earth. Family feel despite immense growth amidst a banner year.
Extreme transparency from leadership: all employees are constantly informed about the financial performance + details of the business, weaknesses, strengths, challenges.
Leadership has a clear, comprehensive vision for the short, medium, and long-term future of the company in addition to a proven track record of executing successfully on this vision.
Leadership genuinely cares about our employees: after an incredible year of performance, every single employee across the board was given a raise and 1 month's salary bonus. Compensation levels were also adjusted upwards across the board to keep this a great place to work and stay competitive on the talent acquisition front. Additional investments were also made in the form of increased 401k matching, personal development resources, and a ridiculous company conference/celebration.
Careful attention to individual career growth aspirations and active support from managers.","None to really speak of. If you're super into remote work you might consider our return to a hybrid working schedule a con, but I personally am stoked to be back in the office with real humans."
44,Turo,Turo is the best place I've ever worked!,2021-10-18,5.0,Senior Government Relations Manager,"Turo prioritizes their employees more than any other company I've worked at. Their compensation package is more than generous and typically higher than what I've experienced at other tech companies. In addition to that, the culture is incredibly positive and welcoming. All of the employees have a ""can-do"" attitude and no job is too big or too small for anyone. We all root for each other's success and want to do our best to make sure the company succeeds. It's evident that this culture trickles down from the leadership team, including the CEO, Andre. They lead by example and do a great job of making you want to join Turo and build a career here for the longterm.","The only con to Turo is that they are limited as it relates to remote work options. That can limit opportunities for employees/candidates who have families outside of California and Arizona, which is where U.S. employees are based."
45,Turo,"Great place, down to earth, overall fantastic place to work!",2021-10-18,5.0,QA Specialist,You can be yourself here at Turo. The leaders are inspirational and encourage you to move up or to involve yourself with different departments.,"There are no cons, great place to work."
46,Turo,Best company I've ever worked for.,2021-10-18,5.0,Staff Software Engineer,"I've worked in the industry for 15 years and Turo is the best company I've worked for. Good people, interesting work, a leadership group that knows what it is doing and that has a heart.",No cons to report here.
47,Turo,Exciting place to work and be a part of!,2021-10-18,5.0,Junior Account Executive,"Creativity and new ideas encouraged
Awesome coworkers
Down to earth leadership",Pay is okay however the benefits makeup for it
48,Turo,Exciting opportunities await at Turo,2021-10-18,5.0,Director,"Turo continues to reinvest in our teams providing outstanding opportunities to develop and to make a real impact.

As a technology company, I continue to be impressed with our culture, which focuses on being down-to-earth first then efficient, supportive, and pioneering.","Fast growing businesses can be hectic at times, but so rewarding!"
49,Turo,"Supportive, pioneering, down to earth and efficient",2021-10-18,5.0,Manager,"Supportive environment where empowerment to bring great ideas to the table fosters a pioneering, down to earth and efficient work place. Excellent culture! Truly feels like I am part of a family of very smart and gifted individuals.",None today!! Dont change a thing!
50,Turo,Phenomenal Culture & Great Place to Work!,2021-10-18,5.0,Trust & Safety,"It is apparent that Turo cares about its employees!

* Good benefits (healthcare, 401k match, fringe points to spend, travel credit)
* great coworkers 
* kind, trustworthy, approachable management
* competitive salary","* Given that it is a Startup, it can be tough to manage work/life balance at times (inevitable in a startup environment)

* it would be nice to be recognized a bit more for the hard work we do"
51,Turo,Overall great company,2021-10-18,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Our CEO is truly one-of-a-kind; beyond words proud to work for him and within the awesome culture he helped form.
People you work with are great, for the most part.
Great benefits
Ever changing, fast paced, fun environment","No work from home options starting January 2022.
Some upper management is ""do as I say, not as I do."""
52,Turo,6 years on the job and couldn't be happier,2021-10-18,5.0,Senior Legal Specialist,"I've gotten opportunities here that I could not have imagined with previous employers. The one downside over the years was that pay and benefits weren't especially great. It was a startup, and I got it. I made a lateral move coming here, I came for the experience, the great people, the supportive environment and daily adventures, just hoping for some potential upside as time went by. Well, guess what? The upside is here, and it has shown up in a big way! A recent salary adjustment obliterated any reservations about my compensation. And we're not done by a long shot. I plan to stick around for more of the great stuff that's in this company's future.","None. Seriously, I've got none."
53,Turo,"Awesome team, excellent place to grow",2021-10-18,5.0,Senior Product Manager,"- Company culture is the best I've ever experienced
- Collaborative team and honest/transparent leadership
- Excellent work-life balance
- Good compensation and benefits, especially for a startup
- Plenty of opportunities to learn and grow professionally",- It's required to work in the office. Relatively strict non-remote work policy compared to other tech companies.
54,Turo,A Place That Continues to Care,2021-10-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been at Turo before and after (or during, as it's still happening?) the pandemic and leadership has consistently made employees & their needs a priority. I haven't seen anything like it elsewhere, and I think it's really the secret sauce that makes employees care about the work their doing and the impact it makes. We also use our own product, so that's incredibly helpful in making sure it's easy to use for others.",Hard-pressed to find any at the moment.
55,Turo,AMAZING Place to Work,2021-10-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This company is so great to work for. They are welcoming, understanding and down to earth. I have only been here for a couple of months but everyone here is like minded and everyone has bought into the culture. We just had what is called Turbo Week, which is a 3 day event for the staff. It was one of the coolest things I've ever been to. A casino night, a gorgeous night in the desert and a fancy masquerade party! And of course company updates so that everyone can see what each department has been doing. And now the entire staff is back in the office so that we don't lose the personal impact and innovation of working and seeing each other daily. We have catering and snacks, a ping pong table, large TVs that display company messages and announcements, sono speakers to listen to work friendly music and tons of PPE around the office.",I don't have any cons to share.
56,Turo,Employees first,2021-10-18,5.0,"Director, Finance","I've been at Turo for 7 weeks so first impressions; best onboarding ever (and I 've been at 7 companies over the last 20 years). Turo lives by the principle put employees first and they will put customers first. Yes, all the wiz-bang benefits and perks but I came for the growth potential and am staying because of the people. Turo not only wants your opinion but listens to them.","With scale comes change. This is not a con unless fluid, fast moving is not your thing."
57,Turo,Awesome!!,2021-10-18,5.0,Trust & Safety Specialist,"Greatest place to work, everyone is part of the team. Great pay, benefits and work environment.

We have an incredibly down-to-earth, seasoned, approachable leadership team who I trust. All of our employees are super supportive of one another. Everyone lives our Turo values daily. I love that my manager gives me the autonomy to do my job and they don't micromanage me. Turo is a place for those who are ready to roll up their sleeves and are ready to have a meaningful impact on our business. The business is super healthy and we are poised for great success. There is a reason why Turo is able to retain their employees despite the competitive environment here in Silicon Valley. It really is that special of a place. So much so that when folks have left Turo for other opportunities, they often return back to Turo because they really miss our team and culture. I love my job and this team!","I honestly can't think of any cons aside from the fact that we are a growing company, so we often have very full plates, but our teams have been growing to support the workload, so I have every confidence that we'll continue on that growth trajectory."
59,Turo,Excellent Place to Work,2021-10-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Turo has incredible and meaningful benefits that it provides to employees, such as 401k matching, health care, transit benefits, and so much more. Additionally the culture of the company is built on being supportive of each other and also on teamwork. Our CEO, Andre, is extremely accessible and also very transparent and honest with the employees. He is focused on the upward growth of the company and is also dedicated to make sure the employees know they are appreciated and respected for their contributions to the company.","The return to work policy was created by the Executive Team to get in-person teams back, but it is unclear if it is largely supported by employees."

- Transparent leadership
- We recently ran a compensation benchmarking exercise which was exciting to see a big pay increase (I guess that means we were underpaid before, but this was good on balance)
- Our Turbo Week celebrations are really so fun and a big highlight of working here

- Turo pays you on top of your salary for phone and internet. 
- Flexible time off policy. Meaning you can take as much time as need off as long as you are meeting your objectives, goals and business needs. Example, if you need 6 weeks off throughout the year instead of the normal 2 to 3 weeks, it’s totally ok. 
- Senior management, heads and executives value everyone’s opinion, and are hands on and will take the time to talk with you about anything. Within my first week on the job I had a conversation with the CEO. I have been working for the last 20 years with various other companies and have never met a CEO before.
- Snack boxes get sent to your house as we are WFH due to the covid pandemic. The boxes have about 10 to 15 items that come in them each month, like chips, protein bars, chocolates and various drinks.
- $100 Turo credit that you can roll over every month without expiring. You can use this credit to rent a car at any time.
- Stock options. Turo has a great stock option program that makes you want to be the best you be and to help the company perform.
- Monthly social events fully paid for.
- Bi-weekly company meetings, where the whole company gets together on a Zoom call to discuss the business. Turo is an amazing with being transparent with its employees and we get to know everything that is being worked on well before it’s implemented, which gives the employees the time to reflect, adapt and ask important questions.",- Nothing at all.

I was scolded by a manager for telling a Host he should recall his car (on the road trip) due to badly needed wheel alignment (imagine he let go of the steering wheel on a highway). Then, another host lied to that manager about me and it got me fired. That host had insisted I promised to pay her an insurance claim in cash (10k - never!).

Almost every person I worked with at Turo was a kind, empathetic, and hardworking team player.","Turo somehow manages to hire so many of these kind, selfless people, and then takes advantage of them. The company underpays and overworks. Sadly, so many employees are conflict avoidant and of the mentality that ""we just have to work harder"" that few people question the unrealistic expectations.

Another con is the general chaos and disarray that categorizes life at Turo. Many people justify it by saying ""it's a startup"" but having worked at multiple other companies, in my opinion Turo's chaos is not normal. The company is poorly organized and decisions are made impulsively. This is one of the many reasons it is difficult to advance in your career.

Great work environment, system is getting better. Future is exciting.","Pace of change can be challenging for some. I work in claims, summer volume is high."
167,Turo,Absolutely the WORST place to work!!!,2019-09-07,1.0,Claims Associate,Direct deposit every two weeks.,"If I could give zero stars I would.  This company is a scam. The customers are bottom of the barrel and be prepared for every single claim to be an escalation.  The policies you will be asked to enforce are bizarre and poorly written.  The CEO cares about allowing anyone and anybody to use the platform in order to grow the company and cares less about risk, fraud, and robbery.  

You will work these claims on a ""claims system"" that does not work. The system breaks down on a daily basis leaving you stranded and unable to respond to emails or view attachments or do anything.  

On the surface the job seems great, but you quickly realize there is no support from your team, supervisors, or senior management.  Any mistakes the company makes will ultimately be your fault and they will let you know it on a daily basis with a never ending instant messages.  

The workload is overwhelming to say the least and the expectations are completely unreasonable.  Especially when you are using a program that does not work.

There is blatant favoritism.  After filing several HR complaints Turo finally recognized this was happening; however, they did not change their behavior.  Management is petty.  You consistently have to take screenshots of what is communicated to you so that you can defend yourself later when an action backfires and management blames you.  Expect retaliation from management as well if you give any constructive criticism.  Turo will promise you benefits and then when it comes time to deliver there is always some type of issue on why they can't do what they promised.  

In the past month over 15 employees have left the company for these reasons and more.   The new head of claims and claims management are completely clueless on how to run a department.   I will say that the only thing the supervisors are good at is playing ping pong.  Don't expect the opportunity to play though since you will be drowning in claims.  

You will also attend many many meetings that make no sense.  No action will ever come from those meetings.  Did I mention the claims system does not work?    

You will absolutely dread coming to work every single day.  After Turo chews all the greatness  and motivation out of you they will spit you out.  We've been told in a meeting that we are all replaceable.  Management has a seriously lacking logic and it shows.  Make no mistake that if you decide to work for Turo you will be walking into a hostile work environment and you're on your own."
168,Turo,You can do anything here,2019-08-06,2.0,Claims Associate,You can do anything here and get away with it. They don't hold anyone accountable for anything and people don't work and won't get in trouble. You'll literally never get fired or written up.,Too much work and not enough people.
169,Turo,"Good benefits, mediocre pay, terrible training, constant flux",2019-07-04,2.0,Claims Adjuster,"The people, overall, are good to work with.  The free snacks and drinks are nice.  The benefits (for those without families) are quite good.  If you can survive the initial shellshock, it is possible to move up quickly.  Just don't expect that advancement to come with any real boost in pay.","The training is laughably inadequate and disorganized.  No one is in charge of it and it shows.  The customers (Hosts and Guests) are combative and frequently horrible.   Expect to spend a majority of your day getting yelled at and insulted via email or phone calls.  You will deny at least half the claims you handle due to policy exclusions or material misrepresentation.  Plan to work 50-60 per week until you either quit or achieve competence through sheer repetition.  If you take any PTO, expect to come back to an enormous backlog.  Policy and protocol are constantly changing and the only notice (if any) we receive as handlers is a Slack message blasted across one of the general channels.  Stock options are available for purchase, but handlers don't get paid enough to afford them.  You're working for salary and the salary is mediocre."
170,Turo,Keep up the amazing work!!!,2019-07-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been part of Turo for over one year now.  And I am confident to say, it has been one of my best years ever.  A few things that I want to highlight:

The company is filled with amazing employees.  Everyone is really thoughtful and supportive.  I feel there is no job too little for anyone.  Our core values are Pioneering, Efficient, Supportive and Down-to-earth.  We have a phenomenal Executive Leadership team.  They truly care about their employees and really go out of the way to listen and hear their employees thoughts and concerns. 

Andre Haddad is the best CEO I have had a chance to work for.  He is extremely smart.   Incredible understanding of Marketplaces.  Well-spoken, insanely smart and passionate about mobility and the shared economy space.  He was also just ranked #16 in the United States  by Glassdoor as the top CEO for 2019. 

The culture is genuine! Every employee embodies the 4 core values.  People are approachable, easy to communicate with... there is true collaboration happening at Turo.  We were also ranked #3 on the list of Top Workplaces from the Bay Area News Group.  One thing that I love is Turbo Week.  Turbo Week is a week-long Town Hall meeting.  Where Turo flies out everyone from all the different branches  to one location, (every 6-months) to sync up and share updates from each department.  During this time, there are also team building exercises and a hackathon.

Great Benefits and Perks (4 weeks of PTO, cell phone and gym membership reimbursement, monthly Turo credit, lunch is provided, volunteer days, strong medical, dental and vision coverages etc.)

The product is disruptive and sticky.  Turo helps people reduce emissions, and assists people during tough times by helping them turn their vehicles into additional income.  Turo also helps people purchase their dream car that they thought they would never be able to afford.  The product offsets your monthly car payment while also putting some cash in your pocket.","There aren't many, but if I had to list one it would be: 

No bonus plans.  Hopefully they will add a bonus plan soon.  However, they did do a compensation benchmarking exercise to make sure everyone is being paid fairly and competitively."
171,Turo,"Honest people, fast-paced business",2019-05-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,There's a ton of transparency top-down: c-suite leadership is always open to answering tough questions and providing solid answers for the company direction. Our company culture doesn't let egos and internal politics take advantage. I've watched co-workers actively make sure everyone has a seat at the table and a voice in all conversations. To work at Turo you have to pass a strong BS filter in the hiring process. It's a great fast-paced place to work with lots of potential for ownership and responsibilities.,"Because we're moving so fast, we're have so many potential projects to work on. However our PM teams are good at picking out what needs prioritization."
172,Turo,Very unprofessional work place,2019-05-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Pay is decent for the amount of work. PTO and other benefits are great,Favoritism is the only way they promote. You have to be a drinker or partier to be well liked at this company. They promise promotions but don't follow through. Supervisors will blame all the other managers and you will never get a straight answer for everything. The systems are a mess and you will take the brunt of it from the customers and higher up managers. So much gossip in this workspace it's very unprofessional. Any time you refer anyone for a position too they are left hanging and are told we aren't hiring yet they are still interviewing and hiring new people. The CEO will hop onto chat threads and act completely unprofessional with his responses.
173,Turo,Amazing company to work for and a great team,2019-05-21,5.0,Managing Director,Turo has great values and is true to them. Consider myself genuinely lucky to work with such an amazing team at such an exciting time in our growth curve,Really hard to think of any.

- Health and dental insurance
- Company-wide meet-ups every six months where we get flown out to the US to meet with the rest of the company","The fact I had to stop and think about whether there were any cons is a testament to the fantastic job senior management have done to create the working environment I find myself in. If I'm scraping the barrel, my holiday allowance is lower than my friends who work in other companies but, frankly, I couldn't care less because when I'm not on holiday I truly look forward to coming into the office and building out the UK business."
181,Turo,Exciting and revolutionary in every way,2019-04-25,5.0,Operations Manager,Such a great environment to work in with complete transparency.

Executive team is very approachable with any questions, even as the company has grown. 
Engineers have a lot of influence on product decisions - very collaborative workflow.
Unique mission, with a chance to make a serious impact on the real world.","Lack of diversity in engineering, even by industry standards, and management is not interested in solving the problem, despite individual contributors vocal concerns about diversity. 
Some very weird and questionable decisions recently about who can stay with the company and what offices people can work in.

They have all hands every other week where you get to ask the heads of different departments questions, so you get a sense of who they are. I've found that the engineers here are willing to help each other out and there's no ego at play. Everyone realizes that it's about teamwork and works hard to help to achieve the company's overall goals. What I really like about working her is that people not only work hard, but they also know how to have fun too, for example there are various social groups throughout the company that chats about Games of Thrones, Instant Pot, Home and Garden, and Rock Climbing to just name a few.","No matching 401k. No floating holidays. PTO is capped at 4 weeks / year, with no increase with seniority."
188,Turo,No doubt about it - the single best company!,2019-04-24,5.0,Government Relations,Thrilling mission and brilliant executive leadership.  Carefully curated employee pool that combines high-level talent and performance with some of the kindest and sweetest people you could imagine.  Company is growing quickly yet there is a wide-spread esprit de corps that buoys the team and is quite contagious.  The people at Turo keep it real - no pretentiousness or arrogance.  Just a super hot house band and CEO who is also a DJ.  Who wouldn't want to work here?,Sometimes the printers don't work!  That's literally the biggest con I can think of.

Upper management's focus has shifted and now seems to be focused focused on cost reduction, RO.  The ability to really pursue and own passion projects is now a thing of the past.

* The team is great and very supportive with strong positive culture.
* Great work life balance, this was very important for me when I joined. People don't get burnt out, enjoy their life and stay here for years.
* Senior management values people. It starts from the very top, Andre, the CEO, is a great businessman and at the same time he is very approachable and personable. 
* The company is data driven, meaning that decisions are made based on analysis and data.
* The product is solid, keeps growing and improving. The roadmap is very aggressive and the team has a process in place to keep delivering new features at hight frequency.

I have observed the CEO and leadership team respond to several tough business, organizational and competitive challenges and the calm, focused manner in which they approach and overcome each challenge demonstrates the steady hand and confident leadership style that can only be forged through years of experience (a rarified quality in the valley IMO).  Moreover, I am motivated to live up to the positive example the leadership sets, investing time to communicate transparently on company issues, and respond to feedback - both from employees and customers. Turo may not have all of the flashy perks that some technology companies offer, but it has the qualities that count; great leadership, great people, great culture and a challenging product that's helping to transform an industry (and the perks aren't too bad either.)","Our product is starting to show it's age, with accumulated tech and design debt.

My team specifically is very collaborative and the company has recently started to invest heavily to expand headcount and really improve the reporting and processes. Still adjusting to the management styles of the recently hired but definitely have a positive outlook and learning a lot.

Compensation is generous but still heavily favoring engineering which is common in the bay area.","Accounting is still playing catch up so we haven't had the luxury to really develop in areas of interest but once things stabilize I feel like I will be given more opportunities that I can take ownership of.

The executive team is a seasoned group of people who lead by example. They model our core values day in and day out.  They are adults and professionals. They hold themselves and their teams accountable which is much appreciated. 

Aside from the leadership, I love my team. We don't always have all the resources or staffing that we could use, but we work hard and make the best with what we have. But this is all part of being in a growing company. I'd take this scrappy, build-as-you-go experience vs. being bored out of my mind at a bigger company with all the ""perks"" but little opportunity to grow. The best part about my work at Turo is that I can actually see the impact that I'm having on the Company and that I'm continually learning. Turo gives me the opportunity to challenge myself with new projects and for that I'm grateful.

My advice is that if you want a late-stage start-up experience, get onboard at Turo now. We are growing by leaps and bounds as the business is super-healthy. Don't miss an opportunity to be part of this ride!","We are still a growing company.

The company empowers employees to do their best work and make decisions that impact business outcomes and customers. Turo's mission -- putting the world's 1 billion cars to use -- is impactful and bold, which is unique among SF startups. Senior leadership is experienced so the company isn't shifting course and changing priorities every few weeks, like some other companies of our size. In particular, the CEO Andre is incredibly thoughtful, cares deeply about the product and customers, and sets a strong example of leadership for the whole company. I've worked at three high-growth SF/Silicon Valley startups in the past 8 years and Turo is by far the best culture I've experienced.","Perks and benefits haven't kept pace with industry peers, 401K matching would be a great addition.

Guys, it's an extremely stressful work load and there is so much to learn to become self-sufficient. The training was vastly lacking, they don't really ease you into it... there was almost zero support, resources are hard to find and out of date, there is no consistency in policies or procedures. Seriously, you could ask 10 different people the same question and get 10 different answers... I've never had a worse job experience. I was consistently ignored by management, my teammates were abrasive and rude when I asked questions (not all of them, and not that I could really blame them, they were stressed out with heavy workloads too)! I had to ask over and over for a specific manager to supply login credentials for the systems needed to do my job -- I was there for about 2 months and still didn't get them all. Some systems would often be down or unavailable, subscriptions to services would constantly run out and would take days to get back up -- it was horribly inefficient, yet they pile the work on you which for a newbie required putting in a ton of extra time after hours and at home. I went to my manager on several occasions asking for some kind of constructive criticism on my work because I just could not keep up with the volume they were dishing out to me...  unfortunately, nothing ever happened but I was warned for getting too far behind. I finally had to throw in the towel and quit because I was just too stressed out and really just sick of the way I was being treated. I felt like an outcast, I felt like people were annoyed with me for bothering them with questions... The only excuse Turo has is they are a start-up and are experiencing growing pains... I probably could have put up with that if everyone wasn't so rude and short with me. And I'm not even sorry for saying this, but after working in the claims department for Turo, I will NEVER use their service. It's a nifty idea, but the way they handle their claims is really unfair.

256,Turo,Decent place to work but still lacking,2016-12-07,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Turo office is located in a good central location, close to public transit and Bart, developing company culture, weekly healthy snacks and beverages,","Operations management needs leadership training and development, often times immaturity and lack of professionalism was apparent, and favoritism was clearly displayed. There is no clear policy and procedure set at this start up which causes confusion."
257,Turo,Great team that is growing fast!,2016-11-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great transparency from the exec team. Really great culture - everyone is down to earth and supportive, but works really hard to build a great product.","As we've scaled up, it's been hard to keep up with all of the new additions to the team and I feel like I don't know everyone as well as I once did."
258,Turo,"Great environment, tough job",2016-11-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Many of the people are really great to work with (particularly most of the exec staff), and it's great being a part of something that is unique and gives back to individuals so much. The work can be difficult, which I like, and everyone puts in a lot of work and effort.","Turo is still often stuck in the start-up phase, at times, which is likely connected to how quickly we grew in a short time; communication between departments (sometimes within departments) can be very difficult, and need-to-know information sometimes gets lost as a result. This makes some departments suffer a lot more than others. Many of the employees don't know what other employees or even departments are working on, and it sometimes feels like we as an entire company don't have a unified goal. I've been here a long time, and this has been a constant. I feel like these are growing pains, and I hope we can get through them."
259,Turo,A great place to work,2016-11-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Turo is a great place to work. Careful and deliberate hiring is a priority for the company, which means that almost every single person hired is a pleasure to work with, skilled and passionate. Turo team members really care about making the product a success, but also understand the value of work/life balance.","For much of the time that I've worked at Turo, the growth opportunities have been somewhat limited. I think this is largely because it was quite small until recently, and so there just weren't many opportunities. Now that there are more opportunities I think it would be possible to grow, but it's still not clear how to do so."
260,Turo,Great place to work for,2016-10-28,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Very open culture, great room for innovation, growth personally and as a team.
No company politics and everyone is treated equally
Provides equity and stock options which is very good given that the company is doing awesome lately.
Very approachable management.","Would be great to have a 401K match.
Sick leaves and PTOs should be probably treated differently."
261,Turo,Solid choice,2016-10-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good company, huge market opportunity and lots of motivated employees.",Compensation could be more competitive
262,Turo,Great place to work!,2016-10-27,5.0,,Great product and mission. Awesome company culture. I love working here.,unfortunately there is no matching 401k
263,Turo,"Challenging and fast-paced, I love it.",2016-10-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"You won't be bored and you won't be over-worked. Expectations are high, but you are surrounded by smart, driven people who are always there to lend a hand if need be. The team atmosphere is strong. I arrive genuinely excited to work and the days always zoom by. I always feel humbled to be surrounded by people who are passionate about their projects. Inclusivity, mentoring and personal growth are top priorities.","We're growing, there's scaling and unknowns that come with that, but for me it's an exciting time to be at the company. There's a lot going on a one time, so you'll need to be focused to succeed."
264,Turo,It's really that good,2016-10-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Leadership team is very authentic and approachable
- Diverse, well-rounded group of coworkers that are incredibly talented and friendly
- Beautiful offices with all the typical startup culture perks

- Truly customer centric philosophy that puts our community first

- Monthly travel credit allowance to encourage everyone to actually use Turo (and many actually do as both owners and travelers) 
- Top notch benefits with most plans at no or very little cost to employees","- Still not a lot of name brand recognition quite yet 
- We're growing really fast so you've got to make an effort to collaborate across departments 
- Be prepared to work really hard, nobody has an easy job here 
- No 401k match but there is a great retirement savings plan and pre-IPO stock options"
265,Turo,"Great culture, rising star",2016-10-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The team is great and the culture is awesome. I've joined the company when it had ~20 employees and it has managed to keep the same company now that we are 10x this size. 

The work-life balance is great, folks are very efficient so you can deliver a lot while working reasonable hours. 

Finally, the company is growing very fast, which creates many growth opportunities for the team.",The benefits package has not evolved much since the company was smaller and less well-funded.
266,Turo,"Turo, an awesome place to work",2016-10-27,5.0,,"-The team is so welcoming and willing to help
-The management is accessible to everyone. On my first week I had the opportunity to have lunch with the CEO and COO (1:1)",None yet. The team really goes above and beyond to make sure you are welcomed and enjoy your time working with Turo.
267,Turo,"Good expierience, great for younger folks to cut their teeth",2016-09-04,4.0,Automotive Claims Manager,Great culture of fun and freedom. Turo encourages a work hard play hard mentality and knows how to keep people motivated.,Somewhat of a immature company culture. Quite a bit of disorganization and lack of direction.
268,Turo,Great company and an awesome place to work!,2016-08-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Turo is honestly the best place I have worked thus far. Everyone on my team is energetic and easy going. It is a really cohesive group that I enjoy spending time with in and out of the office. Other folks throughout the company are welcoming and happy to provide help or feedback. Unlike bigger companies, the development process is fast paced and open to experimentation. It's great to see designs being updated based on data and real user feedback.

The company is very transparent. I feel that I have insight into each departments goals and progress.  And to top it off, there is a great work life balance.","At the moment there is not a 401k match. It has been discussed, but there is no clear indication of when it will happen."
269,Turo,Excellent Company.  Great Propects,2016-07-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Like the CEO and the team.  Like the mission.  Great location.  Believe they will succeed in the end.,"Competitive environment.  Look at uber, lyft etc.  Also car OEMs.  Everyone and their cousin getting in the space."
270,Turo,Great place to work!,2016-03-15,5.0,,"Turo is an awesome company currently in the middle of explosive growth. It's a very exciting time to be a Turist! The culture is typical for a San Francisco start-up but with even more awesomeness. The company is very transparent, work-life balance is encouraged, and everyone is extremely friendly. I love that there is a flat org structure too. Everyone is working towards a common goal and there are no egos as you get higher up in the company. Andre (our CEO) can regularly be seen doing dishes or other work around the office. Leading by example at it's best!","No 401k match, although I hear that's being discussed? Not as many ""start-up perks"" as some other companies in the Bay Area, that's not a deal breaker a though."
271,Turo,"Fun, Fast-Paced, Great Smart Genuine People!",2016-02-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"* Awesome co-workers that are smart and genuinely nice people.
* Fast growing
* Great Benefits","The team is growing so fast, that it's hard to keep up with all the new names."
272,Turo,Fascinating & Friendly,2016-02-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Relaxed environment where team members pull their own weight and help one another all the same. Very mission-driven yet friendly. Proud to be part of such a great organization.,"It's getting bigger and bigger, which makes cross-functional work more challenging. But that's part of scaling such a complex operation."
273,Turo,"Awesome team, culture and mission",2016-01-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Many pros: the company's mission: putting the world's 1,000,000,000 cars to better use - not that many companies out there with such a compelling mission. The culture: very friendly, open, analytical, customer oriented. Always interested in improving and growing. The team: a great combination of smart individuals who care for one another and care about the community of users.",Best working experience yet - so no major cons
274,Turo,Great place to work,2016-01-28,5.0,User Experience Designer,"- The last two years at Turo have been fast paced and full of exciting change. Tons of growth lately and much more in the near future, but we've managed to maintain the positive atmosphere and culture that was here when I started. 
- You get lots of ownership over the projects you work on.
- The whole company is chalk full of talented people.
- A healthy work / life balance is highly encouraged and easy to maintain.","- No 401K match yet, but I have heard rumors it's in the works
- We're constantly outgrowing our offices (pro disguised as a con)"
275,Turo,Easily one of the best places to work in Silicon Valley!,2016-01-27,5.0,,"Its easily the most transparent, driven and friendly team I've worked with. It's at the right size as well where building bonds across teams is easy. The company spends a lot of thought on building the right culture. We don't get free lunch and dinner, and still I'd say this has better culture than 99% of companies because they focus on the right things. The business is solid and growing rapidly, and everyone likes working with each other. Upper management shares everything, and so it feels good to be part of a mission, and not just a cog in the wheel of executing someone else's dreams.","- I think we're not hiring as quickly as we should be, but we're actively trying to fix that.
- Lunch offered only once a week, but plenty of snacks, food and drinks
- No matching 401k program"
276,Turo,The nicest people I've ever worked with,2016-01-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This group of hard-working professionals is very likely the loveliest group of people I've ever worked with.  They are kind, thoughtful, funny, energetic.  There is a big emphasis on building relationships inside the business.  Every Thursday a free lunch is brought in for the employees and nearly everyone plops down at an empty seat regardless of who's already there.  Never seen as cliq-free environment as this.  I believe it comes from the executive leadership - brilliant businessmen and women, who prize collegiality and thoughtfulness.  Cannot recommend this place enough.","The only downside is that if you are new in your career, you will be spoiled by this place, and anywhere you go from here will be a manipulative political experience in contrast."
277,Turo,the real deal,2016-01-27,5.0,Claims Specialist,"I work in the claims department, and came from a very large auto insurance company. This is my first start-up and I feel like I'm on a different planet from my old job. I'm no longer an anonymous cog in a gigantic machine. Every day I feel like I'm making real contributions to helping build a great company.

Our claims department is growing, and I can't recommend this place highly enough for people coming from the auto insurance industry. Turo offers a great chance to escape the drudgery of corporate life. Your experience will be highly valued here.","Great benefits and rock-solid stability were what kept me at my old job for so long. There's no 401(k) matching here, but there are lots of free snacks and there's always beer in the fridge. Not so bad, overall."
278,Turo,CS is a Tough Place to Work,2016-01-27,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Open lines of communication, has positive vibe. Feels welcoming, great people. Great benefits.",Very little actually management. Only SOME management actually step in to do work of CS team and understand the stresses of position. Pay is VERY LOW for work demanded and done. Barely enough to live in Bay Area.
279,Turo,A little better all the time,2016-01-27,5.0,Software Engineer,"Having seen the company grow quite a bit over the years, I’ve seen the company go through some rough patches and try to find their way, but one thing I’ve noticed is Turo continues to become a better place to work every year. I hope they can continue this trend with the rapid growth we’ve experienced.

The engineering teams shift to Responsive Engineering from Agile Development last summer is a great example of the companies continual focus of improving process. I find the company strikes an excellent balance of empowering employees to make decisions and also fostering a collaborative culture that values outside opinions between teams. They regularly solicit feedback and – more importantly – actually take action to improve upon things that aren’t going well. This is rare and admirable quality to have at an organization, and I greatly appreciate my voice being heard.

The people here are really amazing. We definitely take our time with the hiring process, making sure that ultimately this is somebody I’d like to work with each day, and I think that’s a large part of what’s made Turo what it is. We are more forgiving for inexperience or lack of specific skill-sets if a candidate if eager to learn and passionate about our product. We have employees from all over the globe, and I feel like everyone has their own unique story to tell and interests outside of the tech world.

I also want to mention the incredible level of transparency the company provides into the business. I think it helps align everyones goals and understand that we’re all in this together. It’s kind of fun watching the revenue charts :)","There are some inherent difficulties with a bicoastal office, with some others working remotely as well. Relying on Google Hangouts for communication can be difficult at times, especially when the internet is being fussy, but it’s something we’re trying to improve. The timezone change is probably the harder part of this, which mostly just means you have to be careful when collaborating with people across the country."
