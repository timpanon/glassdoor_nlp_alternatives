13,Twitch,"Directionless, Incompetent Leadership",2022-03-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The Twitch community is robust, dynamic, passionate and caring. Getting to contribute something to a massive group of dedicated people is incredible. Twitch has been one of the most important things I've ever joined simply by virtue of that community, and becoming close to some of its remarkably talented people.","The leadership team at Twitch does not have a strong plan for success, nor do they have any of the passion that their community has. Emmet Shear, in particular, seems clueless and arrogant. In more than 10 years, they're still not profitable, and Emmet's only real plan is to focus on ads. But the only concrete step taken is to pressure creators to run more ads, despite the fact that audiences on the platform don't want more ads to be run. Putting pressure on creators to upset their fans turns off creators, and causes them to fear for their ability to continue streaming for a living. Even corporate partners bristled at being pressured to runs X ads a minute.
Even worse, there's the absolute refusal from upper management to address the company's serious issues with diversity. In fact, Emmet has been heard to repeatedly say things like ""diversity is just a buzzword."" There are groups within the company that meet to address issues surrounding various demographic groups in the company, be they racial, sexual, gender-based, etc... These groups would submit proposals to the exec team around what they saw, politely suggesting solutions to pursue. If Emmet saw the word ""diversity"" even once in the document, he'd lose his mind. If you replaced the word ""diversity"" with anything else, and submitted the exact same proposal, he'd take it seriously. 
The simple truth is that Emmet Shear is not competent to take Twitch where it needs to go. He deserves credit for coming up with the idea to shift Justin.tv to a purely gaming related service. It was a good idea. He hasn't a good followup idea since.
And don't even get me started on how often he would sit in meetings playing mobile games without listening to anything anyone said.
Outside of that, there's a reason that Twitch has now lost every single person who helped build the original platform into what it now is. Out of the first 10-15 people who built that platform, virtually none are still employed at the company. Even the COO, Kevin Lin, has left. The people who have come in to run things now are just MBA-bearing ladder-climbers who don't even watch streams, and don't understand streaming as a business. They don't want to, either. They want Twitch on their CV's so they can get a better position somewhere else. So long as the company keeps driving away from its community and toward this type of corporate psychopathy, it can only fail."

112,Twitch,"Good company to work for, but quit after 2 years",2021-04-13,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Twitch is an awesome product. The company is working on cool projects and employs pretty strong engineers. It is a great place to learn engineering best practices and do something impactful. You will shortly become an expert in AWS, too. Work and fun often go hand in hand: say, watching Twitch during the business hours and playing video games after hours is quite common. The corporate culture is centered around ownership and KPIs, which is both good and bad. If you develop a service that does not correlate directly with the KPIs, your next manager may tell you to find a new owner or decommission it.","My biggest complaint is about compensation policy, which Twitch inherits from Amazon. During the last 2 years of the 4-year contract the annual compensation consists of the base salary (which is rumored to have a cap at $185K) and 40% of the RSU grant. Given impressive performance of AMZN stock, this sounds lucrative. In reality once compensation moves into the bracket for the next level, the management is not happy about it. Those who get promoted see only little changes in their compensation and the new hires at the same level get a much better pay. On the other hand, if you are not promoted, chances are that a cheaper new hire will replace you right before your next RSU vesting. So IMO it does not really make sense to stay beyond the 2-year anniversary."

124,Twitch,A Rewarding Job with a Good Environment,2021-03-24,5.0,Software Engineer,"* A good amount of transparency and the ability to push back on things. Weekly all-hands meetings have anonymous Q&As, which helps hold upper management accountable and keep them grounded. It's simultaneously funny and incredibly awkward when an exec gets hit with a real hardball question on stream. Twitch also runs many different anonymous surveys throughout the year looking for ways to improve. These surveys don't pull their punches and suggest common ways Twitch fails at things and what people think about them. Lastly, Twitch itself recommends using Glassdoor, ironically, which is a nice change of pace from the industry standard.
* Compensation is good (at least for an SDE position), higher than I personally expected, and Amazon stock is a great stock to get RSUs for.
* The company's culture is pretty good. Most people are gamers, so there's a lot of talk about games. Generally, people keep things positive, and there's lots of memes.
* As of the last year or two, the technical pipeline for new systems is now very specific and has a lot of guidelines. Personally, I find this to be great, as it means there's less pressure in a lot of decision-making aspects involved in a new project. Additionally, the whole company being on the same standards means that there's a lot of experience and resources available if you run into problems.
* There's a big emphasis on inclusivity and diversity. The management doesn't always navigate these complex issues perfectly, but they do try, and they are willing to admit shortcomings sometimes. There are several 'guilds' here that employees can join that promote diversity and discuss concerns relevant to their group. (There's also more 'fun' guilds, like an MTG guild and a D&D guild.)","* Like many jobs, your experience can vary heavily based on your manager and your teammates. My manager is fantastic, and all of my teammates are great, so my experience here has been good. If those things weren't true, I can see how the same situation could be really bad.
* If you aren't a gamer, you may feel somewhat isolated by the company's culture because there's a lot of things you won't be able to relate to. I have a friend here who's in this situation.
* Social media pressure from Twitch users can sometimes be intense. There's often some kind of active controversy, usually over the decision made by a single moderator (in a company with a thousand employees) on whether to ban or not ban a certain community figure. This can spill over into personal anxiety, especially if you have friends who get involved in the issue. Most of the people working here will never have any insight into the moderation process, but that doesn't stop employees from getting bugged on Twitter in particularly bad social media flare-ups.
* If you need to interface with Amazon on an issue, it can take a staggeringly long time to get anything done."

Its like watching the self abuse of the Republican Party - stroke the ego of your leader and you will do ok.  Disagree with the Grand Emperor and get blacklisted and labeled a ""untrustworthy.""  It is at that point that management begins to make it as uncomfortable as possible for the individual so there's no real choice but to leave (if you don't already want to).    Individuals that get promoted are the ones with their lips firmly planted on the managers backside or have a bobble-head. 

""Values"" have been weaponized for daily use to justify bad behavior by managers.  Twitch Managers should actually read and attempt to invest in the values that get recited at every meeting like cult prayer.  Maybe if managers lead through example the staff might not need to be ""programed"" through repetition.  

Positional authority is the only measure of how correct someone's opinion is within Twitch (regardless of the information provided).  Leaders fly off the handle with ""hunches"" or ""educated guesses"" and then seek opinions that support their view (sound like a President you know?)  Confirmation bias over real information is the order of the day at Twitch and if you are not on their wavelength you will not be on the team.  Sad really.... but unfortunately is part of the game with ""engineer thinking.""  Meaning, ""I am smart about software so I therefore know everything.""  Grow up."

- Collaboration within the company is a weak area. Everyone's trying to work hard on this but there have certainly been some growing pains
- Compensation is a little too heavily indexed on Amazon Stock. Compensation adjustments due to raises or promotions largely come in stock grants which can take a couple years before you see that money - not the most immediately gratifying thing"

193,Twitch,Great company!,2019-10-16,1.0,Development,"Twitch is one of the 1st tier employers in the Bay Area. It's Number 1 in my opinion. It totally deserves 1 rating.

1. Every employees are provided with a headphone! It's allowed to listen to music at work, especially Pandora, since our new COO from Pandora brought so many old friends from that failing company.

2. There is no micromanagement from upper management. All middle and lower managers are given freedom to do there work. When there are conflicts between teams, we are trusted to find solution by ourselves.  Standoffs between teams are frequent. We are encourage to fight our way out. If we don't follow the rule and try to get the upper management involved, we would be ignored in the best case scenario, and berated in the worst.

3. Managers in different levels are given freedom to do there job. When we want to get rid of an employee, we can make up story and put them in the review without any issue.

4. Working in Twitch is a great learning experience for everyone. With years of experience in an environment with rampant politics, I am ready to start my career in politics. I could never do that in other companies.

5. Twitch is a subsidiary of Amazon but stays independent as a medium size company. It has the best of both worlds. For example, it has the Amazon promise-based compensation system. HR will tell you AMZN stock increase by about 17% a year. This is ingenious since this way employees feel like they are making more than they actually make and everyone is happier than they should be.

6. Twitch is a great place to make new friends! Team members are constantly quitting. Every year or two you are working with completely different people in your team! How wonderful it is.",Nothing I can think of right now.

Mid-level all the way up to heads/directors/vps. Lots of increasing office politics as more amazon or corporate experienced employees transferred over to the Twitch side. 

People actually doing the daily work were not well respected by people in higher positions, and lots of micromanagers in the marketing department. Really limited ambition and creativity- teams being disrespectful and left out of the loop from higher ups also caused a lot of grief. HR was often no help, and definitely knew cases where HR managers corroborated with people managers to let go off people for reasons that actually didn't happen. 

From the year I left, up until now- many employees that were the most passionate people have since left. Seems more and more people are there just for the paycheck instead of building a great community and platform."

The people are passionate about the product, focusing on success of both creators and viewers.

People have the best intentions here, collaborate and pitch in across teams to get stuff done and don’t just think about what’s in it for me. I’ve seen the land grab type of org, this is not that way. 

The hiring process is rigorous. If you get a job here you are smart and capable. 

The company has been growing incredibly fast and this has opened up opportunities for those who want to grow into new, bigger roles. I’ve promoted multiple devs to SDE II and SDE III and had an SDE become an SDM. 

It’s fun working with cool, nice people on a fun product. And yes, the new office is amazing and the food is off the charts.","Need more cross org shared dev processes and support.

Product and engineering teams work well together, customer support and partnerships are highly valued and have a seat at the table. Every team I’ve worked with has actually taken customer feedback seriously and work to improve things. I feel like I can change things that I don’t like.

I'd say Twitch is top 10% at _least_ among established bay area tech companies. Pay's strong if not top of class, talent is great on eng and product, office and work/life balance great as well.

219,Twitch,Varied based on Team,2018-10-08,3.0,Manager,"- Benefits and free stuff are all pretty solid.
- Eng culture seems to be on the up and up (a lot of negative energy seems to be diminished or gone)
- Amazon stock continuously goes up so your pay will follow that pretty closely
- Engineers work on problems actually at scale and will have access to hard problems 
- Full access to AWS technologies and support from the inside means you have access to play around with a wide range of tools and get good experience
- I was rewarded properly for high performance each year I was there

I worked with some really smart people who I learned a lot from and have made some really good friendships that I'll keep after leaving. Some of the best product managers and engineers that I've seen have been from Twitch.","- Some teams are just in really bad places with bad managers 
- Normal pay raises are lacking a bit due to increase in amazon stock
- Vesting schedule is really poor
- Org changes happen often, which seems to be how Amazon HQ does things, but maybe without the transparency and oversight

It really depends on what team you get placed on. I was on a high performing team for years and then got re-orged into a new team. My manager and I didn't get along and I left the company. I learned recently that someone had intentionally left feedback with my new employer hoping to influence them on my behavior (they were not part of a reference check).

After a few months I am seeing a trend: employees complaining about small issues and constantly thinking they are being underpaid. I might be wrong but it seems like the engineers/ IT staff are looking at Facebook/Google salaries, thinking they should be earning more, and  that they are doing Twitch a favor by staying here. Yes, the salaries should probably increase somewhat but Twitch is still a great place to work at. I really like my boss and my co-workers and I love health insurance and other benefits we have.

226,Twitch,Commitment not compliance,2018-09-25,5.0,Engineering Manager,"Working for Twitch has been the best amongst all the companies I've worked for.

It is not perfect, but Twitch has a lot of things down:
1. Working hard pays off. I've been at some job where hours worked matter way more than performance. Twitch values delivering and hours and location are pretty damn flexible.
2. Plenty of opportunity. Twitch has a lot of growth and mobility internally. Whether that is upward or lateral I've seen many people transition from engineer to manager, tpm to engineer. Product manager to TPM. PM to engineer and seen a lot of these people thrive. I've also seen people given opportunity to take on higher positions. These moves doesn't always work out but in many cases it has and it seems much less lethargic than at other jobs I've been at.
3. Leadership is smart. While Twitch has always had a lot of raw talent, lately we've been bringing in seasoned leaders that have both the talent and the experience to lead their worlds and inspire the rest. 
4. New kitchen is awesome, perks in general are great. Game rooms, unlimited food and beverages, arcade, massive lounge for you + guests (food + alcohol), flexible hours, unlimited PTO which people actually use, gym membership or variable random Twic health stuff covered.","1. The pay is in a weird spot where people who have been here for awhile are capped out due to the stock growth. Doing a good job doesn't have a lot of room for these long timers to be rewarded since they have no more room in their pay bands. This doesn't mean don't come here, it just means don't be afraid to negotiate with your recruiter. The more people that do the more likely these bands will finally be adjusted and everyone wins.

2.  Despite all of the above, people here sometimes complain about all the benefits. I'm not trying to make this a con is actually a pro. It is worth calling out though that we have people that are unhappy with the minutia of drink provided or when dinner hours are 5-6 (rather than 6-7 on all days except friday since we have a happy hour at 5) they post frown faces. This is a minority but certainly a frustrating one as someone who is blown away by the perks and food etc."
227,Twitch,Starting to Scale,2018-09-19,5.0,Software Engineer,Twitch is really coming into its own. Proper management and HR have provided much-needed stability after years of rapid expansion. Website scales well and technology has matured within AWS. Smart and talented people join the company each week from places like Facebook and Google. There's a bandwagon called e-sports and everybody is jumping on it.,"There's a little divide between ""old"" Twitch and ""new"" Twitch. New leaders are much more capable at our current size and scale and that's really upset some of the old leaders.

OK so the good stuff, pay is pretty good for non-tech people. I hear some tech friends complaining but it's probably hard to compare anyone against Google or Apple where they're printing money.

Most of the Glassdoor reviews are polarized, either Twitch rules or Twitch sucks. I'm not sure how helpful that is so here are two observations~
1. It's a product-driven company. CEO is a former engineer turned product manager. If you work in engineering, UX, or any function that directly contributes to product, you're highly valued. If you're in partnerships, customer support, marketing, or any other function you'll have a harder time getting things done.
2. Engineering quality varies massively by team. Some managers are running a tight ship and others just let their engineers do whatever they want. Seattle is corporate, Irvine is the army, and San Francisco is wild west.

If you're thinking of joining, great, if you like the team you'll be working with Twitch won't let you down.","Enough said, read the section before."
242,Twitch,Solid.,2018-08-26,5.0,Software Engineer,"Twitch has been consistently a good place to work since I joined. It's not perfect... ""cons"" list some problems.. but I'd would take this over pretty much all my friend's jobs who also work in tech in SV.

- Happy with my pay and benefits
- Company is doing well
- Amazon mostly leaves us alone
- Great new workplace (SF only)
- Smart coworkers, if sometimes immature
- Freedom todo my job the best way

Last point is pretty important to me. I'm not micromanaged. I understand others may feel differently about their teams and that's valid but it's not been my experience. I can say I've gotten better at my profession since I joined which is as much as I could really ask for.","Some inexperienced teammates have the best of intentions but wind up slowing you down, creating unnecessary controversy, Slack debates that go nowhere, and so on

The sometime road-to-nowhere project that gets dropped on us and then killed can be pretty annoying too."
243,Twitch,Bigger and Better,2018-08-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Twitch used to be this scrappy little startup where everybody did everything, Emmett was friendly and available, and everything moved fast (or so some would have you believe). Then Twitch got bigger, acquired by Amazon, and a bunch of people got upset about it and started complaining about “big company” problems. At this point, we’ve got strong execs, enough structure and stability to enjoy a healthy work-life balance, and a cool website to play with. Life’s good here.",Only real cons are the complainers. They’re mostly on their way out.
244,Twitch,Fake reviews by HR,2018-08-23,1.0,Software Engineer,"+ Most of the employees love the product and are very passionate about the product.
+ Some of the best engineering minds work on some very challenging problems here. 
+ Good amount of equity (if you survive long enough for it to vest)","Twitch is a great product that is being ruined by the work culture and blame mentality that is slowly creeping in from Amazon acquisition.

- Hire and fire culture. 
I have had several team mates who ""mysteriously"" left. There is constant pressure to deliver and I have heard lots of horror stories from teammates.

- No work life balance. 
Regularly see emails from managers on weekends. Most of the company is very young so family time may not be as important for some but if you are looking for a good work life balance then look elsewhere.

- Company is not invested in your success.
The stock vesting schedule is deliberately structured in a way which benefits the company most. You vest most of the stocks after 3-4 years. So its in your best interest that for the whole time you are employed there the company stock rises. But if you don't perform for whatever reason (family or health problems) good luck because they will just fire you. I know of so many team mates who are just suffering through bad work life balance because of the promise of receiving equity. 

- Product direction is lacking.
The company can't make up its mind on what it wants to achieve.

- No bonus if company stocks performs well. 
Like seriously? We are not going to give you any bonus this year because the stock is doing so great, so you already made a lot of money (on paper). Also, keep chugging at the work if you want to see any of this equity that we promised you when you joined but never told you that its going to be your bonus as well. LOLZ

All in all, this is an ok place to learn and earn but that would come at a price. 
I would recommend it if you want to learn a lot and you don't particularly care about work life balance or company morale. Most people who are passionate about the product have either left or are suffering while waiting for vesting schedule to hit so they can get some value for all the time they have lost here. 

Most of the 5 star reviews that I see here are most likely fake reviews given by HR."
245,Twitch,It's not just fun and games.,2018-08-22,5.0,Software Engineer,"Like so many others, I joined Twitch for Twitch - it's fun, semi-famous people use it, and I love video games, so why not? I've found Twitch is so much more though. It wasn't long before I started to like Twitch for new reasons - intelligent, excited teammates, great technology, and a culture of invention. I've found most people at Twitch to be super helpful and willing to pitch in for one another. I've had several opportunities to raise my hand and suggest something to build, and see it actually get built. I'm paid enough, benefits are solid, great perks like breakfast lunch and dinner in our new office, and work-life balance is pretty good, at least on my team. No complaints.","Seems some teams get a lot harder than others around TwitchCon, so that could be a downside I guess."
246,Twitch,Inspired,2018-08-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"My job at Twitch is flexible enough for me to work largely from home and keep my own hours, but I choose to join my colleagues in the office each day so I can do my best work with them. I’m inspired by our purpose, helping creators make a living doing what they love. Our staff and community are passionate gaming enthusiasts so it’s easy to find people who care deeply about the same things that I do. I’ve connected with my colleagues and my work here in a truly meaningful way. Sometimes the work is more interesting than other times, but when it’s good I’m really challenged and rewarded. Company is overall headed in a great direction and the scaling problems are opportunities to do better.","Twitch is growing quickly, both the site and the employee count. What worked 6 months ago doesn’t work today. Sometimes it’s hard to keep up."
247,Twitch,Had a Blast,2018-08-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I recently left Twitch after a pretty long time, to do something else that is exciting - keeping it vague. I feel like writing this review because of some of the recent positivity on Glassdoor. Twitch was honestly great to me. I respect Emmett and am thankful for his leadership, and I feel like the company truly cares about making its employees happy. I left Twitch a much better professional than I joined. I got lots of training and support and worked with a world class team, what more can I ask for?",There really are not any.
248,Twitch,Trending in the right direction,2018-08-20,4.0,Anonymous Employee,I love gaming and twitch and my job here gives me great exposure to the industry. I work with talented and hard working people every day on projects that actually affect the company and its direction. The work is at time stressful but I can work from home when I want to and basically set my own schedule. It's not perfect and there are definitely bad days but my overall experience has been a positive one.,"The lack of some c-level leadership is a concerning - especially the lack of a CTO, but my understanding is that there is an ongoing search for one currently.  The fairly recent COO hire has been amazing and we're heading in the right direction."
249,Twitch,Legitimately Satisfied,2018-08-16,5.0,Software Engineer,"Twitch isn’t perfect, but it really beats any other workplace by a wide margin from top to bottom. We have a founder-CEO who’s taken Twitch from an idea to a startup to an acquisition to a strategic arm of AWS and still sits in our (brand-new) office working alongside everyone in the company. We have strong female presence among upper management (CMO, COO, some VPs). We have managers who are subject matter experts and actually care for the people under them. I’m excited by the challenges of my job and I feel motivated by the people around me. The company has changed so much in the past 3 years that I barely recognize it, but I’m still impressed by the caliber of my peers.",Pay just isn’t on par with top tech companies in the area.
250,Twitch,Great for self-starters,2018-08-16,5.0,,"I’ve found opportunity is everywhere at Twitch, waiting for those who take initiative. If you’re self-motivated and willing to bring something intelligent to the table, you’ll be happy here.",The counter to everything above- I see some people drown trying too hard to swim in their own lane. It takes a village to scale a successful startup into a 1000+ person company in a couple of years. Team boundaries aren’t always a good thing.
251,Twitch,Glassdoor Reviews don't do this place justice.,2018-08-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you want to ship software that genuinely changes peoples' lives, Twitch is a great choice. It may sound silly but every week we hear from content creators who have managed to leave behind a job that made them unhappy in order to stream full time for their community. And if you're into it, we get great perks and good Amazon benefits. Comp is competitive, if maybe not out-of-this-world.

For some reason, some of our colleagues haven't been kind to Twitch on Glassdoor in the past. I'll just say that I'm happy, and so are all of the people that I work with here. After working for a big pressure-cooker tech company in a past life, I can say Twitch supports an amazingly positive and collaborative environment while still managing to get things done.","Twitch is trying to do too much, and as a result some teams seem confused as to how their initiatives fit in."
252,Twitch,Excellent Team,2018-08-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"When I first joined Twitch I was starstruck by all the big names and faces I got to support and work with. When the honeymoon ended, I realized I'm working with some of the best professionals in the world in a business that really cares about making an impact. I come to work every day looking forward to interacting with my team more than fawning over celebs.

Twitch has grown very quickly and there are a lot of new faces across all departments, which I really like to see. Feels like we're investing in the right things and leadership is pretty transparent about where we're headed. Competition in our space is heating up, lots of money getting thrown around, but Twitch just has the best product.","None to speak of, really."
253,Twitch,Industry Leader,2018-08-06,5.0,Software Engineer,"Video stack is truly cutting edge. There are not many jobs which allow you to push the boundaries of technology, this is one of them. I learned more at Twitch than I ever imagined and I'd happily work there again if I had to make my decision over again.",There really aren't many. Amazon integration is pretty thin and Twitch runs on its own. There was some dissatisfaction as I was leaving but it seemed to affect other teams more than my own.
254,Twitch,Very happy @ Twitch,2018-08-02,5.0,Engineer,"Engineering teams move quickly. There's no bureaucracy in the way. Engineers here care about quality of the product and code. Management is transparent about priorities and answer questions honestly.

256,Twitch,"Own a lot, learn a lot",2018-07-23,5.0,Software Developer,"My coworkers and I have a lot of responsibility here. I joined Twitch after working for a bigger ""brand-name"" type of tech company and I have learned more in the <1 year I've been here than I did in >3 at my last job. Sometimes it can be overwhelming because there's so much surface area to cover but I'm thankful for the opportunity to build more skills, for example I was mostly just working on backend before, but now I do full-stack and feel more comfortable on any project.

My manager shows interest in my development and challenges me with projects outside of my comfort zone. Senior engineers on my team and other teams are always ready and willing to help me when I need them to.

The business is doing well, and it's a really fun workplace with encouraging employees.","A lot of tech and practices aren't standardized across teams, so sometimes it's harder to work with other teams who don't speak the same language so to speak.

257,Twitch,Getting on the right Track,2018-07-21,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Free food and unlimited drinks and snacks.  Comparable perks and above average compensation. However, what excites me the most is the growth trajectory they are on right now after finally finding the right balance to monetize and make the community happy. That means growth in scale and size of the products, teams and engineering opportunities, with the backing of Amazon to make it happen. I feel now is really the best time to join if you have missed the pre acquisition opportunity as finally the leadership has started taking the issue of employees grievances seriously and making changes to gradually make it a better workplace for everyone.",A few pre acquisition employees feel entitled to only work on their own schedule and are just waiting for their last vest before they go. Good Riddance! Bad glassdoor rating from older days making it hard to provide the right impression to prospective new candidates making hiring unnecessarily hard.
258,Twitch,Over The Hump,2018-07-19,5.0,Software Engineer,"Twitch took a beating on Glassdoor over the past year or so. Some of the complaints are valid and have been addressed - for example, many leadership positions have been filled with qualified, talented people and the rest-and-vesters are rolling out. Compensation is solid and backed by AMZN equity. CEO is learning from past mistakes and no longer micromanages.

Twitch dominates live streaming and is growing with esports at a prodigious rate. Now is a good time to join this company.",Some toxicity from disgruntled employees continues to be tolerated.
259,Twitch,The most soul crushing place to work at,2018-07-18,1.0,,A rich history and highly committed community.  Decent work life balance.,Weak executive team starting from the CEO.

- Some colleagues are brilliant and helpful. These people tend not to be around for long. Learn from them while you can.
- This is not something I advocate, but work / Life balance can be really good, you can coast if you want, just look to any number of rest and vesters.
- Video games and tangential interests are common, so if you're into them, chances are you'll get along with lots of co-workers on a personal level.","- Any possible outcome for Twitch will not be because of senior leadership or middle management, but in spite of them. I genuinely  feel bad for people who think the leadership here is decent.
- People who want to build products from the ground up, and work on high impact things, beware: micro-managers aplenty, most of whom come from business backgrounds, and who do not understand the product and customer (but make decisions as if they do)
- Politics and heavy favoritism from under-qualified managers who consider themselves good. This is laughably bad.
- Re-org galore. Un-re-org galore. Re-re-org galore.
- Investment of time, headcount, and capital do not match what leadership pays lip service to.

- When numbers go up, no one knows why. (Cheers!)"

- Benefits are good.","- rampant sexism. Women quietly move away from bad orgs. Potentially not that different from other Bay Area companies, but still pretty obvious here. 
- Managers are often times not people managers, they've just happened to migrate up into their role. This is killer, as those skill sets don't particularly overlap and  ultimately your manager has a huge stake in not only your career advancement but your personal well-being."
264,Twitch,Not too big to fail,2018-06-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Unlimited vacation, free food and drinks.","Management of the company is just terrible. It's a mixture of the old guard from pre acquisition who are terrified of losing twitch core users, so won't take action on really awful harassment and safety issues on the platform, and new hires who are too busy giving their friends soft landings to actually understand their users. We've had 3 reorgs in under a year, and none of them has made a positive difference. If you don't currently work for Twitter, you probably won't have a chance at success at Twitch."

The partnerships team is an absolute joke, they let random employees do the hard work by proactively reaching out to creators with good numbers on other platforms. When you walk to the partnerships side of Twitch HQ, you might find half the team playing catch in the walkways or standing in the corner talking about last night's overwatch league match. When working with any team in Twitch, expect deadlines to be pushed 2,3, even 4 times. The company has been a train wreck that plays favorites for way too long."

270,Twitch,Twitch has so much potential,2018-05-16,5.0,Senior Engineering Manager,"Twitch is an incredible company. The culture here is awesome. Twitch has a culture of delegation and collaboration. At the IC level,  there's little politics and you're given full ownership of your work. If you can do it, or convince someone else to do it, you're given the green light. There's no artificial limit. The hierarchy is flat. Engineers have a lot of power to drive things, make decisions and influence products.

It has all the other perks you could imagine: free catered food, physiotherapists, flexible hours, work from home, unlimited PTOs, higher than average compensation. 

The brand is loved by its users. The product is fun to work on, and the challenges are always there. 

The CEO loves the company and is very transparent, it doesn't feel corporate at all here.","At the management level, there's more politics. The right choices are not always taken. There are a few senior employees that are obviously demotivated that are just waiting for their restricted stock units to vest; they bring the morale of a team down and should be gotten rid of.

Because the company has grown so much in little time, there are a few systems that have no owners, there are a few processes that are unclear.

The CEO  has the founder syndrome, so there can be attempts at micro-managing certain team decisions. I don't think he realizes he has this power, so just something to be aware of."

-Management team is completely clueless. CEO, CFO, CMO and COO foster teams that rely on fire drilling with little to no stability. There have been several reorganizations, and with each one, it becomes more clear that the leadership team is lost.

-No accountability all the way down the management chain. Twitch doesn’t reward/punish people for achieving or missing their goals, they just continue to focus their time on creating new goals for the following year.

-There is no career development at Twitch. Most employees that have received promotions have done so through playing politics and becoming the most useful firefighter. Twitch does not have a culture of merit based compensation/promotions."
274,Twitch,Constant changes and lack of stability,2018-04-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Twitch has fantastic perks such as free food for breakfast/lunch/dinner/snacks/alcohol, free massages if you can jump in on the schedule fast enough.  They do offer some competitive salaries for the game industry but maybe not against other tech companies but I wouldn't compare them apples to apples anyways.  AMZN stock keeps skyrocketing which has helped a ton.","The company has constant re-orgs. I think last year alone a few teams received 2-3 different re-orgs.  With these re-orgs come goal changes and immediately the focus for the company ends up switching from one product to another in a matter of weeks and it's hard to figure out what you need to aim for for further growth in the company.  Growth is fairly stagnant due to this and they tend to hire in people as opposed to promote within.

The company also has a little bit of a clique problem. A lot of old guard who have been there tend to sway their influence around and they also have a lot of embedded pockets of friends.  New management is coming in so hopefully it addresses it as some are on their way out but it's odd to eat lunch and see how teams never sit with each other and eat and instead they sit within their own teams only."

282,Twitch,Stay away from this company,2018-03-17,1.0,Software Engineer,"Home to many gamers. If you are into video games you can easily find someone who plays the games you like. Twitch offers perks that are similar to any other tech company, however these perks are getting worse and worse.","The problems really start at the top of the ladder.  There's way too many inexperienced directors who are only in those positions because they were pre-acquisition. Twitch really should have hired these people from outside.  Another issue internally is racial bias. Yes, while we claim to support diversity and inclusion, it is pretty obvious that the white male is superior in this company when put side to side with people of color.  I want to be clear that it isn't intentional racism. It is the fact that most of the people who hold higher positions are white males and white males naturally see other white males as superior.

Another con is the lack of job promotion opportunities.  Managers seem to be very easy on promoting somebody from L4 to L5 just to inflate their stats about their supposed promotion numbers. L5 to L6? good luck with that.  You're better off at a different company if you want that to happen. L6 to L7? yeah that's only happened to one person in the entire company the past few years.  For those without context, our levels are L4-L7 where L4 is a new grad hire and L7 is a staff engineer. So if you see yourself as an L5, just turn around and use Twitch's offer as a way to negotiate with other companies.

Lastly is the way directors run the company.  They are very narrow minded and are clearly inexperienced. They are way too black and white on something. The way they talk makes it seem like it is always either one thing or the other.  If this then that.  They think when any single person complains about something, it is invalid because it is just ""a few people speaking very loudly"".  If they have not heard feedback from a good amount of people it is not a problem to them, but rather a few outlier individuals having a uniquely bad experience."

Perks.","Culture is horrible and really unprofessional. I feel for the HR department here. There's a constant battle in the company of Old Twitch vs New Twitch (+Amazon), but coming from someone who's seen successful, functioning companies - Twitch needed a change. They can't retain new hires and employees are constantly resigning. Many of the events that happened at this company would not fly at any respectable Tech companies. Their in-work chat is extremely hostile and exclusive. It was a real let down, because Twitch spews this constant mantra of community - but don't let that fool you. There's absolutely no inclusivity for the most part, and any attempts made I've seen constantly slandered as a joke by the dominant bro-culture. 

Most people who enjoy working here were insiders from the start, or already part of the Twitch Community in some form."
290,Twitch,"Not perfect, but overall great place to work",2018-01-31,4.0,Senior Systems Engineer,"I've worked at 4-5 large tech companies in the Bay Area, and when I started at Twitch it totally blew me away. The perks were better than most companies I've been at (Snacks, Swag, Gear, Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner), and Twitch had a diverse mix of talent- super smart senior engineers, as well as new interns and college grads. The scale of the stack we run is insane, at a scale that only a handful of companies operate at, including Google and Facebook. I can't speak for other parts of the organization, but my manager is very laid back and gives us a lot of freedom to achieve our goals.","Since I started, things have shifted and many older employees are on their way out as they vest stock. Some of the perks, like swag, have diminished quite a bit, and some frustrating IT processes have made life difficult, either in the name of security or for management reasons. The tech debt has started to catch up with us, and we spend a lot of resources troubleshooting incidents and replacing old systems.

However- despite all this, I have a very positive outlook on Twitch. We are growing at a rapid pace, and Twitch can deliver insane amounts of video around the world and does this very well. Twitch also has an amazing community and culture that is 100% grassroots, and not artificial and forced like it is at places like Facebook. Also the compensation is good, and you get the benefits of working for Amazon (Stock, etc) without a lot of the downsides that they have. It's the best of both worlds."

There is a decent chunk of smart, driven people who are fun to work with. (Whether they will last or be able to drive change in this environment is another question.)","The culture here is really toxic and downright exhausting. Really draining for all parties involved, I think. Newer additions see the existing structure and tech stack as a mess and pre-acq employees as non-contributors or incompetent, and those who have been with Twitch for longer are disappointed with the culture change and dilution of the product/content. This could be mitigated by strong executive management, but the executive team is simply weak, and often contributes to the problem with decision whiplash, constantly moving goalposts, frequent re-orgs and a preference for gossip and finger-pointing over directly tackling issues. The CEO himself is the source an overwhelming majority of the time and it just trickles down from there. 

The mess is exacerbated by a near non-existent career development or HR structure to reward successful employees, or even provide basic help for those who are suffering. (Stories of people waiting years for promised role changes are common.) Employees' only recourse is to leave or get extremely apathetic and lean on the flexible work policy."
292,Twitch,"Twitch is a great place, which went through a rough patch",2018-01-20,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Our biggest problem (at least on our team) is that we have a vision to build systems and tech much larger than today's, and the problem set is hard. It's rare to get to work on technical problems like this as a day job.

- Amazon honestly is very lenient on us. We get to choose our tech stacks, tools, methodologies, etc. Their approach is not a top down one where you are told which  CI system or tool to use. There are teams building support systems, and as an engineer you literally own your destiny and pick the best tools for the job.

- The amount of freedom we have in terms of proposing projects that actually happen is really good. We have practically no restrictions on equipment and tech resource availability. The amount of freedom to pick and use open source or AWS resources is really, really good.  As some one who  worked in the past at places penny pinching, or where asking for compute resources were months long requests to finance, this availability makes me super happy.
 
- The company does listen to feedback and take it seriously.  Management actually cares about people and give priority to this. There has been a lot of movement lately to actually address pain points brought up.","- Office coffee leaves much to be desired.

- Late 2016/2017 were rough. We suddenly got a TON of external competition from heavy hitters (youtube,  facebook). The company went gung-ho on features and catch up, which was hard but necessary. We are in a much better spot today, but it was hard on people.

- Twitch had a mix of legacy systems from the justin.tv days, along the newer ones. Literally the whole company spent last year a large amount of time to work on the very unsexy problem of cleaning debt. This was also hard on everyone, but we got rid for the most part of massive chunks of tech debt. 

- Some parts of twitch do suffer of ""not-invented-here"" syndrome. We could leverage more external and amazon's tools, which will free up time to work on other larger technical challenges."

I wasted countless hours hunting down tests that failed for no reasons in poor or non-existing staging environments, in code that was a mess, with only a few over-taxed senior engineers who had any clue how any of the mess worked. I've worked in lots of startups and tech debt is a normal part of the game but there comes a point (like, for example, when you sell to Amazon for a billion dollars) where you have to really invest massively to dig yourself out of the debt and build an actual, professional, system.  They haven't done this; doesn't seem like they are even trying.

Lots of management and org changes, which make it difficult to find your footing and grow vertically.

Internal communication and transparency is terrible and inconsistent. Some orgs are better about communicating to the rest of the company than others, resulting in a lot of disorganization and chaos when timing is down to the wire. A lot of folks don't read or pay attention to what was discussed or agreed upon, which make it difficult to keep progress going.

Conflicting corporate values between ""Twitch"" and ""Amazon"" can make it challenging to figure out what standards to operate and hold yourself against.

Twitch is a place that changes all the time. Our roadmap is a solid roadmap based on the current reality. This reality can change very quickly.

If you work on certain teams you also get Amazon stock as part of your overall compensation package. The office is a nice place to be, there's a bar, gaming PC's and space to just generally chill out. 

Almost everyone that works there genuinely shares one of the same passions as you (gaming).","Boy, where to begin. I'll just talk about the important things from my perspective.

Management. The first thing that is noticeable are the pre-Amazon employees are almost all managers regardless of any actual skills (or lack of) they have. Oh, they are also in a clique which is impossible to break into. That probably explains why they are all managers. Because of this Twitch is what i'd call a 'fat' organisation - the headcount over the past 2 years has exploded as legacy employees managers realized they couldn't do the job and needed to hire people ASAP. No wonder Amazon has come in and seems to have put the foot down - hiring has definitely slowed. I've never seen a company in more need of a serious restructuring. Too many people doing too little - there's whole teams that seem to get in the office around midday and leave before 5pm. 

Absolutely no career development. I'm not joking here either, and i'm not over exaggerating. As a multi year employee we've only just started to get a structure together for a comprehensive development plan for employees. My weekly meetings consist of me asking if there's anything I can do better or work on, the answer was always 'you're doing an excellent job, just carry on doing what your doing'.

Oh about working towards that promotion? Just keep working and we'll see. 

The management has no real direction - I'm guessing that a lot of this comes as a symptom from the lack of management from the top. Issues that arise take way to long to be identified and acted upon until it's too late, then the inevitable finger-pointing begins."
304,Twitch,"Some severe problems need fixing, wait till they blow over",2017-11-28,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Twitch, at least in the beginning, attracted several talented folks in both product and engineering who are passionate about gaming and streaming. It feels amazing to be surrounded by people who understand the same gaming subculture as you do. Non-gamers who join are often quickly converted into enthusiastic gaming supporters and find their own preference (whether it be MMOs, shooters, fighters, platformer,  mobile games, or even boardgames). 

If you're an IC, the work/life balance can be good and having unlimited vacation is nice. 

There are also the catered free food and snacks, gym perks, commute perks etc. 

Finally, you also get to impress other gamers when you tell them you work at Twitch.","As previous reviews have pointed out, Twitch is not in a good place at the moment. Senior management has not shown strong leadership or consistent decision making. This, together with the immense growth and urgency Twitch has experienced in the past year, has led to a lot of frantic scrambling in the company. There are too many proposals, too many directions,  too many sprawling goals and far, far too many voices in the room. Having upper management re-enforce discipline and central strategy to get everyone in line would be nice, but the execs are too inexperienced and/or overburdened (our exec suite is short staffed) to handle this.

If you're a manager (whether it be tech lead or director), you will find it hard and stressful to plan, and to maintain a workable roadmap for your team. In Twitch's struggle to find ANYTHING to boost KPIs, teams are trying out ideas left and right, often dumping sudden workloads on other teams in the process, and leaving the projects half-finished.  

Company morale has been tanking, and people are left stressed and anxious. I highly not recommend anybody join until the leadership and coordination problems are fixed."

There are a lot of passionate, smart, and hardworking people at the IC level, reminds you what you're capable of doing every once in awhile- wish those people would get recognition more.","Leadership is a mess. Many are not in alignment with each other, and their lack of shared vision (which is a company value) trickles down and affects the people actually carrying out daily work. Leaders and those in managerial or positions of power are quick to blame their teams or other teams. Or they don't own up to their lack of management and leadership skills. Goals don't seem to match up  between teams, or even within teams, which makes it confusing to get work done. People with lots of experience but no people or team building skills get promoted into management. Poor communication almost everywhere, makes for a really difficult and frustrating work environment. Almost makes me not have fun with gaming anymore because the work environment turns me off. Also, heard employees get away with unprofessional behavior/misconduct. HR and senior management should pay attention to those issues as well- not just productivity and minutes watched or whatever the next KPI is.

History has shown that Twitch is FAR more likely to promote from outside than from within. It's disheartening and we continue to lose brilliant, good-hearted people as a result. They are the smart ones that took control of their environments by leaving.

Depending on how stagnant your manager is, prepare to have little to no mind paid to your professional development. Engineering more or less follows Amazon's leveling structure, but with more hurdles. Anecdotally most non-engineers don't have formal leveling guidelines/expectations.

The HR department has been the worst of my career. When pressed, we're fed empty promises with a smirk. Virtually the entire HR team quit/was fired recently, and I'm wary of the ones that remain. Most do not feel comfortable working with them, let alone trusting them. I'm sorry for you lone decent ones, as the majority have besmirched you.

Toxic culture around management and executives. Executive reviews often go off the rails and our leaders get petulant real quick. I rarely see genuine moments of humility. Instead its posturing, ego-trips. Also, and I hate to bring it up, but many of them are quite unhealthy, and its reasonable to question their mental/physical capacity to properly lead some of the brightest minds in the industry. Not the shining exemplars you'd hope were at the helm.

Many of us would prefer Amazon just completely take over.
If you're still keen on applying, definitely do research into the specific managers you'd be working with. There are some awesome ones, notably from post-acquisition (surprise, surprise)."

Many if not most core employees at Twitch, including managers and directors, have never worked anywhere else. It shows. Twitch decided to triple in size before investing in a solid foundation built on tooling, DevOps, quality control, and building an engineering culture.

Twitch does not have an engineering culture. When most people talk about culture at Twitch, they're talking about the food.  

Writing code is not engineering.  A lot of people don't seem to understand this. You want documentation? A knowledge base? Best practices? Mentoring? Some standard kind of bug tracking or requirements management process? Tests? Local development environments? Staging environments? Continuous integration? Forget it. Forget all of it. There's variation here on a team by team basis -- some are better than others -- but that just underscores the point that there's no *coherent* culture across the wider engineering org. It's chaos.

As a result of this lack of coherence, not just every team but every project ends up spending 60-70% of its engineering effort on deployment, monitoring, alerting, and metrics. Everything is bespoke, and there is massive duplication of effort all around. Every project and every line of code written only makes the situation worse than it already is. God help our skeletal DevOps and systems teams.

An enterprising individual could write a whole new antipatterns book based entirely on case studies taken from Twitch. The executive team has no understanding of how software development works at scale."

Weirdly, the solution seems to be to throw more PMs at an issue.

- Exec team feels completely misaligned. Everyone works in their own silo and if something goes wrong, there's a lot of finger pointing and ""it was his/her stupid idea"". It makes people question whether or not they even know what they're doing, but this problem is also attributed to having...

- ...a straight up terrible Chief of Staff/program director (?) who the majority of the company has no idea what she does. The way people talk about her is truly laughable (especially during review and OP1 seasons), and she's supposedly Emmett's right hand. Things include ""just do what she asks"" regardless of how ridiculous it is because she gets so unnecessarily belligerent. Get someone in place who can actually assist in running a tight ship and be a good mentor, and who is less concerned about appearances.

- HR is cliquey and straight up gossips about personal, confidential employee information.  At least try to be discreet about it.

- Management has no idea how to grow their employees within the company given that we have to follow Amazon guidelines that are incompatible with Twitch. There doesn't seem to be any move to adapt promotion guidelines to our needs."

Kudos to recruiting/hr for posting 5 star reviews on a regular basis to keep the Glassdoor rating afloat","Twitch used to be a great company to work at.  Too bad the CEO and the executive team has turned a great company into a dumpster fire.

There is no long term vision for twitch.  The executive team just care about hitting their numbers, on this meaningless metric called ""minutes watched"" that doesn't actually mean anything, can be be easily gamed, and doesn't drive value.  They're so desperate to hit their goals that they've resorted to shady accounting of minutes.  Every single month half of the company gets sucked into these mbrs and wbrs, and while they're good concepts, the goal for these at twitch isn't to actually report what happened, but to write a narrative that changes every single month to pretend we are actually doing great while in reality most things are terrible.  This way amazon can be confused while the execs inch their way another month closer to their next vest.  

Zero product vision.  Micro-managing CEO.  Zero long term thinking or strategy.  PMs can't establish their own vision for products, instead they become mere puppets for the CEO, who is far too deep into the weeds.  Wish he would give the PMs the freedom to decide the color of a button and instead focusing on actual important things.  Incompetent executive team (70% should be fired given the performance of their orgs).  Ineffective communication due to the changing requests every week/month.  Good people leaving left and right.  How this company is still being run this way for this long is beyond me, but I expect significant changes soon."

Work super hard and never be appreciated because what you're working on isn't Emmett's idea.

Teams are hemorrhaging  people, yet people prefer to chalk it up to ""just a few disgruntled employees"" rather than attempting to fix the problem. Recruiting even tells people to go and try to drown out the bad glassdoor reviews with good ones. Nice joke.

-Our People/HR team is wholly incompetent. Not sure if this is because they don't know how to do their jobs, or if they're just a mouthpiece for Amazon HR. Either way, they're under serving Twitch to the extreme. This is most evident in the absolute lack of career development or planning. No one knows how to get to the next level.

334,Twitch,Management focuses on results instead of building a great company,2017-09-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The core product is awesome and the Twitch community loves us for what we do. It feels great to enable thousands to make a living while doing what they love. While the company culture has dissipated over the years, it is still generally a fun place to work, and most people who work there are passionate and cool. Vacation policy is lax, benefits are great (although relatively standard for a SF tech company). If you love video games and nerd culture you'll probably enjoy working here.","We hire new product managers all the time, yet lack a unified product vision. Even with our small army of product managers, it seems as though our CEO and one or two close to him make almost all major product decision. Products commonly launch feature-bare, often lacking some of the most basic functionality you'd expect. This is a result of extreme pressure from management to launch as many features as fast as possible in hopes that it might improve minutes watched. We launch too many bad products because of this. 

We lack a strong culture. There is no true north to set our gaze upon. No lofty ambition to help people express themselves and build community with our platform. As far as I can tell, Twitch's sole purpose is to grow minutes watched, by likely impossible (or at best unrealistic) margins month over month, year over year.  That's not sexy or exciting or inspiring or making the world a better place. This extreme focus on metrics has caused us to make decisions that don't benefit our users.

Career development is a struggle for most. Twitch is more ready to hire directors and VPs from outside rather than promote those with institutional knowledge from within. I can't tell you the number of times I've been asked to submit a proposal (""OP1"") for where I'd like my team to grow, what roles I'd  like to hire for, and what we'd like to accomplish in the next year, only to never even see a shred of meaningful feedback. The next year, you're asked to submit another OP1 with 0 retrospection as to the previous year's lack of movement. This has happened not just once or twice, and has left me feeling as though I've stagnated in my personal career, and failed my direct reports as a manager.

Inter-departmental communication is poor. Very few teams (outside of science) share updates, leaving little opportunity for feedback, collaboration, analysis of successes/failures, or simply patting eachother on the back for work well done. Even though I've been at the company for many years, I still don't believe I have the avenues to pitch new initiatives or give feedback on others. Even worse, on more than one occasion I've had to deal with newly hired product managers or business unit owners making substantial changes to products and areas my team owns, without my consent or even advanced notice. How does this happen you ask? Because of mandates from upper management pushing a product or idea because they think it will drive minutes. Recurring theme here."

Product Managers design almost exclusively around the pet ideas of our CEO, rather than our users, and this is highly encouraged by our executive team. (""Emmett said we had to build X."") Executives who have continually made big bets that have failed miserably are rewarded with larger teams and more power and influence.

We very badly need to hire more experienced executives that aren't afraid to get their hands dirty. This includes an honest evaluation of the skills and effectiveness of our current senior management. I understand those currently in power were in the trenches together building the company, and that they have a history, but turning a blind eye to the inefficiencies, skill gaps, and performance management problems that are rampant throughout the company is hurting everyone. In some instances, the roles have grown beyond the skills of those who hold them. Acknowledging this and gracefully addressing these issues would be a much better outcome than hoping that senior leadership can slowly gain the needed skills through trial and error or osmosis.

The next two quarters may be riddled with departures if more aggressive measures aren't taken to address our lack of autonomy and product direction.

The leadership did not set clear goals for teams, which resulted in a lack of coordination across different verticals. The distributed approach to development without clear goals caused issues with quality control, thrashing, and improper team scaling. It also meant a lack of central tooling, where multiple teams were recreating solutions for the same problems. 

On the management side, the senior leadership did not communicate well, had trouble delegating, and did not provide cover for employees. The main way that exec communicated with the company was through all-hands meetings, which means that things are not written down and on the record. Some of the exec team also gets too involved in details rather than delegating tasks to their teams, even though there's been a focus on being in more experienced managers.

Frequently these releases have key features (or sometimes even central features) removed to hit deadlines.

Twitch is not a meritocracy. Leadership/management are largely in place based on personal relationships with higher-ups. So, don't expect a lot of growth unless you're in good with someone at the top. Managers act untouchable and do or say whatever. If you object or don't go along with it, prepare to be in the doghouse forever. 

Like someone else said, there's an emphasis on partying together, and if you're not down for that, you'll be labeled as ""not a team player,"" no matter how much you deliver in terms of work.

You'll be locked in a four year contract in order to get all of what you're worth to them.  Odds are you won't want to stay here that long, so keep that in mind when first becoming lured by big numbers and shares of delicious Amazon stock.","Take everything you think you know about Twitch from the outside and shoot a paper basketball of your expectations and predictions into the nearest trashcan.  Odds are you're not just off the mark in your assumptions but frighteningly misinformed at no fault of your own.

It is far more corporate and far less exciting than what Twitch Chat would imply...well, unless you're into chaos and juvenile internet behavior in a work environment.  It's also important to remember that less than 25% of the workforce at Twitch has been at the company for more than two years.  

It's starting to get ugly here.  At its core - and you'll see this in many other reviews - you'll notice that when employees talk about ""culture"" at Twitch, they're really talking about the office design and free food.  No, really.  Take a look at the reviews on Glassdoor and notice how few define their co-workers as anything outside of ""[being] gamers.""  That's because Twitch, since their foundation, spent years hiring notable gaming personalities and ""friends of friends"" and is now a hierarchical and bureaucratic nightmare. 

Working hard and wanna get promoted?  Good luck!  The majority of the managers in place have either been hired from the outside onto teams who've been collaborating for years, or have been close allies and friends to the executive team prior to the acquisition by Amazon.  This has led to an impossible journey to promotion for most so expect the title you start with to likely be the one you end up with regardless of tenure.  Or if you're ""fortunate"" they'll change your title to something lofty if you put up enough of a fight with HR.  As you've probably read in other reviews, this is running rampant within the company and most people have obscure and meaningless titles of seniority.  You'll very commonly have meetings with multiple VP's and Director-level employees only to find out that none of them hold decision-making power.  

Combine this hierarchical mess with interdepartmental disorganization and you have a company focused on ""growth"" at the expense of anything resembling a meaningful or healthy work culture.  Most teams regularly converse about the fact that Amazon is encroaching a takeover of Twitch because of just how damn messy things are getting here.  It's getting so bad that we've lost several business relationships because of how slow our legal and finance teams are at getting contracts executed and payments submitted on time."

Free lunch, snacks and expense accounts are good bonuses.
There's some great people here (along with not so great people).","Becoming more and more like Amazon to please Amazon overlords. Freedoms are already being restricted. Several loops and back and forth for the simplest of expense reporting. In a few years I see the free snacks and lunch being greatly restricted and reduced in quality (they have already started it by reducing snack vendors).

I would only recommend to engineers. They are the ones more in the Twitch protected bubble and being in SF will likely to be the last mans standing for privileges. If you work corporate you are likely not going to enjoy it as much unless working at Amazon type environment appeals to you. If you are looking for a small business mentality look elsewhere. They also do not have landlines for individual employees so be prepared to put your personal cell phone on all your emails.

Managers are for the most part incompetent so many boosted titles because they were there for the takeover. I have never seen so many directors with no one to manage in my life. Granted it's a problem with lots of small businesses that boom but their ability to manage people is seriously lacking for the ones that do have them. Also because so many were there pre-take over there is definitely a clique and they will step over you, lie, etc in order to secure their positions and maintain status quo of their clique and ranks. I have had high up managers tell me to keep secrets from other managers. 

I was also able to see behind the veil on how they treat popular streamers and they treat them like spoiled children who get their way regardless of what they do. These streamers are considered independent contractors so it's actually just an EEOC case waiting to happen there. I would not want to be in a position to deal with them or be apart of any fallout that comes from that so I would beware if you are looking for a partnerships role as you will take the bullet for your streamer.

Whoever wrote the review that working at Twitch is like Twitch chat is spot on. If you do decide to work here keep an eye out, be savvy and come to work everyday prepared to play the corporate game. Beware of those that smile in your face as they will be the ones to stab you in the back. Diversity is seriously lacking as well.

369,Twitch,Obsessed with making employees happy,2016-05-21,5.0,Engineer,"It's very clear that Twitch believes the best way to have productive engineers is to make them happy. I'm often asked in 1:1s for feedback, pain points, and general well-being. My managers have been very transparent with their own goals in managing and I feel comfortable bringing up anything on my mind with my manager, even touchy subjects.

Twitch has done a great job keeping its startup gaming culture after the Amazon acquisition -- playing games at your desk is commonplace. Where another company may have employees walking by say things like ""Games in the middle of the day eh?"", Twitch employees instead come at you with ""What deck you running?"" or ""WHAT A DEAD GAEM"".

On the business side, the company cares deeply about broadcasters and it's refreshing to see business goals align so well with making users happy. Risky products that we're unsure about often go through talks with broadcasters for feedback, and the Partnerships team has gotten really good at facilitating these connections. I feel proud to work at a company that's so well-loved by its content creators.

Emmett is one of the smartest people I know and I could listen to him talk for hours.

Twitch employees are very open to ideas, arguments, and being wrong. Dozens of times I've joined into an ad hoc conversation I overheard and within minutes directly affected a product with my input.

The postmortem culture, in most areas of the company, is well-intentioned and blameless. Problems don't often come down to ""I screwed up, won't happen again""; they correctly go beyond that into ""together we've built a system that allowed a screw up to take down the site; how do we fix that?"". Some areas of the company lag behind here -- the video team's culture is infamous for being isolated from the rest of engineering and its ideals, for better or worse -- but in general it's good.","I said above that Twitch has kept its startup culture, but there are other things that it hasn't kept. Initially, Amazon was completely hands-off with the acquisition, which was great. But very, very slowly they're creeping into the scene, needing to approve all compensation adjustments, wanting to build coordinated products, Amazonifying all Twitch laptops, teaching us about interviewing, requiring periodic security training, getting Amazon badges and turnstiles, etc.

Each case individually isn't a big deal and is backed by good reasons (lots of these are ""we need to fix <scaling issue> and Amazon already has so let's use their solution), but I can't deny that over time it becomes more and more apparent that we're an Amazon company whose large decisions need to go through our friends in Seattle. For now this doesn't affect me a ton, but I imagine within a couple of years I'll be ready to leave for something smaller."
370,Twitch,Amazing place to work,2016-05-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Awesome office and they really provide a space where you feel welcomed and creative.

371,Twitch,Twitch is passionate about their product!,2016-04-19,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Great perks, great people, exciting work. Twitch is filled with people who really care about the product they're building, and that makes the work all that much more worthwhile. It's great to be part of a company that is transition from startup to a larger company; Amazon provides Twitch with support, but Twitch still retains the culture that made it unique in the first place.","The company is going through some growing pains, but overall they have been relatively smooth. From an engineering standpoint, the biggest hurdle is digging through legacy code that nobody seems to know about, since all of the people that wrote said code are now in management roles or left the company after the acquisition."
372,Twitch,One word: Awesome,2016-04-18,5.0,Network Engineer,Great company doing great things. Love everything about working here. Could not ask for a better company to work for IMO. Sure the work is hard and plentiful but what real job isn't if it's worth anything.,I don't care too much for San Francisco or the commute everyday (not that Twitch can do anything about that). Other than that no problems for me.
373,Twitch,Unsuccessfully Dealing with Corporate Puberty,2016-04-13,2.0,Network Engineer,"Some incredibly smart, motivated people work there.  If you can engage them you will do amazing things.  Dogs allowed in the office, which is incredible.  Support staff and contractors are hard-working and friendly, and the office is in a convenient location.","I relocated internationally for a job at Twitch.  Unfortunately the company was moving and hiring so fast that I got sidetracked into fulfilling a need that was not really what I do, and I'm not particularly good at.  I was yelled at a lot for not being particularly good at this thing that is not what I do.

Inside of the company is middle management hell.  Emmett Shear is probably the smartest person I've ever met, and his corporate values are incredible, but they functionally don't exist.  Middle managers have different agendas from other middle managers and sometimes these stack and are opposite to each other.  By the time said directions reach workers it can be impossible to know which to follow.  On more than one occasion I had been dealt with harshly by my manager for following the directions they gave me.

The reality is that everyone's so afraid of the culture being warped that they hold things very close to their chest.  If you ever raise a problem in someone else's department as Emmett specifically instructs, prepare for trouble, abuse, and people lying about you to your manager.  I grew more depressed, made worse by the fact that the food made me sick almost every other day.  I stopped eating with the team to avoid diarrhoea.  This sounds like a joke.  It isn't.  I discovered some less-than-ethical behavior and tried to see if perhaps there was something I'd not understood, and instead was treated with disdain.

This company will set you up for failure and then make it your fault when you do.  It was utterly disappointing and an incredible yet awful experience.  My volunteered time raised tens of thousands for charity, helped professional esports teams reach their goals, and spent as much time as any broadcaster was willing to input working with them to improve their show.  But the time spent after work not wanting to speak to or see anyone from being burnt out more than overcame that.

Not working at Twitch is an great feeling, and it's very conflicting loving the site and userbase so much but having the back-end running of an organization be so depressing.  

When people read this (and I know they will, having seen people publicly mock negative glass-door reviews of current employees), if they figure out who I am they will find ways to disregard this feedback by personally attacking me to invalidate the experience.

Maybe there was a time when Twitch knew who it was.  Maybe Emmett's ideals existed when there were 20, 50, 100 people.  At 500, they haven't for some time.  Overall, I guess it was a good experience, in the way that terrible things sometimes are for the roller-coaster they put you through.

While there are many good things about the company, I cannot in any good conscience recommend a career here - only a job.  No Kappa."

393,Twitch,Gamer's paradise. Professional's nightmare.,2015-11-02,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Without a doubt, Twitch has incredible perks.  You'll notice that by and large most of the reviews from other employees speak to this characteristic of the company, and that's because it's an obvious and great part of working here.

Compensation is solid, although prepare to sell your soul for several years in order to receive it.  Your contract will be front-loaded intentionally under the premise that Amazon's stock will continuously rise and make up for any scheduled decrease after the first few years of employment.  Thus far, this has proven to be true, and Amazon's stock continues to grow rapidly, often accruing employees small fortunes.","Despite all of its perks, and as a few others have mentioned, Twitch suffers tremendously from disorganization.  Internal teams barely communicate with each other, and when they do it's often unclear who holds decision-making power.  Executives are out of reach to employees and are the only people with authority to push projects forward.  Because of this ambiguity, prepare to be included in emails with six to eight other co-workers only because the sender doesn't know who's doing what internally.  

The office management crew do their best to try to create a culture of unity and bonding, but employees stick to who they work with almost exclusively.  There are broad and well-known undertones here that certain internal teams are nightmares to work with and should be avoided.  This stems from fast-paced, friend-focused hiring that has left the company with an army of gaming celebrities, and one weak of assertive, efficient professionals.

It is a culture of Kool-Aid drinkers; one which prides itself more on the rarity of its hoodies than its willingness to openly acknowledge its mistakes and inefficiencies.  This is a company built on the innovations of its users and not on the innovations of its employees...not because its employees are incapable, but because they are not empowered to do so without sifting through the weeds of  bureaucracy."
