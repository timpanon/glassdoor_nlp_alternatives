They cling to old outdated rules and lose talent as a result. The pay is great but I'm being offered better comp by startups with lower valuation and lower profit.

The CEO seems truly invested in the vision. 

The direct teammates you work with are all usually very friendly and supportive but that's mostly because you are all suffering through it together.","The HR leadership is more concerned with scoping up more slices of the department pie than actually investing in the company and the employees; which is heartbreaking considering it's the HR department.

It was incredibly political and at no point did I ever feel like people assumed good intent. I have seen leaders be put on PIPs without any intention of actually intending to help them improve and clear acts of gender and racial discrimination with no follow-through from the ER department.

Truly sad, as this company has such potential."

People are very passionate about the role that Twitter has in society, and while there is constantly a lot of public backlash towards the leadership around critical decisions, internally, I think that there is a lot of trust in the expertise and intentions of other teams.

As an engineer, I feel empowered to work on projects that I think are valuable and interesting without feeling entangled in internal politics. Twitter was one of the first companies to really devote themselves to WFH, and the transition was essentially seamless, since Twitter was already shifting towards remote work. In addition, there are ""Flexible Work"" opportunities, where employees can request to temporarily or permanently work out of approved locations, which is quite amazing.","There are frequent re-organizations (every 4-6 months?), and while you learn to roll with the punches, it makes it difficult to plan out longer term projects, since staffing & priorities end up changing.

What it's like inside: Deeply mission driven, all the way down. Smart, kind coworkers, earnest and caring mgmt. Not a good place for sharks. Incredibly committed to equity - I've never reported to a more diverse leadership team. The good news is the cons are well known (growth, revenue, velocity). These are huge opportunities if we can unlock them. Mgmt has listened and hired heavy hitters at the exec level, who are filling out senior leaders 2-3 levels down. Doing the right things in terms of big bets and velocity too - just need to stay the course and accelerate. For those comfortable in chaos with experience scaling companies, this is a really interesting time to join.","A late bloomer, Twitter often still feels like a teenage startup in terms of process chaos. Some healthy grumbling as we mature and processes change, but Tweeps are a remarkably good natured if talkative bunch, and we take our vitamins without being toxic."
352,Twitter,Na,2020-12-04,4.0,Senior Vendor Management,Freedom to work on projects of your choosing.,Lack of transparency around salary scales/bands.
353,Twitter,Color of your badge matters,2020-12-03,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"For the most part your colleagues and your internal stakeholders will be fully transparent with you. Making the shift from in office work to remote was also incredibly smooth so kudos to leadership for taking that shift in stride. If you are an FTE aka a blue badge life is great. There was job security throughout the pandemic and days of rest/ holidays and of course the all important unlimited PTO which you could use for mental health days, sick days, etc.  unfortunately if you didn’t have a blue badge, life at twitter is quite different.","As mentioned above if you are not a blue badge aka a full time employee (FTE) and are instead a full time contingent worker (40-45 hours/week for a fixed term) life isn’t great. First and foremost Twitter identifies contingent workers with green badges instead of blue. All in all not a big deal but people do take notice. Additionally Twitter encourages everyone to show up as their authentic self. This is some what laughable to those of us in the green badge ranks because if we show up with anything less than perfection (regardless of circumstance) you are cut loose. For example, when the pandemic started, everyone was told we would not have layoffs or pay cuts. That was true for blue badge employees but for those with green badges, if your contract expired and you were doing well, you were still terminated. (This was amended later to contract extensions but no conversions but a lot of people lost their jobs). Additionally I was sold on working a contract based on being able to work 45 hours a week with 5 of those hours being over time aka time and a half. When the pandemic started I along with my other contingent colleagues were told we could no longer work 45 hours but we were still expected to produce the same metrics. This essentially forced us into a pay cut of almost 20%. Again not something our FTE colleagues ever had to worry about. Twitter encourages everyone to show up authentically and to take care of themselves but when you are not given paid time off (literally no vacation) and are in a constant state of anxiety over whether or not you are going to hit your metrics it’s tough to show up authentically. I work constantly and I’m always scared if I’m next to be let go because of the color of my badge. If you have a blue badge you’re golden but definitely don’t join if they offer a contract to hire role."

They embrace, perhaps even over-embrace inclusion (meaning its in your face constantly). 
The food quality has gone way down over the years but hey its still free food. Same goes for snacks.
My particular VP was pretty great, some downsides I mention in the Cons.
Pre-IPO equity was great.
Great Parental Leave Policy 5 months, though I never got to use it.
Great vacation policy. Unlimited.
Men & Women are paid equally!","They only try and promote 15% of the people a year, meaning on average each person gets an opportunity for promotion every 6 years.
The pay they claim is at 75% of Market, but its really closer to 60% I believe.
The Leadership care more about what is going to be discussed at their staff meeting than what is actually going on in their team. Each staff member has hired a second in command that literally makes all the decisions which are often mis-guided.
The HR team is crooked. Literally! Besides the fact that they are leaving and flocking out in masses, they are quick to be emotional and not working to really solve any problems, instead they just want to throw money at everything in their org except the people outside their org.
I know more about what I'm doing than my manager but they are older so presumed to know more.
My leadership does not back us up. I actually complained about someone to HR and their leadership based on my direct reports request, they heard about it and then counter complained. They got promoted and I was lectured about partnering when I was backing up my team.
There is a double standard for everything!
Most of the good people have left, so most who are left point to everyone else and say ""not my job"".
My manager literally is lackluster. No back-bone. Nice person, but still makes me have to give into everything or i look bad because I know my manager will give in.

There is no faith left in HR to see any accusations of unfair treatment by management through. Additionally, the sales org has truly lost sight from what is important in building a strong team with great culture.

589,Twitter,Great place to work,2018-05-05,5.0,Client Partner,Twitter has been an amazing experience so far. A lot of places put mottos up on their wall but don't back it up but Twitter is a place that most people truly #LoveWhereYouWork. It's a very open environment where they give you the best chance to succeed and people work together to get the job done. And the perks (especially the gourmet breakfast and lunch and snacks) can't be beat. Plus the Maternity/Paternity policy is amazing,"Like most jobs in sales, Twitter is a place that continues to moves the goalposts further the better you do and the forecasting process isn't one that allows you to be aggressive and still make a lot of money. Like most companies, there could always be more resources.

WORK/LIFE BALANCE is a true focus here.  My teammates and I don't do well at our jobs because we put in the most hours.

614,Twitter,The best place I've worked,2018-03-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Culture - The teams that I worked with both directly & indirectly were always very helpful and supportive in helping you to get your job done efficiently. There was a real team spirit that existed across the sales team. 

Benefits - The company invests in it's staff. Twitter tries to create a comfortable environment in which their staff can thrive 

I was proud to work for Twitter. It's name always garnered a positive response from the brands that I worked with.","Progression - Due to the high standard of staff, there was a bottleneck for promotions into more senior roles. This meant there was high churn of talented staff once they reached around 2 years in the company."
615,Twitter,Ad Ops Support Specialist (Contractor),2018-03-04,2.0,Ad Ops Support Specialist (Contractor),"For anyone interested in Advertising Operations within start-ups & bigger tech companies, this role provides really good introductory exposure to the general processes & terms.  

As far as general perks - the company also has free breakfast & lunch with 3 different cafeterias & a huge variety of food (which obviously doesn't hurt). 

To be transparent, I think just having the title ""Twitter"" listed on my resume was the most I gained from this job (which is saying a lot because I worked there for a year).","Management wise – I think there’s a pretty strong lack of communication & clarity throughout the Ad Ops department on a lot of different things. Going into this role, I assumed that there would be a very in-depth few weeks of training on the entire system of Twitter’s Ad Ops Department, as well as the products they supported. Instead, it was turned out to be 2 days of very general/vague Powerpoint slides, accompanied by the popular slogan “just mess around with it”. After those 2 days of training, it’s like they just assume you’ll learn everything else on your own. This may work for some people, but definitely didn’t seem to be the most productive method in my opinion. Since I started, I think the training process has improved with new Videos they’ve implemented, but I think there’s still a really difficult learning curve for people coming into the role largely caused by the training process not being as thorough as it can be. Managers & Superiors will often say you can always ask them if you have questions, but from my personal experience, I sometimes felt like it became obvious when you broke past their patience level with one too many questions. And again, I think the need for new people to ask so many questions in the first place could be prevented with a much more thorough training process.

As far as the culture of the Office, I think there’s one gigantic elephant in the room: the Contractor vs Full Time Employee (FTE) distinction. Going into this role, you begin as a Contractor employee, meaning you work full time (40 hours per week) but you’re paid hourly (rather than salary) & don’t receive as many benefits. From my own time here, I think I feel pretty confident in saying that the majority of people really don’t want to be a Contractor employee. Most (if not all) people would prefer the FTE title if eligible. However, it never feels like anyone in Management is proactively looking at your potential & recommending you apply to specific FTE roles. They never mention any current FTE openings or offer any constructive feedback about what’s needed to be an FTE. You really have to do it 100% on your own. They estimate that around 1/3 of employees eventually become eligible for conversion to Full Time, but I only noticed a very small select few that this occurred for during my time there.
 
Speaking from my own personal experience – I only received positive feedback on my work during my time there, but was still never recommended an opening for an FTE role or personal advice for how to progress professionally. This sometimes just made it feel like you were working a thankless job, where no one was really noticing what you were doing. And a lot of the FTE work was 100% in the scope of Contractors to be able to perform once given sufficient training. One could even argue that some of the work processes you do as a Contractor are just as challenging as the FTE work. Thus, it essentially creates a feeling where the work space is very clique-based dividing Contractors & FTEs. Management frequently say that they appreciate your work & everything you do, but in the same breath will explain that only FTEs are eligible for certain perks/outside of work events."

Immediate managers were, for most part, great people as well - with varying degrees of greatness. Benefits were average.

They talk about people being one of the most important assets, but when it comes to real action, the upper management has zero sympathy for its employees. You're just a number. Go somewhere loyal, where the company actually cares about you. When they laid off people, they kicked them out the door like an old dog. Not even as much as a thank you.

Upper management is a joke. Jack keeps sitting on two chairs. Easiest fix to stock troubles would be to resign from Square. Noto took a ridiculous amount of money when he joined. And they had the audacity to vest all his stock at once ""just to help him move to SF"". Disgusting.

Too many good people left in the last 1-1.5 years. The trend will continue - they will keep bleeding talent. Some people go *back* to the companies they left to join Twitter - how bad is that??!?

Decent tools and IT department, though engineers complain about them. Twitter has a surprisingly mature internal tool stack as compared to other companies and many people realize this after they leave.","Management is overly political, which shows that they are not good at anything. Especially higher management (Sr Directors, some VPs), who have fired people they did not like, hired and kept favorite people around and have made this very obvious to the entire organization. If they were any good, at least they would do this without making it very obvious. Senior leadership rose to that level within 12-18 months and since they have no idea how to scale gracefully, they fail.

Just hoping that some of the political people Sr Directors/VPs left behind are fired soon so that Twitter can be saved."

881,Twitter,Learn from industry experts & ship to millions,2015-12-04,5.0,Software Engineer I,"Work life balance. They treat you well, first and foremost. From vacation to stipends (Gym, Massages, etc) they really make sure you have sustainable mental & physical health for continued employment.

Everyone is very rigorous. This can make things slow moving. This can be frustrating. But you'll only ship the highest quality code, and you'll grow from these high standards. This leads to a cleaner codebase & some grey hairs.

I feel like I can talk to anyone at the company. Every team is always willing to drop everything and help you out. The entire company feels very transparent - from the glass meeting rooms to the opportunities to ask the executives anything, in front of the whole company. 

They really encourage continued education. They'll have tech talks, tons of classes to learn ANYTHING, even weekly courses on Improv & public speaking. A programmer can take a class that introduces them to product design. I designer can take programming classes. You can have a yoga class upstairs between your meetings, for free. 

Any equipment you need to do your job well, is yours. Little justification is necessary. They want to empower you.

There's endless food, daily froyo, and a few happy hours per month. Some are INCREDIBLE, with bands, adult moon-bounces, etc.

The culture. There are so many fun people here. The mailing lists are hilarious. People love the product, love the impact it has on the world, and love the fun it can bring as well. The employees really believe in the core values here.","Some people take this generous treatment for granted, and leave. It hurts to see your friends at work move on, but that's how this industry is. Good memories were made and cool projects were shipped.

I think diversity initiatives have gone a little too far here. Suddenly there seems to be disproportional amounts of women getting hired into management. I think diversity is a good thing but it feels very, very forced. Some women teamed up (after the ""Frat party"" incident) to push alcohol out of the workplace entirely. It wasn't 100% successful, but is scary that people team up to kill culture. No more happy hour beer pong, and most floors are now void of the cute beer fridges. Let me assure you, they weren't abused. They were mostly used on Fridays after work, or after shipping something cool as you watch the results & feedback stream in. Work goes on, but it's now missing the spark and edge this place used to have. It's matured and not caters to a few whiney old people who wave the PC & diversity wands. 

I think the hiring bar is dropping. Although they say we only hire very passionate people, many have argued to hire people that didn't even bother to sign up before flying across the country for the interview. That brings me to my next point. Some non-passionate people were hired for their intelligence but not their personality or passion for the product. They're the minority, but they bring in some likeminded people who don't talk much.

There is also a lot of bureucracy, and some managers have way too many direct reports. It's easy to get lost between the cracks, and easy promotions could get dragged out forever.

Stock is down. Wall Street needs to realize what Twitter is about, why Facebook is jealous, and how to empower Twitter. Measuring DAUs and other social network stuff isn't the best. Or so we've been told."

887,Twitter,Great service; good engineering experience; bad middle management,2015-11-29,2.0,,"I got to work with some very smart engineers and learn new technologies and ways of doing things I wouldn't have been exposed to working in a smaller infrastructure.  The company has a lot of employee-friendly policies - high-quality meals, work-from-home once a week, remote workers, etc.

The service itself has the potential to greatly benefit society - it gives a voice to a single individual that can be amplified to millions.  It almost seems there should be a non-commercial version of Twitter as I feel its that vital.

Richard Costolo was also someone that was inspiring and easy to follow.","My particular department was run by someone who had joined Twitter during the fail-whale era and he helped stabilize and greatly expand the infrastructure.   He was someone that was very easy to talk to and allowed the engineering staff freedom and empowerment to get their job done. 
  
However, as the company grew and went public, he decided to hire former friends from past jobs as middle managers.   All of them came from older, traditional companies -  all interested in their self-advancement, biding their time to continue vesting stock,  avoiding disagreement with upper management, saving face at all costs, etc.  They created a toxic environment of favoritism, hiring cronies, fear of doing anything innovative or long-lasting, keeping the status quo.  It was amazing how little was accomplished for the size, talent and seniority of the team and how long I was there.   There were many engineers that were ghost employees - either long-tenured individuals that worked remotely and only for a few hours of a day.     Every quarter the teams decided their goals for their quarter.  Most of the goals chosen by the middle managers were not necessarily the work that needed to be done but instead the work that could be most easily done.   This left gaping holes throughout the infrastructure that only got attention when a crisis would emerge.

The only saving grace was there was some very strong engineering leaders who eventually became the de-facto management of the department.   They identified the problems and came together with plans to solve them."

893,Twitter,Mediocre and political middle managers,2015-11-14,3.0,Software Engineer,"Great perks, mostly good engineers, some cool technologies to learn and work with. I joined Twitter several years ago, when there were a lot more opportunities than now, and was able to design and implement something new and cool enough, that made a significant impact.","I was a tech lead in my group and made many contributions to several projects. I got a second salary rise, the management once again told me how awesome my work is... and ten days later, I got laid off. After that, several engineers from the group wrote me privately that they are shocked by this decision, that my productivity and overall impact was exceptional, etc. Make your conclusions.

I can confirm what others have already said: at some point the company started to bring in a lot of middle managers from outside who turned out to be not very competent at best and political at worst. As a result, I've seen, in particular, cases of groundless criticism of hard-working people and apparent favoritism towards some lazy ones. Engineers who did almost no work for months and were ""in meetings"" all the time, were nevertheless treated with respect, asked to write one useless design proposal after another, etc. Seeing all this, young and dynamic guys with a proven record of success would leave the group and eventually the company, while the management would happily hire twice more of new, less experienced and energetic people."

Twitter has a huge management problem. Every team is in its own silo, thus creating a lack of internal coordination about efforts that is palpable when you find yourself duplicating work someone else is already doing. Managers encourage this 'silo mentality'. 

Priorities change and are defunded overnight, despite all the work and cost. I've seen many colleagues' projects being finished after a year, even when they are close to completion. It seems to me like middle and upper management discuss these things for months but don't tell anyone (talk about transparency). Then, one day they will announce it and expect you to move on. It wouldn't be unusual for them to schedule an off-site around this time as an opportunity for you to show you're on board. Get drunk, smile and carry on.

People who have received promotions are definitely not qualified to get them, but they do whatever they are told and that's enough to get you one. It's insane: I've seen people change jobs internally two and three times a year just because their VP trusts them and nobody else.

Lastly, there is no product vision. When big projects fail, they don't acknowledge it."

They hired me only to let me go shortly after in their recent reorg. Shows the lack of planning and forecasting which is consistent throughout Twitter. Jack's leadership style is to do what he is told by the board/investors - he doesn't really take a stance but constantly claims he is transparent. Twitter is a very chaotic organization - lots of teams doing a lot of the same things with 0 communication between teams, nothing is streamlined, no clear processes, no clear understanding on what to build your strategy around as upper management seems unclear themselves and to be frank too worried about their own jobs to truly coach their team which made it hard to know what it is I was supposed to be focusing on.

The day of the reorg email access to those being canned was cut off prior to people being notified that their jobs were being eliminated. We definitely were not treated in the ""respectful manner"" as Jack promised. HR was a nightmare to deal with, nobody had the answers and we were tossed around which is another typical Twitter trait. Nobody wants to own anything. You are constantly thrown around from person to person when you have a question and people sometimes just don't respond to you at all for months as there is nobody holding anybody accountable. No sense of urgency. People roll in at 9-10am every day and leave by 5pm and hardly anyone works on Friday. And they wonder why the company isn't doing well."

Now that the layoffs are over, the executives are all out recruiting, which makes no sense to anyone.
Layoffs were pushed up due to the timing of the Square IPO. That's incredibly disrespectful to the people let go.

- Lots of potential for impact as Twitter recognizes need for important changes to respond to slowdown in user growth. The lack of guanranteed success of the company highlights importance of the work you do, but this can obviously be a con as well (see cons)

- Open communication is reflected even in higher management: CEO and staff meeting notes are public to the company, etc. On personal level, communication about which projects you want, career goals, etc. is encouraged and taken into consideration, which is great (though obv. dependent on engineering manager as well)

- Competitive compensation and good perks","- Terrible experience with recruiters, I was almost forgotten about early on in the process until I got curious about what happened and followed up. Bear with this, it's worth it if you're not planning to work with recruiters constantly. 

- Lots of negative press about the company was scary in between signing offer letter and joining, not guaranteed success in the space.

Every week, we hear scores of news stories about how Twitter played a part in changing something, helping people recognize some truth, or just help people have fun. People here are smart, but also relatable and compassionate. I've been at other big tech companies that had super-smart people, but they were much more unapproachable or prone to hole up in their work and not socialize. After DickC's departure, management seems to have really rallied around one another, which in my view is 100 percent attributable to Jack's leadership and moral authority. Management leveled out expectations with Wall Street after Q2, which caused short term pain but gives us runway to succeed in the long term. And yes, the food is awesome.","- Changing the external meme will take time and hard work. Don't come here if you just want to rest and vest.

There are different challenges every day and plenty of opportunities for me to give feedback into Twitter/TellApart's future products and processes.
The team is the best I have ever worked with...full stop. TellApart's bar for new hires is extremely high, but that has made the environment extremely positive. There have been plenty of blog posts regarding Twitter's ""morale problem"" but it's generally overblown.
There are also too many perks to mention. In general, we are VERY well taken care of.","There have been quite a few shake-ups in senior management, but for the most part this hasn't affected my day-to-day. I am still optimistic about Twitter's future.
Twitter/TellApart is not a place for people that need to be told what to do everyday. You should consider Twitter/TellApart if you lean more towards ""asking forgiveness rather than permission"" mindset.

- Some engineering teams (particularly revenue, platform) seem to have their act together and are capable of progress. 

- Work-life balance is pretty good. I rarely work more than 40 hours a week. I often work from home.","- Execs and senior management have no freaking clue where to lead the company. The executive team has seen almost 100% turnover in the last year -- there is now literally a different group of people leading the company. Most executives and managers are young and are in high level leadership positions for the first time in their careers, and predictably have no idea what they're doing. 

- There is no legitimate product strategy for user growth and retention, other than unfounded optimism that something might happen. Good ideas appear every hack week, but none of them make it into the product. Teams are encouraged to A/B test everything and have to show overwhelmingly positive metrics to ship to 100%, even for the most common sense stuff. This all results in a mediocre product that doesn't change and shows no forward progress. 

- Career growth as an engineer is very difficult. Getting a promotion involves excessive groveling to higher-ranked engineers who are not incentivized to help anyone besides themselves grow. The title you get when you join the company will probably be the title you have when you leave."
953,Twitter,Smart Driven People,2015-07-29,3.0,Account Manager,"Twitter hires innovative, intellectual and motivated people, it is them who makes the working experience awesome. The culture and leadership combined really empower the employees there to put their best efforts forward to keep the company going.

The continuing innovation with the products and what marketers are doing to leverage the platform is better than ever & will continue to improve. The company offers such great perks, from free meals, snacks, celebrity sightings, happy hours, crossfit, yoga, and much more! If you're looking for great culture and leadership, this is where its at!","Any company that is growing rapidly has areas that need to improve and one thing I'd like to point out is the growing pains of it. It's not just one thing that needs improvement but overall, processes that need to be put in place to make work more efficient. Not having to go through multiple avenues to look for one answer."

- Community outreach programs and internal diversity initiatives

You get to work on a product that has significant global impact, you get to do it with generally awesome people, and you're treated very well. Twitter genuinely promotes a culture and espouses a mission you can be proud of.","- Myopic, disorganized, and gutless eng/product leadership
- Opaque promotion process which was actually worsened through improvement attempts
- Miserable open office space is a constant source of distraction
- Serious, quantifiable issues with lack of equitable treatment of women and minorities, especially in eng, that the company does not seem to be taking seriously
- Most executives refuse to accept responsibility for mistakes and shortcomings, and make a mockery of an ostensibly transparent culture by dodging hard questions at all-hands meetings

The root of the problem is that good leadership at Twitter is lacking, both at the executive level and within the engineering and product orgs. There is not a shared clear, consistent, and bold vision for the future of the product and the company, so much as there is focus on making incremental changes to engagement/revenue metrics and spinning numbers to appease the Street (logged-out, anyone?). Most infuriatingly, few C-level and other members of senior management take responsibility for shortcomings, or provide real answers to hard questions raised by employees.

I have watched Twitter flap for over a year with little progress, and now, understandably, investors are becoming angry. Costolo served as a scapegoat for Wall Street, but the truth is that he was very capable, and will be difficult to replace."

There is no coasting at Twitter. Although the leadership team has a strong plan to re-ignite growth, it may take some time for revenue to materialize and the stock to recover. There's also always a few growing pains at companies growing as fast as we are, so employees are expected to navigate an environment with some uncertainty.

This feeds the diversity problem as well, but the problem day to day is that managers and the company as a whole do not respect or reward all of the other talents that the great people working there bring to their jobs. They are just constantly criticized for not matching some idealized model of the ""perfect engineer"".

From doing ""feedback"" for other organizations I know they have a similar process, where it's more about tearing people down than celebrating their contributions.

- Mediocre middle managers who know little about the technical aspects of the team or the projects. Due to constant reorganizations, a lot of the managers are assigned to teams or projects that they have no technical expertise in.

- Lack of product vision. Suffer from extreme short-sightedness to boost MAU and revenue number to satisfies Wall St.. Lurching from crisis to crisis and stuck in a vicious cycle.

- Over-reliance on AB testing to determine which features to launch, sometimes in the expense of user experience. Features launches are delayed due to unfavorable DDG results on certain metrics even when the features are clear improvement for customer experience.

We test a lot of fast-moving projects - many opportunities to expand responsibility, take the lead on situations; I learn something new almost every day, decent transparency from management; parallel and supporting teams are very open, friendly, super helpful amongst themselves and each other.

Emphasis on work-life balance - you're expected to work hard and always be expanding your capabilities, but the culture is really social, and most people seem to maintain interests and a life outside work.

Benefits and perks 
- GREAT food and beverages for all 3 meals and snacks, (dinner is not as over-the-top, but still pretty great). 
- Health Insurance very comprehensive, monthly fitness/wellness stipend, cell phone plan, 401k (with an employer matching program - I need to look into that). 

Location: middle of SF = great for folks not super into living in SV/Peninsula (or commuting there). CEO & company culture really emphasize community service, company-wide volunteer days each quarter, lots of clearly highlighted opportunities to volunteer more often, plenty of options to fit a lot of different employees. Twitter Inc. donates funds, tech hardware, services to many local programs; holds events, trainings, and functions at the office regularly; and just opened an official neighborhood ""nest"" and training/learning center in our offices!

Also love that our CEO doesn't sit sequestered in an office if he doesn't have to - he's out and about walking our halls, checking in with people, saying hi to everyone...I value that quality in a CEO/boss.","- Many colleagues can come off as immature, low EQ, poor team dynamic; many don't seem to realize how many opportunities are here for career dev IF you're willing to work for it and prove it - wondering why you don't get a promotion 2 months after being hired is ridiculous. Have seen more than 1 person get upset when a more pro-active and thoughtful colleague is selected for a leadership role or given recognition - it doesn't just happen, people! You have to get after it! 

- Strong work ethics, competitive natures, powerful minds, and fast pace are great, but can also combine at times for ridiculous competition and insane expectations (i.e. mgmt increasing workload by ~20% while telling employees they're expected to work same hours - so no overtime has to be paid??); 

- Managers/Supervisors can get overworked from above as well - team benefits less from a manager's awesome leadership skills if he/she is just running around putting out fires. Some test/pilot programs should be scrapped sooner than they actually are (what's the point in continuing in the same vein for 3 months, when it's obvious after 4-5 weeks that it's a waste of everyone's time?)

- Executive team seems to be moving Twitter platform more towards resembling FB. I don't know how I feel about this. If it's successful, then who am i to disagree; but I worry that the platforms are becoming too similar - Twitter is smaller and more agile, I'd like to see us take advantage of that more.

- Benefits are VERY good -  but could still be better - would like to see a few more big benefits that Apple/Google/FB have been offering - maybe some bonus health, housing, and shuttle/transportation perks - we have some of these perks to an extent already, I'm just being greedy. 


Location cons: middle of SF: 

- still a pretty rough neighborhood, and the city's rampant homeless problem is on full display here, although hopefully the services, charities, and organizations in the area make a difference in some people's lives; it can be pretty depressing getting asked for money 3 times along 1 block, I've seen fights, drug use, mental illness, when walking around the area. 

- Forget about parking for a reasonable cost, and forget about finding a nice apartment anywhere in SF (unless maybe you're willing to live with 4 other people, and even then...)"

- Too much hierarchy, sometime you will have to think twice before approaching other engineer

- Keep fixing bugs or small feature portrayed as big thing as millions of user affected but agility is lost, as a engineer will not get job satisfaction. 

- Following is my experience in my team: Senior will show attitude, will not speak in person and communicate only online, which in a way block your work.

- Code review system which require senior to approve your code will block you many time. Senior engineers will want you to implement things their own way, so you become just somebody's logic implementor.

- NOT a team oriented environment, people are driven by individual contribution metrics, therefore you will see sometime seniors are not that collaborative. Again this depends on which team you are working with though. but this is happening and have seen other people suffering from it.

- Didn't find middle management as employee friendly, my manager just talked to senior only.

- Inside of the office is amazing

- Exclusive promotions to employees (movie premiers, discounts on clothing and services, etc)
- Good opportunities to take classes and learn new things
- A very modern technology stack","- Excessive office politics (every company has it, but Twitter seems to be in a class in of itself)
- Executive churn creates chaos in the organization (new VP every 3 - 9 months)
- Quarterly reorgs
- No long term roadmap makes everyone obsessed with short-term goals
- Lack of coordination between divisions and teams
- Inability to execute and deliver
- Irrational behaviour (promoting someone and then firing them four weeks later)
- Twitter engineering, because of paralysis, can only deliver the most minor of features; most major new products and features are coming from acquisitions

Chaos sums up my experience at Twitter.  Because of reorgs, I averaged 4 different managers a year.  I witnessed multiple talented employees explicitly avoid a promotion because of the vastly increased danger it put their careers at Twitter in (hence, the extremely short-lived VPs).  Because of the generous equity grants pre-IPO, they elect to keep their head down in obscure areas and vest, rather than apply themselves and be at risk.  Ultimately, though, many of these employees get fed up and resign (even though they are leaving hundreds of thousands or millions of dollar in unvested equity).  Twitter is bleeding its best talent.

The fear makes the organization extremely top-down and risk averse.  No one wants to propose something novel only to fail and be shown the door.  There is no management cover.  All the way up the chain, managers will attempt to shift the blame to those below them."

2- The engineering team is a very diverse group, from cultural aspects, professional and academic backgrounds. It not only fits the image of NYC diversity but also makes it open to diversity.
3- In Twitter, you have the chance to work with open source at large scale. See Twitter's github page to have a perspective on how much contributions there have been made and the frameworks you'd be working on.","As a rational candidate, you can observe the high rate senior engineers and engineers managers departures have left the company after 3-4 years. If you are optimistic person, take the fact they are fully vested and keep the pros. Otherwise, read-on..

Since the IPO, eng managers are unable to push back upper management decisions. Frequently, because they are young first-time managers, they start acting erratically against their own team, including arbitrary job terminations (e.g.: engineers were recently promoted before being terminated under the excuse of underperforming). As result, they inadvertently create dysfunctional work environment, since people either get emotionally detached from work or fighting for survival (in a remote office it becomes even tougher b/c there is no place to go.) 

At IC level, if you've been in the industry long enough, you know what to expect from engineers in self-preservation, e.g.: code being pushed into private git repo's WHILE design review is still underway to get ahead of the ""competition"", obnoxious code reviews to slow down the ""competitor"", never questioning dysfunctional management decisions in meetings (playing the favoritism game.)

Twitter was once a great place to work because it fostered creativity in engineers, giving the opportunity to grow their careers truly on a merits basis, i.e.: from own ideas to execution. Most of the work now is on-demand basis and most of self-expansion would happen during your extra time (yet not very valuable nevertheless.)"

- not a meritocracy

After the IPO there were a lot of high-level firings, and each of those induced a re-org and blew away the product and feature development that occurred underneath. So, a lot of times yo'd see a feature developed, then abandoned or delayed, then attempted again six months later by another team.

On acquihires, problems arise when there's an obvious conflict of interest (e.g. someone high in the company is old pal's with the acquihired company's CEO), when good people are displaced and/or fired to make room for acquihired folk, and when acquihired folk parachute into the org with outsized titles and compensation, screwing over everyone who came in the front door and who had been working honestly. Tolerance and encouragement of this sort of cronyism is destructive not just to rank-and-file employees but to all shareholders.

Twitter presents itself externally as this hyper-ethical company super-concerned with noble ideas like user safety, but on the inside odd things happen, like a time a bunch of employees were fired with no notice and the survivors were told they could not ask questions and that no explanation would be given.

Given these conditions, employees are incentivized to leave the company as soon as they vest some stock and the learning slows, which happens at the two year mark, on average."

For example, something as simple as requesting an ergonomic mouse was a hassle - with levels of approvals and complicated expense procedures. At Twitter, you just walk up to one of the IT offices and say ""Can I have an Evoluent upright mouse?"" and they just hand it to you without a single question. Everyone wants to do the right thing. If something is obviously a good idea, you're just expected to do it, you don't need to ask for permission. I've never experienced that before at other companies.","From a purely engineering perspective, there is a lot that could be improved, such as some engineering practices or code quality.

The free food is amazing and company is generally open to flexible work schedules dependent on department and manager. Very good leave policies (unlimited PTO, 10 weeks maternity/paternity leave), although good luck taking a vacation and not checking email or attending a meeting.  

Compensation is good; RSU grants prior to IPO (can't speak post) were generous.","The company is going through an identity crisis as it transitions from a small private company to a large public multinational with significant investor pressure.  That transition has taken its toll on leadership and it feels like DickC is scrambling to save his job and survive, largely by implicitly blaming others for the company's failures, getting rid of a huge number of executives.  The churn at the top hurts those at the bottom as the constant leadership changes come with new org structures, new philosophies, and new politics, and projects get put on hold and priorities shift.

There have been a number of stealth layoffs, which management states is for poor performers, but people usually don't see it coming and even those working with the impacted employees had no idea.  One day you'll email somebody you've been working with closely for months and it gets bounced back and that's how you're informed they're gone, but there's very little further discussion about it.  This leads to a stressful environment where people are always worried about the axe, and consequently have short time horizons when thinking about their future at the company.

When executives were recently asked what they thought about a recent exodus of ""long-timers"" (people at Twitter around 4 years) the response was an acknowledgment that the pace was relentless and people leaving matches expectation.  Lasting two years here is a victory and you're considered an old timer at that stage.  Despite the constant churn due to people burning out or getting fired, there's very little investment in building institutional knowledge or making the company work culture more sustainable.  You can see the short term outlook everywhere, even in public comments, and people seem focused on short term wins to move short term metrics versus longer term investments in building a stable and long lasting business that will be around for the long haul.

I see Twitter's core values acted upon frequently, and I really believe the company operates with incredible integrity. The compensation and perks are wonderful—and though my work/life balance occasionally teeters against my favor—my workload is generally respected. I am incredibly optimistic about our future—and I strongly believe I can be at Twitter for a long time, as inter-department and office transfer is strongly supported.

Leadership constantly stresses the importance of the employees—their contributions are highlighted, and I get the sense that our satisfaction is paramount. It's really easy to do your best work here.","I feel like any ""cons"" at Twitter are nit-picking. As the company grows, it's harder to find the information you need (though they're working on that), or the people with whom you need to speak. The rapid pace of the business means we make mistakes that we don't always own up to externally, even though we'd like to. Internal critiques can be occasionally be brutal, and externally we're an easy target for the media (it can be tough to ignore).

There are a lot of documented company values, so you can find a few to identify with. Upper management realize change is needed, both in paying down technical debt and also improving employee satisfaction.","It is often hard to follow the connection between engineering and what the company is doing, particularly recently as there has been a lot of turn-over.

Most of software components are custom, operate on custom runtimes, and written in Scala. This means little opportunity to bring existing experience with you, and a frustrating learning curve, as internal tools are often complicated.

Even if there are some very talented staff here, there are many inexperienced or old guard who control or create processes. This surfaces as rules and tools that feel dated vs other tech companies.

There is a focus and perception that engineering is done one-way and in one place, but things are done many ways in many places."

The culture is also great. Twitter has done a good job of maintaining a startup-eque vibe despite being 3000+ people. That really comes across in the day-to-day: having random conversations over lunch, or at the themed happy hours where people are super friendly and welcoming. Transparency is also important and respected.

- Being paid much better than my previous Fortune 100 employer.
- My team is experienced, professional, and cares about the company's success.
- Management is generally approachable, but be sure you ask for their time with a purpose in mind.
- Lots of opportunity if you reach for it - it won't be handed to you.
- Office perks are great.
- It's taking us a while, but recent vision and strategy alignment is coming together.

I also disagree with a previous reviewer's claim that ""the women's organizations within Twitter carry no real weight at the company"" and the claim of systemic anti-women culture. I've rarely observed the behaviors described and the internal numbers about promotions simply don't tell the same story this reviewer describes. Additionally, the women's groups here have exceptional company support and are afforded the opportunity to hold events and host speakers (sometimes quite difficult to achieve at HQ due to limited space). These groups have also given exceptional access to the most senior individuals in the company.","- Losing a lot of culture through old-timer departures.
- Management churn at the upper levels is unsettling but not wholly abnormal for a company at this stage. I attribute this to a number bad hires. I believe the current product and engineering heads are a better fit.
- Company feels much bigger and it's becoming harder to get work noticed.
- Entrepreneurial spirit is dwindling as Hackweeks only occur 2x per year now and folks don't have confidence they could ship their bigger bets or moonshots.
- Power is concentrated with a few choice folks and groups. Not unusual for any company, but it can be arduous to break through.
- However, renewed commitment to broken windows and bug fixing is a necessary annoyance.
- We've likely overgrown and the recent headcount trimming isn't sitting well with folks, though I think it was necessary contraction."

If you're not in the office late into the evening and answering emails on the weekend you're not working hard enough.

Good luck trying to focus in one of the worst open floor plan offices I have ever worked in. Row after row of bench style desks where stretching your arms might mean an awkward apology to the coworkers sitting on either side of you less than 3 feet away. They typically cram 50-100 people in a given area with no barriers, not even half walls, so you spend the majority of your working day trying to drown out the distractions.

Management is unprofessional and frequently in a position just one level higher than they should be. There is no coherent vision for the company except ignore what's best for the users if it means money can be made.

Finally, there's a reason why Twitter reported the worst representation of women in technical roles (90% male, 10% female). This place is a brogrammer haven. As a woman your faced with a culture that screams petulant college bro from the first day you walk through the doors. Women are frequently given work of lesser importance, have their ideas attributed their male colleagues, are passed up for promotions, and generally made to feel unwelcome. To top it off the women's organizations within Twitter carry no real weight at the company. They are open to all employees so women don't have a safe place to talk about the serious issues facing them without it being made into some kind of joke by male engineers or used against them later."
1074,Twitter,great people but something is off with management,2014-10-22,3.0,Software Engineer,Great peers and there are many perks around the office such as free meals and famous people stopping by for talks.,"The management seems off, I guess they are running trying to fix a lagging user retention by doing whatever they can."
1075,Twitter,"a lot of re-orgs, a destroyed company culture.",2014-10-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are a lot of great people in the company. People used to think about the company and the product. Lately this changed a lot. These days it is more important to play politics. People care about the product less. Instead, they care about their team and personal future career.","People are constantly scared to get fired, no long term plans etc. Many teams don't even know what will happen in next quarter. Currently, it is full of chaos.  It was clearly not the case a year ago. Politics play a lot of role these days in many decisions. a lot of power games. We used to constantly think about the company and always used the word ""we"". These days it is always ""they"" for other teams or ""us"" for your team."
1076,Twitter,Middle management crapshoot,2014-10-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The food's decent (although the snacks aren't really that good). People at the base level are decent and sharp. Fair number of celebrity visits, although it trends heavily towards entertainment celebrities and invites and access are controlled by a pretty tight clique.","All open plan, all the time. Office environment is rows of long tables, of which you get 2/3 a table and a small rolling cabinet. There is no privacy unless you reserve a conference room.  Projects fight for spaces away from heavily trafficked corridors and people fight within projects for seats next to windows and away from corridors. Great if you like that layout style, but no consideration if you don't. 

Middle management is like playing Russian roulette. Read the low rated reviews, and you'll see bad middle management is the most common complaint. And since it's policy that no manager have more than 10 direct reports, there's a lot of middle managers. I've had the misfortune to have several managers here who were among the worst I've ever had. 

If you get a bad manager, you need to tough it out (and brown nose) while discreetly arranging to transfer projects. Neither the next level of management nor HR pays any attention to complaints about managers (save perhaps for diversity related issues). Saying, and giving examples of how, a manager doesn't know what they're doing is ignored.  If a manager takes a dislike to you, unless you're truly irreplaceable, you're in trouble; they've even fired people  just days before the vesting cliff who seemed to be doing a good job. 

While CEO Costello seems a nice enough guy, it's unclear if he's really up to being CEO. There's been a huge amount of turnover at the upper levels, possibly indicating a hiring problem, and the company as a whole, while not completely directionless and drifting, doesn't really have a strong sense of where it's going or how to approach its problems. And there's a definite disconnect between Twitter's supposed culture and values and how a not insignificant amount of middle management acts. Hackweeks, which have been reduced, result in many potentially useful prototypes that then never get followed up on."

There is a free shuttle to the Bay Area... and, oh, yes - the IPO worked very well for employees, as far as I can tell.","It's difficult to find high-quality engineers and especially managers these days.

1093,Twitter,Addenda to an earlier review,2014-07-07,1.0,SRE,"I have nothing to add from my previous comments, but this requires twenty words, so I need to add them.","Working in SRE has some serious issues.  There is an embedded approach -- so one gets one's work assignments and performance assessments from an engineering organization, but promotion/compensation decisions are made by SRE management.  It depends on how engaged the SRE management is with the SRE, and some SRE managers are extremely disengaged, or are willing to accept the word of the engineering manager.  The engineering manager does not have any incentive to promote the work of the SRE, particularly when the work is a joint project with engineering.  Similarly, engineering managers will be more focused on the work of their direct reports, and rightly so.  

This makes the entire SRE employee review process capricious.  Strong SREs are more readily lost through bad management, and SRE reviews (conducted entirely within SRE management structure) are more prone to second hand information and favoritism."

1143,Twitter,"Current employee for less than one year, Sales Strategy",2013-12-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Intelligent, fun, and vibrant workforce. Awesome food and quality of life. Being based within the city makes the urban office community more exciting (despite being located in a sort-of-sketchy area). Exciting growth with global aspirations. Overall, pretty great.","Explosive growth can lead to concerns about the future company culture (ie ""selling out,"" ""feeling too corporate,"" etc). Management has handled the growth trajectory well, but becoming publicly-traded can lead to short-term pressures in the future. This could hinder the fun and passionate atmosphere."

Great executive leadership.","Push for open and fearless communication, but can be passive at times.  Employees find it hard to manage work/life balance, but likely due to passion for the product."

I get to work with some really smart people, who care about growing the company in a way that also impacts the world positively, and who have a great sense of humour. It's great to see a product that you've worked hard on rolled out to millions of users, and getting to hear directly from them that they love it!","It's growing fast, so there's bound to be some pains associated with that.

Lots of exciting work, in cutting edge technologies, where there is no fear in trying to make the world a better place.","Hiring has been heavy, but where the new workers fit into the picture is somewhat of a mystery in many groups.

- Twitter employees are passionate about changing the way the world communicates. You get to work with a diverse group of individuals who share a common mission.
- Twitter promotes from within. You get an opportunity to expand beyond your current expertise and scope. You are always learning. 
- Despite growing 10x in my time here, I actually feel that our talent level has increased from the early days. We are able to attract the best talent in engineering, sales, sales marketing, comms, legal, BizDev and finance.",- A rotating door of product management leadership has hindered the product strategy for many years.
1165,Twitter,Best place I've ever worked,2013-07-30,5.0,Account Manager,"The team is amazing and everyone is very passionate about what they do. Management is very open and approachable. The HQ is absolutely inspiring with tremendous perks including healthy breakfast, lunch and dinner. Excellent perks for regional offices as well that try to emulate HQ the best way possible.",Team is growing very quickly so hands on training is lacking at times. Basically sink or swim environment so not ideal for all personalities.
1166,Twitter,Twitter is the best place I've ever worked,2013-07-30,5.0,Account Executive,Twitter recruits the best talent in the business.  The company genuinely wants to have a positive impact on the world.

1168,Twitter,"Great, fast-pace company that is growing like crazy.",2013-07-30,5.0,Account Manager,"Very transparent executive staff and an opportunity to get involved at different levels.

1173,Twitter,My experience so far at Twitter is beyond what words can express.,2013-07-30,5.0,Site Reliability Engineer,I explicitly like the open culture here and the extremely talent people around me.,"The location is not perfect but given the company's commitment to help the city grow its economy, nothing I would heavily complain about."
1174,Twitter,#Amazing since day one,2013-07-30,5.0,Sales,"Although it is quite cliche, the people at Twitter really are what makes this place special. You are surrounded by smart, hard-working people who genuinely care about the company.  You truly feel like everyone is pulling the company in the same direction.  Oh, and the food is amazing too!",With growth comes some minor growing pains as more people fit into the organization.
1175,Twitter,A fast paced environment with intelligent opinionated people always striving for improvement.,2013-07-30,5.0,Software Engineer II,"Very little corporate nonsense, free food + perks, great office, smart people, sense of doing something meaningful, defending free speech","Complexity - it's hard to keep up with new service X or Y (esp if named after a bird), ever-changing processes can be confusing, dependence on multiple groups can be draining."
1176,Twitter,"Transparent, accountable, original - really great place to work",2013-07-30,5.0,Director,"Twitter is an exceptionally transparent place.  Senior team sets that bar very high.  Also, we are charting our own course - not copying the playbook set out by other companies.  we're a bit of an underdog, which definitely helps people identify with a common goal, common purpose.  Twitter is a world-changing technology (from Arab Spring to 2012 Election to Boston Marathon, Twitter's there!)","growing up - and all the normal good and bad that comes with that.  need more process in some places, install a little too much in others."
1177,Twitter,Junior Data Analyst - TwitterTV Boston,2013-07-30,5.0,Junior Data Analyst,"Amazing team. Great support and encouragement by supervisors and management to develop professionally, test out new skills, and take initiatives on projects. While I'm not based in HQ, our office and my team has an incredible, collaborative culture. Lots of offsites and cross-team bonding happy hours.",Distributed office can sometimes feel disconnected from the HQ in San Francisco. Fewer opportunities to connect with different teams in different locations.
1178,Twitter,This place rocks. Don't want to work anywhere else.,2013-07-30,5.0,Site Reliability Engineer,"The people are rad, problems get fixed, love the product. I've been at places that stayed the same indefinitely. Twitter is a company that is dynamic in it's goal setting and is willing to invest and pay off technical debt.","Some of your friends and family won't ""get"" twitter but have not problem telling you how many ninjas their pirates have vanquished on other social sites. The office has lots of benefits built in which can land employees on the entitled side...especially employees who have limited experience in the world outside of the silicon valley."
1179,Twitter,Happy Fella,2013-07-30,5.0,Engineering Manager,Twitter is an exciting place to work. Hyper growth means there is a lot of opportunity to take on more responsibility. I also have a lot of freedom in my job to drive the changes that I envision. The most important thing to me is that Twitter tries to keep to its values. I'm proud to work alongside folks who are fighting for user's first amendment right.,There is a lot of competition. You cannot coast in your job. What have you done for me lately?
1180,Twitter,"Great job, great people, great perks",2013-07-30,5.0,Software Engineer,"Twitter is probably one of the best place to work at. The people are great, people care about your well-being from day one and the perks are good.

On the other hand, you are expected to work hard and be completely dedicated to your work. You will be given a lot and you are expected to give a lot back which makes perfect sense.

New-new hire orientation is solid and really useful plus you will get to meet some employees from the early-days.

Best way to see how it's like is to be invited by a friend or an acquaintance for lunch.

(The food is great; there are all kind of foods)","There are definitely carrier opportunities however during the first week, I felt an employee needed to move mountains to be promoted. My point of view isn't set yet so I will see in the future."
1181,Twitter,"Great culture, focus on engineers, no pointy-haired bosses",2013-07-30,5.0,Software Engineer,"Very open company, people are approachable and friendly. Good core values which are actually referenced in decision making. Company stands up for user's rights, no PRISM participation. Comp and benefits are great. Food! No, seriously - the catering is amazing.",Getting started as an engineer difficult. There are many internal tools and teams you've never heard of that aren't properly documented or easy to find. The onboarding is far too short leaving most of the actual training in the hands of your manager which ends up being luck of the draw.
1182,Twitter,Twitter,2013-07-30,5.0,Staff Software Engineer,"Great pay and benefits, great product, brilliant engineers, software releases frequent and often, company culture rocks, free food, personal showers, multiple gaming rooms,  great terraces to relax and have lunch with fantastic views of San Francisco, open areas to collobarate, easy to commute to, and fun place to work!","Management is OK, but needs more training and development."
1183,Twitter,Full-time employee who chose Twitter over higher salaries and bigger names. No regrets.,2013-07-30,5.0,Software Engineer II,"The people here are friendly and open, and generally humble despite the high bar we set for hiring engineers. While at other companies I had often gotten the feeling that asking questions or going over to talk to another engineer was an unappreciated intrusion on their time, people at Twitter welcome questions and collaboration, and are happy to help each other; engineers who have been here several years treat newbies and interns with as much respect as they would another senior engineer. The message I got when I joined the company almost 2 years ago was to ""never assume people within the company know best."" This is a mindset I fully support and admire Twitter for having - it is so easy and can be so crippling to a company and to your own personal development to get boxed into thinking ""we know best"" and dismiss challenging viewpoints and ideas from the outside world. I could say plenty more pros on other aspects of the company, but this is by far one of the most motivating reasons I came to work at Twitter.","We have a chronic problem with email volume. Pretty much everyone at the company suffers from a flooded inbox. We try to fix this problem by making lists for different types of emails so only people who want the emails will get them. Great idea in theory, but the truth of it is that people don't get on the lists they need to get on, which means people posting to the right list don't get the message to the people they need to, resulting in them just resorting to posting on the main list again."
1184,Twitter,Overall a great place to work as an engineer,2013-07-30,5.0,Software Engineer,"Great atmosphere, smart people, interesting and engaging work, good food, fun events, benefits of a big company with the feel of a smaller one, easy commute from surrounding areas, general concern for employee happiness and well-being.","Somewhat flat hierarchy results in fewer advancement opportunities, fair compensation but not a leader in the industry, area around HQ can be a little dicey."
1185,Twitter,"Amazing culture, energy, transparency, and perks",2013-07-30,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Love the energy and the overall atmosphere of my colleagues. These folks are so upbeat, optimistic and passionate about the product it makes you want to invest your own money into the company.

Senior management does a terrific job of talking about high-level goals and accomplishments on a bi-weekly basis. The vibe during those meetings is electrifying, thanks in part to the CEO Dick Costolo who's both energetic and hilarious.

Ideas put forward by non-managers/VPs, including those from projects that happen during a quarterly hack week, are also taking seriously. There are forums where such ideas are discussed, and when appropriate they're adopted into the product.

Last but not least, there are tons of amazing perks including 3x/day free meals prepared by a world class chef (seriously, you have to try it), free beer on tap, lots of activities/classes, etc.","Some people might be put off by the narrow pyramid of direct reports reaching up to the CEO, i.e. there are too many layers separating most employees from the CEO in comparison to some other companies."
1186,Twitter,Exciting and challenging environment with a chance to make impact,2013-07-30,5.0,Software Engineer,"Green field work environment, smart people, tough problems to solve. Central location to all of SF and transportation.",Moves slow at times. A lot of moving parts that are not well defined.
1187,Twitter,"Great team, product, and lots of opportunity",2013-07-25,5.0,Senior Engineering Manager,"Twitter hands down has the best people I've ever worked with, and I've worked at several of the Valley's top technology companies. It's also awesome to be helping build a product that has extreme name recognition, and not as a privacy-destroying, all-consuming behemoth. The perks are pretty sweet (at least at HQ), and with the growth rate the company is experiencing people seem to get as much opportunity as they can handle.",The growth rate is really out of hand. The company is literally 5 times bigger than when I started just over 2 years ago.
1188,Twitter,Come work at Twitter.  All the things you don't like about your current gig don't happen here.,2013-07-25,5.0,SRE,"Open communication.  Serious commitment by the management team.  Commitment to open source.  Culture of rewarding performance.  Exciting engaged atmosphere.  Super smart people.  If you patent something you get to keep it.  Ethical business plan, ethics permeates the company vision.  
Oh, and  the food is better than google (seriously).","Commute to SF, bad part of town (9th &Market).   Fast growth is chaotic."
1189,Twitter,A company full of smart driven people with immense opportunity,2013-07-25,5.0,Account Coordinator,"Opportunities for Advancement, Free Food, Interesting Work",No Gym in Building (Just Yoga and Crossfit)
1190,Twitter,"Awesome working environment, motivated people.",2013-07-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Twitter's mission and core values are something I can believe in, and it feels good to be working towards something that I fell is a net positive. The office is great, and the perks (while not being quite Google-level) are better than anywhere else I've worked.","Because the company is not quite out of startup mode yet, cash compensation is a little lacking, but engineers are still getting equity."
1191,Twitter,"Young company, loads of opportunities for innovation and personal growth",2013-07-25,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Engineer first, no b*llsh*t, flexible company culture. Salary/Stocks are great. Free food!",growth was too fast and that introduces certain problems. Some times a team grows too big (>10) and becomes hard to manage.

Fantastic engineering talent
User-focused, do-the-right-thing company culture
Huge growth potential (exciting to be a part of)","Expensive cost of living to be near headquarters
Growing pains in the support organizations (HR, Finance, Corp-IT, etc)
Relatively homogenous engineering employee base (young, white, upper-middle class background)"

Executive staff on a first name basis. Great open door policy. Location (downtown SF!).","People are spread pretty thin. While that means each person does A LOT, it means getting new things done is hard since there aren't enough people to do it. We need more engineers desperately."
1195,Twitter,"A place where engineers control their destinies, and you *are* changing the world.",2013-07-25,5.0,Staff Software Engineer,"small teams, engineers own their own services (prod root, testing, alerting, design, end to end), tons of opportunity to work on fundamental infrastructure and relevance problems, but also there is a ton in place to help you do this already.  Extremely pro-open source.  Flexible work environment, unlimited PTO.  Still pre-IPO, but you know, kinda probably will.","Chaotic: engineering has not been very historically run by strong personalities, which lead to an environment where individual tech teams decided what to build.  This lead to a lack of consistency and and ""anything goes"" engineering mentality.  E.g. there are maybe 6 different logging frameworks in production java code, another half dozen different key-value stores, mapreduce jobs are done via pig, scalding, hive, python on hadoop streaming, you name it.  So if you're one who is bewildered by many choices, you'll be *very* bewildered at Twitter.  It can be a hard place to start your engineering career."

- Lots of excitement! Lots of change and growth - can be jarring if you're not accustom to this kind of environment.","- While communication is generally open, it can be hard to find the right channels to get information (I still struggle with this).
- Internal tools aren't always a priority to help improve productivity (although I've been spoiled by Google's in a prior life).
- Some whining and entitlement issues from a vocal (and often anonymous) few. 
- Unclear growth and development path for managers (but people are working on this).
- Constant growing pains. Lots of them, but almost a pro in the sense that we've worked through many of them successfully. (Seen a fail-whale lately?)
- Old-timer blues."
1197,Twitter,"Immediately open and trusting, Twitter has allowed me to make big designs and solve big problems with little friction.",2013-07-25,5.0,Software Engineer,"Twitter is very open and transparent inside the company, with little friction caused by bureaucratic nonsense. From my first day I've been able to make big changes to the code base and deploy these changes to production. It has been relatively easy to work with coworkers across teams to complete broader projects. I've always felt compensated fairly for the work I do, and I've never felt the need to consistently work long days.","It's in an interesting state as it has been making its transition from small start up to big company, and many internal processes have not scaled.

- Slow execution and too much politics
- Promotion is hard to come by, unless you are one of those chosen ones
- Having a hard time recruiting good candidates and so it is full of mediocre engineers and recent grads

The new space is appealing and very well decorated","Most of the interactions I had were with people that refused to give into the scalability idea.  They consider newer employees with experience from other successful companies a threat and will not consider any recommendations. Company still has no idea how to monetize, but still continues to spend money left and right on hiring/acquiring talent with no long term plans.
The overall vibe of the company is super SF hipster (which itself isn't a con) but when you couple that with a bunch of people that don't really know what they're doing, it spells disaster"

I'm always happy to go into work, and happy to be at work. I'm surrounded by incredibly intelligent people, working on exciting technologies, solving interesting scaling problems that nobody else has dealt with, and learning new things every day.","HQ is located in a very sketchy neighborhood (Civic Center / Tenderloin), and I've often walked past heroin addicts shooting up on the sidewalk. There's plenty of homeless and desperately poor folks, but I'm not harassed by them. It's a little depressing, but Twitter makes a strong effort to encourage its employees to help out the locals in some small way.

There is a certain amount of growing pains at Twitter, and some of us newer folks often ask ourselves ""why did this get implemented this way"", but that's common at any startup. Some of us from the big companies (Google, Yahoo, Facebook) know there's better ways to accomplish the same task, but that's why they hired us.

There is also a certain amount of groupthink at Twitter, but I don't think that's any different from any large corporation."

Salary for a pre-IPO in Silicon Valley is very disappointing.   Management has a chip on their shoulder and anyone daring to sing a different tune better start packing their bags. Everyone too busy impressing everyone around them instead of doing their job.  Insecure management always trying to watch their back - what does that say about the culture."

Great perks for a startup, they are competitive with Zynga and Facebook on this.

Short work hours, everyone leaves at 4 pm on Fridays for Tea Time.

Low expectations for team members. easy to get promoted to Tech Lead. If you are coming from Google you will feel like a genius.

Extremely social company, very friendly leadership.

High salaries and restricted stock.","Very frustrating to be a Software Engineer coming from an environment like Google.

Unusually high turnover for a startup tech company, particularly among senior management and high performers. You never know when someone is about to leave -- and often you have no idea why.

Very secretive. I have no idea how the company is doing in terms of finances. Most big news I read about in Tech Crunch.

Engineering reputation is poor. It's getting better, but hiring is difficult."
