So I know the red flags to look for when it comes to terrible companies. Honestly I can say Uber is great place to work. They actually listen to the employees and do their best to make sure we're comfortable & have a real work /life balance. The benefits are amazing. So far the my colleagues are very helpful and decent to work with. I'm not naïve so I know no place is perfect. But at least here at Uber you will feel heard and respected.","One con I can say is, we need better resources to help the drivers and delivery partners that work on the platform. I don't feel they're being heard enough. Also there needs to be clear and concise communication between phone support & support at the Greenlight Hubs. Too many times drivers have came upset and confused because the information given over the phone is different from what's given in person. And no I'm not a Uber driver or Uber eats delivery person either.. I'm just speaking from experience dealing with them on a daily basis."

Internal quality procedures are lacking tremendously, to the point even the absolute best agents who are incredibly talented and knowledgeable get told they are not good enough week after week.

Set pay scale that doesn’t consider experience and ability, meaning someone who essentially just came in the door will make the same money before proving themselves."

112,Uber,Join Uber if you wish to be stuck in what should be a salaried role as an hourly employee forever,2022-03-24,2.0,Content Specialist,"Near constant trial by fire is great bonding with your immediate team members, the health benefits are admittedly great, and you can leverage your experience from this role into a company that will pay you almost double for the same work.","The CommOps org is broken into two tiers of employees that lead to the lower tier being treated like second class cities - the L-ladder, which primarily includes Managers and up, and the S-ladder, which includes anyone else below a lower level manager role. 

While this is industry standard in customer facing service roles, supporting project based roles such as content project specialist, quality project specialists, and lower tiers of analysts are not traditionally paid hourly based on the nature of the work done and the responsibilities. The team maintains a high attrition rate for the following reasons: 

- Low pay. The role's responsibilities are more equivalent to an assistant project manager, but with the pay of an experienced support agent. Your responsibilities include designing the support process and tailoring the message of the company's projects, tracking down stakeholders and managing reviews to ensure it's ready for launch. 

- Low career opportunities. A select few have made the jump into operations style roles, but it's despite their work on the content for those teams, not because of it. This is a three part issue: 
1. The org that develops content is separate from the team that asks for content, so there are no promotional roles your work can leverage into based on your stakeholder engagement and expansion of responsibilities. 
2. You're gatekept from the results of your work, so despite working alone to audit, redevelop, and launch content, of which the scope of responsibility is 100% in your hands outside of providing final approval, you'll rarely if ever receive information or have access to the data to allow you to pull that information yourself to know what impact it had. 
3. Which leads to the issue of the fact that Uber requires every role to be applied to, no exceptions. You're paid hourly, so you have the stigma from the rest of the company that assumes the position is more just writing words and less end-to-end content ownership and management going into the application. From there, you have to battle to prove you have the experience to be in your next role, which is incredibly hard to do when you have no access to what impact your work has on the overall company.

- Overwork and burnout - They haven't been able to hire up to the level they need to to handle the amount of work coming in, but Senior Management will punish you anyways through low performance bonuses (which HR points to as the reason why their low pay actually is the same as roles in other companies that pay 20k more) and scolding for not being able to make it through everything assigned to your plate. You're simultaneously not supposed to take overtime because it impacts the team budget, but you're also supposed to clear everything off your plate, even when you communicate you have no bandwidth to take anything else on and meet your deadlines. 

- Management is very much a ""stop complaining"" style, than a ""We'll set better boundaries with other stakeholders and adhere to our actual role responsibilities so you're not overextended and can actually complete what's on your plate."""

I am surrounded by brilliant people working on complex, ambiguous problems, yet despite the fast-pace of work and change at Uber, everyone is really open and willing to spare some time to help with a task or jam on the topic at hand. For being such an established player, Uber still feels very much like a startup - every work day is unique and the challenges I face require critical thinking and designing my own frameworks for how to approach them.
There is tremendous opportunity to ""choose your own adventure"" within the company, with just the right amount of guardrails around my role & responsibilities, and plenty of freedom to pursue opportunities I find interesting.
Management is also extremely transparent - with biweekly company all-hands meetings including 30 minutes for Q&A from anyone from the company. This was a huge breath of fresh air coming from my last company.","Though everyone at the firm is very competent and helpful, the company has grown very fast and has gone through a lot of personnel change since its inception. Processes and projects have not always been documented very consistently, so it can sometimes be difficult to find some of the information I need. The flip side to this is that there is very little red tape and a lot of freedom and autonomy to find opportunities for process improvement and new ideas."

18 weeks parental leave benefits both parents and those looking for step-up opportunities","As another reviewer mentioned, there are not clear paths to advancement and it can seem buddy-buddy for who gets advanced.

Pay is also not at par with competitors, which affects not just your own pay but the level of turnover (and hence chaos) that you need to deal with.

Obvious separation between hourly workers and salaries workers. Salaries workers threw themselves a glamorous party for the holidays. Office workers had to come back to the office they had just finished working at...to throw themselves a holiday party with no drinks or food from Uber.

948,Uber,TLDR; think twice,2021-12-05,2.0,Program Manager,"Good benefits

Pay is competitive

Generous Uber credits every month

Choice of Mac or Windows computer

Dynamic Google Suite instead of Office","Extremely high turnover, creates roadblocks to moving forward with projects. I waited for two months for someone to return from vacation and sabbatical only to be told they were now leaving the company. I saw this trend happen multiple times in addition to being told suddenly that a person I talked to last week had since left Uber. Red flag when it’s joked that being with the company for two years makes you a “dinosaur.”

Each team you work with has their own set of priorities that usually differs from your teams, making accomplishing assigned goals or launches extremely difficult. No person will have the same general grasp of an initiative and often I found things I was assigned to were being completely deprecated or deprioritized by the team I needed to work with

Upper management is out of reach. My manager’s manager rarely reached out to me directly and instead deployed someone on my team to relay their messages

There is little to no onboarding or development, in addition to job definition being extremely ambiguous and ever-shifting. My team went through two major name and org changes in a matter of months, and the programs I was assigned to were constantly in limbo of being completely altered for priority and rollout. I received little definition from my manager on how to get around in my day-to-day, ie where to access commonly-used resources and had to learn almost everything instant immersion style. This is not the best when you’re trying to establish yourself with multiple teams. 

For me, the young start-up culture that I initially thought would be a refreshing ‘pro’ turned quickly to a ‘con.’ For a while I heard everyone (not an exaggeration) say ‘TLDR,’ and eventually had to look it up. For anyone like me you’ll be puzzled to learn that this means ‘too long, didn’t read.’ Upper upper management uses the phrase and it’s peppered in to everything— presentations, emails, documents. For me I cringe reading and hearing it because any of the companies I worked for before would have seriously questioned why I’m implying someone wouldn’t read what’s being mentioned in entirety. I find it off-putting but the broad majority I worked with embraced it- enough said for me to know this is not the right place for me."

L&D is awesome.","I won't speak in absolutes, but majority of the time you will not receive that promotion you've been working 6-12+ months for if you aren't buddy-buddy with your manager or skip level. I've experienced it personally, and seen other employees experience it. This creates a really bad turnover experience a couple times a year once the perf process ends. Simply put, the people who didn't get the raise/promo they feel they deserved spend the next few months seeking it elsewhere. I've seen people get pay raises for lateral moves just by going to another company that values them more. That is partially due to the perf process not working the way it should. 

If you work here, or want to work here, there's a simple formula for getting a raise or promotion. Here it is:
Become buddies with your boss. 
Tell your boss everything you do. Even if it's something small like ""Hey, I made a new column on your google sheet!"". Apparently communication is overvalued that much. Communicate and document everything you do. Create an archive of all your work. Again, it's less quality and more quantity. When the perf period comes up, you now have your boss on your side and a huge running doc of all the little things you did.

Who do you ask for your peer review? Someone who will give honest, unbiased feedback? No way! Ask 1 buddy that works on your direct team, 1-2 buddies that aren't on the same team but in the same department, and 1-2 buddies that are in another department. If they don't know what you do, just send them your doc you've been working on for months! They can use whatever they need. Boom, you've got the promo! Congrats! Your middling performance doesn't matter, because you've mastered the system! Work smart, not hard (I use the word 'work' lightly). 

Maybe I sound bitter, but Uber has such potential that it hurts to see the culture being ruined the way it does. Oh and don't even get me started on the demographic breakdown. Outside looking in, the breakdown might look ok. The levels aren't disclosed though. It's safe to say 90% of the non-white employee is in a level 1 role. If you're new to this, a level 1 role just means that they have a job until a higher up department finds a way to outsource it.


Last thing I want to share is the execs transparency is non-existent. Something 100% isn't happening until it is. Something 100% is happening until it isn't. I get that companies have to turn the lights out on things sometimes, but why speak in absolutes if you aren't sure yourselves? Covid is a perfect example. Uber was absolutely not laying off or cancelling PERFs. Next week they do their first layoff wave of many. We get that Uber couldn't afford to keep so many people on when the business took such a hit, but why share news so confidently that you went back on within days? CEOs get paid the big bucks to be able to control situations no matter how tough. People were going CRAZY when Covid hit because the writing was on the wall, but execs were lying. Just flat out lying. Why have so many execs resigned? Transparency. I find it ironic that Uber prides itself on transparency with prices and safety, but doesn't really hold true on the inside. It's like a piñata full of garbage."

Tons of exciting, new stuff was happening (Eats was growing, Uber Pool was launched, we had rolled out Jump) and at the time mobility/ride sharing was fascinating. The people was amazing and sure the culture was fine – but if was a really cool, exciting company.","Since the IPO in 2019 it has been all downhill – IPO was a failure, round after round of layoffs, tons of projects have been shut down, the company rescinded lots of offers (which is really mean) and starting cutting costs and as a result talent at Uber today feels very mediocre (I actually barely know anyone who still works there). 

So yeah, Uber today is sad. One example of my time there in 2019 – within 5 months we had gone through a full rotation of product managers, in the sense that every product manager on my team (I think there were 7), was laid-off, fired or left within a single 5 months period.

You will also learn a lot from working at Uber. The work really pushes you to learn and improve and forces you to learn fast and develop skills you never knew you had.","All the learning comes at a cost: time and stress. 

Ever since joining Uber I have been working till 10-11pm every single workday (and some work on the weekends). It's hard to imagine any working parent can stay at Uber for a long time because of the poor work life balance. 

There is a very high churn at Uber and your project POCs may change 3 times within the span of 2 months because people are constantly leaving, joining, or going on leaves. Sometimes it's extremely difficult to get any work done when the people you work with keeps changing.

Poor communication, changes are announced and then lack clarity and everyone is left confused
Massive numbers of staff were let go globally in a knee jerk reaction to COVID.

1838,Uber,Good if you're just starting out in your career,2021-07-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good place to be if you're early on in your career. Lots of opportunities to expand your skill sets (Analytics Academy to learn SQL, pretty generous professional development spend, etc.) and ample space to collaborate with different teams if you have an interest in working with them. The onus is definitely on you to speak up and make your long term goals heard but in my experience managers were very supportive in helping to get you in front of the right people.

The people here are also incredibly smart and genuinely a joy to work with. I also think Uber as a whole does a very good job of regularly checking in with how employees are feeling and taking steps to address any problem areas, even if the solutions aren’t always super timely.

Benefits/equity compensation are also pretty great. Just wish they offered 401k match.","The freight division is still in its growth phase and with that comes some expected growing pains. But considering that it’s recognized as a ""core segment"" of the business, it’s appalling how unsophisticated some of the systems and processes are for a tech company of this scale. 

There was also just a general lack of organization and a constant need to be okay with not knowing how the scope of your role or your OKRs might change. In my 2 years there the metrics I was held to and the cohort of customers I was pitching to changed 7 times. It was fine at first but over time it just became exhausting because it felt like things changed the second you finally got your bearings. It also wasn’t uncommon for you to start a new quarter without knowing what your quota would actually be until several weeks later. 

It’s also pretty common practice for teams/departments to hold short term competitions with relatively small payouts to incentivize people to work harder. There’s nothing wrong with this idea in and of itself but it always felt like a way out of just paying employees what they actually deserved. 

If you’re coming into it with the clear intention of gaining new skills and exposure to new areas I think this is a good place to be. Otherwise I think you may be able to find a more fulfilling experience elsewhere."

So much bureaucracy, doesn't feel like you can impact decisions or make change within the company even when your ideas may make your job more efficient. 
Unlikely to be made Full Time (hired externally through recruitment firm), so you don't feel part of the company and get no employee benefits (no Uber credits, but also no healthcare and other employee rights). They pay well so you aren't bothered by this.

The biggest con, is if you start to want to take on more responsibility outside of direct sales or explore personal development you risk your commission as you have less time to focus on this.

Sales do not get consulted before products are cut for the suite. Manager is great but doesn't have a strictly sales background.

Previously before Uber bough Routematch technology my boss that I direct repotted to was FANTASTIC, but in the merge he got moved back down from sales management to a senior account executive, so it is hard not being able to ask for his advice as much as when I reported to him.

2270,Uber,COE review,2021-06-04,3.0,Project Manager,"1. Uber allows to be yourself. You don't need any kind of pretense to work and collaborate with others. 

2. Fairly paid (I know subjectivity but still). However this is only for the base salary. I can't say that for bonuses and yearly hikes.","1. Culture: The leadership isnt invested in people as there is no definite intent for employee happiness. While there are systems like employee surveys in place, the drive to act and follow up is weak. 

2. Compensation: The promised compensation like company shares do not exist if you are in the specialist role. I did have it on my OFFER LETTER. But the organisation retracted it and gave a cash remuneration which obviously doesn't lead to an equivalent share value considering the company was going public. 

3. Unorganised approach: Was a bit shocked to see the leadership running a young organization in a very traditional way and totally lacked empowering young employees to innovate and pursue their ideas. 

4. Lack of internal tools:There are minimal tools to make your work easy. Especially when it comes to tracking your own productivity and efficiency. 

5. Performance management: Needs global overhaul in terms of standardising perf management system. Every team has thier own way of measuring performance which obviously leads to payment disparity. 

6. Hiring: Was promised a relocation support (cash plus other support) which I was denied when I reached the city. Moreover the hiring teams are highly unorganised when it comes to follow up on interviews, feedback on candidates etc. 

6. ""Mathless HC planning"": No teams have a math around how and why they need to hire the number of folks they do. They believe they'll be able to spin out a role for everyone thry hire but that's not true. This is reflected in the way employees are shuffled and shifted from one to another more too frequently."

You will meet great people inside there and they really make your time there better. 

Free food and snacks while in office. Office located in Limerick city centre which is ideal if you want to do some shopping on your lunch hour.","Communication. This has been a consistent problem during my time at the company and it has been highlighted in every yearly employee satisfaction survey. This was particularly evident in the redundancies that were carried out during the pandemic, with affected employees being kicked off the system with immediate effect, after reassurance that the process would take some time.

I was lucky I was not one of the affected employees, however, it really opened my eyes as to how disposable I was. This also resulted in 1 employee doing the work of 3, shortly after the redundancies were finalised, as inflows started to rise substantially and KPI expectations also rose, which were a lot more difficult to achieve.

Work life balance was also a challenge as the shift pattern consisted of 11 hour shifts, working every second weekend and changing start times every 2 weeks (8AM - 7PM & 1PM - 12AM). Moving to remote work only made these shifts more difficult. The nature of the line of business required 24/7 support, however the shift patterns are drawn up in the most complicated way possible.

Little room for progression unless you make yourself known to higher management, which often lead to the wrong candidate being selected.

Interview process for promotions quite difficult with creative tests given and no preparation given to those going for said promotion.

Flexing to other lines of business with little to no training given."

2488,Uber,"Great Pay, Great Benefits, Creativity inspiring.",2021-05-03,4.0,Software Engineer I,"Uber has always seemed to need creative thinkers in order to solve problems. The kinds of problems available at Uber aren't available anywhere else in the tech industry. This is because Uber works in the real-world, not just in tech. Thus, many solutions need to exist to prevent problems from happening in the real world, and things quickly become much more complicated when dealing with people interacting. Not very demanding atmosphere, but the company gives you room to move at whatever pace you want - and the freedom to propose ideas across the entire company and tech stack. Even though I work mostly on backend development, I've proposed solutions to many other teams.","It has a fast employee turnaround rate, so, oftentimes, you'll be working on something that someone else designed, built, and left, and you might run into issues understanding the architecture of things / debugging flows because of a lack of understanding of the system / lack of a POC to talk to."

Benefits (Work From Home + Reimbursements) are amazing - we are taken care of for sure.","There were recent changes to compensation but I'd argue that Uber still has ways to go with competitive pay. 

You can feel stuck in your role at times. Leadership won't necessarily come ""looking for you"" to move up or around if you aren't vocal about what you need.

Roadmaps to careers in different lines of business are somewhat nonexistent. Uber is making strides but mobility moves at a snail's pace. If you are entry-level - it may take a while to access a team outside of your line of business or of a different speciality."

Free meals and snacks

Casual dress code

Benefits like allowances and health cards are available from day one

Flexible working hours and the ability to work remotely, depending on your role

Huge, diverse company with employees from different backgrounds","Can feel chaotic and disorganized at times

Many relatively-inexperienced managers across the company

Lack of clear direction from management, leading to half-baked projects and ideas

Horrible paid time off (PTO) policy (only TEN leave credits per year? Seriously?)

Inadequate/barely existent training for new hires in non-ops roles

No mentorship (people, especially new hires, are often left to figure things out on their own)

Office politics

Limited growth opportunities

Promotion process for certain roles feels unnecessarily tedious (why does it have to feel like applying for a new job?)

Employees seem to be either overworked or underutilized

Employees are seen as just a number - no one seems to care if someone is able to put their skills and experience to good use. If it works, great! If it doesn't, then they can just push you out of the company or find a replacement"

2656,Uber,Not flawless but hard to beat. Pros outweigh cons.,2021-04-12,5.0,Business Analyst,"- Access to some of the best minds around
- People managers that really support your growth and development
- Company puts in so much effort to communicate their effort & take care of employees with extra unexpected benefits/compensation that most people didn't ask for
- Not just allowed to work remotely during the pandemic, remote work is required for as many as possible
- Global all hands is an opportunity to ask questions that get legitimate answers from exec leadership team and overwhelming feedback in this area or employee satisfaction surveys are addressed with new or altered policy. It sometimes takes a year or two but it is rarely left totally unaddressed.
- Perks of monthly Uber credits, for benefits there is parental leave is 16 weeks , unlimited PTO, mental healthcare is free
- Equity refreshes per year (always a carrot being waived in that sense)
- Yearly compensation review. I have received a significant % raise each year that I didn't personally ask for, so I appreciate that.
- A lot of internal promotion","- Pennywise and pound-foolish for costs, time, employee benefits, and prioritization
- Stock price is highly dependent on the news
- No 401k match
- Exec leadership often sends mass emails with empathetic but unnecessary commentary on current political/high-coverage news that does not concern the business.
- I have seen some borderline abusive/harrassing employees warned several times instead of being fired. They often leave on their own because they usually do not get promoted after several years. 
- Cyclical nature of focus on certain metrics
- Internal bureaucracy is more of a problem each year. Even after researching where to find certain info, my job is slowed down by having to contact X for input only to get redirected to Z team, who doesn't handle this particular issuetye, so contact Q team instead.
- Regularly have to reopen my IT tickets most of the time because they are usually not read properly the first time."

Often not enough room for individuals to get promoted - e.g. L4s could not be promoted because no further L5 roles were available.
-Instability - the company is HIGHLY unstable. We went through 3 major reorgs during the span of 12 months. 
-Lack of people investment - people often see this company as a stepping stone, and that includes leadership. Leadership did not seem to really invest in their direct reports, from a professional development standpoint. This also was likely caused by the fact that we had so many re-orgs.
-Lack of focus on PD - there was overall very little focus on professional development at the company, which I often felt was de-prioritized in favor of driving the business. For example, SQL training for Ops POCs was cut due to budget cuts, leaving newer folks to have to use free online resources for trainings. There were no trainings or workshops outside of work in our org - it was really up to you to find these on your own.
-Highly disorganized - the company overall was highly disorganized, with many functions having overlapping scopes and not communicating well with each other. Unlike other companies, there were no PMO teams in place to ensure that teams were working well together and staying organized - it was up to the individual teams.
-Compensation - compensation was at least 15-25% lower than similar roles at other comparable companies. This was something often brought up during All-Hands, and dismissed by executive leadership.
-Culture - overall, it felt like people were very jaded at the company - each month, at least 3-4 people left the Ops org on average. People were tired of the reorgs, and tired of not being paid enough while being asked to work extremely hard, given our business was still unprofitable. It felt very unsustainable."

Having said that, Uber is innovating everyday and they don't think twice before adopting a new technology or changing their current methods. People are very smart and are always willing to work extra to make Uber a better platform.",What I have seen is people are pretty work oriented and don't really communicate much as a team (except for work related topics). Meetings are generally quiet and only talk about work and nothing else. Nobody shares their personal stories or experiences. Feels strictly like work!

They do NOT pay commission, which I don't even how this is even considered a sales job since there is no incentive to drive the reps to make deals.
The managers do not give you what you need to be successful even when you reach out for help, they just expect you to understand what youre doing and close deals asap.

No early closure....). No worrying about work when you're off (unless a superior sends an email at 10pm on a Saturday night. Just take your work email off of your phone).
Excellent health benefits and credits for your lifestyle, such as gym membership , athletic clothes, music subscription etc","Superiors have a ""do as I say, not as I do"" attitude. Culture of secrecy and culture of unilateral changes. Superiors are usually locked away in their offices and barely make an appearance. (must be nice to be away form the driver mayhem). 

Experts are required to wear an Uber-branded shirt and dress casually. Superiors tend to not wear Uber-branded shirts and often dress too casually, such as ripped jeans (like a teenager), yoga pants or ripped capris. 

The drivers themselves are the biggest challenge. Greenlight Hubs have allowed a culture of intimidation and verbal abuse to become the norm. Superiors KNOW this fact but usually brush it off and go hide in their offices. Security guards have recently been brought in but many are unqualified and are there for an easy cheque to sit for 8 hours. Posters with Uber's community guidelines and behaviour rules towards Experts were taken down from the office for some reason (no reason was given. An example of the unilateral change). Experts are taught to conflict resolve, however many of these learning only work in theory and are rarely successful in practice. Superiors will normally side with the drivers and will question Experts on what they could have done differently. Many times Experts cannot do anything due to regulations, due to driver fraud, due to driver deactivation etc. and are still required to answer for this. 

Many drivers have enormous language barriers, are elderly or simply cannot use technology. Patience is needed for these potential drivers who are clearly unqualified and will be kicked off the platform in a matter of days for poor performance... 

Expert are rated after every interaction, regardless of what the visit is for. As mentioned with the culture of intimidation from drivers, oftentimes drivers will retaliate by giving Experts negative reviews and blaming Experts for being rude or incompetent when many of the issues the driver is having is beyond the Expert's hands. Common negative ratings out of Experts' hands include: licensing issues, documents being delayed in approval, police background check delays, multiple visits for a deactivated accounts.
There are no reversals for negative ratings, nor do superiors take into account why a negative review may have been left. Experts are required to answer for doing their job and relaying bad news. 

Superiors will bend over backwards for drivers, even to the extent of ignoring new COVID-19 appointment-only model and accommodate drivers who have a tantrum due to this new change."

You can work anytime you want, but I suggest turning on the app during the afternoon on weekends.
The process of being a delivery driver is much easier and less of a hassle than being a regular uber driver.
Also, you're your own boss. Just know that there's a rating system on your performance based on customers' experience of you.","The app can be buggy sometimes. The display can be buggy sometimes, although that can be because my iPhone is old. 
Sometimes certain trip fares won't process in time (although it's far and few between, but watch out nonetheless).
Even with prop 22, you would have to work extra just to make a living out of it. If you want to make a living without a hassle, do regular Uber. This is more of a job if you're just 19 and going to college or if you're living under your parents' roof (or both) and you wanna make some extra money to either spend or save up.
Sometimes customers can be a bit vague on instructions. Just call or message them if you're having trouble. There are rare cases where I couldn't do anything but cancel the delivery. There was one time a customer gave me a cross street and the customer's phone was expired. There was nothing I can do except cancel the delivery.

Colleagues - You get to work with smart, young and kind people 
Attached to the Uber name 
Pre-covid: office filled with snacks and drinks at your disposal. Free Breakfast and lunch provided everyday.","Work life balance is non existent. You are expected to work past 8am - 5pm work hours and sometimes on weekends. 

Feeling overwhelmed/stressed is guaranteed and it eventually feels normal. 

Lack of diversity starting at L3 positions and above... by diversity I mean in skin tones/ethnicity. 

Do you have loved ones that you would like to spend time with on holidays? Well kiss that goodbye because holidays will be spent working. “It’s the nature of the business...freight never sleeps” is what management will say. Don’t expect to be compensated with holiday pay or receive the following day off for working on a national holiday :) 

Oh and by the way, Recruiting will sell national holidays to you as a day off for Uber employees but you’ll get clarity that those days off are not for Uber Freight employees once you start :)

Favoritism is clear and upper management is not afraid to show it - the favorites are people who get to spend their day working on projects, in and out of “meetings” while other AMs handle operations.

Unlimited PTO is a joke... you’ll end up loving your team resulting in feeling bad every time you take a day off because you know the workload is just going to pile up for them

Workload is out of CONTROL. As an AM, be ready to perform all types of tasks (AR, operations, Carrier sales, tracking, customer sales) and trust that the pay does not match. 

Most of your 1-1 conversations with management will be about your accounts not about you or where you see your career going. 

With the consistent changes, it’s likely that you will have about 2+ different managers per year. Most people managers are stuck worrying about accounts instead of actually worrying about developing their direct reports. Can’t blame them tho...it all goes back to leadership. 

Stagnant career- it is really hard to move anywhere. By the time you hear about a new position, leadership already picked who is getting promoted (who knows if these people even interviewed for it)

HR...What even is that?

2942,Uber,Uber Eats has ZERO transparency for employees,2021-03-05,2.0,Delivery Driver,None that outweigh the risks to life and vehicle,"No transparency in driver reviews. Drivers are rated poorly by customers without the ability to dispute the allegations and accusations. If your rating as a driver falls below 95% then you lose ALL opportunities for benefits to include, healthcare, vision, dental, discounts on vehicle maintenance. Uber Eats offers ZERO transparency for drivers who have received a bad rating/review. If there is no way of knowing why a customer left a bad rating/review, then there is no way for a driver to perform corrective action or redouble their efforts to provide better customer satisfaction. This creates a negative dynamic of working for Uber Eats. There is no way to improve service or dispute possible libel/slander/defamation of character perpetrated by customers. I am encouraging a class action lawsuit against Uber Eats if they refuse to operate within the U.S. Constitutional rights to face accusers. If we are to lose our benefits due to a statistically impossible uphill battle to increase our ratings without knowing what the specific complaints of the customer are or if they are even factually submitted, then we have a serious legal issue that needs to be corrected. Transparency of driver reviews needs to happen now or Uber Eats will find itself the defendant in a federal case. Drivers are unable to dispute bad reviews by providing evidence from app screenshots, dashcams, and other documented recordings. Drivers are losing their benefits due to having to wait at restaurants for too long to hand drivers the food, having to wait in traffic behind stop and go traffic due to vehicular collisions miles ahead (the app has not improved or evolved to divert away from slow traffic caused by vehicular collisions ahead). Drivers are at the mercy of lazy people that don't get food for themselves. Drivers put their lives at risk at every intersection to bring food to these lazy people for very little compensation.

If Uber Eats intends to continue operating within the U.S. then it needs to start adhering to U.S. law. We, as drivers in the U.S., need transparency of our negative reviews, not only to improve our service to create better customer satisfaction, but also to dispute any slanderous/libelous, defamation and accusations made by customers. If this does not happen there will eventually and inevitably be a massive class action lawsuit against Uber Eats to affect Freedom of Information. You cannot revoke employment benefits (health, dental, vision) without an appeals process to dispute allegations against drivers. It is unethical, immoral, and irresponsible. Uber Eats should know better. If these manipulative practices that harm their employees' health and restrict benefits based on non-appealable and a non-transparent review system are not confronted by corporate and CORRECTED to create a healthier dynamic, then Uber Eats will ultimately gain crippling negative attention when the massive class action lawsuit is brought at the federal level. I am giving Uber Eats a very short time-frame to confront this VERY SERIOUS issue. You have been put on notice. Create a transparent system for drivers to dispute and appeal negative reviews that are possibly libelous/slanderous. The positive outcome will be that drivers will know what their accusers claimed and improve service to make customers happier or dispute false accusations that lower the driver's rating causing wrongful loss of benefits. If our benefits are on the line and Uber Eats revokes them based on customer lies, then the dynamic is severely flawed and the lack of healthcare could cause unnecessary deaths.

Other Cons: 
1. Customers are instructed by Uber that it is NOT NECESSARY TO TIP. This is harmful to the livelihood of employee drivers.

2. Over 65% of deliveries that pop up in the app are absurdly substandard wages for the amount of time and miles to deliver the order. Most are over 20 minutes and 7 miles for less than $5. Only 24% of deliveries are on par with properly compensating drivers for risking their lives through dozens of intersections across many miles. I have my own acceptable delivery prerequisites to accept a delivery. If the delivery is more than 20 minutes to conduct then the minimum earnings I will accept is $7. I need to maintain the serviceability and the safe, proper function of my vehicle. I need to fill my vehicle with gas once a day. I put over 700 miles on my vehicle per week while working for Uber Eats and I am not anyone's slave. I will not subject myself to substandard wages or slavery. So note to customers, we turn down your slave-wage propositions to deliver your food.

3. Restaurants are almost never ready with the order. On average, it takes me 8 minutes to drive to the restaurant after accepting the order on the app. Some restaurants are ready with the order before I get there. My personal observation is that the majority of restaurants keep Uber delivery drivers waiting for more than 15 minutes. I had 7 deliveries tonight in which I waited for the restaurant to give me the order for delivery. The longest wait time I endured tonight was 33 minutes at a McDonalds. THAT IS NOT ""FAST FOOD"". The delivery from McDonald's to the customer took me 14 minutes. It only took me 7 minutes to get to the McDonald's from the time I accepted the delivery order. I made less than $8 that hour. That is less than minimum wage for the hour. You will not be compensated for long wait times at restaurants. You will lose time and money waiting for food. Uber doesn't do anything to fix this.

4. Uber Eats only employs people from India for their support/help hotline for drivers. The accents are ridiculously hard to understand. It's their way to save a buck by outsourcing jobs to foreigners at a fraction of the cost. It wastes driver's time whenever there is an issue that needs to be addressed and the majority of issues are inadequately addressed and rarely resolved.

5. Customers will give fake addresses or incomplete addresses that cost drivers valuable time and effort. The driver will try to reach out to the customer by phone or text and only half the time will the customer actually respond. When this occurs it causes drivers to lose valuable time for zero compensation.

6. Restaurants will provide Uber with phone numbers that are NOT accurate. When delivering late at night, drivers don't want to travel to a delivery pick-up only to find out the restaurant has closed for business for the day. Uber Eats does NOT remove erroneous deliveries due to restaurants being closed. When one driver gets there and marks the business as ""closed"" in the app, the app just cycles it to a different driver. Drivers try to contact the business to check if they're open only to get an error message stating that the number is not in service. This happens to me CONSTANTLY. I drive across town to a closed restaurant that I tried to call through the app with no response and receive ZERO compensation for spent fuel and time.

7. The Uber Eats app itself has many issues. Quotas are not accurately recorded. Tips are not accurately recorded. You literally have no accurate accounting of how many deliveries have contributed to your quota bonuses.

There are many more problems with driving for Uber Eats.
In summary, the biggest issue with Uber Eats is waving the promise of health benefits in the faces of drivers if they can stay above 95% customer satisfaction rating of their performance, but they have ZERO processes in place to appeal or dispute their reviews. This hurts Uber Eats whether or not they acknowledge it. If Uber Eats created a feedback system by which drivers could view every individual complaint/review, then Uber Eats drivers could improve their service accordingly or dispute false allegations by providing recorded evidence that disproves the claims against the driver.

Note: I personally have a GoPro concealed in my clothing, a dashcam in my car, and I screenshot every delivery from acceptance in-app to pickup at restaurant to driving to customer to the way I follow instructions in-app as well as every name associated with every address I deliver to. I RECORD EVERYTHING and in the state of Texas this is LEGAL. Texas is a single-party consent state in which everything can be recorded and used as evidence in court. I have compiled over 2,000 hours of camera recorded content into a dedicated hard-drive. If I had the ability to face my accusers that gave me a poor rating/review and addressed their claims with my own physical evidence, then Uber Eats would have to nullify the vast majority of negative reviews against me, thus reinstating my well deserved benefits."

Many staff events, good salary and benefits (including a fair relocating package), lots of refreshments in the office. Very nice colleagues, a mixture of very interesting people from all around Europe.
Money comes on time, overtimes are always properly paid. Things such as homophobia or sexual harassment are taken very seriously and not tolerated.
They are not afraid to give you responsibility and trust you, even when you are new to the company.
Many options for promotion or a career change within the company.
They are willing to hire people with no or little experience, so a great starting point for your career. You also get to work with the newest technologies and follow current trends.
Many things are difficult to assess as they largely depend on your team leader - such as whether you can/cannot swap shifts with colleagues, etc.","Not open to improvement suggestions. Your opinion is ignored.
Sometimes you are forced to do things strictly according to the internal guidelines, even when it does not make any logical sense.
As a support, you are basically required to get rid of the customers, not to help them. This is even more visible when it comes to driver support. 
Quantity is more important than quality. The number of tickets you solved matters; not how you solved them.
Team leaders with no leading skills or experience, who have little interest in their team. They often have no idea of what you are currently working on or what is going on at your market.  Very bad communication within the team.
Internal communication between departments very complicated, you might as well never get to the person you need to talk to.
People are paid based on their nationality."

Competitive wages, bonuses, free and discounted Uber trips and orders on Uber Eats, and other free services like Navia and Lyra.","Uber's sick time and leave policies are ridiculously strict considering the pandemic and the fact that many of their teams are understaffed right now due to massive layoffs. 

Their leadership teams are inexperienced, (borderline incompetent,) and lack empathy for their staff. They engage in practices such as workplace bullying, retaliation for reports to HR, blatant fraternization (amongst leadership and subordinates,) and favoritism as a result. The high performers are not rewarded for the hard work, and promotions and manger references are granted only to those who get along with them on a social level. If you make a complaint, favor will automatically fall on the members of the leadership team and those they engage with outside of work.

The company's branches, (engineering, community operations, executive, etc.) operate completely independently of each other, and the comm ops branch is treated like dirt. If you work in the Greenlight Hub you can pretty much expected to be treated like a second class citizen. They even opted to stay open during an active stay at home advisory (after a spike in covid-19 infections) in Chicago, while their other branches were allowed to work safe from home.

While Uber boasts being a ""diverse"" company, their own recent report showed that most of the positions in leadership and tech at the company are filled by white men. Black and latino employees are still underrepresented in almost every sector of this company outside of customer support."

3742,Uber,Modern Day Exploitation,2020-11-23,1.0,Uber Driver,Can make a barely livable wage if you work really hard and know what you're doing.,"The company, specifically talking about the corporate leadership, and especially its algorithm actively work to thread a fine line between legality and exploitation. Very often find themselves on the wrong side of that line but survive because most employees do not have the time/resources to launch a lawsuit.

Also I am a full time driver who has over 800 trips and a 4.94 rating. I occasionally get texts/emails saying their system has detected improper use when I get close to completing promotions, and that continuing to do this may result in deactivation. Needless to say I have never done any of the things they list in their little mafia threat. I call them up and get no information on what triggered it and have to deal with a poor soul who is probably working hard just like me to make ends meet. And all they are able to tell me is that everything looks 'correct'. 

In my opinion, anybody in the company who goes to work in a suit, and does not actively participate in improving the app/algorithm, and attends meetings to make 'decisions' about where the company should go, should go."

3884,Uber,Broken Talent Management and Recruiting,2020-10-26,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Uber is a place where you can learn and grow a tremendous amount in a short period of time. They have some of the best engineers I've worked with and a very low-friction environment for getting things done. Some colleagues complain about some of the extra process and bureaucracy but relative to 99% of all other organizations this size, it really is a 1st world problem. During my tenure here, a was blown away by the sheer scale of the software and the systems used to power it from behind the curtains. I was given the opportunity to do Big Data and work on some of the components of their micro-service architecture. Having colleagues who were as capable and competent didn't hurt.

Uber is a very dynamic organization and they still move fast. They have been working hard to simplify complexity so teams can move even faster without sacrificing quality. In the time I was there, I was able to successfully ship several major features globally and establish myself quickly on the team. Never a boring moment.","Uber's recruiting process and talent management is broken. Having said all the above, if you join Uber in the wrong role forget about getting this addressed in a timely or even fair manner. You'll pretty much get the standard management runaround without any promises. In my case I applied for a specific role and was offered a different role which I was told happens quite frequently. After a year to 18 months I would be considered for the new role I originally applied for. Trusting that they knew the challenges better than I did, I decided to give it a chance but upon joining realized that the role offered was not going to be what I thought it was. Speaking with senior and executive leadership did not lead to any substantive steps being taken to expedite the process or adjust my responsibilities. I am a very senior individual and this was a very hard situation to be in given I had left a high-caliber organization to take on this opportunity. I chalk this up to a broken recruiting process that fails to properly assess a candidates strengths particularly if they come from an industry outside of tech and implicit interviewer bias. Talent management is also quite inflexible. Having raised my concerns multiple times with management there were no attempts to come up with even a compromise solution that would have modified my role to provide some of the responsibilities I sought."

They are useless and have still not provided me with an explanation. All they’ve said is “we’ll deal with it as soon as possible”.  I have been told by support the usual review process takes 24-48 hours. It’s been a week and a bit as mentioned. Please reconsider working for them - Apply for deliveroo instead, I’ve worked for them in the past and I can say they were so much more professional.

3987,Uber,Welcome to the Frat House,2020-10-12,3.0,Self Driving Vehicle Operator,"Great to work with the technology. Really got me motivated and in the office early, which really makes everything else that much easier. (mostly) Great group of people. It was a great experience to be all in on a project. For real! Not just what you said to get the job.","Management was void! Nobody knew how or wanted to know how to make a decision. They thinly veiled this fact with a pre-emptive ""Things change constantly so what happened yesterday may not happen tomorrow"" So what you ended up with was a few cliches that each had their own idea about what day to day was going to look like. I have never worked anywhere where an employee in a position above me complained about another employee as annoying or refer to another group as less than tolerable like at Uber ATG. It was Lord of the Flies meets Animal House. As a social experiment the job was a microcosm of the fall of the western civilization. So I have mixed feelings about it, I really - really - really wish upper management would have seen this, stepped in and given the crew direction. With a little focus things could have been amazing, instead the office in Tempe self-destructed within a year. 

It was NOT a place where you wanted to tell your team lead that you just had a unsafe interaction with other vehicles in public. I know because I made the mistake of trying to always inform the lead if anything questionable happened. My mistake! A slight infraction would turn into an eminent disaster and a case for execution would be made. Of course not everybody was subject to the same rules. Some of the things other people were doing were careless for the sake of being careless yet as far as I know that was not something of concern. It is not surprising what happened in 2018 happened. Safety was more a tool to keep employees in line rather than an ethic. The similarity between work at Uber ATG Tempe and Lord of the Flies is uncanny.

From what I have seen and what I hear, things in Pittsburgh are awesome, the Tempe issues were not relevant. Which, for me, means that working in Pitt would be a dream job! And I highly suggest it, Tempe is gone so this review is just me venting. Thanks for reading."

4071,Uber,One of the best companies that a fresher could work for.,2020-09-30,5.0,Community Operations Specialist,"The most striking feature of Uber is its support of intrapreneurship among its employees; The management encourages its employees to take initiative and allows them to take full responsibility and subsequent credit for their ideas.

Career growth; There is tremendous potential to grow one's career in the company. Employees get ample opportunities to learn new skills, work on projects, and ultimately, move to roles that appeal to them. 

The work culture is very team-oriented. My team leads and managers were very approachable, supportive, and insightful. My mentors were incredibly helpful and were instrumental in understanding the technical know-how of the job. 

All the employees are given access to a plethora of benefits; Free food, free transport, Uber credits, Wellness allowance that can be redeemed for personal care, gym memberships, and more, the list goes on.

All of the above factors contribute to an exceptional work-life balance that reflects the company's ethos.",None that I can think of.

Wasn't also fare in the selection of people to dismiss, as it eliminated the training and sales department, giving the message that it's not investing in new business and not investing in training for employees. Non of the friends-of-a-friend were impacted by the dismissals and over 6 000 employees were layed-off ""due to covid"" even with the business growing, leaving employees that staid doing the work of 2-3 former colleagues.
It's super bias and selective when it comes to recognize and praise the employees, people need to be well connected to receive this awards that is usually connected with money.
In order for you to be promoted you need to be very well connected, like for instant to be part of the City Team, only elite gets there and it doesn't mean that they are the best fit.
It's a big company managed by amateurs."

That’s totally unfair when different riders have different expectations and new driver may not meet all of those expectations. Uber deactivated my account based entirely on low rating they asked me to take some course and put my account active but only for one week or so trial and then deactivated permanently.. ! this short time is unfair and deactivating only for some riders giving me low rating without better investigation is completely unfair! Uber has now lots of drivers and got rich company they don’t lose much if they deactivate some drivers like me and Uber never gives second chances with longer time trial periods for drivers to present their fit and good performance! I was new to Uber and they didn’t care about giving more chance and longer trial period other than a few days ..

- They provide opportunities for development and support you.
- Ability to move pretty fast and test things 
- Autonomy to test and innovate in small markets
- Tech is top quartile in industries they operate, and despite issues is still growing well and operating with the benefit of secular trends","- The many rounds of layoffs have really killed the culture.  Most people, even before the Covid layoffs, were always constantly and openly discussing other companies they were interviewing for and not excited about Uber
- Some managers are really great, while others occupy the roles largely based on when they joined.  
- Apparent lack of trust and transparency from the C-suite goes both ways.  
- A ton of natural turnover in senior and important roles has not helped the culture and created a spiral of turnover, potentially driven by slightly below market comp and increasing bureaucracy
- Uber hires talented, smart, and experienced people, but often assign them to tasks that do not fully utilize their skills and interests, a bait and switch on the job description
- Executives surround themselves with “yes” people and are not open to hearing divergent opinions from anyone else.  Executives only hear what they want, and punish individuals who question or provide alternatives."

4438,Uber,No long term vision,2020-07-26,2.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"Ideas over hierarchy - They really do value good & novel ideas and you are given the freedom to try out new things as you please. While there is a lot of hierarchy, it isn't highly ingrained in the system, so everyone has an equal say and the freedom to disagree with their superiors.

Benefits - The monetary benefits are really top notch. There's free rides, medical checkups, wellness budget, in-house food, happy hours, swag, etc.","Poor management - With the attrition rate being pretty high, the average tenure is around 2-3 years. With such short tenures and the need to constantly out-perform, managers don't have any incentive to invest in their subordinates' growth. So while you might have the freedom to disagree with your superiors, it works better for your growth within Uber if you don't. They merely see you as resources that need to be managed and need to optimise their team performance for maximum output.

Quality of work - Uber Ops is divided into a central team and then regional teams (India north, south, east, west). When in a central team, you are married to a single workstream and shifting between teams isn't very easy, so you need to be really sure about what you are getting into. Regional teams are now relegated to ""on-ground"" Ops, where essentially you have no say in any strategy & planning (which is done centrally) and are left to execute your central level peer's ideas. And unfortunately, many of your peers in the central team, having never worked on anything tactical, are blithely unaware of ground realities, leaving you to execute a poorly thought out plan.

Bloated org -  After the centralisation, there is a lot of redundancy and the need to 'invent' work for yourself. The perpetual reorgs according to leadership whims and threat of job loss has made the work environment toxic."

-free swag
-unlimited PTO (used to be for all employees, now only salaried employees)","-no work/life balance: if you like to have a social/personal life outside of work, UF is not the place for you. Good luck getting time to yourself, especially if you work as a lower level team member in account management. ""Uber Holidays"" do not apply to Uber Freight, and you will often hear ""freight never sleeps"" as an excuse. If you are salaried, you will not be paid overtime and are typically expected to work on holidays. If you are hourly, you will have to fight with your other coworkers and hope that your manager will let you have the day off.
-Toxic work environment: did you hear someone saying something inappropriate on the floor and you want to report it to HR? Are they an L3+ employee? If so, your complaints will go unheard. Management has been reported to HR for everything from sexual harassment to racist remarks to asking other employees for drugs on the floor and get a slap on the wrist. Lower level employees have been fired on the spot for an off-color joke. Are you someone that isn't a straight, cisgender white man? Enjoy staying in a lower level position with pay that is much lower than your straight white male counterparts! 
-Young employees: Expect to have someone recruited straight out of college to be your manager, even when there were plenty of people more qualified and with seniority in the office or on your team already. Oh, and expect to train your new manager and continue coaching them throughout your time below them.
Constant restructures: Don't get too comfortable, your team is always changing! You may get one account, you may have close to 20 accounts, and those accounts may constantly be changing due to frequent reorgs and restructures. 
Useless management: Do you love being micromanaged by someone who does absolutely nothing and/or isn't at all qualified to be your manager? Then this job is for you! Expect to have a new manager on a rotating basis. In the 2+ years I was at UF, I had 6 managers. Only two of them fit the bill for a ""good manager"".
White out culture: Uber loves to boast about how inclusive they are, but the reality is that most employees of color are in low level positions when white men are in charge. Yes, there are ERGs like Pride, Black at Uber, etc - but don't let that fool you. As mentioned above, if you are not a white straight man, you will not be paid or treated as well as your white male counterparts.
Slackers, slackers, slackers: Expect to pull your weight, plus the weight of countless others who can slide by doing less than the bare minimum. Expect to be drained, exhausted, and overwhelmed while your coworker hangs out and shoots pool with someone from sales and marks it off as an ""important meeting"" on the calendar.
High school all over again: If you loved high school drama, maybe UF is the place for you. With a younger working population, Uber feels more like UHS rather than a legitimate corporate office most of the time."

Good salary","Bad environment for women. Management ignore feedback from women that they are underrepresented and need more development and lean on token hires as a way to prove that there are no problems. Most middle managers are male, making it hard to speak up in meetings as they constantly talk over each other.
No one is action oriented anymore - the focus is on making good presentations, not actually achieving any output.
The company mission has become really unclear, mostly due to the ELT skating around the fact that Uber is about making money for shareholders, not proving transportation and earnings opportunities. 
The COVID redundancies were handled really poorly. Employees were made unnecessarily anxious and then those that were terminated were given a 5 minute webinar and no support."

It like watching butter spread too thin on toast, the way ventures have been set up. They lost vision and purpose a long time ago and its only a matter of time before it goes belly up. If someone is smart they should go in for the kill now and acquire them. Every meeting is now about laying off people but none of it is performance based. They have an HR department that believes it is more important to mollycoddle agents who are atrocious at work and penalise leads who only do their job. The whole place has just gone backwards.

4845,Uber,"Very impressive onboarding experience, even more impressive place to work",2020-05-11,5.0,Senior Operations Manager,"Top talent - It was clear from the second I started that everyone around me was the best at what they do, without fostering an unreasonably competitive environment. Everyone sounds genuinely invested in the success of the company and personally driven by their book of work, believing in the impact they have on the business.

Culture of overcommunication - this applies to leadership and peers. I never felt left in the dark during any part in the onboarding process. They made me feel like my experience really mattered to them. After onboarding, I've been very impressed with the level of transparency from leadership, especially compared to my past experience in Finance. Having a global all hands every week where ELT candidly answers all top of mind questions from employees is unheard of in Finance.","People management - given how young the company is relative to other industries, you tend to have young people managing only slightly younger people, and so you lose a level of career coaching you'd otherwise get from more experienced managers. Your career development is very much marketed as your own responsibility and ownership falls 100% on you, so I don't get much of a sense that an individual's performance is tied to their manager.

Job security - during the COVID crisis, the company's approach to layoffs has been made pretty clear. They are not shy about making cuts where ELT feels they are needed, especially as we target profitability as our north star. It feels like cuts could come at any time and impact anyone, without a lot of warning (although they have been very generous in terms of severance packages when cuts have happened)"
4846,Uber,The Circus Kindergarten,2020-05-11,1.0,COE Specialist I,"Well.... maybe freedom in the beginning and access to tech tools, like databases to have the possibility to grow and learn.... lost after 1 year.","From the beginning I had the impression everything was too naive and disorganized, but at least there wasn't any kind of aggressive micromanagement and workload was fine. Then the management always wants more and more for free (the contract is tricky: as a community supporter you do everything required to support....well not specified what). They open more and more positions in the company and they remove the access to all tech tools to the first level support forcing them to work like a machine reading solution from a KB page (not even updated). Disorganization has always been the key of this company. Nobody is able to give a right answer except 4-5 people... we are almost 500 in total. Management is totally unuseful. The work of 4 people can be done only by one. Most of the managers don't have the minimum idea how technically performance is calculated or even read a graph. They just pretend super performance from support teams and they just trust data calculated from the tech team (not here in Krakow). There are pseudo-tech positions here that are paid the same as not technical (the paradox of the language benefit) with absurd job titles (panini specialist) and duties limited to copy and paste that don't give any possibility to grow inside or outside the company. The HR...totally lost in the beginning (they weren't even able to give me bureaucratic advice for the basic employee mandatory tasks: making documents, paying taxes....) To not speak about reception... Once she pretended I wasn't there and she told me to look at the map when I asked where the meeting room was. High management is totally unprepared to market changes. The online news on external sites are more updated than them. There is always this feeling of something hidden kept as secret and shared only between managers, but the management is so unprofessional that act like a fool by writing global email with lies easy to scam."

Specifically AA. Discrimination and passive aggressive behavior comes at every level from the global head of operations all the way down. Felt unwelcomed from the first day I got there.

Every conference room you sit in will contain a not-insignificant percentage of the smartest people you'll ever meet in your entire life.

The pay and benefits are good. The opportunities for advancement are certainly there, at least if you're on a software team, and I advanced very quickly.","Nobody decent stays, outside of a few compassionately led teams, so this 5 year old company toddles like an 18 month old. The Pittsburgh cohort of software leadership is old school, if not old, and is filled with inexperienced, hot-headed, and immature men, half of whom are bullies. Their leadership methods seem about 20-30 years outmoded and completely out of touch with what kind of culture must exist to retain talent in the modern workplace. A handful of teams seemed highly valued and decently happy, but EVERYONE is stressed, all the time. Plenty of teams are treated like garbage, and entire orgs are hacked apart based on the political skill of their leaders, instead of their effectiveness at helping to deliver vehicle autonomy. 

I would not join anything in operations, and would advise caution as a senior employee when joining any team outside of Perception. If you're a talented leader, please join -- I still have a lot of friends who work there and they need you. The lack of clear goal-setting and the constant pivoting will make you dizzy if you're a by-the-books type of worker; probably best to do what you think needs done."

If you enjoy driving or don't mind it, it's an almost bearable job.
Also, you can request payment everyday (but it takes 3 days to get to you...).
Nothing else.","The worst Support Team EVER!
They take days even weeks to reply to you.
They misspell words.
They love to recite their script and not actually communicate properly.
They don't actually read what you say, and then reply with nonsense, which doesn't help you at all. And if you are waiting for them to aprove a document, or something else, then be prepared to not make any money for at least a week.
Are they amateurs? Badly trained? Doing it on purpose? Maybe a combination of those factors. But truly irritating.

Uber loves to spend less money with essential things, and line their pockets more and more, while passing on the cost TO YOU, THE DRIVER.
They know many of their drivers don't even understand or want to know about this, since this is a job WITHOUT INTERVIEW, they let ANYONE IN, even people with NO ENGLISH or basic skills. This is FACT.

They took away the ability for their drivers to CALL IN and talk to a human being on the phone. They rather you use the internet (only on the app, not on any browser though..) to navigate through the maze of FAQs and find the hidden SEND US A MESSAGE.

They have nothing but complaints from customers too, just go look at their reviews and social media pages.

During COVID times, they took even longer to reply/help their workers, which is the worst time to do that.
Also, the CEO of Uber doesnt want to treat the workers as employees, but during COVID, the CEO asked THE US GOVERNMENT FOR A BAILOUT, which means he wants the taxpayers to give money to these gig workers, for sick pay, etc. YES, this is the world you live in, with these shameless soulless corporations/companies.

We are all humans and from our paycheck, we have (but most don't) to set money aside for many things that Uber doesn't pay for.
Like vehicle depreciation.
Vehicle Tax.
Fuel/electricity.
MOT.
Income tax (registering as self employed).
National insurance contribution.
All of these things, you have to pay for, with the salary you receive.
(gross and net income, look it up if you dont know about it, because most drivers have NO IDEA about it, most are immigrants who dont care).
So your net income ends up being A LOT LESS because Uber wants more money for themselves and less for you.

There's more!

There are MANY restaurants that break the rules and nothing ever happens.
Uber's complaint process is non existant. I mean, you can complain, but you know nothing happens, and if you talk too much, like I'm doing, THEY TRACK YOU AND TERMINATE YOUR CONTRACT, so complaining actually does you harm!
Restaurants that have 5 plus drivers waiting inside, because these greedy cnts receive an order and dont even wait a bit before requesting a driver.
So you end up waiting 30mins plus FOR ONE ORDER (delivery).
Understand? The online order goes from the customer to the restaurant, and the restaurant then IMMEDIATELY requests the driver to come and PICK IT UP, but the food is FAR FROM READY, so you end up waiting and losing time (MONEY) or simply cancelling the order and wasting Fuel.
Oh, you can get punished for not accepting many orders or cancelling many orders.
Why? If we are truly self employed, we are supposed to be able to CHOOSE what restaurants we want and dont want to go, etc.

There's way more but who cares, right? No one will even read or care about this, the CEO is getting richer, nothing changes, we die, repeat cycle.

So to sum it up, they exploit mainly immigrant workers, calling them PARTNERS and classifying the workers as CONTRACTORS and SELF EMPLOYED, when in reality, YOU ARE NOT SELF EMPLOYED, since it goes against 90% of what SELF EMPLOYED actually is.

Oh, they recently got together (lyft, uber, etc) and spent a lot of money to LOBBY and go against a ruling in california. Look it up.

So you know, work for them, but never forget you are nothing to them, less than nothing even."

The management team is clear about our vision, transparent about mistakes, and emphasizes that busy work not related to our key objectives should be avoided. People here are smart, driven, and welcoming. Internal career development is encouraged and there are resources to jump from one function to another if you have the initiative to take advantage. The company also focuses on diversity and inclusion initiatives and appears to be very committed to their goals. No issues except the one I listed below.","There are a lot of employees at Uber. This often makes it difficult to communicate effectively to those who need to be informed or looped in for approvals. For that reason, you don't always feel like you've covered all your bases."

Upon leaving the company after a couple years as a FTE and working at other tech companies in the Bay Area, the label of being a former Uber Employee stuck in a bad way. 

If you find a prospect within the company, expect the interview process to last months if you are not a direct referral. The performance reviews were the most strenuous I had ever experienced--The process seemed to last for months at a time, so considering teams restructured numerous times within that span..you were often scrambling to secure solid peer-reviews."

That's it. Great pay tbh..... can work nearly any state so if u travel u can still work. Several benefits like college, gas, etc. Literally a dream job.","Obviously repetitive. Extremely repetitive. But that's what delivery is so it's not really a con... Most jobs are repetitive. It's mindless. U just pickup, deliver, pickup, deliver, pickup, deliver, pickup deliver... Over and over and over and over and over again and again and again. 

Which is why they say it's more like supplemental income. I do it full-time right now so you can imagine how I feel lmao. 

The good thing is I've been learning a lot by seeing so many bars, restaurants, and other food chains. Also discovering my city and beyond. I'm in the DMV so I've been all over northern virginia, DC, and Maryland. So this kind of offsets the simplicity of this job. I'm not only traveling/discovering, but I'm also learning about people's lifestyle, living conditions, food choices, mannerisms etc. I'm seeing so many different homes, neighborhoods, etc. So much context if you have a curious mind. 

But if you just see it as a lil job to finesse some money real quick and don't pay attention to your surroundings and literally just pickup and deliver, then it can get quite painful."

£10 a day for lunch, until they take that off you #findthemoney

Cool office.","Management don't give a crap about greenlight. Over the years they've slowly kicked greenlight out of the big picture. Making staff easily replaceable. Running offices on the bare minimum. Even when there's a protest. No security. No care for experts. London is the only thing that matters in the UK. Slowly taking all the perks away because Ubers gotta make some money somewhere. Maybe stop giving incentives to drivers and actually care for your own staff? Experts are constantly doing other people's work. Lowest paid role in the company but you're doing the most work. Doesn't make any sense to me? 

Every expert has to clock in and clock out of every single activity throughout the day. Even on lunch! It's disgusting that managers want this all recorded. Picking people out when they're not ""pushing their weight"". Getting spoken to like crap when you clock in 2 minutes late. 

London license is the only thing anyone cares about anymore. Stop trying to #findthemoney and invest in your staff. People who have been there since year 1. Launching products and earning the big bosses millions. What did we get in return? A stock option that's fallen through the floor. 

People in Aldgate tower know nothing about private hire. They literally sit in their glass tower telling experts what to do. What calling campaign to work on. What hub to cover because they don't have enough staff because they've all left! Banning hubs from hiring new staff so you've got 2/3 members of staff looking after thousands of drivers per city. IT'S NOT SAFE. You stand up to safety when it comes to riders but couldn't give a damn about your staff safety. 

They'd rather spend £22,000 on a self check outs for all the offices than to give staff a proper bonus. Replacing greenlight staff with a computer hooked up to cheap labourers in the Philippines is not the way to do this. You've got support staff that haven't got a clue about UK laws or private hire laws. 

Drivers were treated better than the support staff. Making support staff wait over half a year for a bonus that was nothing compared to the drivers bonus is a real kick in the teeth. Drivers got their bonus instantly. 

You wouldn't be pulling in millions a week if it wasn't for these experts that joined all these drivers up. With calling campaigns, bringing them through the driver funnel getting them licensed and onboarding them. We are the face of company. We are why Uber is taking in millions. Not because of the keyboard monkeys in the head office.

Do not work for Uber. You're better off driving for Uber. You're treated better as a driver."

Many of the people left are the ones who are good at playing politics, while high performers were let go. There's no rhyme or reason for the current roles that people have, because this company has the perception that anyone can do marketing and that it requires no real skill. 
Creativity and accuracy are not prioritized -- just take a look at Uber Eats ads: filled with nonsensical copy,  misidentifying foods, etc.  And lastly, if you are a woman, you will constantly be mansplained to by men who don't have your expertise, talked over in meetings, and picked apart much more than your male counterparts.

If you're having a bad day just sign off app. Get paid up to 5 times a day through the cash out option in the app or once a week through the free direct deposit option. You can make great tips, meet interesting people, and develop your own territory.","Market is over saturated with new weekend warrior type drivers 
You rely on tips more than you should in my area because Uber Eats (all gig jobs) is so thoroughly over saturated in my market (Tampa). 
Many people tip through the app and I believe that it now suggests tips which means you'll get pocket change instead of $3/5 dollars extra per delivery. 
Considering how low you are paid a delivery ($3/8 $8 if its 20++minute drive) getting no tip or a pocket change tip can make it so you're not actually making profit after car expenses. 
The higher gas prices mean nothing to Uber, they don't adjust pay scale.
The new updates actually cause me to lose up to $4 per delivery comparatively to how much I made per delivery before update.
You get a LOT of scammers in my area, funny enough happens more in the middle class than ""ghetto"" or working area at least in my actual experience, at least once a week, never fails.
Make sure to take pics and use chat to customer in the app and screenshot as well if customer asks you to leave the delivery somewhere or if something seems off. 
Customer support doesn't EVER look into how badly customers scam drivers and the service. They don't want to lose the money. They get 35% from every single delivery a driver completes, 35% every delivery a restaurant prepares, and then the fee $4.95-$6.95+ from customers as well, so they will pin it on you before losing customers $$$.  
You have to be great at time management and keep yourself motivated no matter how bad the area is that week. 
Uber doesn't limit drivers in areas so it becomes incredibly over saturated.
 Over saturated areas means poor drivers you have to clean up after."

Even if it could be difficult to move up (was a very flat organization, which was good in a lot of ways), it wasn't hard to make lateral moves, resulting in new experiences with fresh things to learn and skills to develop. They took reaching pay parity in 2017 very seriously and I went from feeling underpaid to feeling valued. Same with revamping a previously toxic review/bonus structure. 

Despite coming on board somewhat fresh out of school, with little experience, I was trusted with a lot from the start and felt empowered and motivated throughout (most of) my career. 

Employees are treated extremely well in terms of perks (unlimited time off, snacks and catering, amazing health care, credits, and more). The only problem was that some employees were embarrassingly entitled and incapable of recognizing how amazing we had it. My friends and family would have killed for a fraction of that employee treatment. Luckily, there were plenty of chill cool people I made lifelong friendships with and they weren't the ones complaining about free food.","Depending on the pocket you were in, things could be functional and healthy and positive. Or they could be bad. Things undeniably changed for the better in 2017 as the company was forced to get its act together because journalists did their job and reported on real problems at the company. I had terrible, fine, and incredible managers. The same with my teammates and upper-level management. There's enough autonomy that people create their own mini cultures, for better or for worse. It was something I valued overall, but can lead to pockets of undetected dysfunction. 

I don't need to bring up the challenges of working there in the early days—now, the largest cons are the organization is still sprawling and unwieldy and there's a lack of cohesion and collaboration, especially in brand/marketing. Leadership has been getting progressively more defensive and cold and cynical."

- All of my peers are extremely dedicated, passionate, intelligent, and are a pleasure to work with. Uber does a great job of selecting the right candidates for positions. They achieve this while also having an excellent focus on diversity and inclusion. 
- The company's focus on driving a culture of ""doing the right thing"". Being able to witness the company's culture norms from the inside has turned me into a champion for this company. I am proud to work for Uber, and I enjoy conversing with people about all of things we are working on to strengthen our culture, and products. 
- You are encouraged to try things, evaluate, and try again. Uber is still young, and because of this you are encouraged to seek out opportunity and capitalize on that opportunity. 
- Things change FAST, and OFTEN. You are doing something very wrong if you get bored working at Uber. This applies to all positions, anywhere in the world. 
- You are encouraged to ""act like an owner"". You forget you are working for a massive, global company. You are encouraged to own solutions, take action, and solve problems. You can see and feel your impact.","I personally enjoy having these conversations, however some may say that a con to working for Uber is having to ""explain"".  When you tell someone you work for Uber there is almost a 100% chance you will continue to have a full conversation about the company. You will hear about an experience someone had that one time while taking an Uber, you will have to talk about events that occurred several years ago, you will have to educate people on misinformation or misunderstanding of how our products work.

Complete disconnect between driver support and Uber. If the customer changes their address it becomes a HUGE waste of driver's time to rectify the situation. Sometimes it's better to cancel an order than deal with the ramifications of a customer making a mistake. 
Takes a while to get used to following the directions.  There's no extra info, like where the main entrance to a large apartment complex is, or the app tell it's on the wrong side of the road. 
Customers frequently try calling you while you're driving creating a dangerous distracting situation."
5337,Uber,Community Support Representative,2019-11-19,1.0,Community Support Representative,"You will meet great teammates here, good location , free food and healthcare, and the wages are okay for starting out and the company itself is not too bad.","No progression, no sick pay, no opportunities to further yourself,  extremely bad work/life balance and extremely biased. The management are terrible, I can't even fathom as to why they had been promoted as they are completely computer illiterate, one member of management actually asked agents how to copy and paste for a technology company this is preposterous. 

The reason for management being so incompetent is that the hiring panel for promotions is held by their close friends who they had started out with. They overlook anyone with skills if they are not in their own circle and if one member of management seems to dislike you they then all dislike you. I have never come across anything like the management I have seen in Uber. 

Agents on the floor are expected to work two weekends in a row with one weekend off. Over two months this comes to 3/8 weekends off for agents, working 11-hour shifts a day for 4 days max and working until 12am with bright fluorescent lights causing many agents to have migraines.

 They provide no counselling for agents on a certain floor that have to deal with unthinkable calls regarding violence of all kinds and are made to delve deeper into issues reported to Uber, I would not be surprised if someone developed PTSD from what they deal with. 

The stress levels have caused many agents to call in sick every week so that they can take a mental break from what they are made to deal with which of course no sick pay is provided. 

The management has driven the place into the ground and has gotten away with bullying, theft and sexual harassment that has been reported to the overseas HR many times but of course kept hidden due to higher management not looking to rock the boat especially regarding the sexual harassment from on member of management who has been reported a number of times for being completely inappropriate with female agents on the floor and outside of the building. 


The management seems to have their own rules completely away from the company rules itself. 

What I had noticed while working at Uber was the lack of diversity at the building it, it came across as discriminatory in every way towards POC, disabled people and LGBTQ. 

The CEO needs to take a deeper look into the way this company is being run in Limerick city, and fix it before anything worse occurs that can affect the stock market and its PR especially for a company that carries such values and says it does the right thing I can say the right thing is never done in Limerick city Centre of Excellence."

Heavily micromanaged with very little autonomy given to staff to show initiative or create ideas. 

No HR on site, meaning issues often get swept under the rug. 

Roles suitable for graduates maybe that are seeking some experience. 

You won’t stay longer than two years in this company. Very little rewards or opportunity for progression.

5371,Uber,"Fast paced, plentiful learnings & great colleagues",2019-11-06,4.0,Community Operations,"Workforce, opportunities (if you work for them), benefits (you are looked after), travel opportunities","Politics, like anywhere. Reluctant to pay for promotion"
5372,Uber,Good Out of College,2019-11-05,4.0,Account Representative,"Lunches, little micromanagement(although it’s getting more like this), easy product/service to sell,","Complete change of culture. Feels a lot like a Corp company and feeling more like a number than before. Limited work space due to the over hiring of sales reps. You make about 37,000 as an Account Rep. underpaid and hardly livable if you have loans. The exciting growth period of uber eats is gone."
5373,Uber,Great place to work,2019-11-05,5.0,Workforce Manager,"Uber has been focused on ""Doing the right thing"" and that permeates to all levels. You really feel appreciated in the company and they offer great benefits. They are also very focused on giving you opportunities to grow and learn, ensuring your growth is part of your career within the company.",Currently the culture is in a shift from an older startup mindset but it is part of the change.

5375,Uber,There's a lot of good while you're working here.,2019-11-05,5.0,Software Engineer-I,"Benefits are amazing. You get enough uber credits for 15 trips in your work city (about $300 for me) that you can also use for uber eats, a fitness credit, a phone credit, and free breakfast and lunch during the work week. Depending on the team it's also quite relaxed, so long as I'm getting my work done my manager is perfectly happy. Also, unlimited time off is actually really good if your manager is chill. I also work in infra, and the career opportunity is amazing. The engineers I work with quite simply are brilliant.",There were a bunch of layoffs when I was starting out & lots of worry about the current company stock price. The company isn't completely structurally sound so starting at this job you're taking a certain amount of risk. Like job security is non-existent here; there's little caring about the employees future. ALSO they don't match 401k which in this day and age is crazy.
5376,Uber,Awesome place to work in,2019-11-05,5.0,COE Specialist,"Great work environment and conditions, the company cares for employees and makes sure everyone is integrated and welcomed and happy to be working. There are many internal opportunities.",Honestly I don't see one...
5377,Uber,BDR,2019-11-05,5.0,Business Development,"Working with high skilled colleagues, you get all the right tools, training, support and you get to work on very challenging and promising projects.  The managers have a strong background and therefore you learn a lot for them, they know how to empower you and I think this is very important to be felt supported. Continuous learnings, career opportunities as the company grows and develops its product portfolio.","Not to be seen as an inconvenient but definitely something worth knowing. There are still some rests of the old fashion way of working, with a higher stress level and result-driven management. That naturally comes with an optimistic company's growth and project for the coming years. Hard work is not an inconvenience here, but definitely something good to highlight for those not disturbed by this."
5378,Uber,Its a sinking ship,2019-11-05,3.0,Engineer,Core product is pretty good.  I did learn a lot,Leadership at the top has no clue.  Can't lead of motivate.  Office is empty by 5pm.  No excitement any more about the company. People are tired.  Please remove Thaun and have someone with a vision and communication skills and a back bone.  All the engineering now going offshore so very little career op's - very little room to move unless you pack up your life and go over seas.

Best job I've ever had, even with management issues.","Top-Down management is horrendous. No single source of decision making.

5381,Uber,KPI's continually affected by sudden change,2019-11-04,4.0,Client Success Specialist,"- Food, drinks, snacks, benefits, laptop, ERG's, employee discounts, vacation policy, etc.
- Compensation was very reasonable.

- Working with clients across the US and helping them make more money on the company's digital platform. 

- Your work could change things at the company / your work could impact the way people eat food nationally.","- The whole team was too new to the company's way of doing things. We constantly had to work with our team managers to figure out if new changes to the program will affect our KPI's at the end of the year. 

- The coaching was a bit dry when it came to meetings with manager's about personal KPI's.  

- Losing and adding of accounts to book of business due to adjustments in employee head count."
5382,Uber,Fast Paced,2019-11-03,3.0,Project Manager,Uber is fast pace and allows for autonomy and ownership; especially for someone younger in their career.,"The constant re-orgs and re-postioning cause a confusing work experience. Clearly transitioning from a startup mentality to a more structured and rigid work place, which slows pace and causes an incredible amount of repeated work. 

Pay is not reflective of work expectations for work."

Good growth opportunities, a lot of autonomy and freedom to choose what you want to work on. Smart colleagues, nice office with great lunch (Amsterdam).","On-call duty in engineering teams. High turnover  in management roles. Uber doesn't seem to be doing well as a public company so a lot of uncertainty. It's a very fast moving company, the engineering teams are more on the senior side so it's a tough place for new grads. A lot of autonomy and independence is expected from engineers pretty much from day one."
5387,Uber,The Change Is Real,2019-11-01,5.0,Analytics Manager,I had some reservations about joining Uber given the issues raised in 2017 but they have done a major course correction and seriously cleaned up their act. The place is tremendously diverse and full of very high caliber workers. Management does a great job of communicating and being as transparent as possible.  As a woman I feel unlimited and hugely supported in my career.  I appreciate that they acknowledge the bad stuff in 2017 really happened and they don't try to sweep it under the rug or deny it. They have faced it and are making real and positive change.,"[my diamond shoes are too tight] with such a supportive, friendly environment I spend a lot of time in group community service activities and celebrating peoples birthdays, Uberversaries,  and accomplishments. It's a bad place to be a curmudgeon. 
[All these 50's won't fit in my wallet] They feed us constantly. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks up-the-wazoo, team celebrations (see above), Pops Ups with custard, yogurt, churros. This is a terrible place to diet."

5457,Uber,UBEREATS  Might be decent as a side job for extra cash. Wouldn’t suggest relying on this job to make a living.,2019-10-03,2.0,,You can start and stop working whenever you want. Being able to get cash everyday with instant pay and the work is simple.,Very low pay below minimum wage a lot of times. Even before you take out gas. Not even including mileage on vehicle or insurance. Driver support/ customer service is horrible. Never once had any of my questions/dilemmas answered or took care of. Seems like the messaging support is computerized response.
5458,Uber,Be cautious; working in Greenlight is damage-control for the company,2019-10-02,2.0,Expert,"- Pay slightly below fair value, however the company provides you with benefits to offset this
- Monthly credits provided for Uber/UberEats 
- Great health, vision and dental plan
- Opportunities to “nomad,” and work in other Uber offices","- Schedule can be inconsistent; during peak times of the year (around holidays or events occurring in your city) you will be expected to take on overtime. This can also happen when there are significant changes taking place internally that require training. Turnover was very high in my office, with only a single employee lasting a year and the rest ranging from 4-8 months. The team had also gone from 13 to 4 people in less than a year. 
- Communication is dreadful. Trying to contact HR or anyone outside of your department for assistance is a nightmare. Issues that require escalation are not followed-up on in a timely manner. 
- Greenlight as a department is not given the same attention. As someone who had the opportunity to travel to a company event at HQ to meet with colleagues from cross-functional teams, there is a negative stigma internally revolving around Greenlight due to its public-facing nature and is unfortunately looked down upon and seen as inferior by many. There is also a ladder system when it comes to progression within the company that can severely cripple the types of positions you would like to apply for as you can essentially only move up to a single position above you or on the same level after you’ve met certain requirements. 
- High stress environment. Traffic within your office can vary drastically depending on the location you are working in, but after working in this position you eventually come to realize that so many of the issues driver-partners come in for on a daily basis virtually have no solution or are outside of your control, placing you in a sink or swim environment. Smooth talkers and people who are great at coming up with excuses on the fly will do fairly well in this position as you will encounter many situations that you will unfortunately not have an explanation or answer for.
- My largest issue with the company is hypocrisy. Discussions with colleagues in different departments resulted in generally favorable perceptions of the company itself, which as a new hire I originally possessed. The company has great values when it comes to integrity and doing the right thing, however it is in this position where you will find yourself questioning those very things when you are given talking points for difficult interactions with driver-partners that urge you to change the subject or deflect. Similarly, a large portion of your metrics and bonuses are based on customer satisfaction, and yet you are pretty much set up for failure by how many disgruntled partners you will be unable to help because there is no resource or solution to their issue.

Managers generally do not micro-manage (which is great!) but like any tech companies, if you gotta do the work and meet deadlines, you gotta do it, be it on your paid time off or not.

Great welfare. Free breakfast and lunch and heaps of fancy drinks and snacks.

Non-negotiable compensation policy -> double-edged sword but works well for me.

HR experience was stellar. The recruiter was prompt in relaying the interview results (usually within the same day) and what was absolutely helpful was when she brought up both the 'what i have done well' and 'what could have been better' so that I could work on the 'what could have been better' for my next round of interview.

5479,Uber,My worst working experience,2019-09-28,1.0,Inside Sales Representative,Awesome team of talented people.,"I worked as Account Sales Representative for Uber Eats in Lisbon and I resigned less than 3 months after the beginning of my contract.

It was by far the worst work experience I have ever had.

Ridiculous salary, no responsibility or recognition of work, no opportunities of evolution, extremely toxic management with a surreal turnover and an unhealthy obsession from the management to exceed the target. While knowing that there is no remuneration on the performance !!!!!!

Let's go into details now.

1- Lies from the recruiters

Recruiters tell us that they are looking for talented people who really want to pursue a career in the company with a real evolution within Uber.
Besides that, it is specified during the recruitment that the Sales Representatives will have a remuneration on their performance every 3 months that can reach up to 20% of their salary.
In reality, the performance bonus is revised downwards by Uber, which justifies the reduction of the initial bonus by a lot of superfluous criteria and this bonus will never be paid after 3 months but at the earliest 6 months after your starting date and some will have to wait until 8 months to receive it.
In reality, Uber uses this fake performance bonus as a retention bonus.
Recall that this bonus is a weak incentive because it represents only a handful of euros for months of waiting.
It is worth remembering that the Uber Sales Rep entry contract is only 6 months, which forces the employee to renew his contract to receive the bonus. Otherwise, he will never receive his ""performance bonus"".
Finally, Uber is selling itself as a ""start-up"" atmosphere when in reality this is a bureaucratic environment to its paroxysm


2 - No recognition

In the offices in Lisbon, most Uber employees are Customer Support Representatives
The management makes no distinction between a Customer Support Representative and the Sales Team. Whether in terms of wages, or regarding the inflexibility of work schedules, the remote working is prohibited of course.
Furthermore, doing customer service or sales does not require at all the same degree of education or qualification ...

3 - Toxic management.

With very low wages, outside the reality of the market Uber lays the foundation for an environment in which pressure and frustration will prevail.
A constant pressure from the managers to overachieve the target, while we are not given anything in return.
Not only are we asked to exceed the objectives but in addition to work on additional projects outside our contractual functions and all this while avoiding asking for overtime.
Many promises are made but very few are kept. Uber's strategy is to promise promotions, or bonuses to keep employees. Then the bonuses are permanently pushed back and the promotions given to a handful of people.
Uber does not reward its most successful employees but reward the most docile ...


I have never seen a company in which more than 80% of sales employees are dissatisfied with their job and for most of them are looking for opportunities to leave Uber.
At the time I write these words (1 week after my resignation) already 4 other colleagues have resigned (the sales team is less than 20 people ...)

Conclusion:

Uber abuses its brand image to attract overqualified profiles for the tasks they will be given
No bargaining power. Being a Sales Representative at Uber boils down to dealing with administrative tasks while reciting the same word-for-word pitch all day long.
If you are an ambitious salesman go your way, Uber will bring you only regrets and disappointments"

If you have an opinion about the way that riders or customer concerns are handled you are considered a problem. If you are over 35 and attempting to move into management positions it likely will not happen as this company generally has ageism tendencies. Every few months you are herded to a new department based on your metrics and job security is an illusion here...you could be put on a performance warning or on your way out the door at any moment if you don't learn an entirely new line of business in a few weeks. Also, it's a very cliquey environment, if you don't pucker up and act like your team lead or manager is your favorite person on the planet and you want to be just like them one day, you will be an outcast. If you aren't into the same things as your team, you will be an outcast. I've never worked in an environment where people have a problem because you don't wish to go out drinking and partying with them. I've observed people get promotions here simply because their friends are the hiring managers, even if the person was in no way qualified for the position. This company will also peer pressure and sometimes give employees no choice but to help create new lines of business and actual positions, then tell them all they need to apply for the job they created only to be told that they aren't qualified for the position! This is THE single most stressful company I have ever worked at. Between the sexism, ageism, favoritism, and low key racism (they staffed MOST of the African American employees at the Phoenix location on evening shifts,  during off hours and made it near impossible for them to get a day shift position). I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone I actually respect. So many employees regularly take extended periods of time off to deal with the stress and anxiety they experience working there. Additionally, they compensate below market value for the same positions found at similar companies."

Internal politics are pretty gross and counterproductive.

Tough to make business savvy and aligned decisions at the mid levels because someone's political ambitions may get threatened

The Marketing layoff was executed pretty haphazardly. All marketing strategy employees were laid off...and not one product marketing person? Hire mgmt consultants for this next time and be aware of political motivations.

MGMT is Getting pretty cheap about the wrong things. 

HR is a bit sneaky, spin-doctor-y. They shifted a larger % or the equity portion of the bonus pool to tech workers from non-tech workers since the tech workers are harder to retain and recruit."

Apparently the computer has the final say of how long or what direction should be taken and not the customer! As I usually leave it up to my riders but was told by Uber that my time or route was improper and required me to pay them back!

5671,Uber,"Great on Paper, Not in real life - Limerick COE, Ireland",2019-07-30,1.0,Customer Service Representative,"Some of the benefits - ie. healthcare, free lunches, summer parties, etc.","I’ve never been so let down by a company in my life. I was there years, and was repeatedly stabbed in the back, and refused promotions - for no reason. 
I literally had one hiring manager email me to say that the reason I wasn’t going forward for a promotion, is because she didn’t like the colour of the font I used in my application. (And yes, I have that in writing).
I was lied to repeatedly about promotions - they only care about the handful of people who are besties with team leads and managers. To the point where they’ll cover up felony convictions and give people promotions as a bribe to keep them quiet.
They use the tenured agents as pack mules and then reward them with nothing - no bonuses or salary increases for your length of time there, your just paid the same as someone walking in the door.
They’re now restructuring the entire building and despite promises of no one being let go - they’re downsizing every team. Tenured agents are being pushed to lower level teams without reason - just because management don’t like them for whatever reason. 
I had one team lead confirm to me that one reason I was never considered for promotion was because the team manager had a personal vendetta against me, and had just decided she didn’t like me. To the point where she let a false allegation be lodged against me and I was taken for disciplinary - even though I had proof from other supervisors and management that it didn’t happen. But said manager flat out said she didn’t care, and listened to the false allegation anyway.

Some of the teams deal with incredibly difficult and sensitive cases, and hardly any support is given to CSRs, let alone the sufficient training. And if there is a tenured CSR trained, they’ll force the case to someone else with a better job title and give the other person all the credit.

I left on horrible terms - promised a promotion in the interview, only to be told I never stood a chance afterwards. Left crying in the meeting, and the manager didn’t care - just harped on about how brilliant the other candidates were. They don’t care about you. The building has gone from <100 to 500+ in less than 3 years - to them you’re just a number. 

It all seems great on paper until you walk in the door and realise the reality of what’s going on. It’s absolutely appalling."

I witnessed a number of inappropriate things from middle-management  - ""let's put you over her since you're black"" - and many immature comments from managers that I've never seen at other companies.  Some of these types of employees are gone; some are not.   Many but not all middle managers tend to be  ""the last one standing"" rather possess true leadership and management experience and are learning on the job with little guidance.  Often the ones I'm referring to create an environment which berates its corporate employees.  Ironically it resonates with Uber drivers who feel devalued no matter how hard they work."

I haven't been in my role for more than 6 months, however, I've already contributed to multiple projects that have had an impact across the whole ANZ market. 

They do more for L&D than I've seen anywhere else - really investing in their employees. They also understand the impact of culture on a workplace and put money behind team activities and initiatives.","If you're not used to a start-up environment, you'll need to prepare yourself for the volatility of things changing extremely quickly - process changes, product updates, compliance/legal workflow, etc."

It’s a great place to grow and learn as an entry level seller with a people in a competitive environment. Also, best company benefits I’ve ever seen.","If you don’t hit your quota at 100% every month, you’re fired. At least 2-3 people fired a month. There was also a number of people quitting because they knew early on they weren’t hitting their quota and were looking for other jobs. If you’re new, they don’t care. Everyone is replaceable. Its stressful panicking every month not knowing whether or not it will be your last month. The base salary is very disappointing and the market is becoming so saturated right now and harder to sell into. If you’re thinking of moving up the ladder quickly, don’t bet on it. They don’t promote internally often enough. But when they do, you better have a couple of years under your belt and top notch numbers. Not easy to move around in the company to different departments either. Good luck if you decide to work here!"

I’ve been through 6+ reorgs in the 1.5 years at the company. In two of these reorgs it was counter goals to the previous one (hire more decentralized offices > centralize in 2 cities, etc.).

My last manager was the most toxic person I've ever encountered in my entire life. We were constantly encouraged to speak up against bully management and when I did, I was shown the door. This individual was not respectful of my mental health conditions and was downright insulting on a regular basis. I actually had started up a lawsuit against him and was told that my proof of his conduct wasn't admissible in court, which does not negate his guilt. After leaving I learned that he continued to bully his subordinates without consequence and was also rated the worst manager in IT just after he was promoted after being on the team for only 6 months. I was turned down for promotion multiple times due to the fact that I never had a manager who paid attention or cared about what I was doing. If my work didn't put this person on a stage, it wasn't important to him. He became buddies with the HR rep and that's when he made it all about me and said that I was the problem. I stood up against blatant disrespect and abuse and I was forced out. This culture hasn't changed, it's reality is just shoved under the rug."

The Seattle office has a great work culture where it feels like a startup but you actually get to work normal hours.  I'm typically in the office from 8:30a-5:00p, and I tend not to work in the evenings or on the weekends.  My colleagues are bright, friendly, and supportive, and the office's site managers do a stellar job of making this a fun environment to work in.  There are several employee-led groups focused on anything from diversity to beer-tasting. Lunch, snacks, and drinks are free, and the office is in a beautiful location overlooking Elliot Bay.  The company's culture seems to have undergone a heavy overhaul, and my concerns about working in a difficult or toxic environment (based on recent press) have thankfully been completely put at ease.  I've been impressed with Dara's leadership and am very optimistic about the future of the company.","There is a decent amount of technical debt due to moving fast, so data and tooling can hamstring projects and lead to hacky solutions.  I think Uber is in a transitional state of figuring out to how to operate at scale with excellence, so I don't think this is a permanent problem.  The company is changing rapidly so it can feel a bit like getting whiplash as priorities shift from week-to-week, but as long as you can roll with the punches you'll do well."

5834,Uber,Incredible Journey,2019-05-11,5.0,Strategy Manager,"People, people, people. Assume good intent, smart, hardworking, funny. I go to work every day because of them and they will  be my friends long after i leave. 

Quality of work - So many fun challenges to solve. If you find one,  run! and everyone supports you there. 

Management: This is perhaps my personal experience. Uber has done a ton to train up managers (when I joined, lots of young first time managers who didn't understand the difference b/w IC and people mgmt.  That has since changed a TON or the better). Lots more structure around development conversations and 1:1s. In my  experience, Uber management  empowers you to chase the problems you find interesting (as long as there is business need) -- and are very supportive of folks internally . navigating the . company to find . the next role if the. current team isnt  a good fit 

Career Trajectory and Navigation -- You can run in directions you can't even imagine in! I've had 3 roles over my past 4 years, worked across operations, strategy, analytics, growth marketing, process optimization . with even a stint in People Development.  I've . had to ""find"" my next roles, and in one case, wrote the JD for it. I find that exciting because you can truly build a career you want as long as there is a happy marriage with the business need -- not much red tape there, just patience needed.","Don't expect compensation to dazzle you. Come here if you're excited to build and work with your teams, and. grow your career in a way you can't even imagine. Do not come here if money is your P0.  You will always be disappointed 

Career Pathing - do not expect the certainty of banking/consulting promos (e.g. - 2 years and next level guaranteed etc). While we now have competencies and ladders roled out (finally!), it's very much a lattice framework in terms of career navigation. If you're ok with that, Uber is heaven as the opportunities are truly abundant. If you're not,  Uber is uncertain and frustrating."

Uber is a special place where “best ideas win” and you are able to make changes/innovate and see results quickly.  Work-life balance was tough in the early days (necessary) and got to a very comfortable state later on.  The ppl they surround you with at Uber are legends. Truly some of the smartest ppl I’ve ever had the pleasure being around. Uber changed my life and I highly recommend it as a place to work. From TK (the man!) to Dara....this place is still a rocketship taking off.,"Once Uber got big (ie: 10k+ employees), they really have a hard time tracking what ppl do and should be “cutting the fat” of ppl with no impact a lot sooner.

Early employees got paid poorly for the amount of work it took to grow the company (can’t speak to what employees make now), but who cares, it was all worth it for the stock!"

If you want someone to check and keep asking everything what you work on, then it is the place your are looking for.

5960,Uber,"One of the best places to work in Europe, in tech",2019-04-03,5.0,Senior Software Engineer II,"Background: I’ve worked at top tech companies in Stockholm, Berlin and London before, including Facebook.

Uber in Amsterdam is on the top of the range both for engineering culture/excellence and compensation. For expats like myself, the 30% tax ruling and no capital gains tax make compensation especially attractive - especially as Uber grants meaningful stock on top of strong base salary & bonus as part of the package, unlike many EU startups.

But while comp might be something to get people in the door, it’s the tech culture that makes me stay and love working here every day. In Amsterdam, we own and solve global problems from building distributed systems with four 9’s of reliability to architecting scaleable systems that can support new lines of businesses like Freight and JUMP, on top Rides, Driver and Eats.

Code ownership here is strong, code quality high - from required and high quality reviews to automated tests, dedicated teams building advanced tooling for all parts of the development process. Planning and architecture is a focus point and democratic: anyone can suggest new initiatives, but these need to be written down clearly and send out to (pretty much) the whole eng org. This means there’s a firehouse of information on what’s going on and even for experienced people like myself, I found my learning accelerate, seeing how other engineers attacked problems.

Finally, the reason I enjoy working at Uber over other top places like Facebook is autonomy and impact. Similar to FB, autonomy of teams and individuals is very high. However, unlike FB, the impact per engineer is consistently very high across projects - chances are you will single handedly architect, build and roll out features used by millions, with large financial impact.

There are various teams in Amsterdam, internal mobility also being good and it’s easy to move between teams.","Working with the SF HQ is something that will keep being logistically challenging - in planning phases of projects, meetings after 6pm will be common.

As we head towards IPO, we have more processes - as lightweight as they aim to be, they do add up and result in more mandatory annual trainings.

As Uber is very transparent internally, the noise levels on email, eng planning and all hands will be high: you need to learn how to efficiently filter things not currently relevant to you."

I had once my account suspended on the app despite having a very good rating from customers. I received a message saying that I would be contacted. Uber did not say when. I had to wait because there was nothing I could do. 
Then, when Uber decided to contact me, I was told that someone has said that I was driving another car. So, when I asked who, I was told that it was confidential. So, I asked what car, what colour and I had the same answer. 
The Uber agent asked me to explain myself. I said that it was really easy to double check that since the car had 3 cameras and that it was a rental car. So, the agent opened the app within the minute without even checking what I said. 
Today, I had again my account suspended and I am told that someone would contact me. I spoke to an agent from Uber who said he could not do anything and that they had a department that deal with accounts suspended that no one could get in touch with.
What a poor service. I understand why the UK Government is so unhappy with Uber. They are offering a very poor service in comparison of much they are making from their customers. Uber is making money with drivers but do not act as business company but rather as a predator.

At least half of the team planning to move out."
6099,Uber,Disappointing Years of My LIfe,2019-01-16,1.0,Restaurant Operations Specialist,"The people I met at Uber were friendly and diverse culturally. I also like that we had free snacks and meals. Location is decent, located near a BART station though that will change soon with the new office in Mission Bay.","I don't even know where to begin, everything I learned through my experience at Uber was basically a confirmation of things NOT to do when managing a team, building a new org, developing new processes, and implementing policy changes to external customers. Perhaps it's given me valuable insight into what doesn't work.

The company grew quickly and has reached a size, in my opinion, that isn't considered a ""start up"" anymore. However, the tenured folks there still had that ""move fast, break things"" mentality without realizing that now their mistakes have a cascading affect across 100s of people working in their org. I'd like to have seen more strategic and intentional decisions versus experiments (sometimes even ignoring data) based on ""intuition.""  I also continued to see people being handed roles only because they were there at the right place, right time. 

Middle management was the worst I've seen with first-time managers who had little understanding of how they should serve their team. There was no trust between my team and my manager although we got along well outside of work. With this type of management, there was no accountability into one's work and very little (if at all) individual goals.

Dara's All Hands were usually inspirational,  but I rarely felt proud about my work. I wasn't challenged and felt like I was wasting my time, not being able to contribute in a more meaningful way. My skills and experience wasn't put into good use.

All of my coworkers are miserable in their roles and feels stuck. I pray that they will be able to dig themselves out of this hole and find something more engaging. The benefit was also SO BAD and management continued to ignore and delay a proper response despite MONTHS of effort from team members across the US to bring this topic to the forefront. When I left the company for a new job, my new salary literally increased by more than 3x of what I was getting at Uber."

On top of that, they aim to keep a structured approach to work-life balance and professional development. 

As to the recruiting experience: it was definitely the most intellectually challenging processes I've been through.

There are many good teams in the org with necessary contributions such as hardware, laser, vehicle platform etc and it really takes a larger org to build a self-driving car","* Repeated strong success of deep learning models coming out of this group comes with a territory and politics in the org which is really universal across humans/workplaces especially in a competitive area like self-driving.

* It is very important to be unaffected/able to stay out of wider politics and continue cranking out work/results if you are at Uber ATG. This can be challenging but overall the results coming out of ATG Toronto, the problem and data are amazing and the org is moving in the right direction.

* Not all humans in the wider org are unbiased/honest with themselves. Some of them are, more should strive to be. This is a fact of life in most organizations unfortunately.

- As a woman, I feel respected and empowered most of the time (still not enough, but a lot more than average - even when comparing to how I felt at FB)
- Friendly casual environment, I enjoy perks and working with my colleagues.","- Leaders are a problem. It’s a common opinion that we have to fix top management positions. COO, RGMs, GMs and other senior positions in S&P, Comms, CommOps are way too Uber 1.0. Even Barney that joined 6 months ago hired by Dara is very criticized by the lack of inspiration and leadership.
- The ops org lacks strategy and efficiency. Barney has stated his 5 priorities, but there’s no clear path to get there. Operational inefficiency with loads of overlapping between teams and no clear definition and alignment on roles and responsibilities, some teams are overstaffed while others are understaffed, no clear decision making process. And the lack of seniority on leadership teams is a blocker for faster improvement on efficiency.
- The company is urging for a massive reorg and seems not to have the guts to do it.
- HR teams need a lot of improvement. I was never able to speak with my HRBP even asking many times for 1:1s, giving that I manage a team of 9, that surprises me a lot.
- American company with operations around the world. It’s a not a multinational company. Uber is super US centric and I’ve never heard a good reason for that. Development (eng) centers in other regions is more than urgent!

- Comp relatively lower compared to other options on the market. Process not objective and transparent.
- Big company vibe growing. Energy and positive vibe of pre-media storm TK days no longer present. Old timers leaving in high numbers. Dara is a seasoned leader who will try to do the right thing but he is not a tech visionary/disruptor like TK. Expect to see more ""growth"" via M&A rather than products and innovative tactics like in the past.

- Uber seems to really be making an effort to do right by its various stakeholders in the wake of several controversies surrounding the company in 2017.
- Excellent opportunities for career growth. Uber rewards effort and impact with generosity and fairness.
- The business continues to grow rapidly even though it is already huge.
- Dara is great.","- The company is so huge that learning to be diplomatic when working with other teams is a necessity. Sometimes the people you have to work with will not want to help you but you have to find a way to deliver anyway.
- There was a period in 2017 when the company was in a deep cultural crisis. That was a weird time and things are very different now than they were pre-crisis. Uber is a little more grown up, but a little less fun than it used to be.
- Some co-workers other teams have told me their work life balance is less than ideal."

  If you are an uneducated, unprofessional person with poor hygiene, you'll fit in.

 It's similar to high school.

Major things change on a daily basis. Like schedules, policies and procedures with little to no notice.

Everyone tries very hard to be important. Always coming up with some ""amazing"" project that's a joke.

They do not match 401k, and tell you about future raises that never really pan out.

The sales people are viewed as scum here. The sales org is basically run by operations and they have no idea how to manage a sales org. They set out of this world goals that are impossible to meet, thus creating a toxic and misserable place to work. 

Also everyone is so ultra sensitive. I feel like I am walking on eggshells all the time. There are ears and eyes on you all the time and gossip and telling on people is rampent. 

The fun has been sucked out of the company. Unless you are an engineer in SF or an operations manager, the company could care less about you. 

I thought the computer would have changed but I am more misserable than ever here. 

The pay is garbage. There is no 401k match. The equity is laughable at best.

There is absolutely no sales training and coaching. Career mobility is zero. And there is nothing else to sell other than 1 thing. By the way you are not allowed to negotiate and can not use any numbers in your sales, and because we are Uber we have to be super careful of the technical words we use or we can get fired. 

This is not a sales company. Most sales companies treat their employees with respect and have fun. Not this one. 

Their mentality is, you are lucky to work here.

I worked in the Chicago greenlight hub on the South side, it's not the best group of drivers to work with (nothing but hair bonnets, PJ's and background records). They segregate you based off your race ( nothing new in Chicago) Supervisors have their ""favorites"" based off who they like and not performance. They don't care about employees and what they deal with. I literally saw an employee being threatened by a driver in front of supervisors and no one stopped what was going on. You'd be better off working in the COE. Supervisors are snobby and out of touch with what their subordinates deal with. This company was better when I was working as a contractor vs being hired on as a full time employee. Training is horrendous! Everything is disorganized. Most of the leads are up to their elbows in stress. In the end this place left me with high blood pressure but it gave me the strength to find another job that actually pays what I'm worth and oh so much more. Good luck with this job if you apply."

Your mind opens in ways you can't actually imagine and you are always thinking of new ideas and how to improve. And most importantly you can speak up to your beliefs always. Also there is always something new going on, it NEVER gets boring at all. It is a fast changing company very committed to make cities a better place for their people and their families",Well cons.. I think it has more to do with the past of Uber as a company. It used to be a company with a really bad brand image and is always in headlines for making really big mistakes.

6740,Uber,Overall I'm happy working for UberEATS,2018-03-30,4.0,Delivery Rider,Flexible. No middle management to answer to. Good rate if you work fast and efficiently. Communicate well through emails to drivers and riders. Increasing business coming online. Local Greenlight Hub.,Awful support. Unable to deliver during bad weather. App sometimes has issues.
6741,Uber,If you are willing to get your hands dirty and make a huge impact this is the right place for you!,2018-03-30,5.0,Senior Community Operations Manager,"I could list the pros all day, but here is a select few: 
- awesome team: 95%+ of the people I work with at Uber are amazing and people, who I consider friends, not just colleagues 
- you can be yourself: want to wear shorts and thongs to work? this is the place for you! In my experience you can be your authentic self (whatever that may be!) 
- treated really well: despite what you might read in the press, Uber is not an evil company trying to take over the world. At all levels of the company I have found that everyone treats each other with respect and values their ideas and opinions. Sure there are a few bad apples, but the great people far outweigh them!","- it's a bloody lot of work: if you love to take things on cruise control this is not the place for you. It's definitely not a 9-5 type environment (and I hope it never becomes that!) 
- public scrutiny: you need to be thick skinned as not everyone will love Uber as much as you might. Whether it's an unhappy driver partner that you need to win back over, or a know it all relative at Christmas lunch, you will find yourself talking about Uber 24/7 (and often defending/explaining the company). It can be draining and you need to be ready for that. 
- crazy amount of change: personally, I love the pace of change, but it's definitely not for everyone. If you like routine and hate ambiguity and seemingly endless changes this is not the place for you. If you are happy to roll with the punches and make the most of every situation, then you will do just fine."
6742,Uber,Great place to work,2018-03-29,5.0,Data Analyst,"Motivated people, great benefits, great culture","Company grew too fast, resulting in some bad hires."
6743,Uber,Great place to grow and make an impact,2018-03-29,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I've worked for a number of great companies over the years: Google, the games industry, research labs.  I can with confidence that Uber is the best place I've ever worked.

The challenges are fascinating.  We're not just building a website or driving ad clicks.  We're attempting to fundamentally change the way people and things are transported around the globe.

The impact is tangible.  At a place like Google, it's easy for an engineer to feel lost in the weeds.  Uber has become a big company, but every project still feels vital.  Every engineer has the chance to affect millions of riders and driver partners.

The opportunities are abundant.  Uber has grown faster than any startup in history, but that growth meant there wasn't always time to build to scale.  That's both a positive and a negative at times, but on the plus side, it means there are many parts of our tech stack that can be optimized and improved by a motivated engineer.  If you want to take ownership or a project you feel passionate about, no one is going to get in your way.

Change is happening.  2017 was a real wake up call for Uber.  Thankfully, the company took note and listened.  We're now refocusing on the longterm sustainability of growth and talent.  I've seen so much positive change happen in just over a year.  It's been a roller coaster of emotions at times, but it always trends upwards.","On the con side of the tech debt problem I alluded to before, there are parts of the engineering process that are painful at times.  We've been committing resources to fix it, but there's still a lot of room to improve.

Different parts of the organization still feel oceans apart.  Maps reminds me a lot of Google, other parts of the company feel like other organizations entirely.  We still have a ways to go towards homogenizing our values and standards, but things are improving.  Just be mindful of which team you end up on if you decide to join.  that said, transferring is easy and encouraged.

The media attention can be draining.  The world can't seem to stop talking about Uber.  In some ways it feels motivating to be working when all eyes are pointed your way, but it can also be painful to be put under such intense scrutiny."

6747,Uber,Expert In-Person Greenlight Hub,2018-03-27,5.0,Expert,"Meeting people from all over the world and helping them is an amazing opportunity. Being the only point of contact that is in-person often means you are also the ""last line of defense,"" which means you are an alternative way to make the Drivers in your community feel better in ways that might have frustrated them until they meet with you.","The training process is not where it should be and nearly everyone seems to have a bumpy ride on their way to getting the hang of things, which can be daunting. Also, because you are often the third point of contact for Drivers...many people need to be shown a lot of empathy and understanding, along with being told ""bad"" news from yet another source. This can make for somewhat uncomfortable and emotional moments for all involved. So if you don't have a lot of patience for people's emotions and a willingness to attempt to deescalate situations through compassion and empathy, this may not be the right place for you. 

The responsibilities for each location can vary widely and it may not be clear what is expected of you in any given scenario, even though your role is defined in detail. This is sometimes off-putting and can make you feel insecure about what you can, should, cannot, shouldn't, or absolutely NEED to do at any given time. Clarity comes with time and experience."

Uber also allow you to work in another city or country you choose after 6 months working in the city you got hired for (but of course it is based on the result of several tests and job availabilities).",Uber is a highly competitive environment.

Compensation package for new hires is competitive. Some projects are truly interesting. A lot of things are being fixed. Overall, things are probably better than most other startups in similar stage.","Lack of communication inside the company is still a problem and I don't see it getting fixed any time soon. I do feel a lot of times, decision making is pretty much top-down. Onboarding experience needs to be improved a lot. Product goals are not well aligned between different orgs. Overall, I don't feel that a lot of folks care very much about others and what they do.

Upper management is still being stabilized. Some folks who joined 3-4 years ago are leaving, but this situation is understandable and common in startups at this stage."

Experts are expected to maintain unrealistic performance metrics while maintaining office and city operations duties while being paid less than the industry average for office admin. I could go to a govt job and easily make close to $30/hour for the same duties. Managers are out of touch and do not understand the goings on of the Greenlight Hubs. Remote “site managers” rely too much on data and not enough on feedback from Experts. Managers belittle Experts when they ask for more staffing or complain that performance metrics are unattainable. Central Ops make large scale changes to policies and give Experts no notice of the changes. GLH managers are out of touch and rely only on data. Driver partners are abusive to Experts and don’t listen to the advice we give them. Experts are constantly undermined by online CSRs and phone support reps. Experts are the front line of the business and are severely underpaid, have no room for growth in the company and take the brunt of Central/Driver Ops mistakes while these managers hide behind their computers and only suggest to practice empathy as a solution. No clear training provided for Experts who transitioned from contractors to FTE. General chaos in the org, marketing managers being in charge of tax information when they’re not qualified to do so, lack of responsibility taken by senior managers. Performance reviews are long and excessive, no real desire to help out when we are paid less than some of the drivers."

-The program/platform breakdown can cause issues where some program teams don't allocate time for tech debt and engineering excellence.
-The alignment between product/design/eng could be much better (work in progress)
-No dedicated on-call program where the volunteers make extra $ and not everyone has to contribute. This is what the other big players do and is a more mature way of operating."

I started about three months ago and the welcome experience has been tremendous.  Training on internal resources and the company was significant. Team members in my group and employees at large are super friendly and highly intelligent.

- Great organizational culture - specially since we're improving it; there's no hierarchy levels cause your voice is always heard no matter what level you're speaking to or are, flexible working hours (depending on the role of course) and I actually feel it's a company that cares for its employees
-There's a lot of career opportunities - specially since we keep growing globally
-Promotions  are according to your performance and skills, not only due to seniority at the company","-Poor balance between personal and professional life.  It has been quite stressing but leaders are actually working on fixing this 
-Some managers are young so we still need to improve trainings for them
-I started as EXT and they changed some tenure rules which caused pressure and conflict among my team - which hasn't been solved as we've expected"
6810,Uber,I've never felt so autonomous and empowered in any other job,2018-02-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- I had the opportunity to be one of the first employees in Uber in LATAM. It's been amazing  to see how fast it has grown and all the potential we still have. Back in the days (July 2014) we were operating with Rides in 7 cities in the region, and we are now in more than 130. We now have UberEats too, expanding rapidly.
- I haven't had the chance to get bored in almost 4 years. New projects and challenges coming up every day.
- I've also had the opportunity to grow, start hiring and build a team
- It is very goal and objectives driven. You are set up with tasks and goals, and you are free to do whatever you think is best - but making sure to deliver!
- They trust you and will help you along the way
- I'ts been truly inspiring to see how Uber has changed from inside out, changing its mission, priorities, etc,  but always listening to employees and doing what's best for them
- I'm confident we are heading to an even better place.. and still with plenty of challenges ahead","- The fast growth was also a bit painful. Constant changes, switch of priorities every time and we didn't really got to plan anything, just react and deliver.
-  Its very hard to be in a company so publicly known, where you see negative news almost every day... most of the times these are not entirely true. 
- As we grew so fast, we tried to grow our people very fast too. We got to a point where we had lots of young managers - that were first time managers."

I find a lot of meaning in my work and I feel it is very much needed - Uber is growing a lot and Recruiters are viewed not only as ""the ones who fill the roles"" but also as a Business Partner.  
It's an young company and everyone is open to listen and build together.","With the rapid growth, you can expect long hours - but everyone is very respectful of your schedule and personal needs and the environment is one that makes time fly."

There are still many changes we need to adjust internally to create a better work environment.  For example compensation across all countries in Latin America. 
May managers are becoming managers for their first time in their lives. Even if this represents a great opportunity to grow, the company needs to invest more time/money in coaching. We need to create more leaders."

6868,Uber,One of the best tech opportunities in Europe!,2018-02-05,5.0,Software Engineer,"Tldr; It's amazing. Apply now.

Why Uber:
- There are just a few tech companies, where you work on problems of such scale (petabytes of data, 50k+ QPS etc).  
- There are even fewer companies where you solve problems in the real world, ie. you're not helping people share cat memes, you're providing millions of partners from hundreds of countries, a livelihood.

Why Uber in Amsterdam:
- Impactful work: This isn't just another satellite campus. Uber Engineering in Amsterdam works on problems, that are essential for business.
- Work/life balance: Maybe this applies to more places in Europe in general, but you're encouraged to pace things in a way you're comfortable.
- Phenomenal compensation: almost 50-100% more than competing firms in Amsterdam, while this might be less absolute money than offers in SF or London, the cheaper cost of living in Amsterdam ensures you have a very comfortable life.
- Great Benefits: Apart from regular things like insurance, and gym membership, you also get about ~300 EUR of Uber credits a month, you can use them on rides or to order food from Uber Eats, you can basically get away with never cooking dinner.

Why Amsterdam:
- Beautiful city, amazingly located especially if you want to strike off over a dozen travel locations from your bucket list. 
- Everyone knows English and is very friendly towards expats!
- Theres a tax benefit for High Knowledge immigrants in the Netherlands, that'll bring down your effective tax rate to about 25% (from 50+%.)",At present growth opportunities (for positions beyond Sr. Engineer) seem limited as opposed to SF.

6968,Uber,Vehicle operator,2017-12-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Benefits are good and that’s about it at this point. A lot of changes made it a bad place to work.,The new internal mobility program prohibits people from opportunities to grow their careers at Uber. Level 1 and only move up one level.

6971,Uber,Horrible place to work,2017-12-23,2.0,Expert,The health/dental/vision benefits are good. Uber credits are a plus.,"Too many overnight operational changes, Experts (on the frontlines) receive information on these changes too last minute with barely any explanation or instructions on how to deliver these changes. Upper management/operations unfortunately like to hide behind their computers and expect the underpaid Experts to take all the heat. Management does not care about employees, too cheap to spend on things that miiight make for a better workplace environment. Managers often talk to employees the same way they talk to drivers, making them believe what they are doing/subject to is normal.  For tri-weekly meetings, you are required to stay after work hours and are NOT PAID for 30min to 1hr gaps between working hours and meeting. There are MANY features of the operation that are marketed as beneficial to the driver however they only benefit the rider (upfront pricing). Managers are too focused on their bougie lifestyles and don't care for the people working for them. The role of an Expert is something I would not wish upon my worst enemy. Only reason I rated 2-stars is because of the benefits. They're good but not good enough to keep me in a job that will send me to the madhouse."
6972,Uber,Read the contract closely before you sign it.,2017-12-22,2.0,Test Operator,"Great perks and benefits.
Cool technology and growing industry.
Most co-workers are friendly.
Really awesome job to start out.
In the beginning, I felt like I made a difference and helped to improve the technology and the future. 
My job felt like it had meaning.","The reorganization.

I was hired as a Test Operator and I loved the work we did. It was challenging and fun. The managers cared, listened, and respected us. We were a productive, engaged team. I was happy and, as far as I could tell, so were the rest of the test ops team. I felt like I made a difference. 

But it was too good to last.... They announced a reorganization complete with all new job titles. One of the job descriptions was almost exactly the same as what we were already doing but we were told we would no longer be allowed to do this work anymore. We would need at least 6 months with Uber to apply. Our department had not been around 6 months and all but a handful of us did not meet that requirement. The good news is that this new job would come with a raise, if you were able to get it. 

Our new job would be VO, the job duties were significantly decreased and we lost some of our benefits. We were merged into another department and now work under their management.

The work now feels meaningless and empty. I’m unsure of the short term goal and can’t seem to get a clear picture of how the reorganization contributes to the longer term goal in any meaningful way. I’m struggling to keep motivated with the loss of direction and my role in improving the technology through this new position. 

Our new managers play favorites with the people they have been working with from the beginning. We’ve had no opportunity to get to know the people we work with/for. 

Most employers grandfather people in to their benefits/job duties when they make a decision to reorganize like this. It shows respect for the talent that you have recruited with the promise of these benefits/duties."

There are many folks who have been with the company for years, and classic startup, have been promoted to management roles without spending the time actually getting the necessary experience. There are many managers who are first time managers. This leads to chaos, a lack of organization and inability to take action on behalf of their teams and fix issues.

- Recent organizational changes have resulted in a reduction of hours, benefits, and responsibilities for those in my role.

7031,Uber,"Good product, poor leadership and low transparency",2017-11-30,2.0,General Manager,"1) Uber is without doubt a great product.
2) Furthermore its fast pace environment isn't rivaled in terms of speed by many companies. 
3) Additionally, some colleagues (notably at GM level) were among the smartest and most interesting people I ever worked with. 
Uber's extreme growth over the past years poses, however, also several challenges (see below)","Overall Uber was a mixed experience and in the hindsight I regret joining them. The main reason being the very negative corporate culture and the poor people management skills of its top management.

1) Uber is severely understaffed and desperately tries to get people in all areas - and it notably lacks good leaders. Traditionally Uber promotes purely based on operational results. Unfortunately, the best managers aren't necessarily the best leaders. My direct manager specifically was one of the worst people managers I've ever encountered throughout my career (although he apparently did bring in good results in his past role).
2) Uber had to hire so fast that building a sustainable corporate culture hasn't been much of a priority. Uber naturally would argue otherwise not add a Mary of fact for anyone who had worked for a top company before (be it consulting, FMCG or tech) will be heavily disappointed by the lack of common spirit in the company. Some call Uber's culture toxic. I would rather consider that it lacks one altogether.
2) Feedback is super unstructured. I personally am a strong believer that feedback is one of the best ways to learn and improve on a daily basis. Unfortunately, although Uber has a very extensive bi-annual feedback procedure it's not a very helpful one. Additionally, in my case my direct manager couldn't have cared less about providing feedback, even going as far as stating ""please do not ask me again for feedback outside the formal process"". That's an absolute no.go.
3) Since feedback is unstructured, also performance reviews are very intransparent. The bonus (which makes a significant part of the salary) is distributed solely by the direct manager and does not necessarily have to be linked to the targets, since they are anyway moving all the time. That's a problem since it skews the bonus payments towards people who have been around the longest and is biased against new comers.
4) Good leaders leave the company, the bad ones stay. Uber has seen an unbelievable amount of fluctuation in the past 12 months, both forced (= firing) as well us voluntary. On average a new hire only spends less than 2 years with Uber (that's significantly lower that with other Tech companies, such as Google, notably for senior positions). Additionally, people who leave very often have one thing in common: They are looking back with mixed and negative feelings. That's extremely sad, considering the fact that Uber is the only one of my previous employers I cannot warmly recommend to my network.
5) Poor learning and development for General Managers. Most GMs are recruited from within. The few that come from outside, very often do not last long. The main reason is that Uber looks any sort of training and development for external people. And also Uber's new manager training is rather a joke compared to the state of the art L&D programs of other companies."

7066,Uber,Mixed Feelings at the Premier Food Delivery Platform,2017-11-14,2.0,Account Executive,"In many ways the team is like my second family. I have a lot of flexibility to take care of my kids when they get sick. When we aren't rolling out new promotions, I have the freedom to shift my hours and work remotely as needed. It really is great. Our team is pretty small but everyone I work with is really chill. That said when the work has to get done, we get it done! We get new challenges every day so you will never be bored here!!!

Reaching out to the restaurants in new markets is a lot of fun since I am a unashamed foodie. I've met a lot of great people and expanded my professional network substantially in the last year. 

Our compensation is really great for a startup. The health benefits have a lot of incentives which I have no problem taking advantage of.  We are constantly expanding into new markets and solidifying things as we get closer to a IPO. I haven't used the vacation time to go anywhere exotic yet like some on my team have. Hopefully soon!","Uber/UberEATS keeps a pretty small core of full-time people and contracts out the rest. This is pretty normal for the other high-profile tech startups I've been with in the last ten years. I don't work with them directly but we use a lot of contractors. Several people on my team complain constantly about how much time they spend doing quality control on contractor work. Automation helps a lot but at the end of the day we need more talent that actually invests in building the brand. I feel like we could be really great if we did that.

Uber is in the news a lot in a bad way. I've worked in two different hubs and never seen any of the behaviors that got people in so much trouble. That said, the chill attitude can go too far at times and get projects in trouble. I won't say how many times I've had to work late or during the weekend to fix something that could have been prevented. Disorganization is chronic and people can be really cavalier about documentation. I guess outside of coders and engineers, there isn't a strong sense to write things down? Dara, the new CEO, is a great guy and is working hard to turn things around. I met him recently and felt like he is really committed to changing things. 

I feel like I've put out a lot of fires in the last six months. We are growing fast which is great but my people are spread a little thin. Right now we are okay but for a while there we had some serious burnout to deal with. There are caveats to the unlimited vacation perk...

I've seen a post passed around on LinkedIn where a guy complains about how Uber looks down on people without Ivy degrees. This was true at the first city I worked in and was frankly obnoxious. Here the attitude isn't as prevalent which I really appreciate. When it comes to fixing problems, I don't see much different between Stanford talent and State School talent. Stop this toxic attitude!"

I love that I always feel like I don't know enough as that's constantly pushed me to learn more things more quickly and I can definitely see how this has helped me grow faster than my friends who graduated at the same time.","Uber's a really controversial company and while we know internally that we try to do the right thing, the world often doesn't see it that way. It can be really exhausting to constantly see your company portrayed negatively in the media. It also becomes a bit exhausting to explain the situation to your friends and family. This exhaustion can sometimes be felt at the office. 

Additionally, while Uber's tried quite hard to keep itself transparent, the speed at which the company moves can leave you feeling like you don't know what's happening in your own company. And at the moment, there aren't enough company-wide events that help alleviate this."

7097,Uber,"Good company, terrible culture.",2017-11-03,2.0,Expert,The benefits and the perks offered by Uber are pretty good.,"Uber has a long road ahead to establish a positive culture within the company. I am the newest employee in a Greenlight Hub location. I was a partner ""driver"" for Uber previously and really fell in love with the company and the platform. Now that I have been an employee of the company it has completely changed my outlook. I have been employed with Uber since July 27th 2017. Since my initial week of training off the floor, I have yet to receive any further training from any level of management. I have not and currently do not receive one on one training nor have I been coached or developed to pursue a career path within the company. I am however expected to produce positive metric without any additional training or support. There is no growth opportunity. I am not assigned projects or any special assignments that are outside of my normal job duties that would allow me to learn something new about company processes and procedures. Here in our Greenlight Hub it is a consistent issue to get a supervisor or manager to speak to a partner that is requesting to speak with a manager. I have heard multiple different things about company policy. For example, I was originally told that I could be negative forty hours for my vacation time and negative forty hours for sick time. I was just sent an email from my supervisor that I am almost negative forty for the year. I have a medical condition and need to see my doctor as often as once a week. If I’m not able to take the time off that I need to use my benefits and take care of my personal health that ends up not being a perk working for Uber. . In the same email, I felt it was insinuated that I am abusing the sick time. I contacted my Greenlight Hub manager and told her I would be providing a doctor’s note for each approved sick time so that it is documented that I DID, in fact, have medical appointments and I am NOT abusing the companies sick time policy. I was then told by my supervisors that they didnt care what I use sick time for. ""If you want to go to Paris on sick time we dont care."" Is exactly what was said. Overall the Greenlight hub location where I work is a toxic work environment. My coworkers are discriminatory against me. I walk in the hub in the morning to music blasting that talks about women in a derogatory manner the music also says racial slurs. Very unprofessional. I walk over to a spot at the desk to set up my laptop for the day and I watch my coworkers converse amongst each other not to have anyone say good morning to me and have been blatantly ignored. For example, I came back from being out of the hub for 11 days and when I came back from vacation on the morning of 10/31/2017 not a single one of my coworkers said anything to me when I walked in as they all hung out with each other before we opened. When I talked to my supervisor about it, I asked her ""if she thought it was normal behavior to be out of the office for a week to then come back and not have anyone say anything to you?"" My supervisor would not answer my question. Another example is, I came in one morning and got my laptop set up, walked to the back office where two coworkers where sitting at a community table in the back office talking and eating breakfast. I asked if I could join them, One of my coworkers gave me nasty look and then continued her conversation with the other employee. I sat down at the table and was not acknowledge the rest of the time. I found out that there was a company paid employee outing that I was not even told about and just found out after it happened. Another coworker told me that she and a few other people were talking and that it wouldn't surprise them if I got promoted before anyone else because of my race. There are other grievances that I have with the company but the discrimination and hate that I walk into every day has affected my well-being and mental health to the point that I dread coming into work every day. It hurts to be treated the way that I have been."

The company has to make sure that the concessionaire delivers the same quality of food for all employees regardless of their work schedule. Also, tissue or napkins are limited during graveyard shift, one facility staff that my teammate spoke with told them that there's a schedule before they can replenish the supply. I wonder how those people that need to attend to their personal necessities, do they have to wait until napkins or tissue get replenished?

Honestly this whole office wouldn't need to be here if Uber spent some time fixing it's funnel operations. How is it efficient to allow someone with one phone number to make over 20 accounts but only allow them to use one? Why aren't there better instructions during the sign-up process so people upload drivers licenses instead of selfies? This office is here to help fix those problems, but they don't address the root of the issue. Poor design on both the app and in how Uber as a whole is organized."

Their sales team will tell any lie to get you to sign up and once you are onboard the support staff (account manager) lack experience and education in dealing with small issues and complaints. They don’t have a quality control process in place to ensure that food delivery is sanitary and protected. Their training is based on a short YouTube films. They use the same drivers that pick up people. Their drivers are not trained properly. Don’t be surprised if you receive your UberEATS order by a kid on a bicycle without any warming bag (this may be acceptable if you live in Manhattan or densely populated urban area). I really take great pride and time to ensure my customers receive a hot and fresh meal. Quality of delivery is just as important as quality of food preparation and service. To pay a partner (UberEATS) 30% of my net sales and have them not ensure quality of delivery is unexpectable. Don’t try complaining to higher ups because your complaints will go unanswered. I am really concerned for the public and restaurants who partner with UberEATS because they are both risking safety and business liability. For the general public be smart and have someone you can hold acccountable deliver you food before you get sick. Restaurants be smart and measure your liability risk factor when you have UberEATS deleiver your product in a dirty vehicle, no warmer bag, hanging off bicycle handle bars or by unprofessional individual."

- don't expect going higher in this position. you'll stay as CSR.

don't know new CEO, old one was, well."
7228,Uber,An incredibly talented staff with way too much to do,2017-09-15,3.0,Software Engineer II,"As an engineer at Uber, you're presented with a unique opportunity to have a very high impact-to-unit-work, and to release products that go live instantly worldwide. The IC-level talent is phenomenal; you're working with bright engineers, designers, and data scientists who all have incredible drive and talent. It's a great place to grow and learn. This has been Uber's biggest value prop to technical members of staff to date, and it still holds true. You have the opportunity to work on world-class platforms and build product experiences from scratch, which is cool no matter how you slice it.

Despite Uber's public woes, there's clearly an earnest effort by executive leadership to solve the company's cultural problems. Liane Hornsey has led a mighty effort to systematically address the many, many accumulated issues that Uber has accrued. Dara seems right-headed as well, and seems keen on addressing his (very accurate, I believe) read on the company's problems. 

The catered food is free and pretty great. There are some down days in quality, but anyone who says the food sucks is probably just accustomed to the likes of Google or Facebook's excellent free fare.","Managers who are supportive, proactive, and empathetic are unfortunately the exception, not the rule. I imagine some of this stems from scope problems (most managers simply have too many direct reports; my first had something near 20), but if you talk with engineers, there are a scant few who don't have a story about how their manager really let them down during a promotion cycle, review cycle, or project in a manner that was obscurantist at best or callous at worst.

Teams often try to parallelize the product development cycle. This has repeatedly been the source of a lot of stress and thrashing on important projects. Engineers will be asked to work in parallel with product and design contributors, meaning that as the product design changes, engineers will need to follow along. It's often unclear when and how a design will change, or even whether it will change again; there's just not a good communication pipeline or standardized workflow on a number of teams.

If you're an engineer, there's an immense onus placed on you to drive the success of your projects. Engineers are the last filter between a product's idea and its implementation, and so the responsibility falls on them to account for not only product edge cases, but gaps in design documentation (which is never formalized, and usually just a set of slides that requires a follow-up meeting or three to clarify), and team workflow.

In short, the culture is that if anything gets in your way, if there's any blocker you hit, if anything at all is unclear, that is YOUR sole responsibility to surmount. This creates a lot of stress, because it is at odds with being thorough in an environment where productivity and throughput are first-class engineering values."

What I like:

- competitive compensation. I've been working at many places and sometimes my employers played Scrooge McDuck on annual performance reviews (some of them are still searching for ""replacement"", all these years). At Uber, in contrast, I faced with reasonable attitude from the very beginning.  Will see how it goes.

- interesting ""Uber-scale"" projects. I feel I'm getting smarter with every month. Soon after joining the company I found myself in a position of a fresh graduate on his/her first job (despite 10+ years of experience). Uber is growing rapidly, which in turn requires bleeding edge technologies/approaches to be invented/implemented/accepted. I'm in love with my profession, so working on large-scale projects makes me experience technological orgasm.

- reasonable level of management. As an engineer I have an initiative here. I don't need to discuss every single breath I make, though of course I'm not completely free. 

- friendly atmosphere inside the company. People are different, so one may face different characters/attitudes. Nevertheless, general mood is friendly and people are more or less relaxed.","- Workload is high. Plenty of challenging and demanding tasks. I'd say that work/life balance is shifted towards ""work"".

7398,Uber,Toxic,2017-07-09,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"I find it difficult to pinpoint any pros at this company, this may have to due with starting when 20 people were fired, and then most of the executive board resigning. One would assume employees would take this seriously however this did not occur, people complained about having to participate in diversity seminar while recognizing the fact that the company is all white and all male.  In addition to the toxic company culture, there is no work to do. I, personally, spend the majority of my day sitting at my desk doing nothing as my manager has problems delegating work.","Toxic corporate culture. The recruitment process lacked honesty, I directly asked if the temporary position  (3-6 months) could be made permanent during the interview and I was told no. However on my first day I found that my position is still temporary, but open-ended which has put me in a position where Uber can just let me go when they see fit. This wouldn't be as problematic if other people were not hired on during the same week but with permanent contracts for the same position."

7410,Uber,Working for Uber is an amazing job and Uber has amazing perks,2017-07-03,3.0,Sort Customer Service Representative,"Where do I begin? Working here is literally anyone's dream job who loves social networking! I have only been here for 3 months (celebrated my Uberversity today) and I love it. The location is a pro in itself. You get to see Phoenix from an amazing high rise view. If you work a morning shift or late shift, watching the sunrise and the sunset of Camelback Mountain, South Mountain and the city is just breathtaking. Besides working for an amazing brand, the location I thank them for choosing.  We also get catered lunch everyday; enjoying Indian, Mexican, Thai etc.  cuisine's. We have flavored water and unlimited snacks and drinks!! Parking is complimentary or public transportation. We have 100% health, eye and dental insurance coverage. You will also work right in the middle of just about the best area in Phoenix!! Easy access to the hottest everything going down in AZ! On top of all this, Uber, also, in addition gives us other perks that are, yet, again AMAZING and you'll have to just wait to find out for yourself!!

The COE (Center of Excellent) is mainly social and email support with priority teams who may provide phone support in certain cases. So the environment is nice and you don't hear much talking like you would at a call center. Everyday we are interacting via the #1 global platforms of the social media world responding to people via social every single minute of our lives! A non stressful job with the only head phones around your head is for the pleasure of your music selection. 

This company would honestly be great if they just get management to actually follow their own cultural values.","Leadership. Some of the down side to working at Uber, unfortunately, is the people in a position that allows for bad team leads that are antagonist allowing inappropriate commentary to be made. The majority of contacts that we handle are global and diverse, yet, within the COE, diversity it's intolerant. There is no other support besides an English language support so many times contacts are resolved due to ""foreign language"", never receiving support.  ""Oxford English and comma"" plays a huge role in our QA when it shouldn't be necessarily the focus and take away from the actual job description and that's providing actual support. Also, they promote within, rather than hire an experienced person in position externally, a non experience person as a lead who also doesn't have a clue about the job responsibilities they oversee. This is bad management."

Uber does not lie when they say they are fast paced and rapidly changing.  If you come with a confidence that you can contribute in your own way and are comfortable in pursuing those ambitions without needing to be checked each step of the way then this is the company for you.  If you feel you are not able to make a decisions without approval from someone else then you will struggle.,"I work away from San Francisco and the internal challenges Uber faces are more SF based.

This is at the ATG Pittsburgh location, mind you, so I can't comment on SF. But here, at least, I know, it's awesome.

And by the way, the company is trying very hard to change what problems do exist in the culture. It's not just a show for the outside. Everyone takes it very seriously, and there have been incidents in which the employees took a stand as a group to hold someone accountable for actions that violated our values.","Mostly: the outside image. Explaining to your friends. Having to justify to friends why you support Uber and why Uber is a good company. But if you believe that fixing a problem that causes 30,000 deaths and countless more accidents a year is important, then come work at ATG."

Most of the people that work here are invested in the companies success.  The market for self-driving vehicles is incredibly competitive, and we want Uber to win.

I am a woman engineer, and I have had an incredibly positive experience thus far.

Peers are the smartest most inspiring professionals that challenge you. I'm sure you've read the news and articles about how Uber is a terrible place. In my experience, those articles for the most part take a minor thing out of context and sensationalize it. It's easy to pick on big bad Uber, but the truth is the people here care deeply about getting things right for our drivers and riders and put some incredible talent behind it. Sometimes we make mistakes, but there's been something so rewarding about living through and contributing to a mission and a company that has served as an inflection point in our society.","The external perception of Uber can be unfair. Also, if you're looking for great salaries and titles and career trajectory, look elsewhere. People work here for the work directly in front of them and the ability to impact the future with it.

If you have charity or community involvement goals the team will assist you with your idea. Teamwork makes everything easier. It's good to see that our CEO is willing to admit to his faults.","Cultural collision - it's inevitable, people may have been treated so unfairly at their other place of employment that the negative energy may be brought on.

Dress is causal, and they cater lunch daily. There is a stocked kitchen that is impressive, and free for employees. We also get Uber credits monthly which are used to pay for UberEats orders. The location is central, with great views of downtown. Leadership is lax, and not much is taken seriously. There are nearly 50 shifts to choose from, though most are at odd hours, during days, evening, nights and all holidays. Its open 24 hours. 
   They are awesome with time off, and allow you to go negative. They also offer parent time which is for school related events like parent teacher or the dreaded recorder concert. They are involved in a lot of community events and things happening around town.","Point system is strict, and takes a year to fall off. Although you can move departments, there really isn't an option to move up. They drill it in that you can move up, and its easy, to move up; That's not true. No room at desks. We sit at long tables with no dividers or space. It can sometimes be loud and hard to make important calls.
  Its trendy, and a lot like high school. Rumors, jocks and cheerleaders. A lot of fraternization, and favoritism by management. Others can be harsh and judge your work..    
   Most management have no idea what they are doing and spend a lot of time chatting, or texting on their phone. If there is an issue, good luck. There are a lot of things that take place that would NEVER happen at another employer. Very young, and mostly inappropriate. 
    There are a lot of changes currently happening and big adjustments. I'm hopeful that the immaturity will be addressed and the office can become more professional."

7623,Uber,A very mixed bag,2017-04-03,2.0,Uber Expert,"It's genuinely really rewarding to work as the liaison between Uber and it's drivers. Sometimes these are simple and easy interactions, such as ensuring compliance within your state or providence. Other times, you'll have to have difficult conversations with our drivers about why they can no longer drive with us. To have helped drivers meet their goals, maximize their earnings, and do this all on their own time, really illustrates the good the sharing economy offers to those looking to use their existing resources to make ends meet, save up for something, or just make a few bucks here and there. 

Also, this is unique to me and not typical of every office, but I love everyone I work with. We value teamwork and achieve goals together without any focus on the individual.","Our HR department, called People Ops, is horribly inefficient and barely existent. I was accidentally hired on as part-time, though I should have been full-time. My direct manager has reached out to People Ops numerous times and cc'd me on each one to confirm this and have the transition. To this day, I have worked no less than 40 hours a week. Needless to say, they have completely forgotten about it and have not responded in well over a month. I have had to keep getting healthcare from the Healthcare Market. Every time we reach out to the department, we hear literally nothing back. 

This also translates into the soft benefits. I have received confirmation that my gym reimbursements were going to be coming in, however they have not been. I saved the contract and all the emails between People Ops and myself, sent this in, but as mentioned above, I have literally heard nothing back. 

There are also no opportunities to move up. Without hard data, everyone I've interacted with confirms that no one lasts here more than a year, maybe a year and a half. It's good to put on your resume, but you have a real opportunity to grow up the ladder elsewhere. 

Long story short, don't buy into the hype that you get all these great benefits and a cool, hip culture."

7677,Uber,Positive experience despite negative press,2017-03-13,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Uber has hired some of the best people in the industry. I've never worked with more intelligent and driven people.
- Compensation, perks, and benefits were very competitive with companies of similar size.
- The technology stack has matured considerably after some initial growing pains. Engineers can provision infrastructure and build/deploy services without excessive red tape.
- Surprisingly strong, positive cultural values. They are really woven into every day work–used as hashtags, referenced by leadership, etc. Most other companies just create a list of cultural values and forget them.","- Uber has a bad reputation and is constantly the subject of controversy, protests, and negative press. While Uber is not perfect, I do believe the company has matured since its early years and leadership does take these matters seriously from what I've seen. If you can't handle seeing a negative headline about your employer, Uber may not be for you, but for those that can handle it and want to make a positive impact on our culture and reputation, this shouldn't be an issue.
- Teams and people can shift around frequently as the company continues to grow. This is probably a good thing overall for the company but it can feel jarring at times.
- People work hard–not necessarily because of deadlines but because many of their coworkers are smart, driven, and hard-working people so the bar is set high (that's my experience at least). This is ultimately what you make of it–many people stay late but many people also get into work past 10:00am. Remote work is pretty flexible too which is a plus."
7678,Uber,"Was great, grew too fast, and became Google-like",2017-03-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Many very smart, motivated people to work with on big problems; if you're on the right team. A very fast pace of change. Nice, albeit overly-flashy, facilities. The best-run IT department I've ever had the pleasure of working with.","Many of the best engineers have moved on due to the chaotic work environment and management favoritism toward those creating new things, rather than successfully implementing or running things. Middle management is not supportive in any way. Managers will find and latch onto your flaws, using them as justification to keep you from receiving raises, or promotions. Several teams are traps, existing only to provide their manager with headcount, and struggle to find a purpose. There is next to no coaching, and no training. Teamwork is not valued, only delivering new things. New employees receive terrible credit benefits. The catered meals are a trap. There is a pattern to there not being enough seats at any of the cafeterias, so lunch must be taken at your desk, while dinner isn't served until 8:15pm."

- Some of the engineering challenges are interesting and hard and being tackled by few others. (Lots of other challenges are being tackled by lots of competitors, and I don't know whether they would be better to work for.)
- Guided by a strong mission and set of core values. If you believe in them, you will fit in well and they can keep you going through the long hours.","- Apparently, a lack of transparency. I was oblivious to all of the scandals that have been in the news lately, which disturbs me.
- If you don't believe in all the values, you won't fit in. The values are basically not available publicly, and I don't know if they are shared with candidates during recruiting, so make sure you find out what they are.
- It seems like the IPO may be more elusive than at other startups. One starts to wonder if they are putting it off to squeeze more work out of the employees.
- I don't know how common this is, but I was terminated, to the great sadness and detriment of my team, by a higher level manager for seemed like an irrelevant issue.

7713,Uber,I Still Love Uber,2017-02-28,5.0,Data Scientist,"Despite all the events over the last month, I see every day a truly incredible place where every single person can have tremendous impact. Uber holds itself to a high bar, and it certainly isn't perfect. But it's still a great place.

Uber has gotten larger, which just means I can't speak to every place in the company from first-hand knowledge. But from what I've seen with my own eyes in my area, the environment has been remarkably supportive, energizing, and positive.

I've been at other companies where the environment was actually _systematically_ problematic, so perhaps my spectrum for judging company cultures is different from all the press we're getting. But that is not Uber. There's a remarkably high degree of transparency here, and a remarkably low degree of BS. Uber is under quite a lot of scrutiny, and in part that's a consequence of the company's success. The company has increased in size several-fold, and the culture is still growing up. Again, I can only speak to my own experience, but I've loved Uber from the moment I've joined and every day since, for the problems I work on, for the people I work with, for the trajectory I'm afforded, for the technical areas I have the opportunity to master, for the richness of the data, for the mission of the company, and for the company's earnest desire to always be improving. This place is for real, and the growth is real.","Things move at lightspeed, and as we've seen the last month, it's not always perfect as a result. People come to Uber to kick butt in the best possible way. If that's you, you're in for a treat. But that's necessarily for everyone."

7720,Uber,Hardest but most rewarding job I've ever had,2017-02-26,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Level of responsibility is way beyond anything I've experienced at other companies. 
- Huge potential for an individual engineer or small team to impact the business. 
- Easy to develop a strong sense of ownership for your part of the product. 
- Perks and benefits are really nice without being ridiculous (free snacks but not free laundry).
- Coworkers are all very smart and hard working. Slackers are managed out. 
- Many opportunities to learn new technologies. 
- Real, tangible impact on how people move around cities, not just selling ads or building some nonsense app.","- The performance review system is fundamentally broken. Who gets how much is a roll of the dice. Large initial equity grants blunt this to some extent though and management assures us it's being worked on so I'm cautiously optimistic. 
- While the culture of my own organization is good (people have integrity, women and minorities are treated respectfully by management), the bad behavior going on elsewhere still hurts.
- Hours can be long but are flexible. You control your own destiny but it can be hard for some to unplug when necessary.
- Almost all engineers are white, Indian or Chinese straight men. Not an overtly discriminatory environment but management does not demonstrate that they value diversity."
7721,Uber,Everything you've heard about Uber is true - doubly so for the LA office,2017-02-26,1.0,Operations Manager,"Workload is fairly light compared to other areas of the company. If you play your cards right, this is much less than a 9-to-5 job if you're good at acting like you're working during the day.

In addition, no one checks your work in this office. This is a byproduct of most colleagues being completely checked out and not having the mental capability to understand anything beyond basic arithmetic.

For what it's worth, some of the benefits are nice. You get 15 free trips up to $15 a month, and lunch is served every day. The office is also in a great location, so it's nice to meet up with friends after work.","Most of middle management is completely incompetent. This is because the competent individuals have left for HQ, so only mediocrity is left. This office also promotes heavily based on seniority, so if you're neither, I recommend you look for another job.

Surviving in this office has nothing to do with merit. It is more important to fall in line than to do anything substantial. Keep your head down, act like your boss is God's gift to the world, and find a way to set yourself up for a successful transfer after the 6 months."

7735,Uber,Inspiring place to work,2017-02-19,5.0,Software Engineer,"* Opportunity for impact. The per-capita impact for each engineer is higher than most other tech firms. At Uber, each engineer has a real impact to the company's bottom-line. This really drives the ownership culture and is inspiring to see. 
* Culture that promotes standing up for what you believe in. If you feel strongly about something, the company encourages you to voice your opinion, even if there's a large discrepancy in rank. At the end of the day, the right idea should win.
* Exponential personal growth.  The engineers who survive here will experience rapid growth in engineering abilities. I learned more in the first 6 months at Uber than I did in the previous 2 years at large tech behemoth. 
* Competitive compensation
* Convenient perks - free food, monthly credits for Uber and UberEATS","* Longer than normal hours (compared to other SV firms like Google and Facebook). The longer hours aren't imposed. It's more like you feel inspired to build or improve something that you own. 
* Bad brand PR. Uber is one of the most villified tech companies. While most employees believe these opinions to be based on misinformation, it's demoralizing to know some people see Uber as the ""bad guys""."

Dunderheads.  Probably not everyone in the department, but definitely the ones I have unfortunately had to deal with during my time here.  Fairly certain they have little to no knowledge of labor laws and employment standards; I have never felt confident in any answer they've provided me or my coworkers.  Further, there have been multiple instances in which I, or other coworkers, have reported serious issues/concerns (e.g. harassment, privacy issues, among other serious workplace violations), and not once did People Ops investigate the incident(s), nor provide actionable follow-up.  MOAR lawsuits just waiting to happen :(

- Despite the fact that two of our 'Cultural Values' encourage an anti-bureaucratic workplace, UBER has quickly become an insanely bureaucratic company with a completely superfluous management hierarchy and redundancies through various levels of management in nearly every department, making it difficult to get anything done."

- Training and access to resources will help you learn and grow in whichever field you're from
- Everyone's helpful
- Folks are passionate about the brand and the product, almost cult-like
- Quality/Competence of people is standardized globally-- I've worked with a lot of folks in my position based all over the world and everyone seems to have sound, technical backgrounds and expertise. You'd be hard-pressed to find co-workers who haven't done anything significant prior to entering Uber (not to say there aren't a few who slip through the cracks)","- As with any other company, as it grows, political environment at work takes a toll on employees (if you're the loudest, you get farther)
- Hit-and-miss with immediate managers-- you might get a manager who'll help you maximize your talents, but you'll also work with some who don't care about you except for their own interests
- Long hours (well, this is a pro if you're a workaholic), so get ready to have your personal time confused with your work time
- Great benefits (free lunch in almost any country where Uber's based at), but need to have higher base salaries for the amount of work you put into the company
- You get promoted based on perception-- if you've done what your managers say despite being the wrong way to approach a project/task, then you'll go far-- Even if part of the culture is stepping on toes, once you start lobbying for what's right, if your co-workers don't like you, it's easy to get isolated from the rest
- You have to build while on-the-fly-- if you're someone who has to think for a long time and assess a situation before you act on it (even if it's the right thing to do sometimes), don't bother applying. You won't fit in and a lot of people/projects will pass you by"

7777,Uber,3 Month Review- Development Vehicle Operator/Vehicle Operator,2017-01-24,1.0,Development Vehicle Operator,Free Parking in the City,"I have and MBA and 12 years professional experience and this is my professional observation of the company:
-You will be serve the same function as an Uber Partner even though recruiters will tell you that you are going to develop driverless technology.
-All drivers get treated like they are 5 years old even though most of us have advanced degrees  
-Only a small percentage of people actually get to test the technology
-Your primary job will be to taxi employees around and customers who order an UberX.  --You will not have a life if you work here in this job especially if you get the evening shift because you only get a weekend off every 6 weeks.  The schedules are 645a-5p or 445p-3a and once you are on a shift you cannot switch
-You only get a chance to move within the company after 6 months of employment and you must compete with any external candidate who applies directly for the position you want. So if you want a particular position then I highly suggest applying for it directly and DO NOT use the DVO/VO position as a stepping stone because they severely shorthanded with drivers and probably won't let you transfer. 
-DO NOT buy into the corporate culture ideals for any project that challenges the status quo no matter how much better it is because if you use them you will be reprimanded.  So if you are a ""yes man"" or always ""drink the corporate cool-aid"" then you will love it here.  If you are intelligent and can think on your own then find something else because you will be miserable.
-All other employees at Uber get unlimited PTO BUT the DVO/VO position must accrue PTO and you cap out at 10 days for the entire year but you work 5 of 6 weekends so PTO is difficult to manage
-There is no 401K matching
-Pay is 35% below the median income for Pittsburgh
-If you fail to control a vehicle due to errors in software you go home without pay"

There is a high potential to grow and learn both because senior members are very good at what they do and are open to mentoring and teaching junior employees and because you are dropped into hard projects and learn how to do advanced things through trial by fire.  People are really smart and passionate about what they do which makes for a great experience as long as you have a good manager. Like all companies, your work is hugely determined by how good your manager is and I've seen some of the best and worst at Uber.  The company takes care of you interms of benefits (food, gym, swag).","There can be political issues on some teams.  People can get very competitive, cut-throat and bro-y.

Free meals and snacks during work hours. Good starting salary and benefits.,"Poor, vague communication. Not enough clarity about how the job should be done. Direct feedback is either non-existent or avoided by too many of the trainers and managers. The preference seems to be the safety of e-mails or texts rather than in-person conversation, and many trainees agreed that the trainers' communication can't be trusted. Also, the company loves to do things its own way but that led to an elimination of work hours for weeks at a time."
7793,Uber,Best job I've ever had!,2017-01-11,4.0,Customer Service Representative,"The work culture here is generally amazing! The health insurance coverage is absolutely stellar. We're encouraged to be ourselves and everyone I've known here has been incredibly kind. Being a transgender woman, I was terrified that I'd have to go by my legal male name but I was allowed to select my preferred name in the system immediately. That, combined with the Employee Resource Groups, make this a welcoming and safe place to work for anyone in the LGBT spectrum.","Policy changes are rather quick and sometimes we get the memo a little late. This isn't as big of an issue as something else I'm going to write a lot about: the shift bid.

The shift bid happened before I was a full time employee. Even though we were set to be hired a month after the shift transfer, my class did not get to bid. There were only 9 shifts previously and we moved to an amount of shifts greater than 40. The initial shift assignments were sent out on Wed at 4:55pm. The tool to transfer our shifts between our collegues was not available until Thursday morning at around 11am. This prevented most employees from the beginning of the week (Sun-Wed shifts) from trading with employees on late-week shifts (Wed-Sat). Additionally, the option to transfer ended on Tuesday of the next week. This still prevented late-week shifts from trading with beginning of the week shifts.

When I brought this up to management, they brushed of my concerns by saying that they needed the shifts solidified by Wednesday and that people could just confirm trades from home through their email. However, their second point is invalid as everyone here is EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN from accessing work email at home. 

This put many people in shifts that did not work for them, including myself. It caused some people with families great turmoil. We have all learned to make it work but it has notably affected both myself and others."

There is a very big difference compared to other companies I've worked with before. I've been here for only a few months but I don't feel like I don't belong. Every one I work with are really nice people. And the work is also fun. Plus, you get free meals and free rides on top of a high salary.

But what I really like the most is that I don't feel like working. I still got a life even when I'm in the office.",Haven't been here for too long to be able to see any. So far it's all pros here. :)
7801,Uber,Oh the places you will go!,2017-01-09,5.0,Deployment Vehicle Operator,We are literally on the ground floor of this new and exciting technology.

7804,Uber,Great technology horrible culture,2017-01-07,2.0,Anonymous Employee,There are very smart talented people at Uber who care about the company. The technology that is being developed is great and this is in large part due to the hard work of individuals who are passionate about getting the company to the next stage.  The technology is the best part.,"The work conditions seem flashy, but when you realize that you are not really able to even sit down and enjoy an hour for lunch you realize the problem with Uber.  It's not a good place to work if you have a family or expect to have any kind of work life balance. The management has zero respect for your time and it is not unusual to work 12 and 14 hour days and at least 1 day during each weekend.  They low ball offer salaries and get rid of people that don't work well above and beyond 10 hour days. The management team has little regard for your career development and they often cut teams that don't hit aggressive milestones. If you want to come to work feeling like your job is on the line every single day regardless of how hard you work, this is the place for you. The culture is also very hostile, the idea that you should ""step on toes"" is part of the core values and that makes people feel justified when they throw team members under the bus. It's brutal and highly critical. The environment is very combative. Additionally, it is a Bro culture.  If you want to get ahead just be sure to drink every eve and play to the egos of the right folks in the room. It works. Women need to be prepared to be very aggressive in order to move ahead. This place does not value humility or true work friendships. It's fake and forced because for some reason that's what the executives think is needed to build quickly."

1. Super flexibility...everyone is allowed to work at the pace, style, method they chose to. Your deliverable is water-tight...but how you get there is your call.
2. Data-intense .... all decisions, meetings etc are backed by data, which means that no one uses their seniority to bulldoze their ideas through. Also meetings are super-productive, I dont think in 3months I have done any pointless or inconsequential discussions

- Prime office locations for SF","- Absolutely no work-life balance. Do you value your time outside of work? Then don't work here. They literally tell you ""this is not a 9-5 job, this is a lifestyle.""  
- Also don't work here if you: have kids, are a woman, are a minority, or have opinions that conflict with upper management. 
- Overall, the company is poorly managed. Uber is filled with former consultants who have never worked long-term for previous companies before. This leads to people with egos telling you they don't have egos, you just have to work exactly the way they want you to work and be available literally 24 hours a day or you are a poor performer. 
- Toxic working environment. People backstab each other, take credit for each other's work, and generally don't care about their coworkers. They do anything to get ahead. 
- Expect to have more working experience than your manager since most managers at Uber are first-timers with little to no experience in their vertical.
- As others have said, this is definitely not a people first company. You will be repeatedly asked ""is this good for you or is this good for Uber?"" This can be a culture shock if you've worked for other tech companies in the Valley. 
- Comp is honestly laughable. Expect to take a pay cut or be called greedy."

7879,Uber,Solving big problems but at a high price,2016-11-23,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The internal tools at Uber are best in class - you can dig into the data very easily, the tools are efficient, easy to use and very robust. 

Uber is solving some of the largest problems that exist out there, and the scale of Uber is incredible - the company is making a huge impact on the world.

The CEO is incredibly ambitious and very driven, and isn't afraid to make big bold bets on the future.

Generally, the caliber of the people at Uber is extremely high (likely because they had to go through an unnecessarily onerous interview process) - I had the opportunity to work with rocket scientists, people that were published in the NYTimes, former CEOs / SVPs / CTOs, tons of ex-consultants/bankers.","#1 - Politics - Since the bar is so high at Uber, being smart and hardworking is not enough. You must be incredibly good at office politics to be successful - and in fact, if you are not good at politics, you can expect to be routinely passed on for projects and given low performance.

#2 - Performance Policy - Stack ranking is a disaster as teams are compared against each other although they have very different KPIs. Additionally, some orgs have little control of the outcomes of their projects, but are judged by results rather than contribution. If everyone is good, some people still have to get low marks, where politics is particularly prominent.

#3 - Work/Life Balance / Stress  - Working at Uber is extremely stressful. Every decision you want to make is challenged thoroughly and rigorously and there are constantly people that are ""toe-stepping"" on you to ensure the best decision is made. While this is great for the company, on an individual level, it leads to very stressful situations where you must constantly prove everything you do and justify it. 

#4 - People Last Mentality - The company makes no secret from the CEO and down that everything it does should prioritize the company first, and the person later. HR has been neglected, with recruiters consistently overhyping potential compensation. New policies are constantly put in place that undermine the employee (e.g. changing an employee perk so that it is as underutilized as possible).

#5 - Compensation & Hiring Process - Newer employers (2015+) are routinely under-compensated with potentially misleading guidance on the ""upside"" potential of a high valuation. Additionally, the hiring process takes too long (at times 3+ months ), and the recruiting team could be much more professional. Turnover rates are not low."

I wouldn't recommend Uber to my friends/extended network. Uber is a large company, so maybe the department I worked for/my experience is unique. From my experience, it was a very unsupportive, unprofessional, and toxic work environment.

- Unlimited vacation can have the opposite effect when managers and leaders don't model that it's OK to take time off. On the flip side, I see many new dads taking extended parental leave which is awesome.
- I'm not a big fan of the performance review process that leans heavily on subjective feedback.
- The company is still building its development culture and programs. You won't yet find mentoring and professional development policies in place. To grow, you definitely have to be a real self-starter."

- You end up being pretty good friends with most of your colleagues
- No dress code
- Luxurious facilities","**Disclaimer to those who are reading Glassdoor reviews about uber: most positive reviews are left by employees who have been at company < 3 months. When you are a new employee or a ""nUber"" as they call you, you are incessantly emailed by the HR, COO, etc. to leave a positive review on Glassdoor. Amazingly, after 3 months at the company the review requests suddenly dissipate. They know that after a while employees get jaded and no longer have positive things to say about Uber. 


Career Growth: 
-  Little to no career growth opportunities for individuals on city teams - all roads lead to San Francisco
- People I’ve known who have moved to San Francisco have encountered similar political issues upon moving with minor cost of living adjustments to make up for the huge change in living expenses


Office Politics: 
- Suffocating amounts of office politics. You are judged more on how much people like you than the caliber of work you produce or how hard you work in general
- Performance is very much weighted by how much others in the office like you
- Individuals who have more tenure (pre-2015) are given favoritism
- Despite being a cultural value, company has a huge problem with principled confrontation and toe-stepping, those who do well at Uber are consummate “yes-men”


Leadership: 
- Most leaders are inexperienced. Many have moved up in the ranks after being an early employee at Uber where Uber was their first or second job and have had little to know training or mentorship from managers that are actually good at being managers
- Other leaders that have been hired-in are subject to the same popularity norms that plague office politics and are unlikely to stand up for their people if it means potentially being disliked
- Massive pressure pushed down from C-level. Many higher level managers have enough problems managing up to Travis to effectively also manage their own teams. Although some genuinely care, many are only able to do the minimum. 


Attitude and Compensation: 
- Even with favoritism individuals with tenure are unhappy and jaded because they are compensated way below market value
- Early employees who were lucky enough to have extreme successes early while riding the wave of tremendous growth often have confuse their luck with talent or experience; this is compounded by the amount of favoritism they receive
- Early employees who have “golden handcuffs” because they cannot afford to buy out their options at current strike price often do very little and still receive good performance due to favoritism, this drags down motivations of others that are actually try to move the needle
- Many leaders at the company often carelessly throw out that they can fire anyone, at any time for any reason which makes people feel concerned about their job security
- With the way that the new Uber credits are structured, the perks of working for Uber are not what they used to be [for new employees]
- 14 cultural values: many are duplicative, most are ignored and not one has anything to do with Integrity"

Some of the most cutting-edge solutions that exist are only six months or max one year good enough for Uber scale.

When we justify the need for something -- if that's what's best for the company and for the team, we get it. Uber is fortunate and smart to invest so heavily in their systems, and have guys like us that are pretty passionate about our job. The level of trust and expectations are high, which forces us to meet these high expectations. You don't get this far if you're not a performer.","The expectations for you are high, and that can be a con if you're not into being challenged. The social dynamics are also weird at times.

I like that about Uber. Most companies are worried about the next social opportunity, but here at Uber we are helping shape the future.","In some parts of the company people feel pressured to work extremely long hours, and I even feel that pressure sometimes.

For example I left the house 11am and drove until 6pm and neted $48 with my app being on about 6 hours the rest was coming back from airport and long trips. Uber keep lowering the fees and some rides turn out cheaper than a bus ride which is great for riders but absolutely not worth it for drivers
7948,Uber,BS exploitative job,2016-10-11,1.0,,Any pros you've seen advertised are completely negated by the awfulness of the company.,"Constantly changing pay rates, no health insurance for a risky job (I was hit more than once and only survived because I was lucky), practically no support during deliveries (by the time anyone gets back to you, you'll already have solved the problem or been completely dehumanized by some awful client), no way to know if you'll actually have work that day or be sitting around waiting for a ping, all the responsibilities for jobs without any control. All that nonsense about making your own schedule doesn't really mean much when you have a work to the point of burn-out to make ends meet. Just look at their rate of churn for drivers/couriers. Completely unsustainable and unethical business model."

Ability to learn a lot","The cultural values, which are you're measured against on performance reviews, are very biased towards the type-A personality that toe steps over colleagues to get recognized for work. Individuals accomplishments are recognized and rewarded--not team accomplishments. 

Teams work in silos--I've seen two teams build the same feature, and when they found out, instead of working together, they continued to launch two similar but separate features since they were already road mapped. 

Management is inexperienced, political, doesn't do much for their direct reports' development. You have to spend a lot of energy making yourself visible, being a toestepper or you'll be lost in the pack.

Because of this ""me first"" ultra competitive environment, people don't often listen to each other within teams."

- So many resources... makes it easier to do your job and be confident about your work!

- BEST Pro: The things I work on actually go into production. It doesn't get lost in some file drawer of ""things we'll do later."" But the projects I am working on NOW will have a real effect on users in just a few weeks. I feel like I can really make change happen here, and influence the product.","- I have had a great experience working for Uber, but I believe it has largely to do with what team you are on.

The organization has the right idea about leadership and development. Managers work alongside their reports. Their job is to choose a direction for the team, and to be a champion for their team with the higher-ups. 

In my particular area (experimentation and analytics) the work hours are reasonable. People might put in 45 hours / week. Unless there's a major product launch or a systems outage, you can choose your own hours. Taking vacation is encouraged.","There's a strong expectation that everyone here will support and identify with the company's mission. If you think Uber is making the world a better place -- or if you're just super-enthusiastic to work on our meaty data science, engineering, UX, and operational challenges -- this is a plus. But if you're not into it, this won't be a great place to work.

A lot of our compensation (and nearly all of our annual bonus) is in equity. Your recruiter will try to give you an estimate of what your shares will be worth, but it's the same as equity in any other startup -- it's a lottery ticket. That said, the salary is still fair."

They really don't care about talent and YOU are just another use and throw resource for the company
- Fake career promises
- Recruiters as well as team managers are trained to lie and deceit on every stage

- Offers no longer competitive with many established companies when one considers the misleading nature of the preferred share prices. 
- Incredible amounts of politics (company culture encourages back-stabbing amongst colleagues)
- Company lies to recruits (stating huge bonuses, using preferred share prices to calculate equity compensation, promises for quick promotion, etc).

8051,Uber,"Great Vision - Inspirational - Lack of ""Qualified Managment""",2016-07-28,2.0,,"If you're a millennial Uber is the place for you...The potential for growth is exponential. Find a mentor and visionary that will help guide you through process. There are many available within cross functional teams. Its about knowing who is supportive and who has their own agenda.   (Be aware of the frauds who are who are hiding behind their lack of management skills and use your efforts for their own success). 

Quoting Mia Angelo - ""People tell you who they are"" your job is to ""LISTEN"" to what their non-verbal actions are and often what they are verbally stating to you.   

Trained leaders inspire and empower you.   I found the CEO to have that very vision. 

The perks are great yes. The snacks, lunch and dinner, etc. Remember that it is what it is ""a perk"". Focusing on balance will create success  and longevity within the organization.  Yes there will be long days but they will be rewarding.","I found that the managers within certain HQ teams encouraged and supported a ""Mean Girl"" management style within the team.  If you don't go along with them they'll do ""what ever is in their power"" as a group and individually to isolate and control. Senior Management is fully aware and looks the other way.  The leadership is responsible for the lack of action. 

HR - placates the initial concern but ultimately back the manager and does nothing to look into or give credibility for the concern.  Giving credibility to unproven and unqualified managers only manifest the problem and limits the growth of the team. 

HR - should be a source of safety and support. I did not be find the HR team within Uber to be a safety source but a facilitator to manifest the problems and concerns. 

There are many credible visionary leaders within the Uber organization, but the lack of credible management within certain departments is limited due to a lack of real management training.   

Look for leadership that is inclusive, empowering and TRAINED."
8052,Uber,A lot crunchier than I thought,2016-07-27,5.0,Software Engineer II,"Before interviewing and joining, I had the impression from media coverage that Uber was kind of an amoral company full of brogrammers.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  People at Uber care a LOT about their communities.  Hiring is the most diverse out of any company I've ever worked at.  C-level executives emphasize during the all-hands that they don't tolerate insensitive comments or behavior.

Pros:

- Lots of smart people; this can be intimidating but it means there's lots of opportunity to learn.
- Great work, high impact.  Even interns get important projects.
- Professional demeanor.  I don't see anyone playing political or social games.  ""No jerks"" rule is emphasized from C-level down.
- Meritocracy is practiced here.  Everyone is expected to be responsible and be thorough at their tasks.  The top coding bootcamp graduates are among the new hires.  Degrees aren't mandatory.  I see more women engineers here than I saw in college.
- Most folks don't work crazy hours, including mid-level managers.  Work-life balance is real here, unless you're unlucky (see cons).
- Good locations; HQ buildings are near public transit.
- Sane RSU policy for a pre-IPO company.  Contrary to media reports, RSUs don't evaporate when employees leave.  They can keep them under Uber's control or collect them if they want to (probably a bad idea due to taxes).","- The business is everything.  Some employees had to work 80-hour weeks for months because their team was given a very aggressive deadline.  Other teams were still working 40-hour weeks.  It seems like some engineers should have been pulled from other teams to help out the ones in a crunch.
- The vibe I get is that I would be in deep trouble if I said something offensive.  The atmosphere isn't especially playful.
- No 401k matching.
- Very real risk of there never being an IPO if the China effort isn't successful.  Everyone at the company is gambling that Uber will do well in its segment of the market.  I believe in the company, but it's still scary.  Few at Google or Facebook are worried about their company's future.
- Unlimited vacation depends on the team.  Unlimited is obviously a misnomer.  Vacation has to be approved by the manager, only employees have to figure out how much is the right amount.  With a defined policy, employees could use all their vacation with the confidence they're not taking too much.  That said, people do take vacation and are fully unplugged while they're out."

Leadership expects you to be in the office until 8-9pm.  It is a micro-managed where you are simply a cog in the wheel.  The work environment reminds me of a Busch League recruiting consultancy. 

I've seen many people in the Engineering and Recruiting department leave full time status w/ equity before their vesting cliff date, including myself.  You know there are problems when the so called ""sexiest"" pre-ipo can't retain their top talent for more than 6-8 months."

WHAT A RIP-OFF!

- Work? 
Just like any call center out there, a cog in a machine which can be replaced at any time. 

Contract is a hoax, it does not guarantee anything, there's always a loophole for the company to snake-like through.

8086,Uber,"Aggressive jerks, welcome home!",2016-06-28,2.0,Product,"Uber is a fascinating business model, and the international scope, fast growth and leading market position are addicting for business-case junkies.

Many Co-workers are smart and hard-working if somewhat dull (but at huge cost - see below)
""Cocktail-party cool"" means you'll be popular at parties, because everyone has an opinion on Uber and are always interested to learn about the inside. If this matters to you.
Unique, interesting combination of Silicon Valley and Operations cultures.
Amazing product-market fit, the company continues to grow - regardless of whatever you do (or dont) deliver.
Learn how growth works","Where to begin...Uber is basically Game of Thrones translated into SV workplace.

No company churns as much as Uber, even at 7,000 employees - the amount of chaos is unnecessary and exhausting, due to inexperienced management and ingrained top-down aggressive culture.

Aggressive jerks and huge self-serving egos are not only tolerated, they are rewarded. You will be instructed to ignore other teams and duplicate effort to reach your goals, regardless of overall value to the company. You will be cursed at, and public ridicule is not punished. Everyone who lasts has sharp elbows and uses them. Many pieces of the Product team are brutally political, with a churn/burn mindset to people. This contributes to a noticeable lack of diversity in gender, race, age, etc. If you don't fit the model of a ex-Google/Facebook late-20's male employee, you won't fit in. Experienced, high-functioning, hard-working and well-liked co-workers ""disappear"" frequently without explanation or consideration, especially if they don't fit the model. Work/life balance is 24/hour availability because everyone is drinking the Kool-Aid.

Pay is intentionally below market - Uber tries to take advantage of its stakeholders whenever it can, because this company does not value individuals. If you can get a competing offer during interviews, THEN they will raise your below-market salary offer - but not before.

Many inexperienced employees think they are good, but in reality they are just lucky due to the perfect timing of product-market fit.

Because Uber's equity policies are anti-employee, there are many people who are ""friends of management"" and grandfathered into the organization but can't afford to leave, even if they want to. Once this thing goes public, everyone will cash out and leave - nobody wants to work with a bunch of jerks."

The rosy model of transportation revolution only works in limited crowded cities where 
- People don't own cars
- People can't afford parking and live far from underground transportation entrances
- Lack of underground transportation systems 
- People can afford surged prices

Or as last mile solution to public transportation system. 

Big challenges ahead:
- Excessive burn rate that requires billions of dollars injection every year
- Highly inflated and unsustainable eco-system. Both riders and drivers are lured to systems by promotions, incentives and credits, particularly true in countries supported company's hyped growth
- Drivers are paid barely higher than minimum wage given the gas and car ownership cost, large percent drivers leave the platform after a few weeks or months. Constant high cost to recruit new drivers.
- Increasing competition from not only tech companies, but also car manufactures, taxi companies.

The model may work when autonomous car on road, which eliminates drivers from the ecosystem. At the same time, it will make every car manufacture a competitor. Tesla, VW, Toyota, Audi, GM etc will join Apple, Google, Amazon to fight for market share.  The winner would be a tech savvy car maker or a joint venture from a tech giant and car maker. Making autonomous car is a bigger challenge than building a ride sharing platform.

Car is commodity, but autonomous car is true innovation.  Ride sharing platform is less complicated than many high traffic systems today, the realtime dispatch component is likely be the trickiest, which heavily relies on map and realtime traffic report. 

Map developer owns the most important ride sharing static (map) and dynamic data (realtime traffic), will eventually rule the ride sharing platform.

Uber is ambitious and chose to work on everything in house including autonomous car, map. Progress would be more significant if partner with industry leaders.

Uber's NA market is slowing down, China is much smaller than DiDi but bleeding heavily, no sign of relief anytime soon.

Culture

Toe stepping is encouraged with good intention, but many use it to attack others, there is no team work under unexperienced first line, second line management, managers don't have right judgement and integrity to tell when a stepping is good, when is bad. 

Surviving first year is hard, particularly reaching to anniversary.  You may let go right before your  stock vesting date. People work ""HARD"" to show they are busy, but extremely inefficient from business impact point of view. Tons of reports, charts, but not much truth finding and problem solving. Employee will be trained to become a talker, ppt/report maker, and an attacker to survive.

No exit for stock holders, CEO has publicly said to delay IPO as long as possible. Each round of funding dilutes shares."
8098,Uber,Not Worth It,2016-06-17,2.0,Software Engineer,"If you end up in the right place, there's latitude to work on pretty far-ranging projects, and you if really end up in the right place, they won't be rush jobs. New engineering leadership seems to have a solid vision. There are some very impressive people here, though it's telling that I'd describe none of them as matching the dominant demographics or culture here.","Uber is constitutionally incapable of being a high-quality software outfit. As an organization, it's addicted to shipping, and the recent push to increase software reliability is doomed to failure in the face of the fact that the people tasked with implementing it are either 1) the aforementioned SHIP IT junkies or 2) hastily-hired junior developers (you get to learning their names pretty quick when you correlate them with the most totally indefensible outages). A lot of compensation and perks policies are plainly insulting -- e.g. the deadline for exercising options after termination (I don't know if I can't share it, so just imagine a big middle finger directed at everyone who doesn't have the capital to not bankrupt themselves with AMT costs), or the new free rides structure -- and they all point to the fact that Uber doesn't need you and doesn't care. The contrast between that fact and the generally high levels of Kool-Aid flowing around at all times is probably unhealthy to endure for anyone with even a modicum of self-respect. It's pretty hard to have a sense of career trajectory when you get a new manager every few months (seriously, it's like Omaha Beach at the manager level, they'll probably be erecting a memorial in the lobby at HQ pretty soon). I'm not self-important enough to believe that any of this will necessarily have any external business effect -- they seem to be trucking along just fine -- but it's not a satisfying place to be an engineer (except possibly front-end -- they seem to have a better sense of polish and professionalism than other parts of the org). I'm glad the various ERGs exist, but they're not a substitute for actual resources being devoted to improving hiring and culture by management."

- Majority of drivers were from a diverse range of minority groups that you can find in NYC, that's expected, anyone that understand the driver landscape in NYC will know this. However, the entire office in Manhattan is white. This created a very strange dynamic, in a already tense environment. 

- Many of the drivers had limited english, insecure about their technology knowledge and some  would have preferred to not join UBER, but felt they were forced because of UBER's take over of the market. The demographics in the office intensified all of the factors mentioned above.

- The managers seem to think, that successful driver retention is based on how much money the drivers can make, however, after spending so much time with them, I realized the majority of them also care as much about belonging to something.

- Many of the drivers also explicitly expressed discomfort with the demographics of the office, we have to remember that the industry was very much controlled by a diverse group of immigrants prior to UBER, so for the drivers to enter a driver support center that is all white, was uncomfortable and makes no business sense.

It should be near 40% and that's being generous. Elon Musk, Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Virginia Rometty, those are great CEO's.  Travis Kalanick, Jeff Bezos, the late Steve Jobs.  These indivisuals exploit thier most common resourse, the worker.  All they care about is the bottom line. Its all about the money.  I cant't be part of such a reckless, immature, self centered company.  I wouldn't even be a customer.  Why would I want any of my hard earned money to go into the pockets of a handful of careless individuals.  Because trust me when I tell you that the drivers and my former colleagues do not get compensated very well.  The drivers actually net zero profit for what they have to endure.  Ever wonder why it cost $9 to go to the airport. Of course you dont because its cheap.  Well you should because that driver is probably only making a $1.25 profit off that trip.  We are all in this together. We shouldn't be taking advantage of others. But this is our society.  Pay $12 for a drink but God forbid your commute home is more the $5."

Lastly and most importantly, I love having a positive impact on the people that I help with their Urgent Support needs every day.","A majority don't realize Uber is still very new. Things are always evolving and improving because they need to be, internally and externally. Sometimes it feels like things can move a little too fast.

I am growing at a rate that is probably not possibly at most other firms.

It's incredibly exciting to work for such a fast moving company that is doing truly innovative and boundary pushing work.

Uber truly has the potential to be that dream job (but unfortunately they cannot fufill on critical aspect of what keep employees happy - see below).","The talent Uber is trying to bring on (and keep) requires the same in management, and in some instances this isn't the case. 

The really bad: Expect long work hours, an engineer-focused culture and total  lack of HR boundaries (read: don't be surprised by management verbally abusing/insulting employees).  Employees are not valued, management experience is questionable at best, and pay is below industry standard."

That same competitive nature can make for a toxic environment when based on merit that is proven by boasting and not actual ability or accomplishment.

Being a part of a company that has become such a big part of current pop culture was an interesting and exciting experience -- high ""glitz and glam"" factor in comparison to most jobs. It's not retail.","Communication was minimal from the top and continued to weaken as messages passed down from upper levels to lower levels of employee clearance. As a young organization whose goal has been to redefine a longstanding industry (which it has successfully done!) the company still has a lot to learn in terms of positive vs. negative ""corporate attitude"" and general organizational human resource management -- many policies and the enforcement behind them was very wish-washy within our market, and the lines became even more blurred when communicating with other city teams to seek advice or information. 
Little to no defined path for growth makes for one of two types of employee: apathetic reps with no real passion for the job but to pass time and make an easy dollar or disappointed employees who eagerly want to grow but feel aimless and under appreciated."

Uber is one of the most collaborative environments I have ever worked in.  Whether its answering a question about their code, helping to debug, or working together on a feature, people have been uniformly enthusiastic about helping their co-workers.  Perhaps this is because everyone's stock grants are so large that people just want the company to succeed :-)

Uber is good at pruning out busy-work.  Everyone I know is working on a project that I characterize as 'critical'.  

The quality of the engineering team is excellent.  Super bright, hard working, and care about building the best product they can",Work life balance suffers a bit in this environment.  Don't come here to go on cruise control.  Uber demands hard work from everyone and consistent 8-hr days are rare.

Lots of engineering problems - system failures, downtime, lots of on-call work and stress, cost cutting is pretty rampant too, it's hard to get the things you need to do your job and you have to work with limited resources. 

The pay is also much lower than you can get at other companies. If you want high stress, low compensation then Uber is the place for you."

- Flexible schedule. I've heard the ""long hours"" line a couple times but I definitely do not feel that. I do 9 to 5 basically (or more like 10 to 6)... so no more than 8 hours per day, and I've never felt pressure to do more.

As full time employees, you'll most likely receive some type of pre-tax compensation to use for Uber's products in app as well.","Unfortunately, the room to develop outside of working at the support center is somewhat bleak. Being the front lines of handling Uber's messy situations is complimented with a standard customer service wage (see Google for average salary) and monotonous daily tasks. 

Additionally, the work life balance is something talked about throughout the entire company. You'll notice that it applies to this position as well.

Free food and drinks all throughout the day.","All the pros mentioned above are old story. The food quality has gone from bad to worse and it's not even edible anymore. Uber has hired people left, right and center. Managers hire people from their previous companies, either peers or reports, so that they have people to support them. Almost all the managers and higher management guys are super selfish and arrogant. NOBODY thinks about advancing their reports and taking their team together with them. This is what happens when you hire people who have never managed a single person or people who already have a bad reputation at their previous companies and to them, joining Uber seemed a great way to start from a clean slate. Employees are being fed BS by their managers when they ask questions. Loads of politics has just crept into everything and the work culture here sucks.

Work & Independence: You can literally work on anything you want as long as you're taking care of your core responsibilities. It's all about problem solving and ownership, you're respected if you do things beyond your scope of work and solve problems. No day is a dull day. It's almost scary the amount of independence you get at Uber.

Culture: One of the few companies that focuses a lot on maintain the right work culture and ensure new recruits are well trained on the same. 

Brand: Get Uber on your resume and you'll be a hot commodity not to mention you'll always be centre of attention at parties you'll go to.","Work life balance goes for a toss. You will have to work hard and smartly to hit that sweet spot.

It's sad - a lot of good talented people are being treated poorly and no one seems to care.

8213,Uber,"Big Ideas, Big Problems",2016-02-23,2.0,,"There is an incredible amount to work to be done, as is normal at any startup (even one growing as quickly as Uber), plenty of challenging, hard, and engaging problems to solve. People who join are for the most part passionate about the product/future forward looking aspect of the company, while also incredibly smart. 

Uber will also teach you nothing you've experienced before at any other job and everything you'll need to prepare you for your next role when you leave.  

However, all this comes at an egregious cost (below):","Leadership lacks empathy (those that do are let go / leave) and expects hiring fast, firing slow. Amazon but worse - plenty of back-channeling, finger pointing, arguments, intimidation. Survival of the fittest with clear fight or flight mentality across the board. Core Values of toe-stepping, principled confrontation, hustle, winning (among others) that promote individualistic ideas vs. teamwork. Makes getting things done difficult. 

Absolute culture of censorship, lack of perception to outside world. Those who speak the loudest win and continue to be promoted. Unlimited vacation is moot, expect to be working all hours, all days, all vacations. 

Expect to be cussed at."

8223,Uber,Recruiting at Uber,2016-02-16,5.0,Recruiting Manager,"Incredibly smart and talent people paired with a very strong work ethic. People at Uber seem to truly absorb the company value on ownership (Be an owner, not a renter) and put in the time and effort needed to do the job right. There is a lot of work to do, but it's not easy building the fastest-growing company ever. 

It's wonderful being part of a team moving at light speed. As a recruiter, it's great to be able to help the best people on the planet find roles at Uber they can really make a difference in. Management from CEO down are also extremely involved and supportive of the recruiting function, which is a great feeling.","The pace and hard work required is not for everyone. I work as hard as when I ran my own company, and everyone needs to have that level of dedication to make things successful here. At this stage of growth, it really does take a lot of time because there is a lot of work to do. 

Things are more organized that one might expect at this stage of startup hyper growth. So there is probably more structure than some people might like if they want a true early-stage startup environment. We are growing fast but also maturing fast."

These people who run this company are greedy, and a joke. All they provide is lip service, pretending your worth something while they sh!t on their workers. After paying for gas, wear and tear, its really minimum wage pay. I don't think anyone should drive their car for less than 20 dollars an hour, which is really not much money considering."

People are always willing to help you if you have any questions. Everyone is friendly and fun, and you really feel appreciated. Because it's in a hyper-growth phase right now, there is always more to do and work on. There are tons of interesting engineering problems related to scaling right now that are very unique to Uber. Being a part of that is very exciting to me.","Work life balance can get a little crazy. I have spent a few late nights at the office (latest was 4am one night). While the management encourages to get a good amount of sleep each night, they also stress for employees to find their ""Red Lines"" and to push themselves past that if possible. I am all for improvement, but I don't know if more time spent will really have better results. It seems as though time spent is worn as a badge of honor in this office, and all I can do is question if they understand diminishing return.

Most of our direct managers are so wet behind the ears that they appear never to have actually managed people before and the training offered has been deplorable.  Only because of the outstanding teamwork of our band of WFH employees have we been able to cobble enough information and resources together to make a much unappreciated difference at Uber.   To add insult to injury, stellar co workers are let go on a regular basis to make room for the new, outsourced CSRs from the Phillipines and India who we are all well aware are being paid a small fraction of the wages we are paid, and that the cost savings is the whole reason for this very anti American move.

The perks are great—catered lunch, tons of snacks / drinks, happy hours, education, etc.","It's not a 9-5 job—very much an ""all hands on deck"" culture.

I used to be a consultant and I found the best ppt slides, strong data and MECE arguments all over. I used to work in the development field and my work now is positively impacting and changing society every week for REAL. I used to work in Thank Tanks and Foundations to create innovative solutions to analyse and transform the urban realm and I am finally in the best environment for urban innovation ever. I've always loved to work in multidisciplinary teams form all over the planet and I am doing it right now. I feel totally empowered. Reality at Uber goes beyond my expectations every day, every week, every month :) And last but not least, I feel taken care of and appreciated as I never felt before.",Mmmm.... the only cons I can find is not having had the chance to join Uber before.

Very intelligent people, who are mostly younger. Those with experience are coming from very impressive companies. Fantastic benefits.",Long hours. Constant pressure to put the rest of your personal life on the back burner to put company first. Poor communication between departments at times.
8292,Uber,"Dream Job, Dream Company",2015-12-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Uber is like the company that I'd always wanted to work for without knowing it. The company really values its employees. Also my coworkers are smart, passionate, and very hard working. The perks are top notch. Mostly everyone has the attitude that they will roll up their sleeves and do what it takes to get the job done. Also, the company is growing so fast that things are never the same day to day and you get to work on so many interesting projects and gain invaluable experience. I think a year of working at Uber could be equivalent to three years working anywhere else. 

Finally, I've had three different managers while at Uber, and all of them have been amazing managers.","A lot of people say work life balance is an issue at Uber. I think it varies by role. I have never had an issue with it though, and I am always extremely busy with projects. You just need to learn how to disconnect from time to time. Also if you love your job it won't matter that you work extra hours.

My biggest con would be that as we get bigger there is starting to be more bureaucracy. I think there have been some hiring mistakes with having a poor culture fit for some managers. However, I believe senior management actively encourages toe stepping and eventually weans out people who ruin the culture."
8293,Uber,Operations,2015-12-01,5.0,Operations,"The company operations on local scale, while being global simultaneously.

8295,Uber,Awesome software company,2015-11-30,5.0,Software Engineer II,"Forget about the usual red tape, endless meetings and boring reports that you will do in other companies. At Uber, everyone's focus is on getting stuff done and getting it done in the best way possible. At Uber, you will have:
- Brilliant colleagues, top people from top places
- Nothing to prevent you from doing the best that you can
- A job that never becomes routine",The place is a rocket ship still taking off. You will either love keeping up with the speed or be vaporized in the process. I find work/life balance to be better than claimed by others but with Uber you will not have a 9-5 cookie cutter job.
8296,Uber,My favorite company to work for,2015-11-30,5.0,Recruiter,"- innovative, disruptive

8297,Uber,No transparency from management,2015-11-30,1.0,,Remote position - able to work from home office.,Remote team is being eliminated
8298,Uber,I finally found my dream career,2015-11-28,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"The biggest pro is that even as Uber grows as a company, it remains an organization run by owners at every level. As an owner, I'm entrusted, enabled, and empowered to drive the business forward in the best way I see fit. I don't have to wait for rounds and rounds of alignment. This means I can just be be a creative problem solver and don't have to worry about what happens if an idea fails. The goal is to test something out and pivot from there. If something works, great! Go deeper and scale! If not, great! We've learned something that enhances our understanding of the business and can be more effective going forward. There's no time to worry about posturing or how things are perceived. The people in my office (like every other office) only help to reinforce that culture. I've got a built in support network that is always willing to drop what they are doing to help me achieve my goal. No one has ever said ""that's not my job"" because we are all owners. Oh, and it doesn't hurt to be at a company that is literally changing the world. I've never felt such a purpose to the work I get to do. Whether I'm seeing tears of joy in the eyes of a newly onboarded driver partner whose live Uber is changing or an initiative I've created that scales to the rest of the company in no time flat, it's easy to jump out of bed in the morning. I used to be in the Corporate America rat race and only wish I joined Uber sooner. The best part is while Uber has already had such an impact, I truly believe the biggest impacts are still to come. That makes the work only increasingly important and interesting.","Everyone (correctly) talks about the hours. I used to work a true 9-5 and I have a wife so previously, work-life balance was important to me, but that was because my work was unfulfilling. I love the work I'm doing now and don't count the hours since I'm working on problems that I'm personally interested in solving. As the company scales and gains efficiencies, I can see some of the hours reduce. The salary was a step down from my previous salary, but the equity more than outweighs that downside."

The company strives to keep the bar high by only hiring flexible, intelligent, talented people. That, combined with the standard of transparency we have here, makes this an awesomely empowering place to work. Everyone has agency to move around and take on harder projects because of the honest, open communication.

The pace is fast, but the speed isn't driven by numbers and money and quotas. We're all working on something that's already being used around the world all the time by millions of people, so we have to solve problems quickly to keep users (especially as we grow in our new launch cities) happy and safe.","There's a lot of work to be done before we can reach a stable place. Even as we grow, it feels like a start-up with long hours and a free, flexible management system. To me (and other good fits) these are actually pros, not cons. You have the freedom to solve big problems the way you think is best. Everyone here works a lot, so if you have a vibrant life outside of the office, you'll probably struggle. Even after a 13-hour day, I feel like I have a good work-life balance just because I find work so fun and my coworkers so bright and quick and funny; I'd rather be in the office than at home."

Work 70 hours, step on toes, doesn't matter.

There is NO training. If you're new, you have to figure everything out, and if you mess up, you get blamed. There is a common practice of firing people after 2 months if they can't figure things out or keep up. They do NOT give any warnings or feedback, even if you ask for it. Work-life balance is non-existent.

I saw 3 people get fired after 2 months for ""under-performance."" None of them were told specifics except that they were ""unfit"" to be at Uber and today was their last day. No questions, and they couldn't even go back to collect their belongings. HR also didn't give any explanations other than they had to sign their packages and then immediately leave. The company does NOT care about its employees, only about winning.

The culture is one of working too hard and being scared to leave before 6:30pm or doing personal things in case you get in trouble or someone rats you out."

8356,Uber,Excellent,2015-10-05,5.0,Senior Engineering Manager,"Hyper-growth company, super smart and entrepreneurial people and huge potential for impact. Even junior engineers start impacting $$$ within a few weeks of joining.

8358,Uber,It is not what it claims to be.,2015-10-05,3.0,,"As a researcher I come to discover that Uber has a lousy customer service related to the partners.  Uber Support team is very narrow minded since I have personally witnessed drivers being treated with disdain as the best way for Uber to “allegedly” support their riders. I long for the day when no one would want to drive for Uber anymore unless Uber shows respect and add to the values to their partners.  Drivers are the faces that riders see not the $55 Billion team sitting in the crystal tower with more lawyers than the American Bar Association.  Not being honest with the drivers/partners is sending a message from corporate that this is how the game is played, therefore the driver passes this subtitle along to the rider and oftentimes unconsciously.
For example Uber claims in a document published on January 30, 2015 that drivers will be charged 20% for UberX and 28% UberXL request and an additional $1 safe ride fee. Those fee seemed to have been acceptable but after April 12, 2015 Uber started charging more without notice.","Uber office workers treat drivers with disdain.
Drivers are being treated as a number.
Even unruly and drunk Riders are given options to rate drivers.
Uber's Owners are very arongant"
8359,Uber,Operations & Logistics Manager,2015-10-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great culture to work at, very dynamic company continuously innovating and adapting to change. Joining this company makes you feel part of a global team where everyone is there for help and support you to work together in taking this company to a next level.

8360,Uber,"Run, don't walk",2015-10-04,1.0,Community Manager,"I got none - other than it being a known, successful company","To make the company happy, you must live and breathe Uber. You must make Uber the priority in your life. 
- expectations are unreasonable. No one ever gets to exceed expectations in performance reviews, and they will tell you that (there goes a motivation factor)
- you get no recognition, no matter how well you do - yet another point the company is very vocal about
- company politics are nothing like I've ever seen
- your performance review may read: You did not work more than 40-50 hours/week, Uber is not a 9-5. If your review lists this and nothing more that's 'negative', you will not have 'met' expectations
- expectations are not laid out and you won't know what they are until your review. Hired for A - expected to do H.
- favoritism and nepotism is big
- while females and parents get hired, if they want to keep their family a priority, they will struggle
- comments of sexist nature or against people with disabilities get swept under the rug. 
- you cannot voice your concerns (in a professional and respectful manner). No matter how you spin it, you are complaining. When you talk to management about a problem you need help with, you are expected to keep it quiet and come up with a solution yourself. Bringing it up (no matter how big), will shift the focus on you and you will be the problem for speaking up.
- it's more about how many hours you are at the office, rather then the quality of your work (i.e. 40 hrs of quality work < 60 hrs of mediocre work)
- pay and equity is low for the time that's expected of you (well under market).
- very aggressive and negative company culture"

- working for a reputable company","though working for a 'reputable' company sounds great, too many cons which have unfortunately made me quickly feel very differently of the organization.
- emphasis on ""hustle"" and ""drive"" -- yet don't see it performed 
- I'm sorry but either no lunch break or a rushed 20-30 minute lunch break in what can become a 12 hour day is totally unacceptable and most importantly against the law (surprisingly, everyone just accepted this and put up with it). 
- daily abuse from drivers can seriously be demotivating and drive your moral to the ground. it's difficult facing drivers everyday when you yourself can't do anything to assist them
- continuous changing of procedures, when one thing is already explained to us so badly and a new concept is introduced it just snowballs into a big mess
- marketing techniques felt downright unethical and wrong.
- no camaraderie amongst the staff, very clicky as if I was in high-school again. too many young people with little experience in a real work atmosphere. 
- for a tech company, basic things always causing daily issues, simple things like having no wifi, system down..etc."

- Saw my direct supervisor for less than 6 hours
- Was, as a Trainee, the ONLY Uber emloyee in Ohio (including my team) who is not based in Columbus. During weekly Ohio syncs, all 30 other employees were in the Columbus conference room and I would be on a computer in Cincinnati, unable to hear 60% of the meeting and feeling very awkward and left out. 
- Never felt like part of our Cincinnati team, or in the loop as to the ongoings therein (teammates would show up in Cincinnati and I would have no idea they were coming)
- Was given mixed signals as far as what I should be performing in front of Partner Drivers
- Provided partnership ideas to the marketing team, only to be told by my supervisor that I was not focusing on my position, even though my time invested was minimal. 
- Took initiative during Uber Ice Cream to contact and return ASSETS to our Ohio partner, Graeters, and was met with nonchalance from my team, even though I was thanked by Graeters. My team was going to throw away the assets."

- CEO full of hot air. Travis likes to emphasize a ""best idea wins"" policy. But that doesn't translate into reality. The folks who scream the loudest and step on others advance. There is no sense of teamwork."

• Really exciting and dynamic place to work. The huge amount of growth leads to a lot of hard and exciting problems. Almost every week and weekend was record-breaking in some way.
• Everyone worked hard to make sure I had a great internship. People were flexible. I was ultimately even able to open source part of my project!
• Very transparent. Everyone knows how the business is doing. Every new service proposal is emailed out to all engineers. The weekly all-hands meeting is so interesting.
• Fantastic engineering culture. People are enthusiastic about learning from each other. Engineers share what they are working through weekly tech talks. I even got to give a talk as an intern. Also, we are expected to write great code so code reviews are a key part of the development process.
• Unique/multi-disciplinary tech company. Obviously, the engineering problems are vast, but there are so many other challenges the company faces too (political, media, business). I got to hear people in all sorts of departments discuss what problems they were working on.","• Somewhat disorganized, especially for interns. I wasn't presented a project when I arrived because team was busy launching something. 
• So-so ""intern program."" This was the first summer that Uber had a formal internship program. They planned a few great events, but some weren't so good. They also didn't have any events until I was almost halfway through my internship.
• Poor work/life balance. People work their butts off. I stayed at the office until 10pm a few nights, and I definitely wasn't the only one there."

-Write code that lots of people actually use and pay for...gives a real sense of satisfaction to see your work live in production
-Lots of worthwhile problems to solve
-Great location in SF","From a coding standpoint, Uber is a weird mix of incredible sophistication and, shall we say, not so great code.  From what I've seen, this is probably a function of startup style code trying to get features out the door, the large number of engineers at the company and lack of bureaucracy (empowerment applies equally regardless of skill level), and the small team oriented nature of the company built around services.  While a service oriented architecture scales well and has a myriad of benefits, what no one seems to talk about that I've witnessed firsthand is that isolated services don't necessarily get the influence of some of the technically strongest people.  Some services are incredibly well written, others will probably need to be rewritten before long.  This has really been my one frustration with Uber.

And to put my complaints in perspective, I'd at least say that problems like this should be seen as why Uber is trying to hire more great people to get in there and resolve those issues.  I otherwise don't know how management could easily influence this in a better direction.  Otherwise, things are run fairly well I think to the best of reasonable expectations."

+ The engineering team is a melting pot that includes numerous veterans from top-tier technology companies, such as Apple, Google, and Facebook, and the culture borrows from the best aspects of each.
+ There's a pervasive habit of transparency and honest, often critical self-reflection, with an aim of always improving oneself and one's peers. Real change comes swiftly when there are problems.
+ Teams are organized to be small and autonomous so that every engineer can have an outsized impact.
+ Things move quickly and the team and business are growing rapidly. There's ample opportunity to make a dent and advance your career.
+ Enjoy the impact of working at a small, fast-moving startup with the reach and security of a multi-billion dollar industry giant.","- The growth of the team has times outpaced the growth of processes and support staff. Every so often you encounter a problem you'd expect a company of this size and impact to have solved.
- The downsize of the fast-moving, autonomous teams is that coordinating across teams can be a challenge.

There's real science and mathematics being applied to the environment and I'm learning more daily. Things are very un-siloed, information is shared and available between teams. Also they have a policy of allowing horizontal moves between teams so that you are most engaged in your projects. 

Diversity: This is the most diverse workforce I've ever seen in high-level tech firms, and the female to male ratio is also better than I have seen anywhere else in my career at similar companies.

I've now referred two people to work at Uber HQ and they like it here.","The constant, sometimes negative media attention the company is getting makes some people apprehensive about working here."
8439,Uber,Operations Manager,2015-07-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Culture is amazing - very entrepreneurial even as we have grown so quickly!

- Great engineering. Uber is pushing the boundaries of what dynamically typed, interpreted languages can do. It also picked up Node and Go when they were still very new and is now a leader in both.
- Many problems the company faces can only be solved by a combination of technology and people. For example, how can we help concert-goers get to and from Coachella? The solution involved both product and operations teams.

We provide a service that creates unprecedented value for all we interact with. Our corporate values are not BS; they actually provide useful, detailed insights.

Total compensation is top notch and equity upside is still incredibly high, even in July 2015. Strong bias to equity in comp aligns incentives effectively. You will push yourself to be the best you can be, as the stakes are incredibly high. I cannot understate that the equity offered is not some marginal amount. It will move the needle for your life.

Benefits are quite good as well, with free breakfast, lunch and dinner every day, plus free medical, vision, dental and life insurance. The cafeteria food is reasonably healthy and tasty, with lots of vegetables and a meat entree, a salad and sandwich bar, plus quality snacks. No 401k match, although I'm of the opinion this would be a waste of company funds anyhow. You will be taking Uber all over the place with the free credit every month.","Some aspects of the tech stack are a bit rough around the edges, experiencing growing pains which can occasionally hamper productivity. More automation would be useful. Process requirements can sometimes slow down an engineer's ability to get their change in prod. Sometimes this will take a bit of active communication on your part.  Expect to be on call and support your services as well (a strong incentive to write reliable code!).

If you value work/life balance above all else, I won't sugarcoat it. This is probably not the place for you. If you're down to come work hard on a world-changing mission, I doubt you'll be bothered by this."

They started adding unnecessary layers of micromanagers to the CSR Team, training began to get more mucky and then it happened.

Next, they outsourced the CSR team to a temporary agency (we were employees of Uber at first)
Outsourcing customer service to other countries.

While I appreciate the moxy the company has, the management roles are given to people with no real experience in alot instances before they are given a team to lead.  This can be good in ti infuse youth and energy into a organization but if you don't infuse some people with experience, wisdom and leadership you get a real unprofessional look on many levels of the business.

You impact on the city you live in is dramatic and it feels great to see such a tangible reflection of your hardwork.","As the company grows there are some politics that are starting to arise. Leadership has done a good job of emphasizing ""the best idea wins"" and that we should be open about giving praise/feedback. That ideology doesn't always get reflected in the day-to-day as much as it should. Also the hours can be long and grueling but that is true of most startups, its all about your expectations and you really do get out of it what you put into it.

- Lack of leadership. Uber's a great company because we hire entrepreneurs. Put a bunch of all stars on one team, there will be conflict and egos. In my opinion, it's a blessing and a curse.

Uber will need to be at the forefront of your mind at all hours of the day, and even in your dreams. 

TL;DR There is no work-life balance. You will burn out."
8559,Uber,Incredible place to work,2014-12-11,5.0,Software Engineer,"Fast paced, tons of opportunities to contribute, great positive atmosphere, very sharp coworkers. Lots of very interesting and far reaching problems being worked on. Attracts passionate people who are the best at what they do.","You have to look out for yourself to make sure you have the support you need to do your job right. Self-starters do best. Very little hand holding. Fewer perks than other tech companies. Very demanding, of course."
8560,Uber,"Fast moving, smart people",2014-12-11,5.0,Data Scientist,"People are smart and action-oriented; the company is in a period of hypergrowth and we're all trying to make things happen. The atmosphere is inclusive-- everyone is opinionated, but willing to listen to your thoughts-- ""strong opinions, loosely held."" 

Only been here two months; it's been a bit stressful, but overall more fun than stressful, and definitely a great learning experience. I would definitely recommend working here to all my friends.","Not a small company-- my last job was < 50 people, so it feels really big sometimes."
8561,Uber,Tech-focused company with emphasis on scalability!,2014-12-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Uber is a technology-first company. Despite its number of users growing exponentially month over month, the mobile product remains highly scalable and stable, unlike any other fast growing company that I have worked for.

Product teams, engineers, and designers collectively decide which features are the most important for upcoming sprints and, so during development, all hands are on deck and everyone involved is excited to build the feature.","There are times where you'll be given hard deadlines, simply due to regulatory demands and business contracts with partners. This can make some weeks more stressful than others."
8562,Uber,The most exciting company to be at today!,2014-12-10,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"Uber is fast-moving, challenging, fulfilling, and fun! I'm so thankful every day that I get to work at such a forward-thinking and innovative company. Unlike other tech companies like Facebook or Google, Uber creates thousands of jobs, positively impacts communities, and improves the quality of life for riders. Uber is growing FAST, and there are infinite opportunities here to take on challenging projects, develop leadership skills, and grow your career.","Since Uber is growing very quickly, most people here are very new and have a varied experience managing others. Some people are better managers than others."
8563,Uber,"Intense and fast-pace adventure, with a tech culture grounded in the real life",2014-12-07,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"Uber is the best company to work for I can think of : the speed of everything is incredible, yet we thrive to get all the big things and the little details right in order to build the best service possible, at the largest scale possible.
The teams are really impressive, both in terms of human experiences / personal stories and in terms of intellectual power. Never have I been so stimulated in a professional environment. And everybody is so passionate by the job that the feeling is more one of a huge community than a corporate work, even with our size nowadays. Each city is managed like a small start-up, with a lot of latitude in terms of local operations, but with all the support a global organisation can provide in terms of processes, tools, finance and best practices. Best of both worlds !","I don't really see any cons in my current position, if I really wanted to write something, I would say that since each city/market is it's own little start up, you won't get to travel a lot when you're in the operations team because each team is focused on its city. But this is just a beginning and cross-city teams are beginning to appear"
8564,Uber,Working at Uber has been like nothing I've ever experienced,2014-12-06,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I like to say working at Uber is great because of the four Ps. 

P - Product
P - People
P - Process
P - Problems

Product:
Our product is something that I use every single day.  I've worked at various companies in both the B2B and B2C sector and I've never cared about a product as much as I do Uber. Getting around a city (both where I live and where I travel) was always a pain before Uber.  Now when I leave my house I don't have to worry about how I'm going to get there because the answer is Uber.

People:
The people that I work with are amazing.  They come from all walks of life and each person has a different background . People here have individually accomplished so much and have worked so many places in their past that there is always something to learn.  Scaling AWS at Amazon, building the infrastructure of Yelp, and building Amazon's product in the early days are just a few of the amazing accomplishments that my co-workers have achieved.

Process:
Get stuff done and Uber will provide you the tools and resources to do that.  

Need a vacation? Take one.
Need a light at your desk? Here's one.
Want to work across the country at one of our offices? Go. 
Want to work from home in the mornings? Do it.  

What matters is that you get stuff done.","Uber moves fast and we have to because we live and work in an ever changing world of regulation, culture, supply, demand, and on and on.

Working at Uber isn't for everyone.  Everyone at Uber is dedicated to the company and each person does what it takes to make Uber a success.

Does that mean you work till midnight every night or the weekends?  Sometimes.  Is that a weekly thing? No, it's rare but it will happen.

Does that mean you'll get woken up at 3AM to take care of a critical issue that's happening during the day across the world? Sometimes.  Is that a daily thing? No, it's rare but it will happen.

But to me, none of it matters because Uber is a company, product, and vision that I care about and am dedicated to."
8565,Uber,Without a doubt the best company I have ever worked for,2014-12-03,5.0,General Manager,"- Day to day is extremely fun and the job is very challenging. I wake up every day excited to come to work
- Fantastic learning experience for personal and career growth (high degree of autonomy and responsibility)
- Super smart, capable, driven, and fun peers
- The business is revolutionizing transportation and as such is providing a much needed service to both consumers and partner drivers. This makes it a very satisfying place to work
- Company culture is exactly what I love, very results driven, numbers focused, and analytical. Best idea wins every time","- High volume of work load. As I love my job so much this isnt a con for me, but I know many people who value a very relaxed work life balance."

I am challenged but also encouraged by management. You have the freedom to be creative. Ideas are constantly flowing and implemented. It is a great place for people who love a fast-paced environment!",Teams are scattered across the country so it can be challenging to sync up.
8568,Uber,My escape from the corporate world.,2014-12-01,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"Fast-paced, innovative and energetic culture.","Young company, growing so quickly it can't help but stumble here and there. Imagine hiring the smartest, most driven individuals in the company, spreading them out all over the world and saying ""go"". That's what the culture is like. It's fast-paced like a startup. It is literally changing the cities that we operate in. But the average age is probaby about 28 years old at this point...so it sometimes feels like Uber Senior High School with some of the politics and bent towards self-promotion."
8569,Uber,One of the best Tech. companies to work for,2014-11-29,5.0,Software Engineer,I have the experience of working for 3 of the top software companies in the Bay area and have recently started working for Uber. I joined Uber among a handful of different other offers. I was a little doubtful before starting but am more than happy about my decision after spending sometime there. It is a great place to work with lots of opportunities to grow. It still has its startup culture focusing on rapid development and growth and avoiding common bureaucracy at larger companies. Everyone is friendly and supportive and you immediately feel as part of the family.,"While its catered food quality is better than many of the other tech companies in Bay area, it can still be improved. considering the fact that the company grew from a few employee to hundreds of them in very short time, I am sure the problem will be taken soon. The variation and types of food catered is not that many, although the quality of the used ingredients is good."
8570,Uber,Fast paced and tremendous learning experience,2014-11-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The people you work with are smart, motivated, and passionate
- Do well and you will keep growing and get more responsibility

Leaders are in the trenches and always say thank you. 
Smart smart smart coworkers.
Dynamic pace and work environment.","None, but save your time if you are not an A player.  Uber is for driven A players."
8572,Uber,Great Company doing Great Things!,2014-11-26,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"Amazingly flat feeling to the hierarchical structure where every employees opinion is valued and voice can be heard.  There is a great sense of transparency coming from the top down.  The sense of mission and desire to create a high value product, both for our riders and our partners is tangible everyday and the commitment is shown in the quality of people that are hired each and every day.  Benefits are particularly good and the office culture is second to none.","Long hours, but the reality is everyone here works long and hard because they want to and there is a real purpose to the job.  If working long hours towards a mission isn't appealing, this is not the job for you."
8573,Uber,"Great, Fast Growing Company to Work at!",2014-11-25,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"Being part of a high-growth company where you get to collaborate with smart and talented people on unique challenges based on your market, city, and particular side of the business has been one of the most rewarding experiences

Lots of opportunity to be innovative, and often pushed by direct managers to be entrepreneurial

Transparency within the company is extremely valued and often practiced. Weekly staff meetings keep everyone on the same page and help to enhance the company's culture","Long hours sometimes make it difficult to find a work-life balance, but this is pretty standard for the company with as much to accomplish as we do each day

The landscape is constantly changing as the company grows, so if you are not someone who can adapt quickly to new environments, quickly expanding offices and teams, or even day-to-day problems that arise, this may not be the job for you"
8574,Uber,Building Uber in new regions without it was awesome!,2014-11-23,4.0,Brand Ambassador,"- Uber changed quickly and we had to adapt and be updated, and I think is interesting to bu aware of whats going on.
- Close to clients to learn from there their points of view about the service","- No opportunity to grow within the company. 
- Was an unpaid job."
8575,Uber,"Excellent culture, dramatic vision and a sense of purpose",2014-11-20,5.0,Visual Designer,"It's cliched in today's post Silicon Valley tech world, but Uber is quite literally changing the world. There's something incredibly humbling and empowering knowing we're creating a product that is used around the world to improve lives. You might think I'm talking about the rider experience, but Uber is even more impactful on the lives of drivers who Uber helps enable them to make more money (whether supplemental or as an alternative to a lesser pay gig) and provides an opportunity to have more control over their lives than ever before.

Unlimited vacation is cool, but we have a culture that you actually want to be a part of every day. There are so many exciting things happening at Uber that whatever else going on in your life doesn't seem as important. Crazy but true!

Uber's gotten a hard time in the press about our culture. I'd say that anything relating to misogyny or biased treatment towards candidates or employees is more of a symptom of a problem within society than Uber's culture. We hire the best candidates period. We all want to work with smart people that will help move the company forward. It's unfortunate that this means playing into all of the typical trouble tech companies get into with hiring predominantly white males. That said, I look around me on any given day and see a big variety of ages, genders and races.

We've also been criticized for our aggressive culture. We want to win in an extremely competitive space. Our company turns whole industries into our enemies. How can we be blamed that we have a thick skin that thinks of every way to defend ourselves and succeed?

If you don't believe my words and are think Uber is interesting, you owe it to yourself to connect with someone at Uber and come in to see it for yourself.","A lot is demanded of employees, but that can be a pro or con depending on your perspective. Some employees can get wrapped up in the outside perception of us and not want to be a part of that. Management needs to continue to mature, watch their words, and 'grow up' as we grow and increase in importance."
8576,Uber,Best experience of my life.  I've learned and grown more since being at Uber than I ever have anywhere else.,2014-11-19,5.0,Marketing Manager,The caliber of people and the fact that good enough isn't ok.

My job changes on a quarterly basis as I find new sprint projects that turn into full time gigs, and management allows for me to experiment and try new things all the time. There is a lot of trust within teams and everyone is always willing to pitch in. It's truly a family environment.","Work-life balance can be tricky; It's easy to work a 14 hour day and not realize it. At the same time, there are married folks on the team who work more flexible hours with no discrimination from management. You're free to work from home if you want. It's a culture that as along as your getting everything done plus some it doesn't matter how many hours you work or where you work from."

It is truly a results-driven culture and meritocracy. It is no doubt the most engaging professional experience I have had, and the time at the office never quite feels like time at the office.","The job is certainly not for everyone, as it's demanding and you're on call 24/7 with responsibilities.  Some thrive in this high pace environment, and I truly enjoy hitting the ground running to work every morning."
8583,Uber,"If you like a good challenge, look no further.",2014-11-10,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"Unprecedented amounts of freedom and independence. You are basically able to run your own start-up, but you have access to the company's know-how and budget. Very close collaboration between cities, knowledge sharing is great, you can always ask for help and receive great advice. Managers are leaders rather than bosses. Great examples come from the top and trickle down to the rest of organization. You get to work with some of the smartest, most hard working people in the world. Learning curve is basically vertical.","You are not going to see your friends and family very often. This job is extremely demanding, so definitely not for everyone. You have to be ok, with the controversies surrounding the company and occasional hostility from people in your social circles."

If you are looking for a place that you can clock in and clock out of at 40-50 a week, move on. Uber is a place for you to obsess over. You will find that most of your thoughts and ideas relate to your work.","There are very smart people at Uber, but most are very inexperienced. That's not to say the brilliance doesn't shine through, but when it comes to admitting failures on certain initiatives, they are ofter masked with flattery because of maturity level."

8589,Uber,Job of a lifetime. Srsly.,2014-11-07,5.0,General Manager,"Despite its tremendous growth, Uber has maintained its amazing culture. Everybody from the CEO to the newest hire needs to be and is encouraged to be an entrepreneur. I have never seen so much ownership and responsibility placed in every person in an organization. Read any job posting - they sound too good to be true, and yet they are all incredibly accurate. The bar is high, expectations are high, and that is incredibly empowering. The work we are doing is changing the world before our eyes, and once you're here you realize that the existing hype isn't even half the story. Hang on - you'll remember this job for the rest of your life.","This job will be your life - not because your boss is counting your hours, but because you're addicted to Uber. If you're not, don't apply. You're going to be really unhappy and burn out fast.

Career opportunities are abundant but not readily identified for you. I couldn't tell you what my next role could be - but I think there will be one. This can be stressful, and it means you need to blaze your own trail a bit."

8595,Uber,I Know I'm Part of Something Awesome...,2014-11-05,5.0,Community Operations Manager,"This is an exciting place to be. Uber is rapidly growing, and the sense here is that, if you're smart and passionate, you could do just about anything you want. We're really committed to the idea that ""the best idea wins,"" so it doesn't matter who comes up with an idea, if it's good and you want to own it, you can. 

The people here are very smart and they typically come from a good pedigree (top schools / companies), but that doesn't mean much culture-wise; we're all about what you're doing now and how hard you're working. During crunch-times, everyone knows we're in it together and we all help out. In fact, you'll see a lot of cross-departmental pitching in, which probably comes from the start-up phase when everyone was mostly a generalist.

About the compensation and benefits: Uber takes care of its employees. The pay is good. The free food is good. The Uber credits are awesome. The office you work in (HQ at least) is slick.","(1) We could loosen up in the office a bit. Everyone is so heads-down ""in it"" that people get tightly wound. We could all stand to chill out and be a little friendlier. (The end of day trip to the kegerator helps with this.) 
(2) Friends texting you when their Uber is late or takes a bad route. 
(3) Reading negative press drummed up by taxi PR people."

You're given a ton of responsibility to build awesome products and if you're willing to roll up your sleeves and get right into the weeds of a problem - you'll do well here. The company is growing at such an incredible pace that there's a new challenge each and every day.You'll never be bored and there's always something fun to work on. 

The benefits are also top notch - riding in Black Cars, catered lunches, and free healthcare is pretty awesome.","The worst thing about Uber is comp. We get a good amount of equity which will 100% be worth it in the end, but if you're coming from Finance or Consulting expect a 20-30% cash pay cut. 

The hours used to be maddening but we've done a much better job at hiring recently. The work life balance has gotten  a lot better but it's still really hard to disconnect. Expect to always be on and get pulled away during major holidays, events, promos, etc. We're always sprinting."

You get thrown into the fire quickly, and will be asked to solve problems right from the start. This can be stressful at first.","You'll probably get asked to do things you have no idea how to do, and will be expected to figure it out on your own. You need to be comfortable with putting yourself out there to find answers. You'll probably have a few late nights while getting up to speed."
8607,Uber,Collaborative. Innovative. Fast Pace. Fun.,2014-11-03,5.0,Recruitment Coordinator,"Uber has some of the brightest minds working on cutting-edge projects involving all-hands on deck. From world-class deals and litigation that is changing the face of tech-law, to scaling exponential growth and moving globally lightening fast, we work crazy hours sometimes because this is the most exciting place to be! Leaders of the industry in each respective field are working to build a new economy driven by instant consumer input. The best ideas win and the focus is on creating something great. It's inspiring to work here!","We work longer hours than the typical 9-5 job, but that is because Uber has places to be, people to see, and paradigms to change. Timing is flexible and team communication is open enough to work through any potential timing snafus."
8608,Uber,Amazingly Fast-Paced and Exciting Place to Work,2014-11-03,5.0,Product Manager (Software Engineering),"Uber has been an absolutely amazing place to work. You are given a lot of responsibility out of the gate, just because there is so much work to do which makes it an amazing place to learn and grow in your career. The management is driven and execution focused but also has the vision to see beyond the day to day that could keep Uber busy for years. Uber isn't a cult which is what I've seen at a lot of tech companies but also remains a tight knit community.",The culture is very competitive (although from what I've seen so far merit based) and if you're looking to work a normal 9 to 5 Uber isn't for you.
8609,Uber,Best career decision I've ever made,2014-11-03,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"Working at such a fast growing company, I can have a hand in everything. New ideas are encouraged and there's a freedom to pursue your interests. There is no defined career path which makes the future even more exciting. The company is filled with smart people that are truly passionate about their work.","If work-life balance is your thing, Uber is not for you. 6+ days a week of work is the norm and there are often last minute changes that come up that will force you to cancel plans. With that said, it doesn't feel like a traditional job and the time flies. As we grow fast, there is some growing pains where not everything (systems, org structure, etc) are in place."
8610,Uber,Everyday you are presented with interesting and complex challenges,2014-11-03,5.0,Marketing,"Everyday you are presented with interesting, complex challenges that really push you. In addition, I love working along some of the smartest people I've ever met. Really makes you step up your game.",There isn't any formal training. It was pretty intimidating those first few weeks but I suppose it makes you stronger / more resourceful in the end.
8611,Uber,Best place I have ever worked!,2014-11-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Empowerment - you get given a ton of responsibility from day one. 
Career Advancement - If you perform you get promoted quickly.
Learning - Every city is a start-up within a larger start-up, so you still get the feel of a new city in a growing company","It is a fast pace, keep up!"
8612,Uber,"one of the most exciting places to work right now, period.",2014-11-02,5.0,General Manager,"a chance to work with some of the smartest and most aggressive people ever - you'll know whether or not you're a fit for uber within a week. as the company grows to new levels, so does your own personal development. everyone at the company is super passionate about the company and the product, which is great for company culture",understanding how to have work life balance and management of your time is key.
8613,Uber,Get in the thick of an international growth startup,2014-11-02,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"Lots of freedom; especially for the newer, international cities. Having come from a startup background I've had no trouble adjusting, just the right amount of oversight and high level goals combined with support from someone who has done it before. The pace of growth - this company grows month-on-month what most established companies do in a year. You'll learn how to scale first-hand
Super transparent. You can see everything. As a data-nerd this is amazing. The data is the single best reason for working at Uber.
Culture is awesome (for someone who's never done the whole silicon valley thing before, that's the experience you get). You are working with world-class talent. I've met a couple hundred people here, not one of them is a person I would not want to work with. People are passionate, smart and focused. Uber will make you a more capable employee, better entrepreneur and impart that ability to get the right sh*t done so no matter what you do or where you go next, you will be able to do it better.","Can be tough for detail oriented individuals. I'm borderline OCD (self-diagnosed!) and the engineer in me twitches every time I do the time-saved vs. time-taken trade-off in terms of ""Do I write a script to automate this?"" or ""Do I set up auto-calculate in this sheet"". Things are changing and scaling so rapidly that you'll need to be flexible on level of detail and really firm on making sure you use time as efficiently as possible
Time (again for the internationals); you will never have enough of it. For the international operational roles Uber is still very much in expansion mode and it will consume all of your waking hours. Expect to work... a lot. But for the right candidate this won't be a problem.
That goes for compensation as well. This isn't an amazing compensation package for the amount of work you do. If your sole metric is $ then this probably isn't the right role. If you want something engaging, consuming, amazing, frenetic and passionate then this is the job for you."
8614,Uber,General Manager,2014-11-02,5.0,,"Work with amazing people all over the world, tons of autonomy. Be part of one of the fastest growing companies in history. ~250 cities in just over 4 years!!",We do work very hard. Every person you meet will want to talk about Uber!
8615,Uber,High impact at lightning speed,2014-11-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people you work with here are some of the most smart and impressive people that I've ever met. Everyone in the company, regardless of title is encouraged to talk about their ideas and make things happen. This has really helped it keep it's startup-like atmosphere that keeps people passionate about what they are doing. The rapid growth of the company also allows you to work on several different types of projects which is great for anyone looking to work on high-impact products and expand their professional skills.","Because of how frequently Uber is in the media and how many people use the product, as an employee you very frequently have to deal with people with very strong opinions against Uber. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and this is often the case with large startups, but it is something that you should expect to have to deal with."
8616,Uber,Empowered Job at a Great Company,2014-11-02,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"Everyone believes in the mission of the company, is extremely smart, and works very hard to contribute to company success. Management has empowered employees to be able to make a variety of decisions and there is very little bureaucracy at all. Teams around the world all develop a strong sense of camaraderie and pride and are constantly working to innovate. Always new problems to solve and satisfaction in the sense to contribute directly to company success.",Hours are certainly long. Maintaining balance between personal and work life would be considered more of a con if colleagues weren't so much fun to be around. Could be tough on someone with children or a family at home.
8617,Uber,Grow Quickly in an Passionate Work Environment,2014-11-02,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"Uber has an incredibly stimulating workplace environment where you are surrounded by talented and intelligent coworkers. Since the company is exploding, hard work is rewarded with new responsibility and the potential to jump into roles that are not yet even created! The work hard, play hard mentality really propels the team forward - employees are passionate about making Uber the absolute best product out there.",You need to be able to execute without much direction and adapt well to constantly changing priorities.  You are your own boss and must be able to own that responsibility!
8618,Uber,Ride of a lifetime,2014-11-02,5.0,General Manager,"Plain and simple - ownership. Uber is not just a start-up, but hundreds of start-ups in cities all over the world. That keeps the environment feeling small, nimble, and experimental. You have tons of autonomy to make your own decisions and run your business. A true entrepreneurial experience!","Uber is a super high growth environment. It's exactly the challenge I wanted and why I joined, but you have to be prepared for full on start-up mode."
8619,Uber,Hypergrowth Company doing incredible things,2014-11-02,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"A lot of reviews on glassdoor are from Drivers/Partners that don't capture how the engineering culture is.

Company is solving a really big & tough problem - ground transportation. There is a whole new level of reliability that is needed for Uber's systems, due to the fact that it is moving real people and things. FB/Twitter/... not loading for 20 mins is bad for the company's business. But Uber not working for 20 mins, means someone misses their interview or someone might be stranded for a while. 

So, the company seems to be ready to invest in a lot of long term technology pieces needed to get there. So, if you are a developer hungry for working & experimenting new software systems, I would say Uber should rank among the top 3 places right now in the valley. 

People are nice and generally willing to help you out. Everyone is tuned (the onboarding process is very good at tuning new people also towards this) to working towards getting things out of the way and march towards the company's goals. So, if you believe in the vision of Uber and have an attitude of making progress, you will do absolutely fine here!","As with any high growth company, no everything is necessarily figure out.. There is lots & lots & lots of work to do, which could mean longer working hours."
8620,Uber,"Super exciting with awesome people, best job I've ever had",2014-11-02,5.0,Software Engineer,"Simply put, the best job I've had. The business side is growing super fast, and that gives a lot of fascinating problems for the technical side, that I enjoy working on. The best part is that people are smart, dedicated, and hardworking in working towards the goal.","Cons or not, but not a job for everyone. You have to be dedicated and enjoy working in fast-paced environment."
8621,Uber,Challenge Yourself,2014-11-02,5.0,Product Manager (Software Engineering),"- Highly transparent, entrepreneurial, autonomous culture.
- Accountability over approval. Move fast, make the right (data-driven) decisions, and don't let bureaucracy/process slow you down. 
- Lots of hard and interesting problems to solve. We're moving atoms with bits.
- Tons of upside potential for the business and lots of room for individual growth.
- Still a great ground-level opportunity. Helping to shape important product/policy/processes every day.
- No excuses. People get things done here.","- This is not a place for you if you need a lot of process/structure to succeed
- Be prepared to work as hard as everyone around you, which is really hard. I don't actually see/hear anyone complaining excessively about the hours though because everyone's so into what we're doing here."

8625,Uber,The Most Rewarding Job I've Ever Had - Changing the World Every Day,2014-11-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Uber is truly changing the world in a way that only a handful of companies ever do.  It is exceptionally rewarding to be a part of that revolution.  What's more, each person has an ownership for their responsibilities in the company that allows them to directly affect the success of the business.  There is nothing more exciting to me than seeing my efforts directly impact the business numbers within only a week or two.

Uber has a strong culture of accountability, transparency, dedication, and competitiveness.  Uberites work very hard, have much expected of them, and share wins and losses alike.  And Uber loves to win.  So there is a strong and healthy competitiveness in everything we do.","The challenges at Uber are driven by its exceptional growth.  Work-life balance is a challenge, because the company is growing at a rate that makes hiring the right people quickly enough to keep up very difficult.  There is also very much a culture of grinding and working hard that is a part of the ethos.  Employees are expected to go all-in when they join the team.  That said, for those who work at Uber, it's a passion, and most want to put in the hours needed to be successful because the work is so rewarding and the team is strong."
8626,Uber,"Fierce, fast, and with an amazing attitude",2014-11-01,5.0,Software Engineer,"The quality of the employees, from IT, to Facilities, to Engineers, is out of this world amazing. Uber hires only the best, and it shows with the level of service and quality of work.

The office perks are slightly higher than an average perk-oriented startup; they offer full lunch and dinner, with beverages and snacks everywhere.

Everyone is devoted to bettering the company and everyone is expected to do so.","The work is abundant and the office space is limited. With a staff that is doubling every 6 months, space is getting tight fast. But management is adding space as fast as they can to keep up, with excellent long term plans in place, I look forward to working here for a long time."

Gives employees a lot of room and scope to grow and contribute however possible. Things GET DONE QUICKLY, and the impact you make is tangible in affecting your local community and driver partners every day. The startup culture is still very much intact and teams are all working hard toward the same goal.",Some growing pains as company infrastructure is still being developed vs what you'd find at a more mature company.

From an engineering perspective the culture allow everybody to get involved in critical work. You can take on any challenge you feel ready for or want to figure out if you are ready for",Everything moves at a very high pace and everybody is expected to take a lot of responsibility. You need to be ready for that or it can be stressful.

Fun and warm colleagues. = I've never been happier. And I previously worked at the last two hottest startups in Silicon Valley for the last few years.,"There is nothing that I would specifically consider a ""con"" of working at Uber. If anything, I'd suggest to management that they hire an executive chef and kitchen staff and build out a full kitchen that serves gourmet breakfast, lunch and dinner. I know this sounds a bit ridiculous, but food is the centerpiece of hacker culture in Silicon Valley, and was central to creating the ""magic"" at the last two companies I worked at. I think it'd go a long way in attracking and retaining talent. It does at Google, Facebook, Dropbox and Palantir ;)"

I'm surrounded by work-hard, play-hard, hustle-obsessed, results-oriented people that inspire me to constantly become more efficient, learn, and achieve.","Very long hours and less opportunity for work-life balance. But at the same time, who cares if you're putting in long hours and have a mind-blowing amount of responsibility if you believe in your company's innovation, absolutely love what you do, and love who you're doing it with more!? Uber is not a job; it is a lifestyle, and it should be appreciated as such. The lightning pace, frequency and degree of constructive change, and sheer amount of talent in this workplace make it like no company on earth. The historical opportunity to be here now is what keeps me striving."

- great culture
- meaningful product as for drivers as for users
- opportunity to make real changes in the environment
- opportunity to do your best
etc,etc,etc

Salary might be slightly below top tier consulting firms, but instead of this fancy style consulting UBER provides amazing spirit of young ambitious team that conquers market after market. Nice feeling of being not like everybody. You just do your job and it doesn't matter how you look like. People talk to you because you are smart and cool, not because you look official. 

Really. Once you get into - you understand why it is so successful!","Challenges are actually not cons, it;s the best challenges I had:
- workload is great. You push hard and you rest great! For those who loves high hills
- constantly changing environment. Hard to get used to, but once you did - live will never be the same"

Probably it looks like it may be hard to maintain work/life balance, but I would say Uber becomes your life. It's definitely pro to me, but some might consider this as con.

Spread across all over the globe you always have one specialist just a ping away – specialists who quickly become your closest friends.

Travis is a visionary, and will inspire you to grind it out every day.","We have the standard issues related to hypergrowth, but nothing that negatively affects your work. Work life balance is obviously much more sided towards work, but that's what you sign up for.

8662,Uber,"Smart People, Great Company to work for",2014-10-31,5.0,Analyst,"(1) Uber is full of problem solvers. There are so many smart and hardworking people to learn from. 
(2) Given that the company is growing so quickly, there are a lot of opportunities to do work that would be considered outside my pay rate at other companies.
(3) The company is really flat - best ideas win regardless of whose idea it is. 
(4) People are often impressed when you say you work at Uber
(5) Perks are pretty sweet","(1) People have stated that the work life balance is not so great. My perspective on that is that if you like your coworkers, and the work that you do, the hours tend to pass by very quickly."
8663,Uber,I wake up in the morning and look FORWARD to going to work,2014-10-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Creative environment, fun coworkers, true vision for changing the world and leadership structure that values every idea - from intern to C-level.","Rate of growth means cramped quarters, HQ location is a lunch/bar desert around the building, no offices - only pods."
8664,Uber,Great Challenge,2014-10-31,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,Tons of autonomy. I've had the opportunity to run my own business unit. I've also had the opportunity to sharpen my analytical skills.,Uber requires me to work long hours but there is definitely a light at the end of the tunnel.

8667,Uber,"Fast growing, exciting company - pumped to come to work everyday!",2014-10-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Get to work with crazy smart, fun people on challenging/interesting problems that you wouldn't find elsewhere.  Always pushed to find creative solutions for everything that you do.  Amazing passion for the product from everyone in the company creates a great environment to work in.","Work life balance can be a challenge.  Need to be ready to put in long hours.  That said, you're surrounded by your team which makes it more manageable"
8668,Uber,Extremely demanding and extremely satisfying,2014-10-31,4.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"Brilliant and hard working colleagues, extremely committed 
There are very few opportunities out there to work in a company that is making such a huge impact in the world in every dimension
Because the company is growing so much and so fast there are many opportunities to experience different roles /responsibilities","It's hard to achieve work-life balance
The company has outgrown a ""typical start up"" but at the same time it's not a corporation, so in terms of talent management, employee wellness and some lines of accountability, there is room for improvement"
8669,Uber,Marketing Manager,2014-10-31,5.0,Marketing Manager,"People are Smart  but super approachable.
Having uber credits is not too shabby
Stock option is even a better part of the company 
We have a  Wicked product that has a REAL impact on people s life
This job gives Flexibility and we can work in different offices around the globe",we tend to work very long hours and around the clock like any start ups
8670,Uber,Make a big impact and be rewarded for it,2014-10-31,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"#1 A truly data driven company where scientific experiment results drive business decisions and politics rarely do
- The rare tech company with true real-world operations that positively impact lots of people (income creation for drivers, convenience, affordability, and comfort for riders)
- It's a rocket ship
- Talented, cool people","- Low salary. Yes the equity should make up for it in the long run, but it's not awesome to live in SF on a budget
- Long hours. Not really a Con because the work is fun but it can be a LOT at times"
8671,Uber,Best tech company to work for.,2014-10-31,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"I came from a management consulting background to the Ops team, and could not be happier. It's been less than a year, and I can genuinely say I made the best career decision moving to HQ and working here. As to why..
(1) Smartest, most intellectually curious people who are data driven and can execute - I am constantly amazed by the intelligence and background of everyone on the team. Some of the brightest people I've met in my life, and I am so lucky to be learning from such diverse backgrounds and approaches to thinking. One of things that was missing from management consulting was true hands-on execution. Uber is about bringing forward the brainpower + ability to execute, and it's an incredibly fulfilling combo. 
(2) Hustle and energy - Enthusiasm / Uber love for the product and team is unparalleled. Everyone looks out for each other to hustle, pitch in, and get it done, regardless of what it takes. 
(3) It's just fun - I really look forward to work each day.","Difficult to come up with cons, but probably work-life balance (not unheard of in the tech world here in SF). Uber does end up seeping into what I think about 24/7, and end up working quite a bit into weekends, etc. but that's also a personal decision."
8672,Uber,Love going to work everyday!,2014-10-31,5.0,Marketing Manager,"I've been at Uber for about a year and a half and I couldn't imagine a better place to work! Here are a few things I love most:
- Meaningful Work: We get to work on meaningful issues and make a real impact on how people move around the world. I go to work everyday with a purpose and see results. 
- Culture: The culture at Uber is awesome - the best ideas win, not seniority. The people are awesome and it's a very work hard, play hard atmosphere.  The culture is also super transparent. You have access to senior management, and everything you need to be as successful as possible
- Perks: Unlimited vacation, gym membership, catered lunches, Uber credit - the perks rock.","Long hours - but it doesn't feel long because I like what I'm doing. If you're in the office late, we'll normally order dinner as a group. 
Work/life Balance: Uber will become a big part of your life. Everyone that works here is passionate and likes to go the extra mile. If you're not willing to let your job bleed over into your personal life, this probably isn't the right place for you."
8673,Uber,The smartest and most hardworking people you will ever meet!,2014-10-31,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,Being a part of a high-growth company where you have tons of autonomy and work with brilliant people is one of the most rewarding experiences. I am super optimistic about the outlook of the company and excited to help the growth and grow personally and professionally with the team.,"We work extremely hard so work-life balance can be a bit of a struggle. However, the growth speaks for itself, if you are a stranger to hard-work this isn't the place for you and that is very clear in recruiting and communicating expectations."
8674,Uber,"The Best Job I've Ever Had, And Will Ever Have",2014-10-31,5.0,General Manager,"I've worked on Wall St and graduated from a Top Tier MBA program, but I've never had the joy of working with so many smart and passionate people as I have at Uber. The environment is one where people work extremely hard because they are personally bought into the company mission and are passionate about their work product. This is an environment where great ideas are rewarded and every employee is encouraged to innovate.","If you are someone that is looking for a 9-5 job, you have found the wrong place. The collective push of an entire organization that is singularly focused on a larger shared goal is amazing for me to be a part of, but its not for everyone."
8675,Uber,"Great people, incredible product, high-paced work environment",2014-10-31,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"- people are awesome: smart, driven, hard-working - would want to grab beers after work with almost everyone
- product is changing the way people live their lives in hundreds of cities around the world
- high-paced, results-oriented work environment
- very, very little bureaucracy","- gotta be prepared to work long hours
- requires some grind: not everything you do is glamorous, but all important to the cause"
8676,Uber,Most exciting/stimulating/rewarding environment I've ever worked in.,2014-10-31,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"Working in a fast paced operating environment backed by the most sophisticated software engineering and data analytics teams on the planet. What more could you want?

Your other employes will be the most motivated and bright folks you've ever worked with. As a result, you'll be pushed to achieve things you didn't think possible, and have the career freedom to see those through.","We work hard, and expectations are high. If that's not your bag, might be a tough fit."
8677,Uber,10x cooler than your last job,2014-10-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people, the pace, the challenge -- you can't beat Uber. Culture and camaraderie of a startup, resources of a global company. People are legitimately pumped about the vision and the mission.",It ain't a lifestyle job -- you can't change whole transportation / logistics networks from 9 to 5...
8678,Uber,Can't imagine working anywhere else,2014-10-31,5.0,Community Manager,"Uber truly believes in the concept of ""best idea wins."" It doesn't matter how long you've been at the company or what level you are, if you have an awesome idea Uber will let you pursue it. The people here are insanely smart, innovative, and passionate. It's incredible to be a part of such rapid growth and see the impact of what you're working on immediately. There's of course starting to be growing pains, but that's part of what makes it so invigorating and such an interesting place to work--you don't necessarily know what's going to be happening next.

I was at Google for almost two years prior, and despite how much I loved it, I can't imagine being anywhere other than Uber.","You have to be very comfortable with ambiguity. Changes can happen fast, and you have to be willing to be on board and adapt fast. If you need structure, this might not be the best environment."
8679,Uber,Amazing Work Environment,2014-10-31,5.0,Driver Operations Manager,Awesome team and supporting work environment. This job never gets boring.,"There really aren't many cons. We work long hours, but I knew that coming in."

8682,Uber,Work on awesome problem-space with awesome people!,2014-10-31,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"There are amazing engineering problems and features to work on. Our systems deal with real-time constraints at high scale. People work professionally and are dedicated to quality engineering and performance.

The company rewards high performance and gives lots of potential for career growth. The perks are awesome too!","The company is growing fast, so there is a constant challenge to figure out the best ways to communicate and organize. This is a good sign though as it always comes with success. It is promising though that upper management is constantly keeping an eye on growth issues and are always trying to adjust for our growth."
8683,Uber,"Fast-paced, hardworking, and incredibly rewarding",2014-10-31,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"It's amazing to be surrounded by so many hardworking and intelligent people. I'm constantly amazed at the talent we have at Uber. The amount of autonomy that we're given is fantastic and ability to approach anyone in the company with questions is unparalleled. What do you here actually matters, unlike many other companies. You see the results of your actions.","Hours can be long, but you're not at it alone."
8684,Uber,"It's like all things: the more you put in into it, the more you get out of it.",2014-10-31,5.0,Marketing Manager,"People, benefits, culture, freedom to be creative and think outside the box. I know everyone around me is putting 110% into everything they do, which makes you want to work that much harder for your team!","Not a 9 to 5, no room for mediocracy, growing like crazy - which can be a pro and a con."
8685,Uber,No where else you want to be,2014-10-31,5.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"From day 1 you are not just a part of a smart and impactful team but your opinions are given respect and seriously considered. An employee thats been around for 10 hours or for 2 years, it doesn't matter both have the chance to look at a problem, find a solution, and implement it. Thats the best part of being here - not only do you come up with the solutions you right away see the impact!  

Uber is constantly striving to keep employees happy not just by providing the regular start-up stuff (free lunch, lots of t-shirts, great offices) but also by finding opportunities for employees internally. Locally if you work at an Uber city you can impact that city in unimaginable ways and YOU get to make the decisions.",Its a tough job - but you are willing to put in the hours you get the benefit of ...equity in the company! Something everyone wants right now in the fastest growing company. Everyone is an owner and we all work our butts off to make sure Uber becomes the most successful company in the world.
8686,Uber,Business Analyst,2014-10-31,5.0,Business Analyst,"Motivated and hard-working people who believe in the product.
Definitely still a startup in hyper-growth mode.
Doing great work, so the product isn't in as much risk as other startups of just dissipating.

8689,Uber,Great place to work,2014-10-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Surrounded by some of the smartest people I've ever met!
-The bar is constantly being raised....there is no status quo
-Still has scrappy/startup-y mentality with accessible execs and employees willing to roll up their sleeves for any task, nothing is too small",-The pace is incredible but it can also be exhausting
8690,Uber,Exciting and dynamic,2014-10-31,5.0,Community Operations Manager,"Always work to be done, intelligent and driven colleagues, innovative product, limitless growth potential.",Demanding. Be ready to hustle.
8691,Uber,"very fast growing company, exciting opportunities",2014-10-31,4.0,Software Engineer,"Hard to describe Uber as a startup anymore, but with the rate we're growing there are still many opportunities to define your role and work on super exciting projects.  Execs have done a good job defining product and keeping engineering growth on track.  Biggest challenges are with scaling!","Not everyone has a great work-life balance, but I've managed to avoid that trap.  Definitely some growing pains, but we're on the right track."
8692,Uber,Uber is a fantastic growing company to work for,2014-10-31,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Uber is an amazing growing company that challenges individuals to the best at their jobs.  There is an open line of communication with the executive team.  The people I work with on a daily basis are extremely smart and passionate about their job.  The culture is to share knowledge, keep on learning, with a huge emphasis on team.  The company offers great perks to the employees.",Uber is a growing company so it experiences growing pains as our teams continue to grow and user base grows.  The salaries are competitive but not top tier.
8693,Uber,best company ever.,2014-10-31,5.0,Software Engineer,"This is a great company with a growth mindset with man opportunities for big learning and personal and team growth. Many great talented people work here and realize the mission. This isn't a 9-5 company, but a place where the top ideas really matter and great solutions are needed. Some of the positive characteristics:

- top engineers
- best solutions win
- lots of humor
- big equity potential
- amazing challenges (scaling, growth)","- location of office (subjective)
- work is too much fun here (balance)"
8694,Uber,Fierce,2014-10-31,5.0,Software Engineer,"As a software engineer, there are a limitless number of different things to work on, and I'm working with a lot of other very excited and smart people..the best. Huge opportunity to learn and grow professionally as the company continues to hire more people. Equity compensation is very compelling, too good to say no. The executives are very transparent with regards to the company's performance. Free breakfast, lunch and dinner every day, plus tons of fresh fruit and snacks.","We are growing so fast, meaning code evolves just as fast. It feels a little overwhelming, but it's exciting to make a personal goal to grow to be able to keep up. While I've never been asked to stay more than 40hrs/week, there is a strong vibe to work long hours and I've had to reconsider how I spend my non-work hours to be more efficient (maybe that's a good thing?). Not enough uber swag, I have to pay for my hoodie???"
8695,Uber,"The best product, people, technology in the world",2014-10-31,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,Uber is an amazing place to work. I see a lot of less than stellar reviews come from people who aren't actual Uber Employees. As an engineer at Uber you get to work with the smartest most connected people in Silicon Valley. People like Pedram Keyani. It's an entrepreneurial company from start to bottom. Everyone cares and is very passionate. Compensation is amazing. The free food and perks are also equally amazing,"Poor outside perception, tough interview"
8696,Uber,A great place to work with colleagues who will push you to do your best work,2014-10-31,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I am still surprised how much impact each day I get to add to Uber and it's mission to reinvent the workforces of today with technology.  Right now its transportation and I'm extremely proud of our values we hold in delivering the absolute best transport with the best service and software.

The engineering culture is fantastic.  Very meticulous in the design and architecture and an absolute execution machine when it comes to pulling things together.  There's no place else I'd rather be right now.",It is tough seeing the PR of the company portrayed in the media swinging from good to bad constantly.  Once the company matures a little in the market it will make it all the more sweeter.
8697,Uber,Great place to build things,2014-10-31,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Things are happening so fast at incredible scale, and so many opportunities are open to build new things with large impact.","Long work hours seem very common, especially if you'll work on projects directly related to the car dispatching system."
8698,Uber,Building Uber has been one of my life's defining experiences,2014-10-31,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,Fast-moving risk-taking engineering culture where we work hard but are constantly rewarded by experiencing the success of our efforts. The level of intelligence and the level of fun on our team amazes me every day.,"Intensity, autonomy, winning ideas that come from anyone in the company regardless of seniority or tenure... Ingredients that make us successful, but certainly not for everyone."
8699,Uber,The most fun I've had,2014-10-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Uber is filled with smart, talented people who honestly want to make a difference. Whether it's headquarters or the city teams, the employees are always trying to push the boundaries. People are empowered to do what they believe is best and that dynamic makes for an exciting environment. I'm struck by the passion and focus.

The path that the company is on is amazing. While growth is important to scale to the current product, where Uber is headed is a huge selling point for new people to join. I've never been more challenged and yet supported in my career.","Changing the world is hard work. Sometimes that means long startup-like hours. People don't stay late because they have to, though. They genuinely want to. You also need to be comfortable with ambiguity and shifting areas of focus. I can't speak for the driver experience, but the employee experience is hard work but with great reward."
8700,Uber,It's uber awesome,2014-10-31,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"a great place for passionate people. The culture is very open and transparent. As an engineer the whole code line is open for you, and you can work on pretty much anything you want to make an impact on. It's a very gratifying experience as you can make changes and see it touch peoples lives almost every day.","with insane growth comes a lot of side effects, especially around lots of work usually ending up on your plate. There is a struggle on work-life balance, but we're getting good at this. But it's a good problem to have, considering it's a side effect of amazing growth."
8701,Uber,"Amazing team, amazing company",2014-10-31,5.0,Engineering,"Smart, collaborative, ambitious, friendly team. Strong leadership, yet very little is top down. Lots of autonomy and opportunity. Amazing growth which makes everything more fun (and challenging)!",Nothing big yet. Hyper growth comes with a set of challenges -- but that's what makes it fun!

8705,Uber,The company that has the ambition to change the world,2014-10-30,5.0,Analytics Engineer,"This is the company that truly wants to change the world. The leadership team and colleagues all have fearless attitude that makes you super pumped, and people just work together to get things done. No office politics and very flat structured.

I don't see much cons."

- Things break when you move fast"
8709,Uber,"Exciting place to work, great engineering team.",2014-10-29,5.0,Mobile Engineer,"After many year in a small company, I'm having great time at Uber. I'm learning a lot from skilled coworkers and I had opportunities to work on important project from the first week. I really love the transparency about internal metrics. 
Also, great benefits.","The fast growth of the company may not be for everybody, things are changing really fast."
8710,Uber,Great place for a software engineer,2014-10-29,4.0,Software Engineer,"- execute fast, move fast
- amazing growth
- great morale","- Benefit could be better, for example, it would be great if the company can get caltrain gopass and Mifi (hotspot) for the employee who spend several hours on commute."

Can't believe how quick they're moving. Refusal to accept mediocrity.","Intensity of work and aggressive culture- for great reasons and with good results, but you'll have to self-moderate to keep yourself from burning out."
8712,Uber,I'm fired up to come to work everyday,2014-10-29,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I get to work with the smartest people I've ever worked with to build a product that I've used and loved since it first launched.  And I get to help bring this great product to new markets, giving consumers and job seekers an additional choice.  

Here are 3 things besides the product and our mission that make me want to work harder
1) Employees are given a lot of flexibility and trust.  I'm not encumbered by a lot of process.  I get to write code and deploy it that day.  
2) The company is very open internally.  I feel like I have a very good idea of what we're doing and what our plans are.  
3) Our CEO.  TK might be our hardest worker.  He's smart and principled and very candid at our weekly company-wide TK Q&A.  It's great having a leader you really believe in",The only con I can come up with is how fast we're growing internally.  I have to spend a lot of time interviewing candidates
8713,Uber,changing the real world with new technology,2014-10-29,5.0,,"smart and nice people
real world impact
transparent culture
fast moving
new technology
flexible working hours
good work life balance
free food","early startup so developer support is not as good as big companies.

food is fine but not many choices

office is not big enough"
8714,Uber,I'm learning a ton,2014-10-29,5.0,Software Engineer,"The office culture is super positive. People are WAY nicer than I thought they would be before I worked here. Everyone is positive and supportive. Compensation is largely based on the growth of the company continuing, so the stock options are where I expect a big payout, but the salary is competitive with startups in SF.","Perks could be better. Since I am periodically on-call, I'd like it if my cell phone was covered."
8715,Uber,An awesome engineering atmosphere where you make a huge impact,2014-10-29,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Amazing culture and atmosphere. The interactions you have in the first few weeks really gets you excited about the company and makes you feel like a big part of the development process.
- Really talented people across the whole company. Can always depend on people in my team and other engineering teams when I need to collaborate on something.",- Things breaking when they probably shouldn't because of an emphasis of getting things out super quickly.
8716,Uber,"Really impactful, great culture, management that cares",2014-10-29,5.0,Software Engineer,"I work on the Growth team at Uber; I joined two and a half weeks ago and it was a great move thus far.

1. You're working on a product that a lot of people in San Francisco use in fact your close friends all use the product.
2. Management (upper and lower-level) is very direct about everything, which minimizes the likelihood of politics. Most other people (afaik) at the company do care about their careers, but they care way more about Uber succeeding.
3. Very talented frontend and backend developers whom you can learn a great deal from. People spend most of their time trying to learn more and doing their jobs better.
4. The company is not risk-averse and is good at taking calculated risks in the market. In that sense the company still operates like a startup and is in a ""swing for the fences"" mode. This makes life at the company exciting.
5. I feel like my manager and skip-level manager both genuinely try to do what's best for 1. the company, 2. the team, 3. their own personal satisfaction and then 4. their own career ambitions, in that order. It's good to feel that way about a company.
6. Not sure about the rest of the company, but on the growth team, there's a great deal of humility. People are honest when they don't know about something and are eager to ask questions.","1. I think the benefits could be a little more competitive with other companies. At the place I came from prior, I was able to get health care for my dad, the gym subsidy was higher (I end up going to the same gym as before, and my prior employer just paid the gym directly), and the food was a little better. Also we had a shuttle that picked me up directly from where I lived. Definitely not the most important thing."
8717,Uber,Intense but rewarding,2014-10-29,5.0,Data Analyst,"My cultural experience at Uber has been everyone pushing hard to find the best solutions to the biggest problems. Politics exist in every company, but facts and data win arguments here more than at any of previous employers. The growth rate and ability to use the product all the time are hugely rewarding, and are not a small part of why work is fun.","Feels a little more traditional than many startups, though I suppose it doesn't fall into the startup category anymore. It's possible in many roles to have a fairly 9-6 job, but there are times when the social calendar has to be pruned a little.

Fun and interesting coworkers,"Lots of pressure, long hours (face-time is emphasized), little mentoring, conflict between management and team members, very hierarchical structure.

The people I work with are super smart, driven, and helpful (that goes for all departments not just engineering).

Interesting projects and stellar people,2014-10-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Really interesting day-to-day projects, interacting with brilliant folks daily, strong management with great vision, lots of opportunity to have impact and drive results, really open culture that is open to debate, folks are still very respectful despite being a very driven/hard-working culture",Long hours; the office is growing very quickly (starts to lose the feel of being a small/scrappier company)

8729,Uber,Awesome team trying to change the way we live!,2014-10-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"You might think its just an ""app"", but there aren't many companies working on a product that changes how people think about transportation or get things done on a daily basis. You have the power to change the direction of things in the company and have an impact across the board. Its very satisfying to see the results of all your hard work pay-off. My peers are extremely dedicated as well as some of the brightest folks I have met!",There are high expectations of everyone within the company and some people may not be able to elevate their game. Leadership is trying to solidify how they operate and there are some growing pains. These are all good problems to have! Its better than companies that are contracting or consolidating to cut costs.
8730,Uber,So many exciting problems to collaborate on and tackle--no day is the same and all bring an invigorating urgency,2014-10-28,5.0,Growth Product Analyst,"1) Learning from peers who are eager to share insights and teach technical skills
2) Exceptionally close collaboration between PMs and Analysts
3) Fearless leadership empowers us to take risks","1) Hours can be long (trickles down from CEO who works 20 hrs a day), but that's standard for a company with as much to accomplish as we do
2) Data and infrastructure growing pains as we continue to scale
3) Remote offices sometimes feel distance between them and HQ"
8731,Uber,Best place for people like to make huge impact.,2014-10-28,5.0,Software Engineer,"Smartest and most passionate people. Everyone in the team are excited about the impact and opportunity. People believe Uber is changing the way people live. This is the kind of work that every morning when you wake up, you feel like your achievement will be rewarded and you are proud of what you are doing.","Since company is on a huge growth path, the office is getting crowded. But the working environment is very stylish and there is already a plan to expand the office space."
8732,Uber,"""Big company"" revenue and growth, ""small company"" feel (culture, ownership, attitude)",2014-10-28,5.0,Software Engineer,"Challenging problems to solve, smartest coworkers in the business, beautiful office space. Lots to keep an engineer busy, as evident by the growing number of 4+ year employees (only a 5 year old company!).",Lots of work + passionate coworkers + tireless management = work-life balance difficulties. Luckily most days being in the office with coworkers is more stress relieving than holing up in a coffee shop to work by yourself.
8733,Uber,Uber is an amazing place to work for,2014-10-28,5.0,Software Engineer,"* First and foremost, I truly believes in Uber's mission and have a deep conviction of the good that Uber is bringing to the society; this gives me a tremendous deal of satisfaction. By disrupting the monopolistic taxi industry, Uber is making transportation more efficient and bringing value to

1) The drivers, who generally have much better pay than driving a taxi (because Uber gives drivers a larger cut of the fare than a taxi company would; because Uber makes rides more efficient so that drivers have less downtime and thus more trips). The drivers would also enjoy flexible hours and being a boss of his/her own (interestingly, this is consistently the #1 reason why drivers love Uber, at least from my personal experiences talking with dozens of drivers) 
2) The riders, by give them much better riding experiences (courteous and friendly driver, cleaner car, convenience in hailing a car, great customer service), as well as cheaper rides
3) The society, by making more jobs (we are creating 50,000 jobs a month across the globe) and taking inefficiencies out of our economy
4) The environment, by reducing the need of self-driving and car ownership, and encouraging ride sharing, Uber could make a potentially very large impact on our environment

* Second reason why I love working for Uber are the people I work with. I am fortunate enough to be working in a team with both great leadership and great colleagues. Here we really work as team, everyone is very talented, works hard and helps each other, and we learn from each other and grow.

And from what I know, this is not true of our team only but a general culture across the entire company --- you don't get this everywhere.

* Last but not least, I am also fortunately enough to be working on a problem that's both technically/intellectually challenging, as well as contributing tremendously to Uber's business bottom-line. Being able to see our work makes real business impact gives me a lot of satisfaction working here.","Being a relatively young company that grows exponentially fast, we do have to work pretty long hours. Personally I don't mind as I really love this company and I voluntarily work after I got home and on weekends too. I think this is just part of being working for a start-up company one truly loves."
8734,Uber,Wow,2014-10-28,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Hyper growth is really exciting, huge business opportunity. We have a very fast moving engineering team. Cool projects that involve moving things and people in the real world and around the globe.",All your friends will want to talk about Uber.
8735,Uber,I'm happy working here,2014-10-28,5.0,Software Engineer,"Uber is the best tech company I have worked for. Uber has got this great momentum. It's exciting to be part of the company that is gonna Uberize the world. The senior management here is just top-notch. We recently hired the Obama's campaign manager to be our SVP. 

My teammates are all very nice and fun to work with. Everyone has his/her own mentor to learn from. I enjoy coming to work everyday.",Not many good restaurants within walking distance.
8736,Uber,Moving fast at scale,2014-10-28,5.0,Software Engineer,"We have the mindset and velocity of a young company still trying to prove itself, but the resources and maturity of a company coming into its own. You get to work on hugely challenging problems, with a lot of resources to bring to bear.","The company is growing quickly, so be prepared to push through problems on your own at times as the usual bureaucracy isn't fully in place yet."
8737,Uber,Huge growth equals huge opportunities for advancement and super cool engineering project work,2014-10-28,5.0,Engineering,"Super smart and motivated team doing awesome work. The rate at which we release features is really exciting, and the product direction is leaping forward in some really interesting ways related both to hyper-growth and business direction. You will never get bored here!","Not getting bored means you have to take care of your own work/life balance. Nobody ever tells me to stay late or offers any judgment about my work hours. But at the same time there is a lot going on which is really fun to work on, and it is easy to find yourself working long hours and barely noticing."
8738,Uber,"What's it like to work at Uber? Intense, challenging but loads of fun.",2014-10-28,5.0,Software Engineer,"Really smart, great people; one of the best leadership team; challenging problems to tackle; huge market opportunities.  For an individual, there are still opportunities to make a big impact.","If you're looking for a 9-5 job where you can clock in and clock out, Uber is not that place. There's some growing pains but it's expected for a company going through hyper growth."
8739,Uber,Awesome place to work for!,2014-10-28,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,Some of the smartest people I have worked with. The engineers are smart driven and motivated. Uber brings in a culture that allows for innovation and fast paced development. Great perks and lunch,- Nothing really. Crowded happening offices?
8740,Uber,Awesome company that pushes you to be your best every day,2014-10-28,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Working at Uber has been awesome; it's a fast-paced environment where you're always on your toes to learn new things and implement the latest tech. There's so much going on behind the scenes at Uber that your opportunities are endless. Oh, and there's working for a company where every new startup seems to be an ""Uber"" for something. It's exhilarating to be a part of this thing!","The insane growth comes with it's downsides: Uber is no longer a scrappy startup where everybody knows everybody and you're all at least aware of what others are working on. Now days it's taken on a little more of a ""corporate"" feel with levels of management and computer policies. Uber has handled it pretty well, but it's a bit of a whirlwind to go from one to the other"
8741,Uber,"The hottest company in the SF area, for a good reason",2014-10-28,5.0,Engineering Department,"Uber attracts a wide of backgrounds, with people who excel at what they do. The environment is genuinely fast paced -- just look at how many cities we have launched in 2014. We hit 100 in April, then 200 at the end of this summer. In addition, we are genuinely making a real difference in the places we operate, connecting people with a reliable ride.","Definitely not a 9-5 job. You're expected to be (almost) always-on, so bring your A game! You do get vacation, and many weekends off, but in order to bring about the change we want, we work really hard to continue to make progress. Also, we get a lot of (unfair) negative press about issues that we don't really have time to adequately address and correct... so most people love us, but working here you have to be prepared to take criticism and Uber questions in your off time from friends and family etc., and answer in a diplomatic way but in a way that doesn't compromise our competitive advantages."
8742,Uber,Meaningful work solving interesting problems,2014-10-28,5.0,Software Engineer,"There are lots of very interesting engineering problems to solve and engineers are given the bandwidth to tackle these problems, and to do so in a fast-paced environment. Not a lot of bureaucracy and the bit that does exist is easy to navigate.   Work life balance is good and the culture is solid. Working with lots of brilliant folks, and engineering training, means Uber is a great place to grow as an engineer.",Working long hours and the associated stress of completing a project on a tight deadline.
8743,Uber,Fun and Fast Growing company to work for,2014-10-28,5.0,Software Engineer,The company is very exciting and continuously working on new features and products. The people here are very smart and driven! Great tools in place to help the company team members run efficiently.,people work very late here. the salaries are lower than other companies but the stock makes up for it a little. theres a lot of potential for stock to grow.
8744,Uber,Uber is the best job I have ever had!,2014-10-28,5.0,Android Engineer,"Fast-paced, challenging work environment. Opportunity to work on big things which are changing cites and the way of life of millions of people.","If you're not into fast-paced, challenging work environments this might not be the place for you. The talent bar is very high and so are expectations."
8745,Uber,Making a huge impact,2014-10-28,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Making a large impact on engineering
- Company is growing fast, lots of challenges
- Modern stack in Python and NodeJS, uses Storm, Kafka and Spark
- 8 hour work schedule, extra hours sometimes depending on yourself and your schedule
- Equity compensation with much larger value that what I could get at Facebook/Google/LinkedIn, and huge upside potential
- 400 Uber credits per month",Really nothing to complain .
8746,Uber,I am doing the best work of my life at Uber.,2014-10-28,5.0,Software Engineer,Probably the best thing about working at Uber is the quality of my co-workers. Easily the best management team I have ever had the pleasure of working for. Another pro for me is due to the pace & growth of our company I am learning so much more than if I worked at a company that has plateaued. Daily challenges present themselves that are highly rewarding when you tackle them.,"You will work hard here, but you won't be alone at least."
8747,Uber,"New-grad Software Engineer, loving the impact & responsibility",2014-10-28,5.0,Software Engineer,"As a new grad, I am given the opportunity to learn a ton and work on cool things that impact user's and other employees throughout the company. I feel like my work does have an impact on the company as a whole. I never have felt like I have been treated like a ""junior"" engineer.

The culture at Uber is pretty awesome. It's very social, we have kegs in the office, and there are quite a few social events, so it's pretty fun.","Since you work on things that matter, when you break something, you have to fix it. Not really a big problem, as I believe engineers should be responsible for fixing things the break, but I've had to kill a few Saturdays fixing a mistake I made on Friday."
8748,Uber,Amazing place to work if you want to make an impact,2014-10-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Extremely smart and hard charging culture.  If you want to get things done and make a big impact, this is the place!","If ""work/life balance"" is what you are looking for, then this is not the place for you.  At Uber, the balance is that we work extremely hard, but also play hard when it comes to it."
8749,Uber,One of a kind experience,2014-10-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Brilliant leadership, moving real things in the real world, relatively comfortable work life balance. Freedom and flexibility as long as your delivering. Still has the startup vibe.","You're going to work hard. If you want a 9-5, not the place for you."
8750,Uber,Growth growth and more growth..,2014-10-27,5.0,Growth Team,"Very flexible team culture. Opportunity to work on a vast number of initiatives. The best idea always wins, and it doesn't matter who's idea it is.

Definitely a work hard, play hard environment.",No big cons. It's an intense environment so be ready to work hard.
8751,Uber,Best place I've worked at so far,2014-10-27,5.0,Software Engineer,"Working at Uber is really fulfilling. We work on hard and interesting problems, the company is extremely flat so everyone has a voice and can bring ideas to execute on.
Every single employee is smart and extremely passionate about the business, which makes the work environment amazingly motivating and energizing.
It offers amazing career opportunity for everyone. 
Free Uber and other perks are also nice obviously.","This is the fastest growing company, ever. So obviously being in that hyper growth phase, you need to work a lot of hours, but I've seen a worst."
8752,Uber,The most exciting environment I've ever worked in,2014-10-27,5.0,Software Engineer,"Startups love to talk about how they're 'killing it', even though usually they're just struggling to survive to their next round of funding.  The focus on Uber isn't on 'killing it', everyone knows we're already doing that; we want to know what we can do to kill it faster.

Compensation is extremely competitive, and includes something that no other company can offer: equity in one of the fastest growing companies in history.  Even now, Uber is out of its infancy and continuing to double revenues every six months.

Transparency within the company is a big part of our culture. There's a weekly meeting where anyone in the company can ask the CEO a question and get an honest/unfiltered response.

You get to work with a lot of extremely talented people from a wide variety of backgrounds.  I've met people at HQ from six different continents, and I'm currently the only male engineer on my team. Diversity is a common buzzword these days, but at a company as small and simultaneously global as Uber it's also a reality.","The company is growing extremely fast; sometimes there are more people than desks and working arrangements can get very... 'cozy'. With that growth comes lots of change, and you will feel very uncomfortable if you are used to being in a predictable environment.

Work/life balance may be a deal breaker for some. We're trying to grow the team as fast as the number of problems we're facing is growing, but sometimes the latter outpaces the former and the days can get very long, but the work is usually still exiting. I've never been told to work on a weekend, but I have voluntarily spent a few at the office building something I wanted to make."
8753,Uber,Love working at Uber!!,2014-10-27,5.0,Software Engineer,"-Fast paced. We move really fast and fix things all the time.
-As an Engineer I'm able to drive a lot of product directions, basically being a mini-PM, which I personally enjoy very much.
-Probably best startup in the valley right now in terms of growth rate. I really believe Uber will hit it big.","-Food is not the best
-We work really hard, so had to cut down some time spent with family. I'd say there's still work life balance though."
8754,Uber,Uber is an amazing company to work for,2014-10-27,5.0,Software Engineer,"Change the world. They're fundamentally changing the way people interact with the world, bridging the digital with the ""real world"". It's an amazing opportunity to be a part of.","The company is in a complex market, and tech journalists often don't understand the nuance. It could be frustrating to read a litany of seemingly negative articles, because the journalists don't understand the actual laws or issues. That's probably a downside to every company that's rapidly changing the world. People who don't work full time in that specific industry probably don't actually understand the issues in the industry."
8755,Uber,Best Job I've Had,2014-10-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Really smart coworkers, interesting problems to solve, growth potential, strong brand, fun culture",We're experiencing some growing pains.
8756,Uber,Great place to work for motivated people,2014-10-27,5.0,Software Engineer,"Uber is a fast moving company where you will never run out of work to do. Despite of this, the work life balance is very good. As long as you're productive when your here you'll have no problems. My favorite thing about Uber is how fast they move. They experiment a lot and prefer to try things instead of theorize about them.","Because of how fast they move, sometimes it's hard to keep up do date on all the stuff Uber is doing around the world."
8757,Uber,"Great place to work, intense, innovative and fast growing",2014-10-27,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The team at Uber is truly awesome. Right from the CEO to the engineer right out of college, everyone seems to be self-driven, optimistic and go-getter. There is a lot of product focus in the engineering ranks. The people are smart and there is willingness to do whatever it takes.  Combine this with great product market fit and what you have is a truly amazing company which will the iconic company of this decade. I believe that Uber will be bigger than Facebook and Google and will touch people's life all around the world.",There is technical debt on account of growing so fast. There is a lot more work that needs to be done on the infrastructure side.
8758,Uber,"Great, Fast-Growing Company",2014-10-27,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Smart people
- Fast pace
- Great leadership
- Awesome benefits
- Tightly knit teams/company

Working for a company that is driven by a vision that every employee shares makes working a pleasure. People here work hard and are great at getting things done. It also helps that we all use our application multiple times a week so we understand the product that we're building.","- As a company that is growing exponentially (global reach and it's personnel), we're constantly faced with new challenges in scaling people and processes, and although handling growing pains is well executed, it requires constant communication that sometimes isn't perfectly executed.
- You'll get pushed to work hard and get a lot done. If you can't keep up with the work, it will impact your work-life balance."
8759,Uber,"Amazing culture, Ambitious mission, Huge potential",2014-10-27,5.0,Engineering Director,"This is an incredibly mission oriented fast placed environment. Everyone is so willing to help and no one shies away from hard problems. When fires come up (and it is a small startup so we have fires) everyone jumps on and solves the problems. 

Everyone feels a real passion for the mission and there is a true belief that we have an opportunity to build a better global transportation system.",It's a young company and a lot of the communication and process could be streamlined. It takes a lot of work to get up to speed and understand what is going on. There are a ton of things to work on and it can be hard to prioritize the most urgent work from good long term investments.
8760,Uber,Great place to work for gives you so much more freedom that a typical job would never give you.,2014-10-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Make own hours
Work as much as you want to
Uber gave me so much freedom and an hourly wage in the high 20's when I couldnt find a job.","Mileage pay rate has been decreasing due to competition with Lyft
Putting so many miles on car
Occasional taxi standoffs
Another con is that customers cannot tip through the app.  Sooooo many more customers would tip drivers if they could and it would keep drivers happy even with lowered rates."
8761,Uber,Working from home full time!,2014-10-17,4.0,Customer Service Representative,"-Super easy work. Everything is 100% done remotely from the interview to the trainings. If you have a background in customer service and are computer savvy you'll be fine. You'll only be answering emails. No phones!
-Flexible schedules! I have the freedom to work whenever I please for the most part. Night owl? Take an evening shift. Prefer to get work over with? Opt for a 5am shift. Best of all everything is broken into 4-hour blocks...so I can work in the am AND the pm if I have another obligation in midday. This is an excellent job for a student, parent, or simply someone who does not like traditional 9-5 white collar work. 
-Awesome management. Truly some of the most encouraging, happy, and helpful people I've ever met. They don't micromanage at all which is a huge perk. 
-Concise and intimate training sessions. Learning remotely is difficult, but the Uber team makes it simple via live video chats. 
-Weekly paychecks! I know it sounds silly...but it really is a big perk haha. 
-Room for growth! Since the remote CSR program is still relatively new there is a lot of opportunity to go through new trainings, which ultimately makes you a more valuable company asset.","-At an hourly rate of $15 that is non-negotiable, funds can be a bit tight if this is your only source of income and live in an expensive state/city. 
-Since CSRs are contracted through a 3rd party employer, they take care of benefits, but they aren't great at all.
-No paid vacation time or holiday pay. 
-Not the best position for someone that is not a self-starter"
8762,Uber,Hectic is the way to describe this company!,2014-10-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,If you got on in the beginning pay and benefit were great.,They did a bait and switch in the middle and decided to move everyone to Zerochaos which took the benefits way

8764,Uber,Long hours and repetitive work,2014-09-24,1.0,Operations and Logistics Manager,"You get a prime seat to watch the evolution of the transportation industry. Good exposure to operations, marketing, and political strategy in a rapidly growing business. You will learn a lot and it's nice to have your company constantly in the news and being brought up in conversation.","Work life balance is horrendous. You will eat every meal at your desk. Despite claims of ""no face time"" there is absolutely the expectation that you need to be seen at your desk well into the evening. You will be online and constantly available on weekends. 

Once you learn the basics of the job there is little change in the day to day. They sell it as a chance to implement innovative solutions, but everything interesting is done at HQ by the strategy and product teams. If you work in a city you just get to implement the vision of management without any real freedom to do anything creative. 

Questionable ethics and the company continues to treat it's drivers extremely poorly preferring. If you have a strong moral conscience you may find yourself staring at the ceiling every night instead of falling asleep after a long day at the office."

Push back is always solicited and no one worries about stepping on toes -- it's all good, because we all know that the best idea wins. You're privy to a great deal of data and knowledge about what the company is up to, which creates a real sense of buy-in and ownership over what we're building.","As expected, it's a fast-paced environment.  You feel like you're constantly behind, so you need to know how to channel that stress into motivation and productive energy.  Work-life balance is tough, but it's because everyone loves the cool things they get to do so much that they don't want to stop doing them."

This is a new position, so we  must adapt to changes/updates quickly.  It's a learning experience for everyone."
8773,Uber,WAS considering working for Uber,2014-07-13,5.0,Trained,Good idea but bad management & ownership,horrible treatment to employees. ..This company sounds very greedy!
8774,Uber,Great work place at least at HQ. Different cities and driver might have a very different experience,2014-07-01,5.0,Software Engineer,"I was surprised about the amount of smart to very smart people working here. The company culture makes it so everybody learns from each other, and at least for my software engineer position, it makes the job much more interesting. Compensation is not competitive for the bay, but people bet on the stocks, and if you believe in it, it is a game changer in comparison with higher salaries you could get somewhere else.
My favorite part is that most people ( if not all ? ) are truly passionate about what they're doing here and we thrive with the belief that we're making a difference for people.
Perks are better than what they sound like during the interview.","This company requires a LOT of work. I'm not talking about startup like, you will get emails at any time of day or night, week days and weekends. Some of them you will be expected to respond. It looks fine for most people because everybody is very involved in what they're doing, so most people don't seem to care, but I wouldn't be surprised if some burn out quickly.
The company is also growing at a fast rate, which makes it difficult to know if things are still gonna be as good in the future ( so far so good though... )"
8775,Uber,Not all it's cracked up to be,2014-06-28,2.0,Remote Community Success Representative,"The only pro is that it's a work from home job that is non-phone and it pays better than most work from home  jobs. I would add that the job is relatively easy, but that could also make the work mind numbing.","I feel that as far as the remote customer service team goes, those in leadership positions are flying by the seat of their pants. Ask two managers the same thing and you are likely to get two different answers. No consistency with scheduling or flexibility. Your experience with scheduling will depend on your manager. Some want you to be available when they say, regardless of your other obligations, while other managers have respect for work-life balance. In addition, there are way too many 12-hour shifts scheduled. This is unacceptable to me. 12-hour shifts should be reserved for those who volunteer and should be rewarded appropriately. If no-one steps up then figure something else out. Scheduling 12-hour shifts shows no regard to the employee. 

For the remote customer service position, we were trained for two weeks, which is sufficient. However, after that you are pretty much left to the wolves. They say you are free to ask questions, but everyone is literally ghost once you end training. They  have a chat system that is for the birds! During training it seems great. However, you will ask a question once you are on ""the floor"" and will get crickets. You will ping a manager for help and get crickets! Then when you look up, the manager has logged out of the chat system. Really?!! So then your only resort is to email a manager and their response is that email is not a good way to get help. How the heck am I supposed to get help when a manager is not around to chat or they ignore my chats?? I understand that not all managers are available 24-7 but the ones that are need to respond. And I shouldn't be chastised for seeking other resources. I'm not sure what I expected, the team leads (most of them, not all) seem rather robotic and boring. Seems like they may not like their jobs, this would explain no one going out of their way to help. 

If you've been working low-paying jobs then  you may put up with these issues, but this is really only a decent salary and I've made more than double what they in a previous career. But I can see how this might seem fantastic to those who have only made a minimum wage salary. My suggestion is to do Uber if you need to, but move on to greener pastures when it's time."
8776,Uber,Love the work you do.,2014-06-17,5.0,Community Operations Manager,"Work with smart people in a challenging, fast paced, and fun environment - working here is life changing. 

The people I work with are now some of my closest friends. They are without a doubt some of the most passionate, brilliant, hard working individuals I have had a privilege to know. On top of they are people that I truly care about and feel truly care about me - everyone is rooting for one another to succeed.

I could not imagine a company that has inspired me to learn more, be better, and push harder. I feel ownership over the work that I do and the growth that I see in the company. Everyday is a new experience, a new problem to solve, or a new question to answer.

The work/life balance is challenging, but people have fun and have a sense of humor. People share interests, spend time together outside of the office, and celebrate hard work. We're obsessed with Uber - it's a requirement.","As much a pro as it is a con - there is a degree of uncertainty in working here. The company is changing fast and if you're not ready for it, you can get whiplash."
8777,Uber,"Growing company, fantastic work environment",2014-05-21,5.0,Software Engineer,"It's not like Uber is some sort of charity, but we still feel like we're affecting the world with what we do here. In a city like San Francisco, where it was nearly impossible to find a taxi cab in the past, democratizing the transportation landscape is incredibly exciting and fulfilling. The great news is the work environment is also game-changing. Everyone is working hard, towards a purpose that goes past twice-monthly paychecks.","There are growing pains, absolutely. With a seemingly never-ending customer base that grows by the hour, keeping our systems up to date and working correctly is a challenge. When new initiatives are pushed through, the workload can be a bit taxing."
8778,Uber,"Exciting, Fast-Paced & Full of Opportunities",2014-05-01,5.0,General Manager,"1. Opportunity to build a brand
2. Global Culture leading to a lot of learning
3. Best of minds working together",1. Lots of work but then a start up demands one
8779,Uber,Uber takes care of it's employees,2014-02-16,5.0,Community Manager,Work never feels like work.  You get to shape your own successes and watch the impact directly.  Managers and colleagues feel more like family.  The company takes care of you.,It's not a 9-5.  Work bleeds into your night and weekends.
