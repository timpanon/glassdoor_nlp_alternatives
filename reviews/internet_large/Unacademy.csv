Even though the workload was alot, it was good to work in that good work environment.","Now that the company is expanding, such useless employees are getting hired and to call them your manager, is an absolute insult. They have no idea, what they are doing, should be doing or how it is done. There are 4 managers in a team of 20. Everyone is running things in a different direction and then there is one who has the leash to all 4 and is an utter waste.
They are not even giving a LoR, and it is an edtech. Both the snr manager and director have stopped responding. How mature is that? Such an act of turpitude. I have worked here for 2 years and when I want something that lil, you will stop responding. They will bug you even on your weekend/leave/holiday. There is no mental peace. They don't care about an employee's future, if you thrive, that is not good for them cuz you won't be there to do their work. The processes are so manual. Nothing is properly executed. They will be a bug in the system every weekend. Then you will have to wait for product to sit and fix it and reschedule everything once that is fixed. So you have no weekend left. You work 24x7 without a proper pay. Incentives get cancelled for no actual reason. No prior notice. 
If you try to reach to upper management, they will just give a diplomatic answer. You can't tell your problems to HR because that will straight go to your manager and you'll be scrutinized there."

2. Terrible leadership. No respect or empathy. You are treated as a robot. They ask for feedback just to throw it in the bin. They have unrealistic expectations and no stable vision.
3. No work freedom. You can't do your best work because estimates are so tight. If you give a proper estimate, it is frowned upon. Add to that micro management.
4. If you think managers can do anything to change any of the above, forget about it because leadership is deaf.

There are 2 types of people who work here:
1. Who hate the work culture and secretly looking out.
2. Who hate the work culture but love their salary more, so not looking out right now.

Advice to people looking to join:
1. Don't join. There are better companies with same or better pay and culture.
2. If you absolutely have to join, don't settle here, keep looking out and beware of low balled offers."

Zero work life balance. 

I was promised a 9 hour/5 day work ween but they made it a 6 day week while keeping the hours same. 

On paper it's 9 hours a day but you'll be working close to 12-14 hours. 

It's rare that you'll even get one whole day off in a week. They'll expect you to be available well before and after your working hours. 

The top management sets very unreasonable targets and give you very little time to plan so you'll be expected to work day and night just to get called out when it inevitable fails. 

They have this terrible YouTube Festival concept every single week so you can say bye to your weekend plans. 

They tell you that they care about you, that they value their employees and they constantly preach about mental health and then they'll take away your weekends and grill you all week. 

The HR is pretty useless and will never help. Just pretty promises and 'We love our employees' presentations every other week. The managers are clueless and some of the dumbest people you'll ever meet. 

You can find solace in the fact that almost everyone working there feels the same way and is suffering."

The HR is only there for hiring. Everything goes through the Director of Sales. No Leaves on crappy Mission Wednesday. If you cannot do sales, you leave the organisation. 

Higher management does not assist the employee in improving, they rather prefer to dump the non performing assets and hire new freshers who want to be a part of labour games.

922,Unacademy,Based on my journey of helping learners crack their goals!,2020-11-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"When I look back at 1 year 7 months journey at Unacademy, the one word that comes to mind is Growth. In 2016 we strived to build great products in Education, as we turn 5 years old in a few days I can say that we are also building a culture that foster greatness and empowers people to perform at their best. 

Purpose: Education is empowering people to crack their goals. This is a purpose and fundamental which drives people to perform better. The two key stakeholders of Education are Educators and Learners. Every decision revolves around providing the best to the Educators and Learners. 

People: We do not hire to execute. We hire to lead. It has been a journey to be surrounded by team members who all are responsible, conscientious and anxious to be valuable, as individuals every Unacademy Team Member gravitates towards tasks that have a high, measurable, and predictable return for the company. A high talent density allows us to break the barriers on a daily basis. 

Process: First Principle Thinking, it is a phrase that is not thrown lightly around. We have broken, reshaped, realigned processes on a daily basis. We are critical of our processes and believe in doing 100 optimizations on a daily basis to enhance the experience and the business outcomes. 

Product: We are a product-driven company. We treat every process, every video, every channel as a product. We believe that a great product triumphs over everything else. 

Now, these 4 Ps are present everywhere and spoken about a lot. But, my journey has allowed me to define two more Ps in my actions, thoughts, and feelings. 

Principles: We strive every day to live up to the leadership principles. it has acted as my guiding north light in every decision. We don't fear screwing up, the bigger fear is what if we screw up together. Hence, the feedback is at the moment. It is then and there. It flows in all directions - upwards, downwards, and across. 

Prosperity: The immense learning that I have had in my journey of 573 days has made the growth possible in every domain - personal growth, as a leader, creating process, building products, business knowledge as well as financial. No two days have been similar. 

Overall, I know that we are not perfect. But, mastery is always a journey and I firmly believe that we will collectively move mountains. We have cracked it in the past, and we will crack it in the future. 

Let's crack it!",- Nothing that is unfixable

They will remain stick to the old educators only who they have added in the plus.Doesn't matter how good you are performing, they will not bother to give a contract.
If you ask them, they will send you always a computerized message saying that our algorithm will tell us when to make you a plus educator.
Their policies should be changed, they should notice new rising educators also.and should give them a chance too because ultimately monetary benefits are the only thing that can motivate you."

Freedom to take decisions! There is no micromanagement here.
As I work very closely with the CEO, I can without a doubt say this has been my best work experience so far! Everyday is new, I feel there has been an excellent growth personally and professionally for me, learning and development is vast!
The vision and mission of the company is shared with all which helps the team work as one to achieve that.
Great leadership team, this inspires one to out do your self each time.
Good work and effort never goes unnoticed, you will surely be appreciated.
The best thing I like about this place is women's empowerment and social security. 

This company is definitely going down in the history books! You are here either for 10 days or for 10 years

CEO- fantastic young entrepreneur that one can come across in the recent times, his vision, mission, dedication, leadership is something that is so motivating it just makes the employees want to give their best!

1071,Unacademy,Great Workplace for the Young + Ambitious,2019-03-05,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Unacademy provides ample opportunities for young professionals who are perhaps low on experience, but high on skills, ideas and ambition to learn and grow. The work culture + leadership value ideas, individuals and their contribution to the business over seniority or maybe formal work experience. If you're able to prove yourself, it is taken notice of and accordingly rewarded.

The work at Unacademy is very fast-paced and iterative, and so as a creative individual, it is very gratifying to see one's work come to life so quickly and efficiently.

Coworkers are also a dynamic group of people motivated by working towards the future of education. As projects can also be challenging + diverse and out of one's formal training, collaboration and support is vital and optimal at Unacademy.","There need to be more dedicated employees in-charge of relaying different operations + developments in the business/product across other teams in the company. Communication between teams isn't active enough. This can sometimes result in assumptions of key objectives of certain projects.

It becomes difficult to work with external agencies and consultancies (especially the big ones), as plans are sometimes fickle and so it reflects badly on the individuals coordinating with these agencies and the company itself. It also becomes difficult to cultivate long-term rapports and future work opportunities with these agencies."

Work is very fast paced and there is a lot of stuff happening every day","Processes are very poor and the excuse is always that we are a start-up
Despite being a small and agile company, there is a lot of politics embedded especially in the leadership side
Don't expect any benefits or any time for personal stuff as all are expected to be working 24/7, and if you decide to take a day off, expect to cancel and adust because they are a start-up
Most positive reviews are pushed to give the looks of a happy place
Any talks on change or new ideas are seen as pointing mistakes of manager and this taken personally, especially from HR
New ideas should only come from well-connected team members or managers

- The managers are always pushing you beyond your limits to drive results through exploration, innovation, efficient execution.
- Growth curve is really good if one can drive results consistently.
- One is given various opportunities in short span of time if you perform, like to lead a team, growth of position, bonuses etc.
- One will need to put in a lot of efforts and long hours to get results, but you will be amazed by the results of those efforts and your ability to pull such great things off on your own in such short span of time.","- Poor work life balance (it’s a startup, what do you expect)

1086,Unacademy,Absurd management,2018-10-17,1.0,Intern,Location is good and flexibility is an option.,"The company does not focus on its employees.
The company is terrible at management.  They seem to be newbies given a brand new platform to handle. Plenty of rookie mistakes.
The company CANNOT handle its clients. They filter out useful material at times without giving it a second thought.
There is no such thing as constructive criticism. No mentorship of any kind. 
Superiors are incredibly rude."
1087,Unacademy,Thread wisely!,2018-09-22,3.0,,"- Great place to work in case you are keen on learning what goes into building a hyper-growth PaaS startup. 
- Would highly recommend working at Unacademy, to anyone who is at the start of their career. The opportunities for learning are immense.
- There is scope for working in different teams, as long as you are comfortable asking for it or saying yes when asked.
- The management is trying hard to create a name for itself as an exciting place to work, which translates to impromptu parties, anniversary celebrations every 6 to 12 months, off sites for the ""core"" team, hackathon's with expensive prices read iPhone X's, PS 4's, Apple Earpod's (in case you are in the product team) and cash prizes (if you are in the business teams).
- Can be a great place to work depending on two things, 1. which aspect of the organization you work in i.e product, business or admin & 2. which of the co-founders leads your vertical. 
- Given its brand name and persona in the Indian tech community, you will have the chance to work with more A-team players than B & C.
- If you are good, drive results and are aggressive about it compensation in the form of salary + stock ops are great. Again knowing your value and communicating it is the key.","- There is a culture of gossip all around the company, which while it is natural for humans to gossip has negative effects on the culture & work environment. This seems to be perpetuated & most often used as a tool by the management team.
- Divide and rule is a tactic used all the time, which translates to certain team-members being left out of events, celebrations and sometimes even meeting that the rest of their team takes part in.
-  If you are recognized as someone that is good at what they do (depending of course on who leads your vertical), two things will happen;
1.  You will almost have your life sucked out of you with regular requests to work beyond office hours, calls & emails at odd hours, requests to come in during the weekend.
2. Leaving the company can become a serious nightmare, I mean SERIOUS. 
- Policies can change faster than lunar cycles, sometimes you work on weekends, sometimes you don't.  You get Sunday's off, for the most part of it.
- There is a high employee churn at the company, if I were to take a guess I would say the average tenure for middle management is generally 1.2-2 years and lesser for lower levels.
- If you are a non-native Hindi speaker would highly recommend you brush up on your skills before joining. Given that over 80% of the company is from the northern part of the country, Hindi is the common language of communication during team meetings, events etc. Also, a majority of the userbase and the educator base are also native Hindi speakers, so it definitely helps if you can speak the language."
