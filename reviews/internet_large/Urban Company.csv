3. No cab system.
4. In business operation team, if you are having official leave then also they will force you to work and say according to business requirement you have to work.
5. No matter how you work, if upper management decided to do cost cutting they will torture you even if you are giving your 100%, they will harass you till the time you have to put the resignation. 
Ex : Hiring an employee they have to pay the CTC but after a year or two if they replace that employee with 3-5 intern with 8k stipends then company obviously have more number of resources with less budget."

When i joined this company they said it's a 10 hours shift and 5 days working in a week and then after few months it became 13-14hours shift and that too 6 days working and the targets are unachievable... No matter how hard you'll work you won't be promoted or appreciated."

*If you land up in lead role, you can take full responsibility for the product but actual developers will suffer if you get an inexperienced lead (which are most of them)","I am still in depression after leaving this company. I worked as a developer and work hours are too damn high. The best part is that they say weekends are off but you have to work on the weekends as well (from home). How can they expect developers to work that much without even getting rest, it drops productivity. The reasoning behind everything is that this is a startup.
Anyways, even if you commit yourself and work very hard to meet their expectations, then also they won't be happy.
The work you are doing is decided by others (multiple bosses) and they usually don't have clue about technologies (timelines, difficulty to implement, resources available). They just want things done only to change it later after a week acting on their own whims and so-called ""data-analysis"" by product managers (as they don't really have that big customer base and people really struggle to even get on the platform).
The model of their business is very complex (which is not required) and they even keep on even changing it say in a month or so. This certainly impacts the work of developers. In simple words, they are not sure what is to be made and would curse the developer that he didn't think it through before developing it and would curse even more if you go back to discuss it. Everybody just plays blame game and no one would take responsibility. Appraisals are purely based on fawning.
Most of the reviews (on services they provide as well as job reviews on glassdoor) are FAKE! As they would politely ask you to review them good when you join them  (even the interns). Most people would do it as they are yet to go permanent.
Also, they take the utmost pride in these fake reviews and ads that they make and trick themselves to think that the company is flourishing."

There are a couple of jobs which I considered were dream jobs for me but only 2-3 months after joining this place I realized that I cannot work anywhere else now. Reasons: 1) Ownership  and freedom to execute things: The only thing people do not like at UC is if people ideate a lot and do not go ahead and experiment. 2) The position of the company: This is probably the only company in India right now what is small/start-up like and still well poised to do very well in future, hence stability as well as all along with pros of a start-up. 3) Family like culture and very very young people here so the place is always filled with energy; 4) Focus on fundamentals and faith in the leadership. I have seen and heard from a lot of friends in other startups that their founders at such stage have started taking customer or partner experiences and loyalty very lightly or have become too disconnected and indifferent about the fundamentals of a business. But this company is lucky to have the 3 founders that we have.","Not a place for free-riders or fence sitters. Very high energy and very fast pace of execution.

1.Learning Curve- This is the best bit. I've been here for almost 2 years now and the evolution of myself has been crazy.Not only me but people around have noticed and appreciated how quickly I've got to pick up so many skills and know so much.
2.Disruptive - We are trying to build a solid product for a very tricky space. Tricky in terms of  the un-organised nature of the services industry and the fact that globally no-one has been able to solve this problem well.While that seems like a huge challenge at first it also becomes your strength as it is extremely exciting to build something which will be an absolute game changer.A legacy.
3.People- I've met and worked with some of the most smartest people here and have imbibed a lot.Since the comapny is at a very initial stage I have been able to form some great bonds here which I know I will cherish for life.",Work-Life balance could take a hit if you're not smart with time management. I am a football freak so I know I have to take time to watch and play football on the weekends so i work more efficiently.There are people that are able to find a way out and deliver in short working hours as well but some people are unable to cope with it.I believe that is the same at every place
616,Urban Company,Most exciting place you would ever work :),2016-10-31,5.0,,It's been 18months here but honestly journey is always been great here.  If you have positive approach and have an intent to hustle then you will enjoy every bit of being here and working day in day out. :),I have not found one yet. So it is not applicable.
617,Urban Company,"Work, Culture And Growth",2016-10-31,5.0,Engineering Manager,"I would like to mention share my view
1)  The working environment is very appreciating, you can get complete ownership of work you are doing from detailing to shipment.
2) The people here are very helpful and all are full of enthusiasm. 
3) The best part here people are not the believer of the typical hierarchy structure. You can reach out anyone for your ideas and for dc.
4) Maybe some issue could be about work-life balance here but I think if you can work smartly and with complete ownership, you will not feel here.","If anyone wants to work like a typical MNC it's not a good choice for you, Everyone is working here with so much energy in himself."

620,Urban Company,Worst company with unprofessional behaviour,2016-10-18,1.0,Software Engineer,No such pros found as it does not even deliver learning opportunity being a start up company.,"1. Expectations are very high with zero planning and unprofessional behaviour of co founders and management(with hardly having any manager hierarchy in the company)you will be fired if you ever dare to speak anything against them.
2.Immature behaviour of the co-founders due to lack of experience. Employees are highly paid and are expected to stay mute as they own an employee.
3. Employees are highly paid to work with mute mouth as company has bought them with money and Co-founders will give that impression always.
4.Co-founders will shout when and whereever they want and nobody will push them back as employee is being overpaid not for their skills and adding value to the company but just to go with the flow keeping there mouth shut.
5.Unprofessional behaviour of the co-founders with easily lashing out on people in front of everyone.
6.Zero learning and will ruin your existing skills if you are an experienced and skilled person.
7.Not at all employee friendly behaviour as you are expected to work for 55 hours with no such implemented work planning in a week as already said you are not being over paid for your skills but to stay mute.
8.Very bad attitude of the owners towards making company successful and well established in the market.
9.Communication from HR is non existent as they are the week team with no such professionalism.
10.No employee friendly policy.
11.Join at your own risk which may end regretfull exit."

- Fun if you're a techie at heart: they have hackathons, tech talks, weekly demos and encourage work on proof of concepts.
- You feel like you're actually making a difference, Raghav (, the CTO) is super approachable and values your opinion. They had dedicated hours twice a week for team members to give feedback and suggest changes in their product. 
- Free lunch, yayie.","- Generic cons of working in a startup - hours can be hectic, they are still figuring out what works for them and what doesn't and sometimes end up reverting everything. Unavoidable and understandable, yes. Still breaks your heart to see your work being sent to the trash.

Many people want to feel like their work is contributing to the greater good of the world. so for me urban clap is the place to be. They are solving one of the biggest problem in Indian metros. Ensuring discovery and ""quality"" of services. Making service profession accountable to what they deliver. 

Kind of work: Too Cool !! There is so much work to be done. A technology team of 25-30 is dealing with  challenging and exciting problems every day. Its fun to brainstorm them and try out different solutions. Its like I am totally free to pick a problem I like and experiment with it. Ofcourse there is regular work to be done too, but I always know why I am doing it and there is no one fixed way to do it, so its never boring.

Sky rocketing learning: 2 month seem like a year already ! . Complete ownership.

Culture: Work hard , party hard. Flexible. No hierarchies, minimal reporting system. Completely ownership and result driven. Co-founders work with you on day to day basis. Lots of acknowledgement for good work. Regular employee feedbacks. One on One with HR once a month to ensure you are happy. Jam sessions for people with guitars. Chill Friday evenings. team trips. mixers with other teams. launch parties and many other things to make life fun. 

Peers: Every one is hand picked and smart. Young , productive and people you can learn from. All discussion are very constructive and helpful.","Long working hours: Though I enjoy it because the work is fun and there is so much ownership. But 10-12 hours minimum are needed.
