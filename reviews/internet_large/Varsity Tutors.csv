I hesitate to take a lot of these jobs - b/c the planning and preparation would not be worth it...I am currently teaching Spanish to a middle aged man - He is at the intermediate level - For every 60 min class - I spend25 to 35 min. planning and i am not paid for this planning time. Most jobs require you to buy special books and/or download a curriculum and plan accordingly. The students that I have encountered are indifferent to achievement and are only on the platform b/c of a parent or parents. They are listless and sometimes don't even respond to you.

This is the job for you! I assume all the positive reviews are from people who have guzzled the kool-aid, from what I see in chats it seems like that's pretty common. 

It's a very creepy high-energy sales environment where everyone is happy!! all the time!!!! let's spam gifs and emojis!!! I had to mute the team chats because jfc.

There are some legally questionable things in terms of not taking people off the call list when they ask to. I've seen notes where a lead will decline but people will schedule follow-up calls and keep calling them relentlessly. They're just asking for a lawsuit since that's considered harassment. I hope someone sues them, I just don't want to be caught in the crosshairs."

A MacBook Air was also a nice perk.","What they tell you when you're hired is that you will spend the entire day on the phones talking to warm leads. What they tell you when you're in training is how to have consultative conversations with those warm leads so that they will ultimately buy from you. What they failed to mention was that most of what you do at first is call leads for the 5th, 6th, 7th day in a row and that by then, most people are annoyed with you.

They also pay well.,They are all about pushing tons of information on you very quickly. Then expect immediate results and compare your numbers and stats with everyone which for me did the opposite of motivating me. I did do better than most at the top was praised for it at the same time was warned almost daily how its not good enough and how I would basically lose my job even though I was in the top. The stress of doing your job correct and well and still being threatened to lose your job constantly is just not my style. I do not feel it's healthy mentally for workers.

Everyone with VT is nice and friendly.","Pay could be a little better considering prep time. Could be a bit more structured and specific when it comes to student cancellations/no shows, it’s left up to tutor digression which can be tricky to navigate sometimes. Also, if a student plans to be with you for a specific amount of time they can add additional hours on and not tell the tutor in advance which is kind of annoying as far as planning goes. Can only invoice for 1+ hour sessions, so if you have a young student wanting 30 min sessions you have to invoice every other week which is frustrating."

My work with Varsity Tutors as a Client Experience Department Manager welcomes me to continue this passion, as I help people from all walks of life, with the sole focus on supporting any kind of Learner from any walk of life or background, to achieve their personal goals no matter how big or small. This is RICH work because of the professional love I weave into business efficiency and problem resolution. My experience and professionalism is valued, and my contributions are constantly recognized and appreciated. 
Varsity Tutors has the most excellent and caring training and upper Administration: whether it be in the Customer Service, Special Learning Needs, Tutor Placement, School at Home, Billing or Client Experience Department. If I have left any department out, I de facto include them all! Absolutely every single manager/administrator I have ever worked with is present, knowledgeable, genuinely caring of other employees and all clients, and willing to help no matter what. The same is true for my own particular team in the Client Experience Department. For a nearly 100% remote corporation, growing exponentially as Varsity Tutors is... to be as cooperative, organized, and supportive as it is....is very unusual in this day and age. It is a blessing to work for a company that has its origins in my own hometown of St. Louis, as well. All in All, I am so grateful to work with and for such an amazing company!","I'm not a big fan of quota requirements for sales, which is why I'm happy to have moved on to a different department from the one I started in."

For a job that is completely on-line, I know an amazing number of my colleagues, have the occasional coffee break, involve myself in groups that we form to focus on our interests. I also love the focus of the company on volunteerism and giving back. The paid volunteer time off allows me to work in my own community more than my schedule would often permit.","The pace varies widely from season to season, so we are always shifting priorities. You get used it after awhile, but at first, Wednesdays seemed to be the day everything updated and changed. Now, I just take it in stride.

95,Varsity Tutors,Nice people but ridiculous expectations,2021-11-15,2.0,Certified Nursing Assistant CNA,"The management was great and although the work was virtual, everyone made an effort to lift spirits and promote a team environment. There are some fun perks as well. The company just became publicly traded, so it is exciting to be a part of their growth right now. There are multiple opportunities for growth and promotion at the company as they get bigger and bigger.","The workload was ridiculous. You are expected to meet your quota every month and in order to meet that quota, that involves dialing out multiple calls a day to sell tutoring services. The services themselves are very expensive and that aspect made it difficult to sell to consumers. The goal for us as consultants was to find the need of the consumer and to promote and sell the services that works best for their needs. It sounds great, but in reality, it felt like waving services that many consumers need for a multitude of reasons in their face. The other aspect that is hard to swallow is just how difficult it is to keep up with their standards. You have to spend a solid 8 hours making calls the entire time. You will be talking to people most of the day. It is the type of job that some can handle, but if you can't handle being at a computer for 8 hours at a time with very little break opportunities, you may want to look elsewhere."

The company has a very positive attitude towards their product and the products seem to work effectively so it is nice to sell something genuinely helpful to people.,They hire a lot of people during peak season and keep very few.

Taking advantage of people with education backgrounds by stressing the idea that we are helping people. In reality, we are guilt tripping parents and students into purchasing more expensive packages. We were trained to sell 1:1 tutoring over small classes since it was more expensive. However, not all students benefit from this expensive 1:1 tutoring. Silly coming from a company that stresses individual learning needs, to not care about the learning needs of students when focusing on higher sale value.

We were told our mission was to help people learn and provide individual learning support, while recommending products we know is not the most beneficial for that person.

People in my cohort were fired without warning for not meeting quota when we just started and were told we didn't have a quota. Confusing.

Trainers were disingenuous. But who can blame them, the company hires multiple cohorts a month with 20+ people each. Honestly, who can care about new hires when so many are constantly hired and fired like clockwork.

For your mental and physical health, run the other way. Especially to those who love teaching and helping students. This is not for you. It is a facade. Making people believe that we are working for the good of the student and learning. If you have a conscience, simply don't.

One aspect that I really really did not enjoy was the ""metrics"". I had someone direct message me about my activity being low when I never had low metrics. However, I was in training all day which explained that. I was basically told that I had to meet a mark by the end of the day or else. This sends the message that one slip up and you're out. That stress that someone is always watching and you can't fall under a certain number is bad for mental health and induces stress. There is a feature called ""idle time"" where if you are not moving your keyboard and mouse the time adds up. I constantly was checking my metrics and time so that I wouldn't get that dreaded message. All sales companies care about metrics to a certain extent but this is not the way. As long as monthly quotas are met, people should not be held on such a short leash. We are people not robots. Being treated as such is not conducive for workplace success and employee moral.

After quitting, I re-read all the reviews and they all resonated with me and were true. I thought that these bad reviews came from people who were incompetent and lazy. I am a hard working and very passionate about everything I do. In no means, am I incompetent or lack the ability to exceed in my work performance. However, I was wrong and foolish thinking that the reviews about this company were from misinformed individuals. They are all true and accurate to what this company is."

They are generally given to the first person who expresses interest.","Definitely the pay. As others have said, clients pay a lot of money (I don't know how much) and most clients do not bring material for you to cover with their child, which means you have to use your own faculties to come up with material for each session, and parents generally want homework, quizzes, etc. as well. I always spend too much time on unpaid planning initially. However, one perk is that if you teach classes and generally stick with similar classes, you can re-use or modify the material you have already created, which saves time.

The parents think I will hand write and correct HW assignments, grade essays read entire books the students are working on, design a curriculum from scratch etc because they pay so so so much. I expect that for $15 for SKILLED WORK, I will spend at most 15 minutes preparing for a session. If I spend 15 minutes, I make an abysmal $12 for my work time.

Not only do you get PTO but they are flexible with swapping days/hours if needed which is really nice. I enjoy the culture, we work hard and have a lot of fun.","Can sometimes be a bit stressful. Especially balancing phone calls, inbound texts and placement work all at once. The management does a really good job trying to accommodate for this the best they can by giving us time off calls to focus on work. At times, though it can still get a bit overwhelming. For the most part one of the lower-stress jobs I've worked, just be ready to work hard."

247,Varsity Tutors,No room for growth for POC,2021-02-16,2.0,Customer Care,"Prior to Covid, the office space was definitely a pro: they kept us well fed and entertained, a typical start up environment. Pretty flexible company, managers don’t really breathe down your back.","There's no room for POC, Black people especially, to progress within the company. We’re constantly overlooked and passed over for promotions that we're beyond qualified for, which are usually given to managers’ “friends”. If you take a look at the website, you'll mostly see white male faces in higher up positions, and that is a very indicative of the type of environment: white male dominance. 

Pay is ridiculously low and often times you're working on multiple teams due to low staffing from Covid layoffs, but not compensated for that additional work. They will squeeze you dry if you let them. 

They are also not transparent: When I was first hired, it wasn't until I went in for training that I was told that I had to work weekends, and strange hours at that.  I was also under the impression that I was interviewing for one role but it truly ended up being a completely different job description and too late for me to turn back to my old job so I was pretty much ""forced"" to stay. We all know job hunting is not easy."

Also, the company provides very little of any type of materials to help with tutoring -- no curriculum, practice tests, etc. For the cut that they take, I think they should make it a bit easier for tutors so there's less unpaid ""prep"" time on our end. Also, it can be tough to get students. You might have a few come your way but it's common they are assigned to other students.

297,Varsity Tutors,Great place to work if you're comfortable with ambiguity and change,2020-12-18,4.0,Account Manager,"I have worked for this company for almost two years. Management does a very good job making each employee feel heard and takes their time to show appreciation. Whether you're love language is words of affirmation, quality time or gifts, management does a great job making you feel valued. This keeps me here. Additionally, I love being a part of that is in it's beginning stages. I love the company culture of being adaptive to our progressive world and the employees that take the time to adjust with company changes. The start of world certainly has it's challenges but I love that the company will work with you, if there is something that you don't understand.","If you are not comfortable with change and ambiguity, this place is not the place for you. This company does move extremely fast, so i'll admit, sometimes it is very overwhelming. However, if you push yourself and remain a sponge, management is there to teach."

You get to work from home and they provide all the tools and training to be successful. They listen to their employees to improve every aspect of the company.,Must be ready to work hard! Every employee gives 200% effort. This job can be stressful like any other sales jobs that has metrics and goals that need to be met each month. They give you all of the training and tools to be successful along with a good amount of time to figure out the job. If you cant keep up they will part ways with you.

We were instructed to sell things we could not guarantee (an in-person MCAT tutor in Lawton, Oklahoma). Run away. It is all a sham. I did not last even a full year. Turn over is about one year. Everyone from my training class was gone by the 8th month. I could write a novel."

308,Varsity Tutors,"Flexible hours, pay sucks",2020-12-04,3.0,Tutor,"- You choose your own hours, students, and subjects to tutor in
- The company shoulders the burden of finding students, managing payment, and sometimes acting in other capacities as a middleman","The pay is $15/hr for most tutors, far below market price for freelancers; the reasons they get away with this is are listed in the pros section above."
309,Varsity Tutors,Don’t let these crooks fool you!,2020-12-03,1.0,LSAT Tutor,It’s remote. Pick your schedule. Clients appreciate the hard work.,"Literally everything about this company. If you can see past the smoke and mirrors, it should take all of 30 seconds to realize that you have fallen victim to a very clever marketing strategy. 

Do you feel proud of making it through the interview process? Do you feel respected as an educator and have you received recognition for your intelligence during each step of the interview process? Almost feel like a vip after acing a new subject assessment test and hopeful about expanding the range of students you have proven worth of teaching? Enthusiastic and motivated by their claims for limitless potential and flexible schedules!?  Of course you do, so does everyone else working for this company. 

So why is it that we all earn less than a pizza delivery driver?  This is a classic “be your own boss” “no limit to how much you can grow” “all depends on how much effort you are willing to put in”.  For anyone that has ever worked for a “legal” pyramid scheme, this company gave you the same uncomfortable feeling it gave me. They put you through a lengthy interview process with multi factor testing, ask questions that require actual self-reflection, make it seem as if they only want the best while subliminally smothering you with 5 star accounts of delighted tutors. 

Sorry to burst your bubble but what’s happening is that all the bells and whistles are extremely successful distractions from the fact that you make about 20% of what the client pays. Remember, the students are “YOUR” clients and success is determined through “YOUR” effort and talent as a tutor.   They just forgot to mention that it is all “THEIR” money.  Let that sink in for a second since you are all unique and bright young educators — a tutoring company too cheap for an actual hiring department, too burdened to provide any sense of legitimacy with a personal call/Skype/email/etc. is now taking 80% of the earnings each time you tutor a client. Of course they will inform you that private lessons taught outside of the site will result in immediate termination. Of course you won’t receive the disappointing news of minimum wage income until after you have committed hours building your brand.  Of course they display zero respect or appreciation for their tutors because their platform is so effective, 5 new tutors will have registered by the time you come to your senses and leave. 

Through successfully motivating you, the enthusiastic (usually new) tutor, this clever marketing platform allows the folks at the top to sit back and make TONS OF MONEY without doing literally anything.  Depending on how you look at it, Varsity Tutors is not doing anything unethical, illegal, or necessarily wrong... they offer jobs, motivate individuals to sign up, and provide a platform for people to work as tutors.  I wish I came up with the idea before they did. Unfortunately, you will never be compensated fairly and will ultimately leave after the disappointment and frustration becomes too much. The only question is how long you are willing to suffer before that time comes."
310,Varsity Tutors,Pretty good,2020-11-29,4.0,Tutor,you can choose your own schedule,can be difficult to get students
311,Varsity Tutors,Why I love Varsity Tutors,2020-11-24,5.0,Client Service Representative,"Varsity tutors promotes a family environment that make coming to work enjoyable.
Every department allows for creative thinking and it is actually is encouraged because things can never stop improving.
We don't have a cookie cutter environment that is mind numbing and boring.
The constant change is exciting because you get to learn new ways to do your job that may make your work life more efficient all from the comfort of your own home.",Your shift has to include a Saturday or Sunday.
312,Varsity Tutors,Working at Varsity Tutors,2020-11-24,5.0,International Client Director,"Working here is great! Even before COVID, the company offered Remote work. This was to help with a temporary situation or more long term. The company prioritizes its employees and their families first. Varsity Tutors believes in family first and will provide every resource and support possible. Outside of this, if you are competitive, this company rewards its employees for their work. Varsity also believes in developing their own in house talent for leadership. Great Pay and Benefits! The culture here is fun and relaxed. You are here to work but it's also fun. The CEO and Senior Leadership are involved with everything in the company and you will frequently meet them and have conversations with them. If you are currently in the Military Reserves or Guard, the company will work around this with you and constantly help you balance that part of your life and working here.","Honestly, I have been here for a pretty long time and I have no real cons to share."
313,Varsity Tutors,Flexible Remote Job with Impact!,2020-11-23,5.0,Client Sales Representative,"Once through training, choose your schedule. Remote, good pay, full benefits, 401k match. Changing people's lives by helping them find the expert they need? Priceless.","MUST be self-motivated. If you cannot work from home and stay on task, this is not the job for you, since we have metrics to meet for the company."
314,Varsity Tutors,"Massively underpays, but the platform is good.",2020-11-23,2.0,Math Tutor,They send several tutoring opportunities for all levels of subjects. Easy to have a flexible schedule. The online platform is solid and easy to use so both parties can be interactive.,"The pay is TERRIBLE. They overcharge clients (~$60-$100 an hour depending on how much they buy at once) but the tutor only receives a tiny fraction of that ($15-$20 an hour). So some clients come in with high expectations after paying top dollar, but you aren't even getting half that money. Obviously Varsity Tutors deserves a cut to compensate for the platform, advertising, etc, but taking minimum of 2/3 of the gross pay, when all they do is provide clients and a platform? A private tutor that's freelance or through some programs often make $30-50 an hour depending on subject, prep involved, etc. There's no reason for them not to be paying the backbone of their workforce twice as much and still be making a profit.

I have also had minimal interaction with anyone at Varsity Tutors, 99% of the time is just in the app and done automatically or by me or the client."
315,Varsity Tutors,Flexible job with poor pay,2020-11-20,3.0,Private Tutor,You can choose your students based on subject material or scheduling preferences. You control your whole schedule.,"It looks like students pay about $50 an hour, but you only make $15. Raises are few and far between and only for specific students."
316,Varsity Tutors,Working at Varsity Tutors is Amazing,2020-11-18,5.0,Training Lead,"I love working at Varsity Tutors for many reasons! Their mission is truly to help everyone learn and they believe that education is valuable and can change lives. At Varsity, I get to help people accomplish their goals and dreams and there is no better feeling. Varsity Tutors also really cares about their employees. They really do invest in each person's growth and want everyone to succeed. The job is also very flexible because you are able to work from home!",There are really few cons and nothing worth noting.
317,Varsity Tutors,"Flexible timing, low pay",2020-11-17,4.0,Academic Tutor,Flexible timing. Good opportunity to learn and keep updated,No pay for preparation. Not much preparation materials.
318,Varsity Tutors,"Good for extra income, not great pay rate",2020-11-12,3.0,Tutor,"Being able to choose which tutoring opportunities interest you, lots of tutoring available currently, setting your own schedule (mostly)","The pay rate is $15/hr for online, never any raises, and considering what they charge the students (~$50/hr), it's not great. Sometimes the descriptions for the potential students do not include important info and/or have the incorrect preferred hours for scheduling. They require 24 hr notice for you to cancel a lesson; if you don't, you must give the student 1 hour of free tutoring to make up for it. (It goes both ways, though; if a student cancels less than 24 hrs before lesson, they have to pay for an hour of it). Company pressures parents to request 2 hr minimum lesson lengths and is very sales-oriented, rather than student-centric."

-if a student is nice and their parents are considerate AND they happen to live near your home base or other clients, it can be fun/not too frustrating","-Hourly is quite low and not particularly negotiable
-You have to drive to get to all the tutoring sessions (this might be different now due to COVID but this was the case when I worked there) making you responsible for gas and mileage on your car

I've worked in professional sales for over 20 years, and Varsity is far and away the best job I've ever had.","We are constantly evolving, so you have to be comfortable with frequent change.

Perks like free tutoring hours for you or your family, flexible schedules, and continuing education.

Lots of room for growth.","Sales culture, which is not for everyone, but great if you enjoy a challenge or are competitive. There are other departments and opportunities as well that are not sales focused. 
Overall tutor experience needs more attention from the company in general, but they are working on it.

As a start-up, the company is able to adapt to new challenges and adjust to meet changing needs of their customers and employees - the best example of this is their response to COVID. Employee safety was prioritized and new solutions were created for learners of all ages. Varsity Tutors has a high upside and will be around for a long time to come.","There are growing pains with all start-ups where products need to be launched quickly, do not work as expected or needs change.

I have always been treated well, benefits are good, and I feel like my concerns are not only listened to, but responded to and resolved realistically. It is a fast paced environment and often you have to be comfortable doing things that are new, but when you are working on something new that is taken into account. I guess what I am trying to say is that the expectations are not unrealistic.","The only con I have is more of a personal one. I understand that VT is a corporation, and not that there are no philanthropic efforts, but I would like to see more. Also, the pay is not bad, but could be better.

Varsity does a good job helping you keep your schedule straight","Varsity is very hands-off; everything is between you and the student (some people may not like this)

- pay
- bonuses
- great job to ride out for the ""training period"" and make nice bank (after that the bonuses are less and not worth the stress or feeling like ick everyday after interacting with your ""team"")
- Offer bribe to people exiting to not say anything negative about the company (which is why you'll see very few if any negative reviews)","- one of the most unethical companies I have ever worked for in my life
- lots of fake reviews written by current staff on Glassdoor and other sites to encourage people to apply
- This is a job mill with them constantly hiring and firing people without even giving them a real chance and lots of moving people around. 
- Little to no stability in your role.
- They expect you to work even outside of your work hours...for free. One of the reasons people (who weren't me) do so:
- If you set up a sale and someone else only takes the payment information while you are away, THEY get credit for the sale, not you
- Sales employees do and are encouraged to outright lie to clients to convince them to get the services
- cursing and other bad, obnoxious behavior during meetings sanctioned by supervisor
- employees and supervisors work as a group to construct lies to tell clients during ""team"" meetings & laugh at all of the people who fell for the lies
- Company changes rules and requirements from one day to the next with little to no warning
- Claims clients can choose in-person or virtual services when in reality they will then (after payment) try to force the client who signed up for in-person services to do virtual services (because virtual tutors get paid less). They do this mainly by saying that: Sorry, we can't match up the good in person tutors with your schedule, however, we do show that ""Jane"" can match your schedule and is highly rated. Unfortunately, Jane can only do online. If they resist online, they will badger them. If this doesn't work, only THEN will they actually try to find them an in-person tutor....at the lowest rate possible (for Varsity Tutors), regardless of reviews.
- Will hire many tutors (even knowing they don't have work loads for them) just to keep them from working for competitors (via the contract)
- Will use lower paid, unqualified tutors (even those with many complaints) over higher paid, excellent tutors. I even looked into a tutor's file and saw a note not to give her work (though she was excellent) because of her pay rate. Yes, it literally said it was because of her pay rate!

We are not compensated for the time spent preparing lessons, and I know that we are paid about 1/4 of what the families pay Varsity Tutors.

Varsity tutors is great for someone who is just looking to make some extra cash. The position pays $15 for online, $18 in person per hour. Not bad compared to minimum wage but most people know tutors generally charge $40-50 per hour. Working for variety means that you take a pay cut for the convenience that varsity supplies you with students. Otherwise, this is great for a part-time gig becasue it is so flexible. (Impossible to get full time in my opinion). Management is very friendly and tries to work with you as much as possible. They are always nice and try to be as quick as possible. The online platform is probably one of the best I have seen. All in all I've had a pleasant experience","Not a full-time position

They have one of the best employee-support teams that I have ever come across; they are always eager to resolve any issues that may arise within a tutoring session as well as answer any questions along the way. The pay is solid, and, as a tutor, I have complete control of if and when I tutor. For online tutoring, I have the opportunity to discuss with clients about what their expectations are as we continue our sessions and I can easily schedule clients and make adjustments to the schedule if I need to. When working with a student online, we have access to a highly sophisticated interactive board to guide students through each lesson.","The biggest downfall, in my opinion, is the process Varsity Tutors takes to remove a client from your list of students when they do not have enough credits for tutoring sessions. It would be easier on tutors if we received notification that a client were dropped because of financial reasons, as opposed to receiving the same notification we do when clients' goals are met or they are reassigned. Knowing that a student is temporarily out of credits and can be reassigned to you would be more beneficial than it seeming like we will not have that student again."

-  In years past, this was a pretty easy place for someone to get a job. The recruiting department does very little and so even those who are not qualified can get a good 35K/year job with benefits. A good place to gain some experience. 
- Although for the most part it's an unprofessional atmosphere, there are some smart people at VT that were fun to work with.","- Most of the chaos at VT stems from a massive disconnect between how the C suite thinks the company is operated and how it's really operated.  It's a shame because this lack of awareness enables a lot of the behavior I witnessed among managers and directors/upper managers.  
- In addition to promoting an unprofessional environment, a lot of the upper managers/directors seem to be in way over there head. Unfortunately, these individuals influence a lot of decisions within the organization. As a result, a lot of decisions that impact the day to day operation are made by individuals who lack competence and would almost never be considered for a middle/upper management role at another organization. 
- The lack of professionalism,  immaturity/lack of experience & unstable environment associated with a startup, make this a very difficult place that I wouldn't recommend if you have  other options available to you."

The company and its employees genuinely care about client and tutor satisfaction as well. They survey everyone frequently, and implement suggestions, always striving to make the company, product, and experience better. Employees are eligible for a raise every year.","I make $18/hr, which is not stellar.

I worked at VT for nearly 2 years, and yes it was a grind, but it was worth it. Not only did I make good money. I was fortunate enough to be surrounded by good people on a daily basis. The Tempe office is sweet! 

One thing that I encourage which many don't take full advantage of is the 50 free hours of tutoring you get each year! Chances are as an Individual you want to learn something/better yourself outside of work. Well, guess what? You can do that for FREE.","This is a startup company, meaning they do have growing pains. You may not always get the answer you are looking for. Remember the company comes first, and realistically you are only a piece in the bigger puzzle. 

Growth opportunities aren't that sexy. Only inside sales opportunities, the next step up from ED is  Manager. After that, you are competing for one of the few director positions if there is one available.

The bonus structure was not set in stone when I left. They did have a metric grid, which is a way to multiply your payout. If you are in it to make money, know that you will be consistently dialing upwards of 120 calls per day."

They do not adjust pay based on travel distance/time. It's also kinda weird that your client is expecting ~$60/hr tutor performance even though you're only getting paid a third of that. It's an uncomfortable expectation if you're just starting out, as I was.

For my first lesson, they paid me $15/hr for in-person tutoring instead of the standard $23.50. It was a ""mistake"" on their end and they sent me a new contract to sign with the correct rates. 

They let me go without any notice as of January 1st (no e-mail, nothing). I even had some lessons planned for my students for the next semester. There's a December review here that mentions they're letting a lot of their California tutors go without telling them - I guess I was a part of the tutors cut. 

It's possible they cut all of the in-person tutors due to the class action lawsuit filed against them and/or Assembly Bill 5 passing recently in CA (effective as of January 1st, 2020). If they only cut some of the CA tutors, I think their criteria for figuring out who to let go was based on ability to extract revenue from clients. I wasn't very forceful with my clients in getting them to meet up frequently if they didn't want to - thus I extracted less revenue from them. I did have good ratings and relationships with my students, so that's the only factor I can think of. 

All in all, you can do better than to work for this company. Far better. I'm not gonna name any competitors, but I'm telling you that better options exist. Go look for them."

452,Varsity Tutors,Get Paid For Hard Work!,2020-01-04,4.0,Sales Representative,"At this job not only are you on an hourly type pay, but they give incentives for overtime when needed and the bonus structure is awesome as well! If you are good at what you do you have the ability to make good money every single month.","Since the company is open 7 days a week the schedule isn't a regular 8-5 job, but if you do have to take a half day to see a doctor you do have the ability to make it up on your time off!"
453,Varsity Tutors,Great job for a flexible work schedule,2020-01-03,5.0,Tutor,This job is very amenable to a work schedule that can be tailored to your availability.  I enjoy interacting with the students and the tutoring experiences have been positive. I think their policies are reasonable and provide a benefit to both the students and tutors.  Compensation occurs quickly.,The internet connections have to be strong.  Students should be encouraged to buy writing pads for better interactions during the sessions.  The compensation should correlate better with the tutors ratings and experience.

455,Varsity Tutors,Do not work here,2019-12-23,1.0,Tutor,Quick pay twice a week.,This company is SHADY.

456,Varsity Tutors,Best PartTime/FullTime job online,2019-12-19,5.0,Computer Science/Math Tutor,"So the job is an independent contractor position. You can apply with at least an Associates Degree.
The Payrate is mostly $15 an hour but increases up to $37 for instant sessions now and then
It's very fulfilling and a very flexible career. If you have an associates degree, then this might be the job for you. I was able to pay off two entire semesters by doing this in what ever gap I have in my day. 
You can earn up to $1000 dollars a week, it takes all day, but you can set up gaps in between so its not too bad (it works very well as a full time job).
If you need to cancel a day because you are sick, are burn out, etc, you can.
There are A LOT of computer science opportunities. I guess maybe other topics are not very common, but I know definitely Computer Science and Math is on the top of the list.
You get to help students around the world!","The site has glitches, sometimes connections are bad,  and their older interface in my opinion was better. 

The business gets slow over the summer and winter breaks. However, it really is not that bad if you think about it, it brings a lot more free time.
 
It is an independent contractor position so you have to put money out to the side to pay off taxes yourself manually when Tax Day comes. While a traditional job, the employer will take out funds as needed from ones paycheck."

480,Varsity Tutors,Inside Sales Rep.,2019-10-09,5.0,Inside Sales Representative,"Varsity Tutors is a great company.  I started with VT because I wanted experience working for a start up and I was not disappointed.  I have had a great experience at VT.  I have been challenged, I have grown, and I have made a lot of good relationships and I made good money.  And I think Chuck, the CEO, is doing a great job.  But Selling leads that come from SEM/SEO is not easy....it is a grind.  And this isn't a 40 hour per week job.  But VT will fully support you and teach you how to sell and if you are willing to put in the hard work you will be successful within a few months.","1. This is no longer a 100+k/year opportunity, instead 60-70k should be your expectation.
2.  Benefits are not that good.  Again, I went to VT for the experience and I am glad I did.  
3.  This job has been made into a 2 year role.  At 2 year your skills and pay have peaked.  And they are constantly letting people go and hiring at the same time.  And unless you live in Tempe, AZ you likely are not going to get promoted."

484,Varsity Tutors,No shortage of students!,2019-09-23,4.0,Tutor,Working for Varsity has been great! There is no shortage of students. You can work as much or as little as you want. The management is generally understanding and easy to work with. Tech support is responsive and helpful.,"You can't set your own rate and have to wait 6 months before requesting a raise. The rate is a little low for what you could make as a tutor on your own, but you make up for it somewhat in sheer volume of students."
485,Varsity Tutors,Would recommend to anyone looking for part-time work!,2019-09-20,5.0,Tutor,"I thoroughly loved my time with Varsity Tutors as an Independent Contractor. I loved the parents I got to work with and the students were just as awesome. You truly feel as though you are making a difference in people's lives and you grow to look forward to your scheduled sessions.

You get to choose which age group you want to tutor as well (K-12 up to adult learners).

You do get to set your own schedule (nights only, days only, weekends, whenever you want to work) and you get to tutor virtually or in-person in your area, so the work/life balance is entirely up to you as there is no minimum amount of clients you must have.

Being paid twice in a seven-day week also helps when trying to make ends meet. The more subjects you can tutor, the more opportunities you have to make money.  I raked in about $1,400 in a month in a large metropolitan area tutoring evenings and weekends with just one or two daytime clients and had more tutoring opportunities available to me than I could take on!","You are not paid for prep time and you must pay for outside materials, but more often than not, parents are willing to reimburse you for the material.  Unless you are commuting a large distance, travel is not compensated. I believe the hourly pay is enough to make up for that.

As this is an independent contractor role, if you believe you will owe a certain amount in taxes, you must pay quarterly taxes to the IRS instead of the usual lump sum in April. As an independent contractor, Varsity Tutors does not withhold taxes from your checks (social security, medicare/medicaid) so you must send in those payments manually to the IRS."
486,Varsity Tutors,Nice part-time job with average pay but a great teaching experience!,2019-09-18,4.0,Academic Tutor,"You initially start interacting with students through instant opportunities, somewhat like an Uber/Lyft for tutoring help :P 

Over time, you get to interact with students regularly. If you so desire, you can even work with them in person.

Since I love teaching, I have enjoyed interacting with students across the USA and Canada. The teaching app interface is top-notch; the online teaching platform is cutting-edge.

Direct payments are made twice a week, Tuesday and Friday.","Sometimes, there are not that many opportunities; other times, there are way too many. That is the nature of this position.

The pay is far less than what Varsity charges each client. I guess this is because they take care of scheduling, payments, and other logistics, so we can focus on teaching students."

Most opportunities fill up very quickly, often times without having time to respond (both instant and posted). Also, sometimes one is matched up with a client and then can never get in touch with the client even after reaching out to Varsity Tutors for assistance. Also, tutor pay should be adjusted for instructional planning time, particularly if client does not have materials. Finally, some tutor incentives based on rating would be a great idea!"

They use a particular sales technique which they want each of their employees to use. Early on, they try to support you as much as possible by meeting with you to check in on your performance and give you bits of advice. 
They'll try to work with your schedule a little bit if you have things outside of work you need to care for by maybe having you work more on one day and less on another to accommodate for it.

-They have frequent large group meetings to keep everyone somewhat connected and aware of what is generally going on.

- The offices are very nice looking and the desks are pretty comfortable too.","Extremely misleading with any off time (They literally have a calendar on log in which states all of the company holidays.  Don't get excited thinking they will be closed and you will have time off. 
You'll be expected to work and will get paid time and a half but you'll be calling people on the holidays and trying to get them to buy packages. 

-They offer a ""volunteer day."" Don't try to use during the second half of any month. 
-They frown upon time off requests during the push to hit sales quota.

-If you do not meet the unrealistic sales quota you will be fired. This is a bit of ""luck of the draw."" since you are almost completely cold calling every lead.

You will be calling hundreds of people all day long repeating a similar script for eternity until your soul dissolves into the computer screen. 170 or so calls a day."

This creates a huge gap between what clients(and their parents) expect and what tutors are incentivized to put into each lesson.  When you take lesson prep time into account you make sub-minimum wage.    On top  of all that, despite the massive overhead charges, it takes forever to hear back when I try to contact them for help with legitimate issues, yet I regularly get emails about nonsense like writing Glassdoor reviews for them."

This includes sick time and vacation time. It will go up by 1 day if you manage to stay there for 2 years. The seating arrangement consists of long tables, like family style dining. There are a few offices, but they are occupied by the executives. Non-executive employees have to use a parking garage that is not attached to the building. It's a long cold walk when the weather is bad. The company is big on 360 reviews, but never allow employees to review their managers or executives. It is just assumed that they are competent. Some are and some aren't. Questionable ethics across the board, including the way that they handle customers and former employees."

Everything is measured and then analyzed.  It’s too much metics. You can’t twist someone hand to make them want tutoring by guilt trip or making the customer feel bad spending $55 a hour on a tutor. It’s a hard sell and I can say that because I’ve sold for the last 20 years.    It’s a boiler room and hardcore sales that makes it look like a great place to work.  The rah rah attitude isn’t for everyone and works on younger crowds like new grads that never held a real job.  I get it. It’s not for everyone looking at a computer screen for 10 hours a day.  The ping pong table and free food is great way to show you care however it’s just a way from employees burning out.  You need to give more work life balance or you’ll find more people will just get up and leave once something better comes along."

The office manager works very hard to ensure you're comfortable and well-fed. Snacks and drinks are stocked at all times, and you're guaranteed to have at least one catered meal a week.

- Positive attitudes from management. Most mid to upper level managers are very positive and supportive. 

- You are doing business in the educational sector. It's an honorable thing to be helping students of all ages learn and be successful as possible.","- Extremely competitive work environment. Depending on the team you're on, your fellow co-workers can be extremely competitive. Screams, high-fives, and generally obnoxious behavior can be very exhausting if you don't share a similar attitude towards sales.

- High pressure sales quotas. It's easy to become discouraged. 

- High tutor-to-client turnover rate. You will be dealing with many clients who go through 2-3 tutors and want refunds due to poor experiences. Much of your time on the phone every day is spent deflecting refunds."

I work with another online tutoring company in which I make $4 more an hour for less work overall (no communication with parents outside of tutoring, much less preparation time spent, no invoicing - the company handles all of that themselves and I am paid on time each time). With VT, I feel like more of a classroom teacher than a tutor at times because the parents expect the tutor to create lessons and work outside of our paid time. I really don't like that when I am only paid for tutoring itself. Lastly, VT never picks up the phone when I call in, and voicemails I leave are rarely returned. I usually have to call in at least three times before I actually get to speak to someone for help."

In addition, the opportunities they will send you are often over an hour away no matter what distance you set. With travel factored in you can end up making about $10 an hour for your time. I have reached out multiple times over the past few years about the lack of opportunities in my area and pay rate. I'm yet to hear back from anyone about increasing my rate, and the advice I was given to receive more opportunities is to increase the distance I'm willing to travel (which as I described doesn't help when you're travelling for 2.5 hours for a 1.5 hour session) and to respond to (non-existent) opportunities ""more rapidly""."

It is OK that video quality is low and not the company's fault when audio quality is poor, but sometimes you write an equation on the whiteboard and the student does not see what you wrote.

613,Varsity Tutors,Awful.,2018-09-16,1.0,High School Science Teacher,Students were motivated.  Good job with dealing with he different time zones for online tutoring setups once you were assigned a student.,"90% of the possible jobs I expressed interest in went to some other tutors.
I pointed this out to Varsity management along with my description of the very clunky-working writing program they provide for tutor sessions, along with the point that the students shortened the agreed upon time of the session and I’d get shortchanged.  Regardless of stellar reviews of my work by he students I helped, the company blackballed me, took away my students, and claimed that it was their clients that had cancelled future sessions.
The pay is poor as well.  I’m sure Varsity get more than 2/3 of what the student pays for this service.  
Definitely not worth the trouble if you are a professional teacher.  
Shame on this company!"

They also pay premium rates for special situations: learning disabilities, advanced students, etc.  Also tutors have a lot a freedom to choose learning methods appropriate to each student, unlike some of the other branded tutoring agencies that have ""their own method"" of teaching certain subjects. One size does NOT fit all and kudos to Varsity Tutors for recognizing it.  Also all tutors are qualified in the subjects they tutor by passing a subject assessment.","I wish their portal was a little more robust. Sometimes i'd like to send and EXCEL spreadsheet or WORD attachment to a student via their messaging; but currently does not appear to accommodate  Easy work around of course if just regular e-mail but I've found it an advantage to try to keep all the info in one place.  Sometimes we will finish a session before the 1.5 hour minimum invoice time has elapsed.  I'd like them to implement the option to charge any amount of time up to the time allotted for the session.

651,Varsity Tutors,Repeatedly messed up Payments,2018-04-20,2.0,Tutor,I like the flexibility and working with my students.,"They are awful with payment. I've worked with them a year or so now. And had no issues. Recently, they sent all my checks to the wrong address. Then told me its because of my IPS account address and it was my fault. #1. It took several phone calls for someone to even tell me that there was a separate login for payroll THAN the current login I already had to a different site. #2. Paychecks prior to had always come to my correct address. And so I don't know how the sudden ""switch"" happened because I didn't adjust anything. Then I was informed that they couldnt reissue checks for two weeks FROM the payment date and that they couldn't stop payments. I explained that it was clear that the checks were sent to the wrong address. So please reissue checks. I was refused. Of course, since then I opted into direct deposit. I was told that it was active. But somehow they still managed to mail the previous check to the wrong address AGAIN. Mind you I am about 4 checks due at this point. I was told I would be paid direct deposit the following Tuesday. Was NOT paid. I was finally paid on Friday through direct deposit for ONLY ONE CHECK. I was then told me for some reason they could not pay me all my past due money owed for the past 3 weeks at once. I had to wait every week for the next check's payment. So now I am working on 4-6 weeks of late payments. My bills are late and late charges are being charged because I was depending on Varsity Tutors to honor and respect their tutors. My bad. 

Additionally, I was told there was NO DIRECT number to payroll, and that it was just her I could talk to. When I asked to speak to a supervisor who could issue all my payments at once since they were already weeks late, she said there was no one I could talk to her but her. 

So I just received another direct deposit that is shorted from the weeks prior to and I am almost positive I will not get a solution to this problem. 

I had a good run with Varsity and almost quit tutoring in the middle of a session with clients over this. I only continued as a commitment to my clients. Once that was complete, I have not taken anyone new this has been such an awful experience. I have no idea if they are strapped for cash or taking the money where they are supposed to pay tutors and redirecting it somewhere else. This is one of the worst payment experiences I have had with a company. It's too bad because before all this I was pleased.  I even reached out to them on Twitter and no response."
652,Varsity Tutors,"GRE, SAT, and High School Subjects Tutor",2018-03-30,4.0,Tutor,"Varsity truly seems to be one of the best companies out there to work for as an online tutor.  It's great that tutors have full control over which opportunities they accept and how they schedule their sessions with students. The Varsity reps are consistently helpful and will pair students with a different tutor if the fit isn't great. You receive no training, and the pay isn't comparable to what you can make as an independent tutor (see cons below), but it's a good place to gain experience.","The main downside is pay.  GRE tutors are paid $33 per hour.  The students are paying anywhere from $50-$90 per hour.  So Varsity pockets anywhere from 33-63% of the income.  It can be even worse for high school subjects, for which tutors only earn $15 per hour. It makes sense that Varsity needs to make some income to run their business, but taking this much as profit is exploitative to the tutors.  Oh, and if you call and ask if there's any possibility of higher pay, they hang up on you."

Varsity tutors has been a very good opportunity to work as a professional in a professional setting.  You also have great latitude to be successful and teach in a way that optimizes your talents and abilities.","Tutoring jobs are most typically given / claimed on a first come first serve basis, which is often almost instantaneous for online jobs.  Sometimes this can be frustrating and perhaps not the best way to pair tutors with prospective clients who may have commonalities that would make for an ideal fit.

You get to choose what you tutor (as long as you are qualified to tutor it), your hours, and your distance limit. Most of the students I tutored were very cooperative and willing to learn. I met some pretty great kids through this job. The pay is pretty decent. You could make a lot more as an independent tutor, but that is the price of Varsity Tutors providing all the students for you.",There were definitely times when Varsity Tutors did not give me many tutoring opportunities. I was lucky enough that I was not dependent on this job to pay the rent. This job really does not guarantee a stable amount of money each month. It can also be very difficult to find another job after this one because you do not really have a direct supervisor here who can write you a recommendation. There is no number to put on future job applications.

First, as far as getting students to tutor, the company sends opportunities your way for you to accept if you can or to decline. It's great because you don't have to go searching for students on your own. Second, whenever I had a question, I didn't hesitate to call or email. Whenever I called, the Tutor Engagement Specialists on the other end were extremely helpful and kind. They listened to me and helped answer any questions I had.  Third, the App was extremely easy to use when it came to messaging students/families, scheduling tutoring sessions, and invoicing sessions. There were several other apps that I used while tutoring, as well, with tons of resources that the students had access to as well.  I loved working as tutor for Varsity Tutors! I would highly recommend working for this company!","Honestly, the only con is that sometimes you are sent opportunities that are either out of your range or not a subject you can tutor, but all you have to do is respond no and the opportunity is gone."

682,Varsity Tutors,Great... if you are out of options.,2018-02-14,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Easy, quick interview, with a huge variety of subjects.
-Flexible schedule! You can work as much as you'd like if there is enough demand. 
-Some really sweet kids can come through, if you are lucky. 
-$10 bonus after completing your third session with a client.","-Pay is abysmal. Varsity Tutors takes about three-quarters of the rate the clients pay, despite having very little/nothing to do with the quality of tutoring the client receives. You receive a measly $3 extra if you meet with the clients in person, and you may have to if you are teaching a less in-demand subject. For reference, I drive an hour an a half once a week for a one-hour tutoring session, and I earn $18 total for my time. 
-Again, you are not being paid for any of the extra legwork you do, which has included (in my experience): editing multiple drafts of essays in preparation for a tutoring session, reading their college-level assignments daily along with them, creating games, quizzes, and lesson plans, and the list goes on. 
-VT is not on your side. If you need help with a troublesome client, they will simply not respond to your emails or phone calls. One day, you will get a blithe email to the effect of ""the client wanted to go in a different direction,"" which was really super helpful after trying to make it work with the client. 
- In the same vein, VT is horrible with communication. You can call them about a client, and if they answer, it's impossible to hear over the giggling. On multiple occasions, I thought I might be on a conference call in the lunch lounge. I insist on email contact only from them, because I cannot understand them and they have sassed me for having scheduling conflicts.
-VT, regardless of the number of times you have called or email them without response, may send you an email scolding you for your inactivity 
-Opportunities are hit-and-miss. Most of the opportunities come in around 3AM, or at 9:30PM on Christmas Eve (don't ask me why). 
-Clients find the platform confusing, the prices high, and often demand very specific criteria for their students. Many will ask for tutors who have graduate degrees, which is fine, but you won't find a Masters or PhD graduate who is okay with making $18 at most. 
-Your life-- your commitments, goals, schoolwork-- do not matter to VT. Their clients don't  either.  All of that hums gently below the ruckus of all that sweet, sweet cash flow they get from their tutors."

685,Varsity Tutors,Lovely company,2018-02-13,4.0,Tutor,Really easy to make your schedule. I get a good amount of opportunities to allow me to make money and find new students without being overbearing. The platform for online tutoring is pretty nice and works the majority of the time. The kids I've tutored are great and its really fun to help them learn what their teachers should have taught them! There's nothing better than seeing the sparkle in a kids eye when they get the concept that they'd been struggling with.,"The online platform does have some kinks. It will OCCASIONALLY not work. There's a feature where you can see the students curser (so you can see what they are pointing at) but you can't write properly when this is on. It also requires a strong wifi connection, but this does make sense since it is a live feed. It is also a bit annoying how long it takes to get some opportunities. My brother works for the company now but he only gets an actual online opportunity every week or so, so it's hard for newcomers to build up their repertoire of students."

I now have a clear understanding as to why it took such hard work at each step, to finally earn the title of a prestigious Varsity Tutor. The way with which VT takes their time to ensure that tutors and students are matched perfectly, is a process that I never knew a tutoring company would take the time to perform. I don't just have a slew of opportunities showing up in my inbox; I have opportunities that are precisely based on my areas of expertise, and, the client team takes their time to review everything before making the perfect match. I have developed relationships with the families of my students, as well as the students I work with of all ages. So much so, that often the students I work with for a single assignment/need ask to have me as a full time tutor. It feels amazing knowing that my purpose and passion for teaching are appreciated by the actual Varsity Tutors team, as well as my students. The support system that is in place for both the clients and the tutors is outstanding, the platforms - online or in-person, are so safe and secure that I realize the reason that Varsity Tutors is regarded as one of, if not, the, top tutoring company in the entire DMV area.","At first I felt overwhelmed getting to know the way the tutoring works; however, every step of the way, the team has helped and supported me. I've talked to the team so many  times, and they are so supportive and helpful - and we are on an almost family like level. As I've transitioned and become more familiar with the 'way things work' I no longer feel like I'm alone if I have a question about what is best for my clients, and myself. Although that seems like a 'con' - it really isn't; in fact, it's what makes the company even better. I'm never alone, the clients are never alone, and everyone is so well supported."
688,Varsity Tutors,Wonderful Company,2018-02-12,5.0,Academic Tutor,Varsity has done such a fantastic job of matching me with students I can help.,Sometimes the messages part of their website glitches but I typically send text messages as well.

The medium through which you communicate with students online is easy to navigate, and the tools are fairly straightforward to use. Varsity does a great job of taking care of the minor details so all I have to worry about is logging on and helping my students. Additionally, the tech support team is phenomenal-any time we run into an issue during an online session we always get help within 1-2 minutes. The scheduling is flexible, so you can work as little or as much as you want to. This has been the perfect job for me during my gap year between college and medical school.","Sometimes the volume of students can get pretty low, so I don't think it'd be possible to work full time."
690,Varsity Tutors,Great company,2018-02-09,5.0,Tutor,The company gives plenty of different tutoring opportunities. You also get to work with tutees of a variety of ages and backgrounds.

They also save a lot of time in searching for students, a student is simply assigned to you and you can accept or decline a student on your own terms.","The only downside is not related to the job itself but simply that there isn't a lot of demand. Depending on location, it can be rather difficult at times to get new students, the demand doesn't seem high enough if I wanted to go full time."

I was a private tutor before I was a full time employee here, and working here has given me a chance to share and spread the best of my talents. In working here, I've really pushed myself to become a stronger communicator and become faster at multitasking. This isn't a place where you'll get micromanaged -- management lets you have room to be creative within your process, but provides feedback and structure when needed. VT also takes the time to make sure that employees have fun at work. The St. Louis office has standing desks, ping pong, and there's lots of food and drinks. There's also opportunities to work overtime. Metrics are shared regularly so you can track your progress.",Sometimes overtime can be a bit taxing!

They have a great culture and always have a fully-stocked fridge and kitchen with free snacks and soda! There is definitely opportunity for growth within the company. They do a great job of providing feedback and coaching each individual on a weekly basis. Bonus structure is pretty solid.,"You do have to at least work one weekend day per week. You also have to work one ""late"" night per week, which usually consists of working from 12:00-8:00. During the first few weeks on the job, you truly have to grind it out.  As a sales rep, it can become discouraging when you do not make a sale for a few weeks."

701,Varsity Tutors,Management is oblivious,2018-01-30,2.0,Sales Associate,Some get to work at home. Lots of bonuses and gifts for doing well. Good benefits.,Management doesn't tell you what you should expect moving forward in training levels that you go through. I had a sale 10-11 days in a row in 3rd phase and second highest to highest every day in dials. Even jumped on the company in my days off to check in with prospective clients. But even though I was doing what I was supposed to do in 2rd training phase I was let go due to taking too long in 2nd phase. Which mind you since I didn't take any days off I used them at Christmas time because I have my son for all of Christmas break and they faulted me and counted my vacation time against me. People in my same time didn't have a sale every day like I did (I figured I made the company between 10-12K in that time). I hardly got any help from my manager. I ended up calling other workers to get advice because I wasn't getting it from my manager. So don't take time off to be with your family because they will sing you for it.  People on my team kept telling me how awesome I was doing. But obviously I was let go before I was doing too well to get rid of me. Which I already was. Other people on my own team had taken the same amount of time and they didn't lose their jobs. Also some people got special treatment in which they got to call more newer leads than others even though they didn't hit their numbers yet to be allowed to do that. Losing my job was a complete shock.

My first year at the company I made a little over 100k...it can be done if you are willing to put in the work.,"Varsity Tutors is a start up and because of that we are growing fast and there are lots opportunities but the benefits are lacking.  I am single and because of that it doesn't bother me but it would be an issue if I had a family.   My next point is not so much a con, but more of ""it is what it is.""  If you want to be successful at this company you are going to have to work and work hard.  People complain about the hours, but honestly, compared to most sales jobs, it is on par.

Not much more to say other than that. IT'S SO FAKE it's quite absurd. Jump at me at the elevator at the end of the month? YAHHH I'm soooo pumped to make you money. Donuts and coffee? LOL

I don't think these people understand that what employees want is a meaningful career and not ""sugarpuffs"" cereal."
730,Varsity Tutors,Sales Director,2017-12-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"You get to work from home and they provide you with all of the equipment you need. Also, they have a really good benefits package.","Plenty. First, they change their expectations every week. Quotas and weekly goals will randomly change on you so be ready for that. Also, EVERY manager is different and that’s in a bad way. I had two different managers while I was at VT because they were “moving things around”. Apparently there are some employees who have had 4 different managers just because they move the teams around so often. Also, you’re not going to make bonus without hitting overtime. The people who are at the top of the sales rankings work 6 days a week and 60+ hours. A manager even told me that those people hit those numbers because they work OT. They don’t have a system in place for their employees to make the bonuses that they were promised within a 40 hour work week. AND THE MANAGEMENT WILL TELL YOU THIS. Also, the lead flow is trash. If the system is working that day, you might only have to call people who have already been called 5x before. If the system isn’t working...good luck."
731,Varsity Tutors,Smoke and Mirrors - don’t waste your time,2017-11-30,1.0,Sales Representative,They give you a lot of food and most co-workers are nice.  The operations manager and trainers are very nice and helpful.,"There are so many! To start, management is awful. If you’re doing well, they love you, but when you’re not, they’re not very nice. They play a huge amount of favoritism and you’re screwed if you’re not a favorite. The leads are awful, and it’s an overly glorified call center. You will rarely make the money they brag about and the information the recruiters and trainers give when you start, is nothing like the actual schedule and job. If you’re not working overtime, you’re not making money and management constantly changes their requirements and lead flow. 

When it comes down to it, management and corporate managers truly don’t care about the work/home-life balance for their employees. Their services are overly priced and they can’t keep quality tutors because they don’t pay well and there is a huge disconnect in the various departments, so the clients suffer and oftentimes don’t stay with the company. If the company doesn’t focus on the customers they have now, they are going to lose money and employees at a higher rate than they already are now. 

Management can blame the employees all they want, but they set up their employees horribly and then blame them when the company doesn’t perform, which has been consecutively dropping over the last few months. They like to say it’s because of quick growth, but really it’s because of a huge lack of organization from upper management all the way down to the lack of concern for the employees at the sales/client manager position. The sales/client managers are all different in their management style and it becomes confusing when the expectations constantly change."

They make our job easier so we can focus on making money. They are on the cutting edge of technology. If you have worked in Sales before, you will definitely appreciate it.  Your managers are always open to feedback and helping you improve and develop as a sales rep. I left Varsity tutors for another opportunity, but soon came back. It is like a family here at Varsity, and you have more control over your income. If you have a good work ethic, you will succeed . You get free tutoring hours for your family, PTO &  paid holidays. Varsity allows flexibility with you schedule, which is always great. Busy season will require some overtime, but you are paid well for it.  There are always fun contests and prizes being given away.

The culture of cooperation and supportiveness amongst team members has dramatically improved since I began with the company. And everyone seems invested in making sure that continues so that the client is served well.  I also enjoy being part of a company with a start-up mentality and track record - it provides lots of opportunities for development and growth if you are inclined to pursue that.  The company also provides lots of lunches and social events for staff to get to know each other.  And because it is still a small company, you have access to management and leadership to voice feedback and/or concerns.

741,Varsity Tutors,Sweat shop with phones,2017-11-16,1.0,Inside Sales Representative,"The office provides free snacks and drinks all day and occasionally had catered meals. The office is freezing cold, but admittedly a cool facility with several amenities. The pay is surprisingly good for how little skill it takes to do this job.","Don't let them fool you. Varsity Tutors hires in sales classes every two weeks because the turnover is ridiculously high, not because they're actually growing. Expect to work a minimum of 50 hours a week with little to no notice of when you'll have to work your overtime. In September we were told we can't use PTO because too many people had quit and they were understaffed. Management is unapproachable and rude. There is absolutely no work-life balance here. Hours are crazy and you're required to work weekends. They were not up-front with me about that in my interview process. 

For salary, you get a standard salary and monthly bonuses paid out on the second paycheck of the following month of completion. This would be  great, but very few reps hit bonus regularly. During the interview process, HR will make it sound like you get to build your clientele over time, but that is not for inside sales reps. Goals are ridiculously high and you'll have to work 60+ hours a week to bonus. 

If you decide to take a job here, make sure you negotiate the terms of when you can receive your bonuses. They'll make you wait up to a month and a half and won't award you your final bonus if you don't work there the date it is supposed to be paid out.  I suppose this is to save them money to make up for the high turnover. 

After I started working there, I was shocked the poor culture and work life wasn't reflected in Glassdoor reviews I read prior to starting. Turns out it's because after an employee leaves, Varsity Tutors offers them a lump sum of cash to never say anything bad about the company. What a joke.

Benefits are average and nothing special. Stock standard package.

Don't work here unless you're desperate for money or need something to hold you over until the next big thing. You'll always have at least one weekday off work which is great when you're interviewing for other jobs."

From the on boarding process to training to stepping foot on the sales floor, every person you'll encounter in genuine. And each individual cares for you and your success here at VT. And what can be better than changing the lives of the students you assist?

The company caters lunches quite frequently and there’s always a ton of energy and encouragement coming from every direction. The managers are very helpful when they have the time to be. You actually get well recognized for doing a great job, which isn’t something I can say for most companies out there. They constantly throw out incentives to boost energy and excitement with some friendly fun competition.","While the company does many great things and has a lot of potential, there are unfortunately too many cons to be rated higher than 3 stars. In order to succeed at VT the top sales reps basically make work their entire life. People work nearly every single day of the month for around 10-14 hours a day just to hit and/or exceed the ridiculously high quotas. The company doesn’t market well, so many of the leads are useless, and yet they wonder why lead flow is up but the actual sales aren’t. They also don’t recruit new employees very well. Add that all up and during the busy season while lead flow is high and there aren’t enough reps to cover it all, they require a mandatory 10 hours of overtime a week... As if we aren’t already all doing that just to keep our jobs. The quality of the tutors who get hired is steadily decreasing as well, which means that sales reps get dinged with refunds all month long. Just when you think you’re getting ahead, something that was completely out of your control comes in and knocks you back down. 
The healthcare they offer is way overpriced and you still pay a ridiculous amount out of pocket."

Varsity tutors is taking learning to the next level by bringing tutors to your home via electronics (phone, tablet, pc, or mac), or face to face. We are matching tutors and students up and making sure that client is learning and approving of the person who is tutoring them. 

Varsity Tutors is helping people learn but learn at their own pace and time. They take a customer reviews very seriously and always want to improve on the service that they are providing. 

Varsity Tutors makes learning and working for them fun. It's been a real long time; since I have been able to say I Love My Job and the people I work with make that easy to do.

763,Varsity Tutors,Inside Sales,2017-09-25,1.0,Inside Sales,The only pro is that they hire fun and hardworking people.,"Management is awful. If you are doing well and hit quota, they love you. If you have a slow month, they act like you are not there while avoiding eye contact and any conversation. This fluctuates month to month. They ask you to work overtime and disregard a work life balance. Most of the employee's have given into the idea that this is a great company because although they ask you to work a mandatory 10 hours of over time, they cater lunches, have a fully stocked break room, and play fun music. They DO NOT CARE for a work/life balance. It is impossible to be successful in this company unless you dedicate all of your free time to working overtime. They used to hire hard working people to work who were honest and worked as a team. Most recently they hire younger kids out of college who will work the extra hours without complaining as long as they are receiving endless amounts of bagels and red bulls. When it is time for management to 'clean house', they tell you one week you are doing well and are on track to hit quota, then the next week, you are on a probationary period to hit an unrealistic goal. If you are successful and get out off of probation, it doesn't matter because they still need to fire you. So they will lie to you and send you lies in email form and it will be nothing that you have talked about before. My advice is if you are interested in working there, don't have a family, work ethic, and kiss as much butt as often as you can and you will do just fine. This is why majority of the management staff doesn't know how to manage a team...they only got ahead by who's butt they kissed and not based on their skills."

The benefits are also great. We have a bonus holiday for our birthday that we can use any time of the year, and 52 free hours of tutoring a year to be used by yourself or your family!","Working from home, they don't pay for office equipment, like a desk. If you don't already have an office space, that is an added expense. It is a VERY fast pace environment.

Catered lunch if you like scraping the bottom of the barrel for curry soy and rice.  Training if you can learn at a New York minute pace.   Nice people if you are under 30.  That's it folks.,"They say they only hire the best of the best.  What do they consider the best when their classes every few weeks are filled with people with no experience and under the age of 25?  They say their picky.  What does that mean?  You only pick the best of the best of those dumb enough to apply in the first place?  For those of you experience, I""m talking to YOU!  You will not have leads in your name to work.  It's a rotating call system.  You will receive a lead that your very next door neighbor (sitting within arms length) called 1 hr and 3 minutes prior.  If you pitch a deal but don't get the payment, since you don't have a direct number or extension and aren't allowed to give out your direct email, if that customer calls back in to sign up, they will get whoever is next in line to take a call and BOOM, you're done.  They get the credit for the sale, not you.  You own nothing.  This is a great job for people with no experience and very young adults trying to gain some experience in sales, but aside from that, anyone else applying is either desperate or crazy.  Fyi, the benefits stink too.  Over $300 for a single PPO plan with a high deductible is just plain NUTS.  But that's what you get with a start up company, Yes, start up, they aren't running off their own money, it's all funded by Venture Capitalists firms.  Go figure."

I especially enjoy that I can either tutor in person or via the computer, which means I can tutor from 6-8 AM before work and make money while wearing pajama pants.","Varsity Tutors provides learning tools on the website, but they do not provide any training for tutors, which means you should feel really comfortable with the material before committing to a client. Some client's families are really involved and it can be hard to navigate those relationships and the expectations parents have for tutoring to be a magic bullet and solve all their child's problems at school.

I have worked for a lot of companies that I hated coming into work because of their structure, management, and team of employees. Where as Varsity Tutors, we are a family.

With a ""product"" like tutoring, selling it to clients is easy because you can actually stand by the tutoring and the good it does for people and their families. I actually left my last job because I didn't believe in the product enough, in good conscience, to sell it while keeping my integrity intact. Shianne [West Coast] is the fireball of inspiration when it comes to leadership and the office manager Sarah is absolutely fabulous at setting up things like Pretzel Day, potlucks, Donut Day and basically any other holiday her crazy imagination can come up with. Also, new office in Tempe come this September! So psyched for it!",Not any that I can spot at this moment.

Working remotely is great.","- No room for growth
- Many of the reviews you see here are solely because the company requires its contract tutors and FT employees to leave reviews
- They have got down the SEO method and incorporate misleading marketing to give the impression tutors in a specific location have the skills that clients need. If you dig a little deeper, you will know this is not the case. 
- The markup is insane. What the tutor is paid, what the client pays, are just fractions of the cost of service. VT takes a lot off the top. 
- The company is more concerned with scaling than it is with investing in its employees. Words of encouragement and positive attitudes are great, but they are not substitutes for employee salary. 
- Initially the company was concerned with finding perfect matches, and did so with moderate success. As they grew, it became a numbers game, and quality dropped significantly. Probably due to the fact that they relaxed the requirements when screening tutors for proficiency.

I didn't think my advertising skills were very good. I also didn't want to be doing secretarial work on top of tutoring. V.T. provided a solution for both these problems. I have had a very positive experience with the students V.T. has provided for me. The households I have visited have all been pleasant. I don't have to bill anyone. V.T. takes care of that and sends me frequent checks. So I am free to concentrate on my students.","Online tutoring only pays $15 an hour, a sum that is now being discussed as the new minimum wage for our society. I think a person educated enough to teach should get more than a minimum wage. I think the pay should start at $25 an hour.
It has been hard for me to get jobs close to home. My students all live fairly near each other. It is a half hour drive to get there. But since the tutoring is all after school, it takes me an hour and twenty minutes to get home in rush hour traffic. So far I have not managed to get 2 students on the same day.

The office is in a good location,  clean, bright and they offer a well stocked kitchen. Hourly pay is reasonable but appears in reporting few reps actually hit bonus numbers.","This is not a corporation. There are zero employee protections, no disciplinary policies and the turn over in Sales is ridiculously high. 5 people or so a month are fired with little coaching and zero progressive discipline. You notice that a 10 year company has less than 10ish% employee retention beyond 1 year?! If you have a good job,  I wouldn't risk it. Management speaks to doing good work,  tutoring changes lives, then enacts sales policies that are malicious towards customers, using ""pain"" to manipulate people to buy their services. No ""quality product sells itself with good service"" ideals here. Several new employees expressed the sales tactics asked of them made them uncomfortable because of dishonesty. Definitely high pressure, used car like sales. No security for employees and small opportunities for growth into management. Be prepared to see hardworking coworkers things surreptitiously swept into boxes by HR as a weekly occurrence. They also steeply underpay the tutors so they can provide kegs of beer and pizza to the office staff on a twice weekly basis. Managers are know for saying they'll take you out for drinks or food and expense it.  For a company not yet profitable, this is a scary practice that speaks to their culture. Do you spend money going out and treating your friends to drinks when your budget is still in the red? That's why the rutors are making only 15$ of that 65$ rate. And they're providing all the content and the actual service?  The culture here feels great until you realize that theres no equity among employees/contractors and the perks are at the customer and tutors expense."
838,Varsity Tutors,Company is a SHAM,2017-04-14,1.0,Tutor,There are no pros of this company. They try to reel you in with saying they have a ton of students for tutors to work with but have no work for you.,"There is no benefits or health insurance
There is no way to work your way up.
There is barely any work 
They can terminate your contract at a whim just because and without any clear guidelines as to why or how to improve yourself. They won't even offer you a call or let you know you are on probation. They will just send you an email saying you are terminated after barely giving you any work to begin with. This company does not follow through with any of the things they tell you. Read the fine print before signing up with this company. There are way better tutoring services that you can work with who actually treat employees right."

There is plenty of excellent material available onscreen that one can use while working with a student online.  These resources and infrastructure make it easier to have productive and helpful sessions.  The students are motivated and want to learn.  These are people who are trying to take the next step in life, and it is satisfying to help them improve and progress towards their goals.  This is good and beneficial work, and a lot of resources have been developed to make it easy to deliver an effective learning experience.

The students I have worked with have been fun and challenging - usually from very high achieving families who understand and STRESS the importance of Education to their kids.  As such I often find myself working with students who want to push a B+ to an A.  I do not do on-line tutoring, because I have found I connect much better one -on-one with the students (usually in a home setting).

I gave three stars for ""career opportunity"" only because this for me is an excellent way to build my independent education services business, but I don't consider it a ""career"" per se.","Really, haven't found any - the company has matched me with good clients and pay twice a week just as they promise."

Moreover, I have the pleasure to meet lots of interesting people along the way -- interesting students and families.","The onboarding process is rigorous, but that is understandable, they are trying to build a national reputation.

- There are always technical issues with online platform
- Pay is lower than what most independent tutors get paid 
- Pay is MUCH lower than what clients pay (like you get 40% of what clients pay) so they can expect more than you are able to provide given pay/schedule on tutor's side
- Very strict non-compete clause
- Taxes aren't taken out, so you have to deal with making that payment once the year is over

879,Varsity Tutors,Tutors Are Treated Well Here,2017-02-07,5.0,Tutor,"I've had an amazing time working for Varsity Tutors. Management is quick and efficient when it comes to solving problems -- be it client scheduling, web issues, or general conflicts -- the (personal) service they provide for their staff is unparalleled. I feel like they've always got my back. It also helps that tutoring opportunities come often, so there's rarely a drought if I'm looking for a new student. This is a great company to work for!","My main concerns are about potential client interaction -- sometimes VT can serve as a middleman for communication, when it would be easier to contact the client myself about availability, scheduling, etc."
880,Varsity Tutors,"Flexible, but low paying",2017-02-06,3.0,Tutor,"Varsity Tutors sends you potential clients on a regular basis, and you decide who you can handle w your schedule.  They answer questions quickly, whether by phone or email.  This means that the schedule is flexible.

881,Varsity Tutors,Enjoyable tutoring with excellent client support,2017-02-03,5.0,Tutor,Tech support and client support are excellent. Company supplies most of the materials needed to tutor. Students are hard-working.,Pay is on the low side. Parents can be intense.
882,Varsity Tutors,Varsity Tutors takes care of their people,2017-02-01,5.0,SAT/ACT Math Tutor,"Varsity Tutors is responsive to and respectful of their tutors.  They can tailor the number of students and amount of tutoring sessions to your needs and preferences.  They are attentive to feedback from their employees as well as their clients and this makes for a work experience that is pleasant and tutoring sessions that are increasingly productive as time goes on.  This is especially noteworthy to me because I can contrast my experiences working for Varsity Tutors, a company with over 10,000 employees where I have never met any of my directors of education or coworkers in person, to my experience working as a math and science teacher at a small high school with 200 students and around 25 employees, where suggestions and concerns raised by faculty and staff are routinely ignored or met with open hostility by the administration.  In closing, I will also say that not long after accruing about 25 tutoring students and a 50 hour work week with VT I suffered a major medical issue that required a 7 month hiatus from tutoring and the transfer of all my students to other tutors.  And despite the massive logistical issues that had to worked out and the loss of a lot of revenue for the company, everyone at Varsity Tutors was entirely supportive of me and patients as I recovered and could start working again.  I can't think of many employers that would in such a way so I can't  praise them enough for it,",I'm not sure if there is a system in place for pay raises based on customer satisfaction or length of time with the company but I think that there should be something like that for tutors who try to make a go of making tutoring a full-time job with Varsity Tutors.

I love how it is possible to create your own schedule so you can plan around any other activities that you participate in throughout the week. I also love the detailed write-up given for each possible client because it allows for easier decision making regarding if you can take on the client or not. Furthermore, this gives the opportunity to hit the ground running when starting with a student.","Some of the downsides for working with varsity tutors are that notifications of prospective clients, even if turned off in some cases, can present themselves often, and that I wasn't debriefed on some things about the process that many clients ask about (how much do sessions cost, why can't I do shorter sessions with certain clients, how many hours do clients have left)."

891,Varsity Tutors,There's both the good and the unfavorable,2017-01-19,3.0,Tutor,I've been working with them now for over half a year. Great thing about it is it gives you sort of an upper hand in building clientele as opportunities are sent to you and you don't have to even look for them.,"Aside from that good luck actually getting a client. When I first started out I was disappointed to find out that even though I was responding to opportunities within minutes of having been sent the opportunity it would turn out already having been taken. If I have the right understanding opportunities must be mass-emailed to all tutors who are considered qualified to tutor in that particular subject and it's like a game of slapjack to see who can slap their hand down first. If you're looking for a reliable career, don't bet your cards on this one, but if you would like some extra income and would like to enjoy tutoring here and there sparsely then I'd say go for it."

I can't think of any pro's to working with this company in particular.  I would recommend choosing another, if you are a tutor looking for employment.","I have worked through many tutoring companies and this one is by far the worst.  They do not seem to care about the well-being of the children that are tutored through their company and they certainly don't attend to the tutors.  They demand that tutors respond within 24 hours to communications but take weeks to respond to basic questions from tutors -- questions such as, why am I not being paid?  They prevent tutors from attending to the needs of the student through mismanagement and poor communication since they do not respond to questions which must be answered in order to meet with a student and provide good quality tutoring.  Many of the email addresses for management centers seem to be unattended -- no response.  I always had to try several area managers to ever reach anyone.  It's so unfortunate that a greedy company can interfere with the educational development of a child.  I really enjoyed working with the kids I tutored through Varsity, and loved to see them learn and grow."

Most of the students are great too, as most of them have made strong progress during our time together. The support staff is wonderful too; any concerns are answered almost immediately, and they are always available via telephone or email.","Unfortunately I do not receive enough student opportunities to consider VT a full-time job. Perhaps it is due to the fact that my tutoring subjects are not in high demand in my area, but I do not receive as many opportunities as I would like, and when I do, the process often takes a long time before I am officially assigned to a student. There have also been a number of situations where student assignment fell through due to miscommunication with parents or with their location.

There is a help desk person for any technical issues 24/7.,They pay you significantly less then what you can get not going through a middle man. They paid me $15 an hour and I can get $30-40 when I find my own clients. They charge the clients $50-100 an hour and pay their tutors a fraction of that. There was also a lot of technical issues. Half my sessions had some sort of issue where the screen would freeze or the connection would be lost and we would have to reset the connection.

Varsity charges $55-$85/hour for my services from what I can tell ( I've had to do detective work since they won't tell me), yet only pay me $15-20/hour. I'm highly qualified (master's degree, teaching license, years of experience, advanced training, etc.), which that have no qualms advertising, but they don't treat me that way. For an average hour lesson, I put in about 2-2.5 hours of work (I have to lesson plan, commute, teach, then log everything). Take my $20 hourly pay, divide that by the hours I actually work, and I'm barely making minimum wage for most lessons I teach. I was promised a raise at 6-months because of my experience--that was two months ago and I've yet to see it. When I try to contact someone, I'm sent to a generic voice mailbox (I don't even have a phone number for my direct supervisor). All the people on to of my that benefit from my hard work do nothing to help me--I never get my calls returned, when I have a request, it usually takes weeks to resolve, etc. Plus their contracts that they make to sign essentially make it where you can't use any of the connections you've made for two years (for instance, if a client of Varsity's likes me and recommends me to a friend, that friend HAS to hire me through Varsity).

970,Varsity Tutors,It's Okay,2016-03-02,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Managers are very friendly and coworkers are great!
-Work from home
-Hours are kinda flexible, but it does put a strain on co-workers sometimes
-Good entry level position if you want to get into HR/Recruitment long term
-Company issued Apple computer","-Pay is very low for the amount of work we do. When offered the salary, I wasn't too happy about it, but I figured I'd save money by not having to pay for transportation expenses. However, with the long days, weekends, etc., we really should make more money

-Working weekends. At first it was okay, just part of the job. But it got old fairly quickly. Especially since weekend days aren't half days or anything. It's a full nine hour day, both Saturday and Sunday.

-Nine hour days packed with work. Interviews are scheduled back-to-back for the entire day. There is almost no time to step away from the computer, unless you're able to end an interview early or have a no show. But when an interview ends or there's a no show, you're expected to do more work (notes, follow ups, helping co-workers with their calls, etc.) There's lots of pressure in that area. Honestly, I have to bend the rules to keep my sanity (more on this below)

-Biggest con: The work gets very monotonous if you go by the rules. The interviews are expected to go the same way each time in terms of questions, order of the questions, timing, etc. Veering away from the designated process, no matter how much more effective/engaging it is, can lead to a poor evaluation. 

Sometimes I feel like a robot. Sometimes I ask candidates the same question twice in one interview because my brain needs to be reprogrammed. There's no variety. My days look the same. It's predictable. I already know exactly what's going to happen on my shift three weeks from today.

I end up having to build in at least 10-15 minutes for myself after each block of interviews. Otherwise, the monotony really makes me feel icky. I'm bending a rule, but it's the only way I can effectively do my job and not take my frustration out on the next candidate. I need the time to step away, meditate, drink tea, whatever. Our schedules are packed with very monotonous work. Back to back hours of the same thing. Of course, lots of people can handle this type of thing. Overall, it's a matter of personality type and work preferences. I'm just not cut out for it. I would appreciate freedom more variety or more room in the schedule to step away and refresh since the work is so boring."

My biggest concern about working from home initially was that I would feel isolated, but quite the opposite, I've never been involved with such an encouraging and motivating team from all over the country and there is always someone there to help you if you do have questions.

They are very family oriented and flexible with appointments and any other family obligations you may have.","You work every other weekend but you get one day off each week no matter what, so one week you work 4 days and the next you work 6.

They regularly provide opportunities for me to connect with students, and I have taught several students through them. That includes one who is fairly long term. 

Their administrative support is helpful and reliable, and their payment system is also reliable. They provide an online tutoring platform which is easy to learn and allows you to teach students using text, pictures or practice problems. 

I will definitely continue working for Varsity Tutors as long as I am able to. I recommend them to anyone interested in part-time tutoring.","Compared to what you can make tutoring elsewhere, the pay isn't quite as good.

--> The Summit:    Every year the president, Chuck, coordinates our Annual Summit.  This year it was held at Disney World in Orlando.  Let me tell you, this guy spared NO expense.  From fantastic dinners, a beautiful hotel resort, going to Cirque de Soleil, and passes at Disney World, it was a phenomenal trip.   

-->  Camaraderie:   While working from home could be isolating, Varsity Tutors does a lot to make sure that we are still experiencing the same camaraderie and support that we'd get in a physical office.  Each team has a Skype chat that we can use for advice and questions and work-related issues, but we also are able to share funny stories and jokes.  

--> The President, Chuck Cohn:  Many of us have worked for - or had interactions with - company presidents who are arrogant, rude, and who look down on their staff.   This is couldn't be more opposite of how Chuck operates.  He is friendly, professional, and humble.  For example, while at the annual Summit trip we had a lovely dinner before the Cirque de Soleil show and then took a resort bus back to the hotel.   We were filing onto the bus to go back to the hotel, and Chuck did something that really stuck with me.  Instead of standing in the front of the bus or taking a seat right up front, he got on the bus and looked for the first empty seat just like the rest of us.  In fact, he found an empty seat about 2/3 of the way back on the bus.   He didn't expect special treatment of attention of any kind, even though he was paying for the trip.  

--> Feeling Valued:  VT does a lot to make sure that we feel valued.  On your birthday you receive a delicious Edible Arrangement, and on your 1 year anniversary you receive a gift as well.   About a month after getting married I was even sent a wedding gift!  Considering no one knew my husband's name, our wedding website, or registry sites, I was shocked that they even found our information.  I emailed Chuck to thank him for the gift, and his response? ""We are so excited for you! Congratulations!"".   It made me feel like a million bucks to know that he cared enough to send us a gift.  :)","The initial pay may seem too low, but not having to commute is a HUGE money saver.

- Upper management is young and smart, and could easily have a huge chip on their shoulders, but they don’t. They are down to earth and pleasant to work with.
- People work the hours they need to depending on what needs to get done at that time. However there aren't expectations that you will be working late hours or weekends. Any longer than average hours are typically due to a growing company that is consistently looking to fill new roles.
- Great work life balance. If I need to stay home with a child or take one of my children to a doctors's appointment, I can put my family first without feeling guilty.

The other people are always more than willing to assist in answering questions, there is a sense of community that pervades the entire structure from the front-line directors all the way to the president of the company.

I think what amazes me most, though, is how open all levels of the company are to both answering questions and receiving feedback.  Personal experience has made me hesitate to answer questions in past employment situations.  Here, however, I have never been (even accidentally) made to feel that I was somehow lessened by no understanding or knowing something.  Further, when I have brought ideas or suggestions for improvement, each one is evaluated and I am told whether it has been tried, is a good thought to look further into, or if it is not a direction the company wants to move.

Finally, the flexibility and willingness to work with the employees in scheduling (and when changes arise that are needed) truly makes Varsity one of the best places I can imagine ever working.  Not that being able to work from anywhere I have stable internet isn't inherently flexible, but when troubles arise, or I need to take additional time off, management is more than willing to flex the hours and allow for make-up time to be worked later.","A con that will occur with any tech-heavy workplace, there are occasional issues with the systems as they are rolled out to the employee level.

It is a joy to work with my colleagues, and I never feel like I am out of touch with anyone, even though we are spread out across the country.

However, as I have spent more time with the company, I have come to find some of its policies and some of the ways in which it operates as disagreeable. 

Overall, the opportunities offered by Varsity are ideal for someone who is looking for some part-time work and is interested in teaching or at least in putting their expertise and experience to work helping others. It also offers a flexible schedule; you often choose your own clients, and you can list and frequently update your own availability. The Varsity team was initially always there to help, whether it was with customer support, tech issues, or any other problems that may arise.  

The Varsity policies regarding cancelled or missed sessions does deserve some applause. They appreciate that tutors must take time from their day, and conform their schedules to these sessions, and thus should be compensated to some degree if a session is cancelled less than 24 hours before its start time or if a student fails to show.","Increasingly, I'm being asked to contact busy students to 'check-in', but in reality it seems the goal is to see about scheduling more sessions. I receive emails and phone calls constantly, asking me to check in with students more than once, with students who have already informed me that they will reach out to me to schedule our next session once their schedule permits. 

The pay is very low, especially in comparison to what independent tutors are making. As a starting wage, it is reasonable, but the amount of time (and effort) it takes to increase the rate by even one or two dollars is unreasonable. There does not seem to be a system in place for rewarding (and thus maintaining) well-reviewed and consistent tutors. The compensation is a factor that I think will push many of Varsity's better qualified and more successful tutors to stay only a short time with the company."

Some of the pros:
- Good salary
- Freedom to choose our own clients
- Flexibility with other schedules
- Meeting some very interesting people and networking with clients
- A helpful platform for online sessions with many tools to make the class more efficient
**  Most of all, problems (technical or other) are taken care of very quickly and VT makes sure to follow up with tutors more than once to ensure that things are working smoothly

I've worked for tutoring companies before and a large portion of were only concerned about their clients' satisfaction and making a profit while totally neglecting the employees' concerns.  So far, VT hasn't given me that impression.","-  The online platform and online scheduling is pretty glitchy at times
-  Recording sessions and payroll system should be better explained for those who are new and unfamiliar with the system."
1026,Varsity Tutors,Get Everything in Writing First,2015-09-21,1.0,Director of Tutoring,"Some of my co-workers were cool as were some of the tutors we worked with. That's about all I can think of, sadly.","Just ensure when you accept a position with them you have everything in writing in your contract beforehand.  I accepted the position thinking it was going to be a great job (and I came from an education and tutoring background) but it wasn't until AFTER my training they informed me I'd be working a minimum of 50 hours per week with only a 30 minute lunch each day and I was on-call every weekend I wasn't working. The bonuses and technology weren't all they were hyped up to be during the interview either and my manager, have to hand it to her, was single-handedly the greatest micro-manager ever to exist. I am not at all surprised at the rate of turnover that existed; at times it felt like slavery. The company was also unaware of the employment laws in my state, they forgot to send my W2 the year after I quit, and they asked me to sign a contract stating I would never speak ill of the company or disclose my salary without opening myself up to litigation. It appears some of their policies have changed and kudos to them for doing so but from my end, all I can say is that it was one of the worst companies I have worked for but if it's something you're interested in, just ensure you get your terms spelled out in detail and in writing beforehand."

1032,Varsity Tutors,Love Varsity Tutors,2015-08-24,5.0,HS English Teacher,It has been a pleasure to work as a tutor for Varsity Tutors for the past five months.  The staff is always professional and they work hard to find me new students within the driving radius that I agreed to.  Once a student has been assigned everything is laid out in a very helpful way so that the tutor gets all the pertinent information needed to establish a workable relationship with the student.  After you have started to work with new students the staff is always in communication with you to determine how they might be able to better assist you.  My students are wonderful to work with and the families have gone out of their way to make me feel comfortable.  I love the way the staff always sends an email at the end of each month to remind you to log hours and if you haven't logged for a particular student in more than a week they send you an email to make sure there are no problems.  I hope to work with Varsity Tutors for a long time.,I have no negatives about this company. They have stood up to their end of the deal and I will continue to try and live up to mine.
1033,Varsity Tutors,Director,2015-08-23,2.0,Sales Director,Working from home. Though I think the company's expectation of its employees working a minimum of 50 hours a week diminishes that perk.,$40k/yr to work the way company policy states is ridiculous! Upper  management needs to put their money where there mouth is and actually show that they value their employees. Turnaround is insane
1034,Varsity Tutors,Great Company!!,2015-08-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I absolutely love working for Varsity Tutors. The opportunities to meet and work with new families is so rewarding. I have met some of the most genuine, kind, loving, caring families while working with the company. Varsity does a great job at communicating with families and their tutors to ensure things are always running smoothly. I know that if I ever have an issue or question about anything, human resources or my city director is always just a phone call or email away.",I am very pleased with Varsity Tutors.
1035,Varsity Tutors,Review,2015-08-20,4.0,Tutor,"I have been a tutor working at Varsity Tutors for about 2 years. It been a pleasure to work with a supportive team and the tactics with pedagogy.

1036,Varsity Tutors,Great place to work as Tutor,2015-08-20,5.0,Varsity Tutor,There are plenty of things that I love about varsity but the one thing that is very important working as a tutor is communication. The staff at varsity tutors would let me know through phone or email if there is any problems with my student or any problems with scheduling. I always have an easy time communicating with them and they always find a solution to any problems that I had. They are very friendly and its a great environment to work. I also love their learning tools which I use regularly with my students and I believe they do an excellent job providing the resources the tutor and students need.,nothing that I notice so far
1037,Varsity Tutors,Good opportunity for extra money,2015-08-19,4.0,Academic Tutor,"They allow a very flexible schedule, and you only take on what you want. Good opportunity for people in school still.","There isn't really much mobility upwards just from being a tutor. You are not an actual employee, just a contractor. However, if this is a temporary thing, it's not a big deal. Also, it takes a while between interviews."
1038,Varsity Tutors,A Professional Group,2015-08-15,3.0,Math Tutor,"They keep abreast of all activity between student and tutor by having the tutor give a description of each session within 24 hours.  The concepts covered, how the student performed (pros and cons), what was done to re-mediate errors, any successes, and overall performance.","In 4 months only have had 5 clients.  The pay is sub par for the work and preparation involved.  No compensation for long trips of 25 miles or more.  You have to be quick on the trigger when a new client appears online.  Otherwise, someone else scoops them up."
1039,Varsity Tutors,Private Tutor,2015-08-14,5.0,Private Tutor,"I have been with Varsity Tutors since February as a private tutor. I love it here. They give tutors lots of flexibility with scheduling and allow the sessions to proceed how you seem fit. Logging in the sessions, receiving pay is very straightforward. I love that they are constantly in touch with you and provide you with many resources to ensure the most effective experience for tutors and clients.","They pay may be less than what most tutors would like however they do find the clients so it is straightforward. It may be frustrating to be rejected from clients from time to time but again, it is up to the client so not really the fault of VT. I feel that if you are starting out as a tutor and need help finding clients, VT is the right place for you."
1040,Varsity Tutors,Love working as a tutor for Varsity Tutors,2015-08-14,5.0,Private Tutor,"I have been tutoring through Varsity Tutors for the past year. As a tutor, I have found the organization to be very competent, easy to work with, flexible, and reliable. They make it possible for clients and tutors to find the best matches for each other. If, for some reason, a session shows that the match is not good, Varsity responds quickly to the client to provide someone else who may work out better.  I am looking forward to another year of doing what I love, working with students to reach their goals with the collaboration of Varsity Tutors.",Clients come and go as they need. Tutoring cannot always provide consistent hours because of this basic situation.

There are a lot of opportunities to work with students of all ages. I have worked with elementary school aged as well as at the college level. Varsity Tutors is great because they do not charge you for using their online tutor system, which has proven to be a great way to tutor. I have had the opportunity to tutor in person as well as online and really enjoy both.","At times it can be difficult to get assigned to a student, but once you do the opportunities keep coming."

I joined this fantastic team last year and have not looked back! I have been matched with appropriate students, received immediate assistance when needed and utilized their very user-friendly online format to the benefit of my students.Because the Varsity organization is so well run I can spend all my time building a productive relationship with my students online or in person. But, most importantly, I enjoy teaching again! I can see the improvement in my students and even better, they do, too!","None, I'm very happy working for this company."
1044,Varsity Tutors,Criticisms on Varsity tutors,2015-08-13,1.0,Tutor,"somewhat easy networking to find students.
online tool for video sessions
logging comments online per session for students or students' parents to see.","They only pay 15$/hour and force the students into buying package deals. Students think that tutors are getting paid 46$/hour. Varsity tutors takes 60% of your money earned. They give quite a pathetic bonus per session (not per hour) if your driving distance is 10 miles or more, which barely covers gas. Rather than doing an express direct deposit payment per session, you have to wait til over a week into the next month to receive a paycheck of 45-100 dollars."
1045,Varsity Tutors,Director,2015-08-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"This job is strictly work from home which is good for people who prefer that (not so much if you don't like the feeling of being isolated from the world by sitting at home all day). The salary is decent and there is a yearly Summit, often in Las Vegas. The company pays for your travel and hotel (my year, we stayed at the Aria on the strip). The company also pays for you to fly to Phoenix, AZ for one week of training (hotel paid for). The company provides you with a laptop, cell phone and headset so that you don't have to use your own. Some of the people that work there are really great, but since you work from home, you only get to correspond for work via Skype and Zoom.","The most annoying and horrible micro-managment I have EVER experienced. They even record all of your outgoing phone calls and listen to them to critique you. You constantly feel like the company doesn't trust you to do your job. The training is basically non-existent: Training is often done in someone's home and there is no training center or set training manual to learn from. The title ""director"" is a CLEAR misnomer as you are really a paid telemarketer if you are a sales director. Even Client and Tutor Directors aren't really ""directors"" as you would think of that word. They really just oversee client relations and tutor placements via email and phone calls, but they are ALSO required to make sales. Directors are ranked on the internal company website to make the directors compete for the amount of packages sold. Those on the bottom are constantly hounded by the management and often fired. The TURNOVER RATE IS RIDICULOUS! Groups of directors come in by the handful, not on an individual basis, so there's constantly new people coming and going. The work hours are long 8am-6pm with at least one day that you have to work until 8pm. The company philosophy is that since you don't have to commute to work, you should spend the time that you would be commuting working. HOWEVER, you are paid on salary so there is no additional pay for consistently working 45-55 hour weeks (working 40 hours is frowned upon as you aren't working enough). Additional pay comes from sales commissions (which goes back to the management encouraging competition between directors, which leads to hostility between cities and between directors in the form of stealing clients/sales from one another to get company recognition). 

Basically, this job is only good for people who WANT to work 45+ hour work weeks from home (Saturdays and Sundays included), and compete for sales, sometimes in a dirty or shady fashion. You'll be asked to cover several cities at once and as the company grows, the work load increases, but the base pay does not. :-/ Medical insurance is also REALLY expensive."
1046,Varsity Tutors,Criteria for meeting Students' needs.,2015-08-12,5.0,,"Varsity Tutors does a great job at linking tutors' teaching experience with the needs of students. Their top priority is that both Tutor and Student maximize the educational experience. They go through a thorough process to critique tutors and make sure their experience will allow the student to receive the assistance they need. 

They never obligate a student or tutor to a teaching opportunity and make sure that both are comfortable with the teaching arrangement. 

In addition Varsity Tutors has a supportive staff with quick response times to handle any issues or concerns for both parties. There are unlimited resources and they are always open for recommendations. 

Overall it is a classy and well run organization dedicated to education.",There are no cons at this time except that there is only 24 hours to tutor in a day.

Right away this gave me a positive outlook on this company. There hiring process was quick but thorough. I had a background check and two interviews. The employees are so helpful and always answer all of my questions. One of my favorite attributes about this company is there matching process. Although a tutoring opportunity might present itself that I would like, I am never paired with the student unless I am the absolute best fit. They match the tutor to the student personality wise, distance, price and teaching strategy wise. I adored my first student and we got along wonderfully. I also have the freedom of how I want to teach, with out the company putting extra rules and regulations on the session. It's like tutoring independently but with having a great support team, that is looking out for the students and you.","I have not found any downsides while working with V.T.

Varsity Tutors allows tutors to practice independently and adapt their teaching strategy for each individual client, which also allows students to find tutors which best suit their needs. Working for a company that is dedicated to helping students gain interest and confidence in their academic abilities is very satisfying and I would highly recommend Varsity Tutors for tutors and students!","Tutoring opportunities, especially online positions, fill very quickly and you must constantly be refreshing the tutoring page in order to show interest in new students."

1063,Varsity Tutors,Great company,2015-08-06,4.0,Personal Tutor,Varsity tutors provides a laid back style by allowing you to accept or reject potential students. The matching system for tutors to students is very good. The company takes care of gathering initial information and provides the tutor with detailed notes on the student when offering you the chance to work with them. The pay is great and yields opportunity for raises. The directors are excellent communicators and will do anything they can to help you out!,It is very difficult to get a substantial amount of hours per week. You are typically emailed the student notes and whichever tutor responds first gets dibs on the student. I would not recommend tutoring at varsity tutors as a primary source of income.

I love that the company offers help in so many different academic areas and test prep. All of the leads that come in are warm and hot. They reached out to us first and all marketing is done online.

1080,Varsity Tutors,Great company to work for as a tutor!,2015-06-15,5.0,Certified Tutor,"I've been working as a tutor at VT for about a year in the Bay Area and San Diego areas. I love the flexibility and agency tutors get when it comes to tutoring, taking on new clients, and setting your own schedule. The directors you work with are very friendly and helpful, always letting you know that they're there whenever you need them! Communication between tutors and directors is usually very prompt. They give you bonus compensation if you drive more than you'd like to tutor a student, which is a plus. I was able to meet and tutor some really wonderful students in the past year I have been working at VT. All in all, Varsity Tutors is a really great company to work for, especially if you like the freedom and independence that goes with being a tutor!","-paychecks are monthly, not biweekly, which can sometimes make it difficult to manage money well.
-there's no other way to actually meet your directors or fellow tutors since everything is done electronically. I know my city-wide director said that they were working to have all the tutors in an area get together at some sort of event, but I think that planning got shelved in favor of other priorities.
-during some times of years, you might have less clients than usual to tutor--number of hours/week can sometimes shift. There might be months were you tutor students 8-10 hrs out of the week; others, you'd be lucky to get 2-4. But that just depends on the demand and schedules of you and the people you tutor."
1081,Varsity Tutors,Amazing responsiveness and professionalism,2015-06-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've never have had so many good experiences from the beginning. The first interview was actually  fun; their team was extremely responsive once I passed the interview; they made it easy to go through the paperwork; you get super-friendly and professional treatment with ANY problem you may have. Once I started, they even called me to tell me how a client was very happy to have me as a teacher. There's not an email that I send that doesn't get answered within minutes or hours. I mean... It's just a great company/team!","Well... I guess that it depends on the subject you teach. If it's a popular one among teachers, then you definitely have to be very very fast: once you receive a tutoring opportunity, and even more if it's online, it might be gone in less than 2 minutes, which means you have to be extremely good at checking your email right away if you want to get the most out of this job. 
As for the pay, I guess that it depends on which city you live. Most likely online tutoring is a flat rate (I'm not a 100% sure) so if you live in NYC it might be not enough for you. It's still worth checking!"

In those 10 hours, each minute is expected to be spent on the phone and religiously tracking each moment of time, with the exception of a lunch break. This poorly run, understaffed company has a culture of competitiveness regarding who can have the LEAST work-life balance. Working 12 hours without a break is lauded. However, the compensation in no way deserves this- it is very low. Some positive reviews on this site are from employees who were asked and incentivized to do so. There is a culture of bullying from management. Manipulation is a common management practice, as is negative reinforcement. Recruiting policies and selling methods border on outright lying. Ethics seem to be ignored in favor of the bottom line. Some employees with children were penalized for tending to them, while others were not- fairness was not often seen. Caution to parents: low quality tutors are common.

Directors are provided with laptops and a technology allowance for work-related expenses. 

The CEO of the company is very visible and has an open-door policy that isn't just for show. He asks that employees fill out surveys and takes their ideas and feedback into consideration when reworking policies.

Employees work on teams and are in constant contact with everyone, which is great when you are working from home. The support provided during the first few months is critical to an employee's success, and everyone really steps up and is happy to lend a hand to the new hires. This is the best work environment that I've ever been a part of. I can see myself here for the long run.","Work weeks are a bit long sometimes (working every other weekend), but every other week provides a 3-day weekend.

Like a lot of other people have mentioned, it also offers good flexibility whether you tutor on the side and don't have time for a lot of students, or whether you want a more substantial student base.  It's also nice to know that if a student cancels on you on short notice, Varsity Tutors will still provide you with compensation.","The great part about Varsity Tutors for students is that the tutors come to you.  This can sometimes be difficult, however, for tutors that rely on public transportation (like me), or who have to travel a long distance to see a student.  Although they provide additional compensation for traveling to see students who are further away from you (10 miles, for example), it doesn't always seem worth it.  They do a pretty good job of connecting you with students who are closer to your primary address, but it still takes time to travel there.  Skype in place of face-to-face tutoring sessions is a good alternative that Varsity Tutors offers to combat this."

Additionally, my supervisors have been very supportive about my choices for hours, subject matter, and transportation.  I get to pick my own hours and number of students.  Additionally, I am able to choose which students I want to work with, and I have been encouraged to only take on students with subject matter that I am completely comfortable with.  Most of the work is conducted on your own, so there is a lot of freedom to plan and schedule lessons.","There are only a few cons to working with Varsity Tutors.  Since the tutor position is a contract position, there are no benefits (health, dental, etc).  Additionally, it is frustrating to only get paid once per month.  However, these are small issues, especially if you are only tutoring part-time.

And because you can work in their online environment, you can choose odd hours based on your time zone, which may be just fine for someone three time zones away.","It isn't the fault of the company, but sometimes the clients will cancel at the last minute, or not show up.  Fortunately, the company compensates you for 'no shows' or cancellations that take place with less than 24 hours notice."

-relies on your past education and test performance; no need for special training & allows great independence in teaching

-very reasonable non-compete clause (you can't take clients away from VT but you can tutor others on your own)
-reasonable pay
-tutors can choose which clients and subjects to teach

-you can spend more time traveling to and from clients than actually tutoring
-not much room for advancement or promotion
-only paid once a month
-sometimes client opportunities are scarce; you might not make enough to pay your bills with this job alone, but that might be due to having lots of tutors in NYC"
1131,Varsity Tutors,"Good place to work, flexible scheduling",2015-02-02,5.0,Certified Tutor,"Scheduling is very flexible, it is up to you how much or little you work, and you can change it as events in your life change.
The managers and corporate reps are very friendly and helpful.","Clients sometimes expect you to be on-call, or want to ignore minimum session times.
Periodically there are technical difficulties with the online platform (especially if you have a spotty internet connection)."
1132,Varsity Tutors,Supportive staff; ideal job for supplementary income,2015-02-01,5.0,Tutor,"I've been working with Varsity Tutors for 6 months and have had only positive interactions with the staff and clients.
The nature of the job is a huge plus-- there is flexibility in scheduling, number of hours worked, subjects taught, clients, and time-off.
The staff has been communicative, accommodating, and responsive to any issues that have come up.  I enjoy working with them","The schedule can be a little unpredictable due to clients' and families' busy schedules.  However, the cancellation policy helps offset the unpredictability."
1133,Varsity Tutors,Rewarding Job with Good Policies and Company Support,2015-01-29,4.0,Certified Tutor,"Since introducing the online platform, managing a greater number of tutoring hours is easy since I can work straight from home or school and have the option to tutor my in-person clients online if weather prevents travel. My clients are polite and dedicated to improving in the subject I am tutoring them in. This is a great job for someone who is employed or a full-time graduate student and looking for a meaningful way to make some extra money. Local management (regional directors) are easy to get in touch with, helpful, and personable. The online platform and session-recording set-up is easy to use and allows for detailed notes to be kept on prior sessions.","There is no compensation for travel or material and no means to negotiate salary even after working with the company for a period of time. Clients are sometimes surprised to learn about certain company policies (such as 24-hour cancellation). Cost to client and tutor wages lack transparency and the tutor must file taxes under ""self-employed""."
1134,Varsity Tutors,Best all round tutoring agency,2015-01-29,4.0,Certified Tutor,"Varsity matches up students with the proper tutor.  I can get full information before committing to the assignment.  I can select clients based on subject matter, level, location, availability and even motivation and past success level.  They provide assistance but no interference to allow me to optimize lessons for individual students.","No real cons--opportunities vary with seasonal fluctuations, of course."
1135,Varsity Tutors,Fantastic opportunity for tutors,2015-01-28,5.0,Certified Tutor,"I have been working with Varsity Tutors as a tutor for the past six months now, and it has been a wonderful experience.  I have nothing but positive things to say about the way the directors have communicated, the way they have matched me with clients and the level of professionalism and effiiciency in which they conduct business. As a tutor, my clients have all been very self-motivated and this is wonderful because it allows me to really focus on content. Without doubt, Varsity Tutors is the best company/organization at which I have worked as a tutor.","The only con is that as a tutor, your schedule can fluctuate and so I would just point out that it is a part-time position versus a full-time job. However, if you have experience tutoring, you know this ahead of time based on past experience tutoring. It comes with the territory!"
1136,Varsity Tutors,Varsity Tutors makes tutoring easy and convenient,2015-01-27,5.0,Tutor,The online tutor portal makes tutoring easy and accessible from anywhere. Not only can you tutor from home but varsity tutors does a great job of finding you students.,The pay could be better.
1137,Varsity Tutors,It's a great decision to work for Varsity Tutors.....,2015-01-27,5.0,,"Working for varsity tutors only brings positives: you can set your own hours and work with a wide variety of students- of all ages- with a wide variety of subjects. The full-time employees are very easily accessible and will provide feedback very quickly. Varsity Tutors puts individuals who desire to work with students in the tutoring session in an excellent position to do so; with this being the case, I would recommend any of my friends to work here.","A pro, that can turn into the cons, is the number of opportunities available! There are so many of them, so it's easy to over commit: nonetheless, managing your own schedule is a good lesson to learn."
1138,Varsity Tutors,Excellent company to work for!,2015-01-25,5.0,,"1. I am an independent contractor...I control the work load.
2. They are there to answer questions and help with struggles.
3. Excellent mediators when there are struggles.
4. Wide variety of subjects to choose from...","As an independent contractor, you have no eligibility for benefits."
1139,Varsity Tutors,Working with Varsity Tutors has been awesome!,2015-01-23,5.0,,"The best reasons to work here are that the people who run Varsity have excellent communication skills, they're kind, and they're very understanding when it comes to schedule changes and restricting how far a distance you drive to.",None as far as I've seen.
1140,Varsity Tutors,"Fun, Laid back, Flexible",2015-01-22,5.0,Private Tutor,"You pick your own students, schedule, and subjects to teach. You get a super friendly director who helps you out every step of the way! Plus, if students cancel at the last minute, YOU STILL GET PAID ANYWAY! You get a nice mediator who looks out for you. I would totally recommend this job to anyone who loves teaching and helping students improve their academics. Plus, you get the respect and recognition you deserve for your professional knowledge. As a college student who just graduated, this was the first company who hired me, so I'm super thankful that I got this opportunity when the job market right now is still terrible. I love this job and I love watching kids improve. Joining Varsity Tutors was totally worth it!","This is a part-time gig, not a full-time thing. Most students (K-12) get out of school and are only available at 4 PM or after to do a tutor session."
1141,Varsity Tutors,I have enjoyed working with the students because they are very cooperative.,2015-01-22,4.0,French Tutor,Students are very willing to work with me to find the best time to meet as well as a place to tutor.,"Occasionally, students need to change the time to meet or struggle with the length of time."
1142,Varsity Tutors,"Organization could be better, but they leave you alone and give lots of work",2015-01-21,4.0,Tutor,"Lots of students, especially if you're willing to be flexible; they expect their tutors to already know what they're doing, which means they leave you alone and let you do it, which is nice; raises are available.","Not the highest salary for tutoring work (though not the lowest); the organizational structure leaves something to be desired. Multiple directors all respond to the same email account but don't seem to communicate, so I don't feel any personal connection to the higher-ups and I end up repeating myself frequently.
Also, the independent-contractor model is a pain come tax time."
1143,Varsity Tutors,Excellent experience!,2015-01-21,4.0,Tutor,"The staff at Varsity Tutors is friendly, professional, and very supportive. They send many opportunities for new students, allowing you to choose as many or few as you desire to fit your schedule. An online tutoring option also offers the opportunity to tutor from home, saving on travel time.","Travel time can be tricky, especially in cities where heavy traffic is the norm. Driving 30 minutes each way for a one-hour session is frustrating, but the time spent with my students was always enjoyable and very much worthwhile."
1144,Varsity Tutors,"A Great, FLEXIBLE company!",2015-01-20,5.0,Tutor,"Varsity Tutors has been the perfect part time job for me as a freelance writer and creative. When my other freelance work dries up, I can focus more on Tutoring--but if I have to decline a lot of clients for a couple of weeks because I'm working on another project, that's no problem. Also, getting to use their online platform rather than drive around to clients' houses is a big plus. Furthermore, all of their staff is very prompt when replying to email and calls!","Basically none that aren't common to tutoring as a profession--sometimes there are dry spells with fewer clients, of course."
1145,Varsity Tutors,Great company to work for!,2015-01-16,5.0,City-Wide Director,I love the autonomy and company-wide desire to provide academic excellence to our students.,"Working remotely is a different experience than working in an office, I find that there is better communication working remotely, but some people may find that challenging."
1146,Varsity Tutors,Love it here,2015-01-16,5.0,Certified Tutor,"There are many positives about working for Varsity Tutors. I have the most flexibility imaginable, which is really important for me since I am in the process of going to medical school. I am able to alter my schedule at any time, I have full control over which students I would like to tutor as well as the topics that I'd like to tutor, and even the mode by which I do so (online vs. in person). There are also a lot of other opportunities within the company that I have been able to take advantage of, such as marketing for the brand around local universities, as well as formulating a wide variety of practice questions for their online database.","Some locations for in-home tutoring are a bit farther away and VT does not compensate for any driving time. However, it is your choice whether or not to take on a student that isn't very close to where you live, so ultimately, it won't affect you if you don't want it to."
1147,Varsity Tutors,Outstanding Place to Work,2015-01-13,5.0,Certified Tutor,"I love being a Varsity Tutor. The company does all the leg work of finding clients, and I simply schedule a session and begin tutoring. I've gotten tons of long-term (ie three or four month long) assignments that have really added up in terms of hours and payment. Plus, if you ever have any issues, you can call the company directly. No need to handle billing--as a tutor, I can get to work without having to worry about the administrative side of things.",Some locations for in-home tutoring may be hard to find.
1148,Varsity Tutors,Great experience !,2015-01-13,5.0,Tutor,They are organized. You can work either from home or outside but you are able to build up your schedule. They are really professionals and will send clients regularly. Benefits are good and the job is enjoyable.,Some clients may be difficult to deal with but not impossible. Knowing a little bit of physiology can help and then things will go on smoothly.
1149,Varsity Tutors,Experience as a Math Tutor,2015-01-12,5.0,Academic Tutor,"The company is very supportive; they are on your side during client complaints and will add or drop clients as requested by you.  They supply books and other materials needed to work with the clients.  I've worked in several different teaching/tutoring environments, and this has been the least stressful environment.","As a tutor you are considered ""self-employed"".  This means that taxes are not taken out of your paycheck each month, and you have a pretty hefty tax bill in April."
1150,Varsity Tutors,Varsity Tutors is a great organization.,2015-01-12,5.0,Tutor,"Very supportive staff. The website is easy to use and has great resources for tutors and students. More than enough client referrals to fill evenings and weekends. Flexible scheduling, travel bonuses.","Working around student's schedules can be difficult. Travel can be taxing. Since tutors are employed as independent contractors, employees must pay taxes as self employed workers."
1151,Varsity Tutors,A company that puts you in touch with a wide variety or clientele and students.,2015-01-12,5.0,Tutor,"I make my own schedule (perfect for a part-time job) and have worked with a huge variety of students. The experiences I've had with that variety of students has benefitted my students in my day job (high school English teacher). It's nice too because they do all of the marketing and advertising for you, unlike other national tutoring services.","I haven't had any issues, but the local director job has gone through a few faces since I started. It makes it difficult to establish strong relationships."
1152,Varsity Tutors,One of the more rewarding part-time jobs I've had.,2015-01-11,5.0,Private Tutor,"-Easy to have a work-life balance (especially with me being a teacher).
-Great way to stay up to date on math (or other subject) topics and procedures.
-Compensation is very fair for the quality of work. Get paid for travel as well. 
-Directors are awesome and very friendly to work with--super duper personable. 
-Directors are great at providing clients within 15 miles.
-Aren't forced to take clients based on your availability, but rather given clients based on individualized needs.
-I have yet to find a client that I haven't liked working with.",-The initial screening process was a bit confusing.
1153,Varsity Tutors,Excellent,2015-01-11,5.0,Certified Tutor,Varsity Tutors provides educators with clients in their area to tutor. I would recommend this company to any teacher looking for extra work.,There are no cons at the moment. The company is great to work for.
1154,Varsity Tutors,Good company to work with if you want to make extra money and want flexibility with your schedule.,2015-01-09,4.0,Tutor,"The company has well trained and professional staff that will help you get started with clients as soon  as you're approved to tutor. You have the freedom of choosing your own hours and of picking clients. Even if you don't take home the full tutoring amount, the salary is still more competitive than other tutoring companies.","Most of the available students tend to be far from central DC, so commuting times can be long."
1155,Varsity Tutors,Varsity Tutors has helped me advance as both a tutor and entrepreneur.,2015-01-08,5.0,Certified Tutor,"Varsity Tutors understands the importance of a healthy work-life balance. Their constant support and understanding have helped me balance two jobs, while being enrolled in class. Additionally, their '24-Hour Policy' ensures that all of your calls and/or emails, regarding absolutely anything, are returned within 24 hours. Moreover, I can personally attest to their consistency and reliability, in that all of my questions, comments, and concerns have been answered within 24 hours of my inquiries, if not, within 1 hour. My experience working as a contractor for Varsity Tutors has been nothing short of an incredible experience and I look forward to continuing as a Certified Varsity Tutor for years to come.",I have had absolutely no issues with the company or its employees. Their continued support has made me a successful tutor and entrepreneur.
1156,Varsity Tutors,Great company to work for part-time,2015-01-07,5.0,,"Very respectful of tutors preferences, not just of those being tutored. Provide plenty of support with new clients. Provide plenty of opportunities to tutor. Put a lot of trust in the tutors hired.",Rely on previous tutoring experience and not much support in terms of developing tutoring skills
1157,Varsity Tutors,Varsity Tutors is a great company that takes care of its employees.,2015-01-07,5.0,Academic Tutor,"If you want to work at a respected, well run tutoring company, I would definitely suggest Varsity Tutors. I've been working with them for over three years. The management of the company really prioritizes their tutors and values them greatly. They are also always on call, in case you need anything or have any questions. As a tutor, you have a lot of freedom with regards to how many students you want to take on at once and you can change your availability at any time. You also have a lot of autonomy with regards to how you tutor and what resources you choose to use for each student. The company also allows you to do online tutoring for certain students/subjects/tutors which is very convenient as long as you have a good internet connection. You are really your own boss and get to decide your hours to a large extent. This is also a company that has been growing ever since I began with them. They have expanded tremendously since I started with them, and I get the sense that they will continue to grow. Also, as a student, it helps reinforce the material I'm teaching for myself so I don't have to study.","There are no health benefits. Also, because each student has different availabilities, your schedule is constantly in flux. This isn't necessarily a problem with Varsity Tutors specifically and they always ask your availability, but it can become problematic when trying to make a schedule for more than a week at a time (with regards to tutoring). I'm not sure how availability of clients would change in different areas. I am in Philadelphia, so there is a good amount of students available."
1158,Varsity Tutors,Great staff that will help you with everything!!!!,2015-01-07,5.0,Private Tutor,"I have been working for Varsity Tutors over 6 months. They are such a great team of people to work with! If you need help, just give them a call! They are working so hard to find us the right people to tutor. And all the clients from Varsity Tutors are so great! As a tutor, you can pick your own schedule and pick your own clients you want to work with! Probably Varsity Tutors is the most flexible and considerate tutoring company. What are you waiting for! Come to join us!!!","Believe or not, there's not much about Cons"
1159,Varsity Tutors,VT is a great opportunity!,2015-01-05,4.0,City Wide Director,"I have truly enjoyed my time at VT. I am a single parent and working from home has been a total life saver. I can take my daughter to after school activities and don't have to take a sick day or leave work early if she is ill. My co-workers and all managers are amazing! I feel appreciated and heard at this company. You can express your thoughts and ideas. I have had so many ideas/suggestions that have been implemented the same week. After working for large corporations it is so refreshing to be a part of a company that does not have all the red tape and bureaucracy. I also love that I have the autonomy to make decisions and I do not have to get permission for every little decision I have to make. 

I am excited about the potential growth and opportunities at this company. My hard work and dedication is recognized. We all work together and have lots of fun chatting with each other on Skype! 

I have also enjoyed working with the students and tutors. It is awesome to know that we play a part in helping a student get to the next level. We have amazing tutors and I have built some wonderful relationships with hundreds of them.","After reading other reviews it needs to be said that working from home is not checking your computer while you do your laundry. I have worked more with this job than any office job I have ever had. You must be very disciplined and know how to stop working. It's easy to get sucked into working 60 hours a week because it's there. If you don't know how to turn it off then you will end up working way more than you are supposed to. I have worked more than my scheduled time, but not because I was asked to. I simply made the choice to do so. It is not frowned upon to work your scheduled hours and be done; it's just very hard to turn it off especially if you have a strong work ethic!

Besides that, I wish we had more benefits such as retirement, option to purchase more life insurance, etc. However, VT is still a new company and I have faith those things will come with time as this is a company that values its employees. 

Lastly, I think it is more challenging to communicate since we all work from home. We don't always know what is going on and sometimes there is a lack of transparency. For example, when someone leaves the company we aren't notified; we either notice they are no longer a contact or hear through the rumor mill. I have always found this sort of odd. While it is none of our business if someone quits or is let go, a simple email stating ""Jane Doe is no longer with VT. We wish her the best, etc."" Also, system changes (which are usually awesome and very beneficial) are not explained or announced. You just log on and notice the system is different and you just have to be trusted to figure it out. I have been a Director for over a year and I still don't know how to do everything in the database."
1160,Varsity Tutors,A profitable and flexible place to work!,2015-01-03,5.0,Private Tutor,"Varsity Tutors is a great place to work if you need some extra money and have some spare time. You can chose your own schedule, decide if a client is a good fit for you or not, and you create your own pace with your students. There is good support from the company, the local supervisor is very helpful, and the compensation is good.","You need to be able to work out the best approaches to each student on your own, and create your own curriculum. You will not receive a lot of training once you are hired, and need to be able to function as an independent contractor. They also do not take our your taxes, so keep that in mind when you see your paychecks."
1161,Varsity Tutors,"THE place to work as a respected, independent tutor.",2015-01-03,4.0,,"The company is supportive and respectful of its tutor employees, there is a solid amount of communication between directors and tutors, tutors are truly to work as many or as few hours as they desire, and, as a tutor, I have been treated with nothing but respect by both directors and clients. I have loved being able to tutor in the subjects about which I am passionate. VT is an especially student-friendly company and I have had no problem working around my class schedule.","Depending on where you live, there may be a significant amount of driving involved, though there is sometimes a small driving stipend attached to distant clients. Furthermore, the negative aspect of allowing all tutors to work entirely independently with little direction from the company is that such a set-up makes it difficult when put in the position of a substitute or fill-in tutor. In such scenarios, the substitute tutor generally has no idea what study aids to employ, what material to cover, or what routine to follow."

Management is hands on and listens to suggestions.,"I was told when I was hired that I would work about fifty hours a week. The reality is that I worked more than sixty. The schedule was totally out of whack and extremely tiring. There was also not much flexibility. I found it impossible to have any kind of work life balance, which is why i left eventually. Also, if you divide your salary up into the amount of hours you work, it is a very paltry sum. Work from home or no, this job is extremely demanding of your emotional, mental, and physical time."

1165,Varsity Tutors,Growing company with no concern for your well being.,2014-12-15,2.0,City Wide Director of Tutoring,"The company offers amazing services to people all over the US! Our tutors, and staff are wonderful.

The people they hire as Directors are a fantastic group. Smart, talented, witty and hard working Directors & Regional Directors make this company run. Sadly, the staff is overworked and under appreciated. 

Working from home is still a perk, however the hours are so long that you never feel like you're able to separate work from home life.","Directors and Regional Directors are worked to the bone for a low salary. The ridiculously long hours (10 hour work day minimum), and 11 day on/3 day off work schedule is not manageable long term. The company justifies your 55-60 hour work week as fine because you no longer have a daily commute. If you do the math, the Directors are making less hourly than the tutors. 

Client care is a thing of the past. Activity reports & sale numbers out weigh any concern for clients. Everything is being micro managed now, to the point where the ability to feel a connection to your clients, get to know their needs, and take care of them is completely lost. 

The company is losing amazingly talented team members every week because people can't handle the hours, and the pressure."

Not only are you able to grow and develop in your career, but also in your knowledge of building a first class, industry leading company. The people here are great too, and very fun to work with. It's been a great 4 years so far!","The work can be hard at times and there are definitely growing pains, but all of that can be easily overcome with hard work, perseverance, and the support that exists from team members and supervisors. You also have to be able to embrace change and understand that you will be pushed out of your comfort zone, but the rewards are well-worth it!"

However, beyond just the work from home opportunity Varsity Tutors is a company that cares what its employees think and works to include their suggestions into technology and policy changes.  You also won't find a more caring and supportive group of colleagues who will stop what they are doing to answer questions and offer feedback whenever they can.  Finally, you are working in the educational field so in terms of personal reward/satisfaction Varsity Tutors offers that as you know at the end of the day you are doing something that will help a student succeed.","While working from home is a big perk it isn't for everyone.  You have to be able to create a work/life balance since work is only a few steps away.  It can also mean you are a little isolated from your other coworkers.  You can chat on Skype etc. but if you are a person who needs that ""office setting"" with constant contact with coworkers and management you don't get that here.  I believe the benefits of working from home outnumber the issues but again might not be for everyone."

Kimble listened to my job related worries and worked with my strengths which enabled me to be both beneficial and productive with my clients. I enjoy being able to work from home and Skype clients as well as constructing problem sets. This is a progressive company that is changing students' lives and helping young academics (like myself) to support themselves in the process.,The job is very accommodating to those in academic fields and allow one to choose the amount of work that they can handle. The only con of the job would be if one chooses more work than they can handle given their schedule.
1173,Varsity Tutors,Fantastic Work from Home Opportunity,2014-10-09,5.0,Director,Varsity creates a great work environment even though you are not in an office. There is a very positive culture and everyone makes you feel welcomed and appreciated.  When I came in they did not have many benefits to speak of but they just currently added healthcare and vision (vision is no cost to you!).  The compensation is more than fair...it is a 50 hour work week but you do not have to commute anywhere so that makes up for it.  You also have the ability to earn commission on top of your salary which is a nice perk.  They are very flexible with the schedule so if you need a day here or there you can switch the day you work which is great because I have a child at home so the flexibility for the unexpected is great. They also have a great tech allowance so you can have a great computer and all the necessary accessories.,"The only real challenge I can think of is the work week is long, but it goes by quick."

1176,Varsity Tutors,Fabulous Work Culture,2014-08-30,5.0,Associate Director of Recruitment,"I'm a FT employee, not a tutor. The atmosphere feels almost ""google-ish."" It's fresh, innovative and constantly growing and changing. Everybody has a voice and upper mgmt has a 100% open door policy. You have easy direct Skype or email access to everyone from the President and Founder on down. Mgmt takes you seriously. They are just as apt to implement an idea of yours as they are one from top mgmt. We all work from home, but there is still a feeling of camaraderie that is better than what I have felt in most brick and mortar places I've worked. We all love what we do and everyone I know WANTS to be here. The warmth and friendliness is amazing. Everybody takes pride in the company and wants to see it succeed.","It's not a con, because they are very clear up front about the hours, but be prepared to work some serious hours. 11 days on (9 hours a day or 10 if you take an hour for lunch) and 3 days off. Having two 3 days weekends every month is great, and completely makes up for the 11 days straight schedule. Again, you are not hoodwinked into long hours. I was told in the interview what the hours would be."
1177,Varsity Tutors,Great opportunity to work from home,2014-06-27,3.0,,Company has decent pay for part-time employees. It doesn't seem so great for full time.  Working from home is a nice benefit.,"The company is growing rapidly and in the past,, hasn't made the best decisions. It seems there is a lot of turnover in middle management."
1178,Varsity Tutors,Director,2014-06-10,4.0,Director,"1. Work from home
2. Senior Management that listens, takes all requests, opinions and suggestions very seriously and responds promptly.   I,  as an employee,  feel more valued with this company than other very large corporate companies I have worked for in the past. 
3.  Wonderful colleagues and work environment
4.  Technology is constantly changing and evolving to make our jobs easier and more efficient.
5.  Fast growing company, there are often new opportunities arising","1. NO work/life balance.   You are expected to work VERY long days and weekends.  Definitely not ideal if you have a family or small children (unless you are a work-a-holic, then it doesn't matter!)
2. Health benefits offered, but no dental, vision, 401k.  
3.  Very minimal vacations and holidays compared to other companies.  Expect to work on holidays occasionally"
1179,Varsity Tutors,"Professional interview on phone, was warm, respectful and asked very good questions.",2014-06-04,3.0,Tutor,Flexible schedule and potential to work with variety of students..,Not enough hours for income I need.
1180,Varsity Tutors,"""Wonderful company.""",2014-06-02,5.0,Academic Tutor,"The clients are often self motivated and eager to learn, so you do not feel like your efforts are ever in vain. In addition, the hours are perfect for students and people who are trying to have two jobs. The hours are manageable and suited to your needs.","Depending on where you live, it can be quite a drive to the clients' house (you are reimbursed for longer drives, however). Business can also be slow at times of the year because of school being out, so you may need to find other jobs if this is your primary source of income."
1181,Varsity Tutors,"I have worked with some nice kids, but find the company unprofessional.",2014-05-30,2.0,Tutor,"Tutors can pick their own hours and general locations.  The pay is somewhat higher than that of most other tutoring companies.  Except for logging tutoring hours and brief descriptions of the sessions, there are no real administrative duties involved.","The company seems to be run by bright but fairly clueless college students.  There is no training, so customers can easily end up with smart tutors who, unfortunately, have no idea how to teach.  The company doesn't offer a lot of work, and sometimes they repeatedly offer assignments outside of a tutor's stated preferences.  Travel time, supplies, gas and tolls subtract a significant amount from the total compensation."
1182,Varsity Tutors,Tough but rewarding work-from-home at a fast-growing company.,2014-05-29,5.0,Sales Director,"1) Satisfying work - VT expects a lot from its directors but doesn't burden them with needless busy work. Everything I do during the day I feel is clearly contributing to our shared success. I also generally feel good about the work I do with our clients - we've got great tutors and it's a wonderful feeling when you hear about how we've helped our students.

2) Working from home - this is a big advantage for me personally, though I've known people who didn't much like it, so it might be a con for some! I really enjoy the ability to work independently and manage my own time.

3) Community and teamwork - the culture at VT is great. Everyone works together and shares the burden when things get busy. The leadership team is very available to everyone for questions, comments, or suggestions. It's nice to know that I can send a Skype message to the VP or CEO at any time and my thoughts will be taken seriously!","1) Benefits - VT provides health insurance, but that's it. No vision, no dental, no 401k. I'm hoping that changes soon as the company is growing VERY quickly but for right now they do run a little light on benefits.

2) Hours - you're expected to work 50 hours a week minimum, and work every other weekend. A typical day is from 8-6pm, and you're occasionally expected to do a late shift, usually from 10-8pm. Since there's no commute it's not too terrible, but anyone applying to VT should be aware of what they're getting into!"
1183,Varsity Tutors,I could not be happier - so proud to be working for Varsity Tutors!,2014-05-29,5.0,City-Wide Director,Working at Varsity Tutors has been an incredible experience. The ability to work from home allows flexibility which is a huge perk.  It is the best of both worlds as you are able to work independently while any co-worker is just a call or instant message away. There is a true sense of team here as we work hard together to do our jobs the best we can. There is nothing more rewarding than being able to help students and change lives for the better!,Some might consider working a long day a con however if you love what you do this does not matter. Those hours are spent in the comfort of your own home while helping students in their time of need - most certainly not a con!!
1184,Varsity Tutors,Good for getting started at tutoring,2014-05-28,3.0,Math Tutor,"I worked as a tutor while going to school full time in Atlanta. There were always lots of clients looking for help. I had to turn down new clients all of the time. Once I got the tutoring experience, I found enough clients myself. Since Varsity is essentially a match-maker for tutors and clients, I stopped working for them.","You can make more money by the hour if you meet clients by yourself. But DO NOT try to beat the system by meeting them through Varsity and getting paid directly, they will catch you."
1185,Varsity Tutors,WHAT A JOKE!  UNPROFESSIONAL. DO NOT LEAVE A GOOD JOB FOR CITYWIDE DIRECTOR POSITION,2014-05-18,1.0,Director,"ONLY Pros were the promises (that were a scam) Seems like they go through tons and tons of city wide directors- you use your own resources- wifi, laptop etc  with the promise of a laptop. Check out the career page....always new faces....people come and go pretty quickly.  That says everything.",I wouldn't believe all the positive reviews on here.  The model is to churn and burn through people because you are using your own resources.  They want you to work 10 hours a day.  They want you to say a rehearsed script.  Make initial threats that you won't last  so you work nonstop for the 30 day trial.  Its a joke.Was promised a laptop in 30 days- what a joke.  Bonus structure promised was a lie.  The process providing tutors is a joke too.  There are lots of other options.  Look elsewhere.

Everyone is friendly, supportive, and you really feel like you are making a difference. They are open to your suggestions and appreciate the feedback.",The hours for part time recruiters are inconsistent which makes it difficult to predict what you will make from month to month. You are not in control of how many hours you get from week to week. It is hard to not be able to count on income.

Have to use all of your own technology, give out you personal cell number to strangers.
Piece meal work. I interviewed potential tutors and they pay you PER interview, didn't matter how long it took to get there, conduct the interview and on board the new person, you got paid for one hour. Total rip off
Constantly having to hire tutors because they mislead them about the job and then they quit

There seems to be room for growth within the company, and I plan on staying on long term.  I also very strongly believe in the mission of VT, and appreciate the high standards we have for our services.  Overall, thankful to work with such a great company!","Long hours (everyone works at least 50 hrs/week), lower pay than desired.  When offered the job, I was so excited to accept that I didn't stop to think about the salary they offered me, or make a counter offer.  That was a mistake, because I know I was offered the very minimum, and will now spend a long time making up for it.  Divided by the number of hours I work, my salary is really not great."

Automated payment system easy to use

Good if you like working with kids","Gives you no training or prep materials (the online prep materials submitted by tutors are a joke)--you are an independent contractor

I have been working with them in the New York/New Jersey area for some time, and I am constantly impressed with how the staff continually goes the extra mile to accommodate the client's request and the tutor's needs.  The organization is so well-organized that there is never a problem with payment.  If one is diligent in logging one's own hours, the payment is always exact and timely.  Also,  having been a classroom teacher in a public school system for many years, I thought I would have to forego organizational assistance and support working as a tutor, but Varsity feels like a touch of home.
