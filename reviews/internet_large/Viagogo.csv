Some bosses will go above and beyond to make your experience great; I was lucky enough to have such a boss. I was happy with compensation.","I’ve noticed an improvement in companywide communication, but it could still be better. In fact many of the issues that caused me to leave could potentially have been resolved with more open and honest communication. The company has yet to release a post-COVID remote work policy, and I’m told not to expect remote work continuing. Many policies are not set in stone, so if you are willing to ask for stuff you may get it, but if you are shy you will miss out.

There are people who seem to look down to other and talk down to them as well. The culture is very elitist brown nosing.
79,Viagogo,It's a job,2020-01-30,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Pizza. At the start you get lots of experience. Easy to move to different departments and get more experiences. Colleagues are mostly wonderful and will boost your mood. Close to shops.,"Lack of transparency, inflated ""perks"".

Monthly staff drinks/pizza parties. Summer and Christmas parties are great fun. Work is relatively easy (but tough- keep away if you're sensitive), with good opportunities for moving to different departments within the company. Loads of work abroad opportunities. Most team leaders are lovely. It was brilliant when I started working there, but over the past year has gone to the absolute dogs.","The probation period is 12 months, meaning you can be fired at any time without reason in your first year there, I didnt feel secure until I had passed the year mark and even then, I still feel like I'm walking on eggshells. Loads of new policies and procedures have been implemented in the last couple of months that are absolutely ridiculous and has triggered a massive increase in long standing, hard working members of staff leaving. They're newly implementing a ""week in hand"" style payment, leaving us with a week less of our already low salary in February. It's become impossible to plan or book holidays, before you can even consider booking anything you need to have all the days accrued, if you try and book in advance they'll deny your request. The worst one is probably the fact that we pretty much have to ask to use the bathroom or get a drink of water and you're timed while your gone, if you even go 1 second over your allotted time you're hauled into meetings and told you're an issue when in reality, you were just peeing, we were all told to ""control our fluid intake"".

-Getting off work on time. Working overtime is not needed for agents.

-Able to swap shifts with other coworkers. 
-Monthly activity and F&B are provided on special occasions or festivals

-Entertainment facility is provided in the workplace but there's no time for you to play anyway

-viagogo has their own security guard standing at the entry to make employees feel secured (Prevent furious customers for breaking into the office?)","-viagogo treats their employees like they are some kind of robots or machines, viagogo time and monitor you every single second,  even for going to the restroom. It's literally like working at a prison.

Double standards needed to be broken in the workplace as Team Leads can come to work late but agents are always required to come to work on time (no lateness is allowed, even for just 1 minute.) Additionally, TLs can overuse their personal time more than 20 mins per day but agents only got 20 mins to go to the toilets?!

-Agents need to call the sickline if they are running late but obviously this rule doesn't apply to TLs as they can come to work late and everyone (including TL) has signed a contract that more than 5 lateness within 6 month will result in termination. 

-TLs have obvious preferences towards agents 

-Every agent only has 20 mins per day to go to the restrooms which it's ridiculous and inhumane as 10 mins will be gone from suffering a diarrhea. 

-Agents are required to verbally inform their TLs before leaving the seats.

-Personal time cannot be overused (even for 1 min) as viagogo time you every second. Agents are only allowed to use the personal time appropriately at some designated time as agents cannot use personal time at the beginning of their shift and at the end of the shift which this is absurd. 

-Viagogo only cares about the numbers and productivity and ask agents to do as many cases as they can and as fast as they can. If you do not meet their targeted goal then you fail and the quantity of the emails are not even enough for all the agents to work.

-Agents will only receive fail notifications from the Audit team if the case is not handled correctly. Agents will never received compliments as viagogo expect agents to act perfectly like a machine.

-Agents cannot email or contact relevant teams and other departments directly as everything has to go through TL first which it's kinda troublesome.

-Receiving calls from furious and unreasonable customers for nonstop scolding and yelling is pretty much an everyday thing as agents are literally just customer's punching bag.

-viagogo treats their employees like disposable  utensils that can be replaced it anytime by anyone

-Agents who request sick leaves more than 5 days within 1 year will be put under a performance review which this is inhuman and can tell viagogo really doesn't treat their employees as a human beings and expect agents to behave and function like a robot with zero absence and errors.

-viagogo has a really high turnover rate and this doesn't only apply to their employees. Even the security guards, office cleaners and HR have a high average of turnover. 

-Audit team is extremely picky and sometimes audit the case incorrectly without common sense which makes agents very upset since the amounts of case being audited will be a record for management team's evaluation of agent performance.

-No annual bonus or incentives for hard working"

-learning: you'll learn, but there's no structure and you probably won't have a mentor.

-growth: no, they hire externally to fill senior roles. i wouldn't count on it.

-pay: viagogo will definitely pay you, but it'll likely be below industry average

benefits: the benefits plan is laughably bad. we purposefully don't share it unless asked explicitly to, and even then we don't send a PDF to read, we just gloss over the details on the phone.

-management: management varies a lot, but generally it's quite bad. i won't name names, but the viagogo NYC office has ~90 people and in the year and change I was there I saw at least 30+ people leave the organization. hopefully that tells you something about what management across the board is like. the team i started with and worked with for a year is entirely gone.

-culture: i've witnessed screaming matches, I've been in meetings where shouting was the default form of communication, I've cried after a meeting, a bunch of my coworkers have cried during meetings, but viagogo provides snacks so.

-future prospects: there's an article on the guardian that talks about this

**bonus complaint**  viagogo doesn't pay for slack even though we have literal hundreds of employees worldwide and almost 100 in NYC alone."
89,Viagogo,"Great Place, But Not For Everyone",2019-09-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"You get to work with lots of really smart, talented people. Work environment is laid back with casual dress and flexible work hours. The new NYC office is really nice and helps the work environment feel like that of a cool tech company. Fun perks like celebrations for the last Friday of each month, office board games, and team social/fun budgets. The work itself is challenging and interesting (for me at least). Bottom line, you have the opportunity to learn a lot, and if you show talent and work ethic you’ll be given a chance to choose your own path here.","Companywide communication can be improved; it’s often hard to know what other teams even do without personally asking a team member. Paid time off (10 vacation days) could be much better. Bad press can be discouraging. Overall experience seems to vary widely depending on your team as there are no set policies for things like working from home, working hours, etc."

Company have changed their business model and now very customer service focused. 
Big drive from high level management to make improvements. 
Laid back & fun daily work atmosphere.","The company has lots of old negative coverage in the media. 
Young evolving company so policy's constantly changing, though for the better, makes daily work challenging. 
Communication gaps between teams."
218,Viagogo,Decent culture but...,2014-12-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Young, vibrant atmosphere which is understandable given the sector (concerts, events, etc). Colleagues are generally nice, approachable and easy to get along with. As a start up business it has a more youthful environment which is nice when compared to older, more rigid corporate. 

Middle management when I was there was very competent and I had full faith in their decision making and leadership. 

Occasional opportunities to get tickets to concerts.","Dodgy practices: The company came under some intense scrutiny in a Channel 4 documentary that highlighted some of these: Buying up tickets in house with credit cards, agreements with promoters for premium allocations, etc. 

Also, depending on which side of the argument you sit (Supply/Demand vs price fairness for events goers), don't work at viagogo unless you're a star spangled capitalist who doesn't have a problem with traders speculating on a time sensitive commodity (tickets) to the long term detriment of consumers. 

When I was there there were no full time employees, except very senior people. This is because viagogo is a start up and it gives senior management the power to streamline the business when they need to. Unfortunately, this means you effectively have no job security and when you're annual contract is up, you could very easily be ushered out  no entitlement to severance. 

Management whilst being very competent, could be quite cold. There was a mentality that mangers shouldn't mingle with the minions, which is rather dated approach to man management.  

Work/life balance is ok. The pay is poor and well below market rate and there are no real perks."

223,Viagogo,Viagogo in Limerick - The worst experience I could ever imagine,2014-08-17,1.0,Customer Service Advisor,"The most of employees are nice and friendly. The local irish employees are culturally not interesting, but there are a lot of foreign employees from whole Europe that make the environment more enjoyable.","Management is composed by not qualitfie, unskilled and incompetent people, who have no idea about how to deal with employees. Being a business on the bound between legal and illegal (viagogo promises something it cannot guarantee actually, being the tickets not at viagogo side), employees are obliged to create false expectations for the clients, who even can face high expences, in prevision of receiving tickets that maybe they will never receive. Total lack of honesty and transparency in the relation with clients."
224,Viagogo,Underwhelmed by the lack of leadership across the board.,2014-08-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Very relaxed, people can take days off and not even explain to management why they are. 
it's pretty common for people to arrive at 11am and leave at 5pm. If this were a normal office this would be a con but because the cons are so bad these are the plus points.","Horrendous management practices, no leadership or ownership from management on many issues. 
Across the board they seem to have a hatred for their staff, they have a habit of firing people on the last day of their ONE YEAR probation and try as had as possible to keep wages well below industry standards. 

There are very few perks with working there, Bonus scheme is not bad but apart from that there is not supplied to staff to keep morale up, and as a result there is a huge turnover of staff across all departments. 

There is a general air of disrespect amongst many of the old guard and the idea of being PC is non existent there. If there was a HR department i would presume those would have been fired for it but as it stands the same sexist, borderline racist jokes are made on a regular basis"
