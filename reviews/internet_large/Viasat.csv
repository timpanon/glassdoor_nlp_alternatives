0,Viasat,Stay away.... not everything that glitters is gold.,2022-04-07,3.0,Quality Specialist,Company pushes a unicorn culture.,Nothing but Nepotism at this company... especially if you're a white male you are a part of the in crowd. Favoritism and Nepotism abounds. This company is the quintessential embodiment of a systemic racist institution. All complaints of racial harassment are swept under the rug and offenders recieve wrist slaps while the victim is shamed. Opportunities for advancement are given to cronies.
1,Viasat,"Pay is so good, but no training or structure to new hires in Software",2022-04-04,3.0,Software Engineer New Grad,"Pay is amazing for a new hire right out of school

Office is nice and food is good, although they make you pay for it.","401k is terrible. 50% match.(most decent tech companies do 100%match, yet these people do 50%)

No training structure or training at all for software roles. First few months I just came into work with no idea what i would be doing for the day besides meetings. Just had to act busy . Im happy with what I do now being here for a year and half but like i said first bit was rough without a training on how to code/test/projects/do things. I had to self teach everything to just keep up.

Unlim time off but never been able to use it without mgmt getting upset when I took time off."

I came across a job posting and decided not to apply, but a recruiter reached out. I thought why not give it a chance? Worse mistake ever. There is a culture of reprimanding people even though things are not communicated or expectations set. There is a lot of lip service to transforming the company but the people that have been there a long time will go out of their way to make sure that doesn't happen. Some leaders are in their roles because they have been at the company for a long time and not because they have the expertise to lead their functions. In my particular case leaders were often controlling and would not listen to any feedback even while they pretended to be open. Oh and they will make you track your time in ridiculous and minuscule ways even for divisions where it is not a need."

15,Viasat,Don't even bother to try working with HR,2022-03-17,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Decent place for an engineer overall. The work is interesting and there are smart people on the engineering teams. There are some ""us vs. them"" attitudes from people who have been with the company a long time. From what I hear it used to be much better 10+ years ago.","They are struggling like most companies which is no surprise with the supply chain issues. 

HR is the group to avoid here. From the beginning, it was about working around 
HR to get to talk with the hiring manager (I applied - did not hear back from anyone for a couple of weeks. I then reached out to a manager on LinkedIn who passed along my resume to the hiring manager who called me right away). After that, it was the hiring manager and the team that pushed to make things happen (not HR). Even after you're hired they seem to have no interest in being a part of your success or helping you unless there is something in it for them that makes them look good or if you are part of senior leadership. They definitely do not walk the talk."
16,Viasat,Runs like a start up without any of the perks of a start up,2022-03-17,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Viasat is a place where there is a lot of opportunity to do anything you want. If you have an interest, you can fit in and do almost anything. When you start out, its very exciting.","Unfortunately, Viasat is a place where everything you do thats above and beyond immediately (and retroactively) becomes part of your job. There are a VERY small number of people who get recognition for the hard work of a lot of people. It doesn't matter if you work 32hrs or 52hrs a week, the upper management will tell you that you must work harder. You can never grow because all growth is not career advancement and all hard work is rewarded with much more work. 

Also, compensation: small raises, tiny bonuses and 401k matched in stock (search VSAT, if you're curious about that last one)."

I'm not a racist and we as a company welcome anyone that has the qualifications.

Happened 3 times, 3 dropped promotions. Each time I asked when we would get more staff so that I could move on. First time: 3 months, Second time: a year, Third time: and least 2 years if things go smoothly. 

Lower tier agents are treated as inferior human beings. People are downright derogatory, and while M&D experiences much less of it than floor agents they themselves often turn around in their own seats to fight each other. While this makes the work place toxic, the real culprit is management. Teams are understaffed, overworked, and have to maintain mountains of SLAs and documentation at the same time."

65,Viasat,"A fantastic company to start, grow, and finish your career",2022-01-12,5.0,Senior Staff Engineer,"* Great work-life-balance. It's built-in to the culture to be accommodating. I never feel bad about taking time off, shifting work hours for my family, or taking wellness breaks. I rarely work more than 40h/week. If I end up working on a weekend, I usually work fewer hours during the week to balance the ledger. That said, I'm happy to put in extra hours in those rare times when it's really needed.
* Massive tech stack. You can do hardware, software, radio-frequency, enterprise, cloud, physics, government, and so much more. You will never run out of things to learn.
* Lots of autonomy. The culture does not encourage micromanagement, hierarchies, or rigidity. Our mantra is ""Do the right thing"".
* Constantly evolving. This company was started in the 80s by people who are still around. They have learned to continually adapt and evolve despite huge changes around them. This company isn't going anywhere, and keeps getting better the longer you're around.
* Upwards mobility for high-performers. If you're a star employee, the sky is the limit. If you just want to punch your timecard and chill, then expect your compensation and promotions to reflect that.","* The teams can sometimes feel like a bunch of small startups. This has benefits, but it also means that your experience could vary from team to team depending on who the managers and teammates are. Not all teams will be the right fit for you.
* Another mantra is something along the lines of ""Resilience in Ambiguity"". It means some of the answers you seek will not be available, and you'll need to make decisions, and take responsibility for them. This works well for some people, and not as well for others.
* There is a lack of transparency around compensation and titles. This is improving, but will take time.
* Viasat is a globally distributed business. This also means we operate in lots of timezones, and you sometimes have to work with people who are very far from you. You may need to be flexible about when you work if you're in this situation."

People are responsive to new ideas, executives make time to hear them, and most people you work with genuinely care.","The biggest problem is that people can use those same values of opacity and ambiguity against you. I was treated so cruelly by a recently-hired VP that HR intervened when they saw it (of their own volition) but they were powerless to act because there are no rules. The worst experience of my career, bar none. I resigned. Trust and discretion are laudable, but if you can't protect a high-performing, longstanding employee from mistreatment, you have a problem. Once you see how much damage a single bad hire can do at Viasat, you'll sour on this passion for ambiguity too. It's a shame but for that reason, I can't recommend it as a place to work. It's fun until you find out you have no recourse against a bad manager, and no one has your back."

If you’re ambitious and seek them out aggressively, they come pretty easy. If you’re hoping someone will give you a path for you to follow, you’ll be disappointed.

Viasat helps monetarily with certifications and gets you licenses for anything you can provide a business reason for so you can expand your skill set. If you ask for more challenging work and then do it well, you can use that to negotiate for a role change our promotion. Internal promotions are very common.


Good benefits. There is a gym, several snack bars and coffee lounges, plenty of networking opportunities, stock options, 401ks, all the insurance, elevate, lots of access to education and nice facilities. Some departments also did raffles and parties before the pandemic hit.

Compensation is fair, but I definitely recommend trying to negotiate for a higher salary  than offered. Be reasonable with this and do your research first. Sometimes they are legitimately offering the highest they are able to because of pre-determined and approved guidelines that are outside their control. The worst that happens is they say no anyway, but more often than that they will just ask why you deserve it. Have one good reason, and they'll either up the offer or get back to you after speaking with their boss.","Departments sometimes feel isolated from each other. This occasionally results in the right people not getting the memo and projects getting delayed due to missing information and misaligned priorities.

The higher l you go up the chain, the more time you should expect to dedicate to work. My best advice is to be very upfront about how many hours you are willing to work a week of you're salary. This will also help if you're worried about the ""and other responsibilities"" in a job description.

A layoff happened at the beginning of the pandemic that I'm sure affected a lot of people negatively. Most of those that were still there had to pick up additional work during the pandemic and multiple large projects."

You get unlimited sick time and they recently switched to an unlimited vacation policy as well. Pretty much every benefit under the sun (health, dental, vision, life insurance, short and long term disability, etc) for FREE if you are on the high deductible health plan. Throughout COVID employees have been working from home as much as is possible. At the end of my first year of working here, my salary is already 6% higher then where I started, partially from my annual performance review and partially from a “market based” adjustment (even though I was already making well over the average for the area from my research). Dress code is casual (depending on the office, shorts may even be common). No one will expect you to work excessive hours unless there is a very good reason, and even then only infrequently. I’ve had maybe 3 really hectic weeks where I worked significantly more than 40 hours since I started. Management is grateful for this extra effort rather than expecting it.","We always seem to be behind schedule and right down to the wire, to the point where I have occasionally had to work a late night or over the weekend to fix a bug that was discovered at the last minute during testing. Management is always very nice and grateful for extra effort in these situations, but it would be good if we didn’t end up in last minute panic situations."

Aside from the healthy culture, this good review comes mostly from the fact that, in 2020 when when all airline-centric revenue was hit hard and some competitors were undergoing large scale layoffs (%40+), Viasat cut the absolute minimum (%3 I think?) and even continued standard cost of living raises in 2020.

269,Viasat,The Music Died,2021-01-21,3.0,Software Engineer,"There's lots of good people at Viasat. It's an engineering led organization and there's lots of variety in the things that you can work. Nobody shames you for switching projects. Offices were very nice. Very remote friendly. Travel opportunities. Interesting products and industry. Good benefits package. Lots of young people. I love Carlsbad.

Work life balance is very good.","Viasat used to be my dream job. During COVID, that went away. While execs laid folks off they also took on big bonuses and gave remaining employees poor raises. Lots of brain drain occuring recently, especially with high performance individual contributors. Senior leadership is an out of touch old boys club.

There's two kind of employees at Viasat: the lifer and the new grad. Viasat does not tend to hire many middle career engineers from outside. That'd be far too expensive compared to a new grad or overseas. This means nobody is cross pollinated. It's the ""it's always been done this way"" or the highway.

The culture at Viasat is very plastic. P&C/HR will tell you what the culture is: ""fun, innovative, embrace ambiguity, etc."" In reality, the culture is one of chaos, an embrace of mediocrity, and under resourced. Often when a company boasts about there own culture like Viasat does, that's when you know it's manufactured. Truth be told it's not the worst culture of anywhere I've worked, but it's not the happy go lucky utopia HR/P&C says that it is. They'll brag about all the corporate development and leadership trainings that you can't do because you're too busy completing JIRA tickets.

Advancement and growth opportunities are foggy. Some managers are very good at sharing and helping you grow. Others not so much. Embrace ambiguity! Additionally, lots of internal politics on commerical side.

Pay is just average to below average. Don't expect to earn top dollar, even if you work hard enough to."

There is no real incentive to work hard or take up more responsibilities when you are not paid for what you do but paid for your years of experience.

335,Viasat,Execs Out of Touch,2020-08-28,1.0,Engineer,"Great low level and mid-level managers
Great Campus
Inclusive and communicative culture in some business units (not all)","I have been at Viasat for nearly 20 years. The company has changed tremendously over that time. In the early days it was like a family and the top execs were admired since they worked along side everyone else and appreciated personal sacrifices employees made for the company. This is no longer the case. The executives have lost touch. 

When COVID hit, they promptly laid-off or furloughed hundreds of people and announced a salary freeze. Everyone could understand the rationale given by the execs at the time. But then the annual report was published in early August and it showed they accepted huge bonuses, stock awards and salary increases in June, just two months after the lay-off. 

Every colleague I talked with is outraged to see how well they were taken care of while the rest of us were asked to sacrifice and some of our most respected colleagues were shown the door. To add to the frustration, they released a surprisingly good financial report for the April-June 2020 quarter, which is not consistent with the message they gave to justify the lay-offs.

Are companies across the country not being asked to do everything possible to keep their workforce employed during these tough times? Decisions by Viasat executives are clearly being made to maximize financial performance and increase their personal wealth. All execs could have taken a 50% bonus cut and kept a hundred or more Viasat family members employed for the remainder of the year while still earning multi-million dollar compensations. To them, cash clearly wins over compassion. 

Latest rumor is they are preparing for another lay-off and elimination or reduction of benefits to further optimize company financial performance. Why? Viasat is not in financial hardship. They are doing this while many projects are short staffed and managers are not allowed to hire and constantly pushed to be more productive with fewer people.

I am personally conflicted because my team and low to mid level supervisors are great. The attitude of the top execs is now flowing down so I am actively looking for other opportunities as are many of my colleagues."

Relationship with the company feels very personal, and there is definitely a feeling that you are here to do cool things, and in return you will be taken care of.
It really is a place where an idea can grow into a whole business - there is plenty of room for upward and lateral mobility. If it doesn't exist yet, start it. If it's a good idea, you'll get support. Definitely an open environment that encourages thinking differently and embracing the right thing, not just the easy thing.","Because it's such an open environment, it can take a while for people who don't fit the culture to eventually leave. 
Because the company has grown so much in the last few years, there are a lot of growing pains as we figure out and improve new processes.

During my tenure, I was treated fairly and given the opportunity to do what I needed to do to accomplish my job.  I was  directly led by a person that set a great leadership example (Thanks Jim E.)  And senior leadership really challenged our teams to be accountable problem solvers (Thanks Phil, Kevin, Todd, Marc).

During the Covid 19 Emergency the company communicated well and placed the employees at the forefront of their decision making.  Having been in the communications industry for nearly 25 years I was surprised that they did not move more swiftly to cut employees.  That is a credit to the senior leadership team.  

I would highly recommend Viasat for anybody seeking employment in a fast moving technical company that pushes the limit on what is possible.",Every company has cons...but honestly there is nothing out of the ordinary.  Tools and Enterprise Systems needs to be  a focus but they only suffered because Viasat is so aggressive launching technology that it sometimes becomes hard to make that part of the business a priority.  Viasat will need to solve that problem before the network becomes so expansive that it is too big of a problem to solve easily.  True to form...they are working on that and I expect they will solve this too.

They hire most engineers as FTEs which comes with great benefits, a nice office, and decent pay. On balance, most of the engineers here are extremely intelligent, yet willing to help and challenge you. Management gives you a LOT of freedom when it comes to both your schedule and deadlines, if you prove yourself as a harder worker. Unlimited sick days, and generous PTO. My immediate supervisors are both people I can turn to for help/advice, but also someone I enjoy talking to about non-work related topics. Overall, would recommend this place to anyone, and I am glad the laid-back San Diego culture Mark Dankberg has established out in Carlsbad, translates fairly well to their other locations. It is challenging and difficult work, but organized in a way that makes you feel accomplished.","A lot of the on-boarding programs for new employees, like matching you with a mentor to take you to lunch, are kind of useless because no one seems to follow through. HR makes an effort to identify who hasn't, but I feel like it requires throwing someone under the bus for something that should be a bit more casual. It is also a very young company on average, which is not bad, but management should make sure there are people of all experience levels on all teams."

The system in place seems to promote tolerance , education and growth of its employees, but reality is not at all.  Your ability to do well depends on your ability to schmooze. Company favors white males and veterans that move up the ranks through schmoozing. Simply look at who are in upper management, especially in engineering.  If you are a skilled engineer, looking to develop technically, this place is seriously lacking in engineering quality.

Essentially no stress on the job, it's all about building awesome stuff. You can even work extra hours earlier in the week to take off work later! In addition, it's very easy to work remote some days if you wish.

Every manager I knew was always super helpful, friendly, and encouraging.
 Everyone I worked with was genuinely funny, smart, and a blast to be with. 

The pay was pretty great, and interns get housing + a flat relocation bonus, which increases the further you are from the office you'll work in.  There were also a ton of awesome intern events, like jet skiing, movie nights, etc.

The campus at Carlsbad was super awesome and fun to be in. You're a very short drive away from the beach at all times!

There are dozens of company bikes you can use to go from one building to another. Free snacks and coffee everywhere. A fun outdoor area, including dart boards and a ping pong table among other things. A pretty dope slide.  And generally a very nice office space. I had my own office as an intern, although not everyone did. 

I also personally worked on a super fun and interesting Hololens project. 

It was a great time, I highly recommend a Viasat internship.","The lack of overall structure can make some projects much less efficient than they should be.  Also, intern 401K/the stock plan thing were laid out in a confusing manner, they were presented as if they were options when they really weren't.

491,Viasat,Outstanding Company - They truly care for their employees,2019-06-03,5.0,Systems Analyst,"1.  Open culture, little power distance between myself, my supervisor and even those above him.   Feel very comfortable contributing to the team and making suggestions.

2.  Very focused on work-life balance.   They truly live these values and care holistically about their employees.  I have been many other places, even healthcare, where it is spoken but not truly a part of the culture.  It is here.

3.  Outstanding work environment.  The campus is beautiful, the food in the cafeteria is good, great free coffee, they really take care of us so we can focus on our jobs.      This includes our physical surroundings.  They appreciate us introverts and provide us the quiet space we need to really perform.

4.  Dress code fits the jobs we do.   As an analyst, I have little contact with the 'outside world' so am allowed to dress in a comfortable way that is appropriate for my position.   It is about the work I do and the quality than how I look.

5.  Really interested in your long term goals.  They have an outstanding tuition reimbursement plan and take seriously where you would like to go in the future.   

6.  The flexibility of my work schedule.   It is not rigid hours where you need to be here at 8 am and not a minute over.   It allows me to structure my day around my family's needs as well as avoiding the traffic to get here.  

7.  Focused on Wellness.  You are encouraged to exercise and given the tools needed.  They have an outstanding benefits program coupled with a wellness effort that is available to all employees.  Once again, it is not just fancy slogans and 'talk', it really is part of the culture.  

8.   No useless, dreaded, bureaucratic performance reviews.   We have quarterly conversations with our manager which is much more useful than trying to sum up the entire year on a form then have a meeting that everyone dreads and hates.     

9.  It is a place where you can work hard, will be recognized and feel you can succeed.","1.  The commute can be rough.   They are very flexible in regards to working hours so I can come in earlier and leave earlier to help avoid the traffic.  

2.  Sometimes there can be too many meetings when it could have been communicated in other ways.      Hey, not every place is perfect, right?"

494,Viasat,"Challenging, Rewarding, and Enjoyable",2019-05-30,5.0,Project Engineer,"One of the biggest pros of working at Viasat is the excellence of the company's leadership. The senior and mid-level management of the company are all extremely sharp and talented individuals. They've led the company to become a technical leader in the industry while maintaining an unbeatable work environment that fosters innovation, rewards hard work, encourages diversity and inclusion, and allows a healthy work/life balance. 

The technical work is the second biggest pro. By constantly pushing the envelope of satellite technology and developing new communications technologies, there is a seemingly never-ending stream of challenging and interesting work. The company's success and growth opens up tons of opportunities for individual career growth for new and experienced employees.

The company clearly demonstrates that they care deeply for their employees. The benefits and compensation packages are very generous and competitive. The company encourages community involvement and green initiatives as well.","After well over a decade of work at Viasat, I honestly couldn't identify something I'd label as a 'con' of working here."

I started working here to move to California and to experience all the good experience that I heard about from other Viasat employees. I must say, I do not think that I will go to other companies. I know some people leave Viasat, but my heart is set for this company and probably going to stay here til I retire. 

Everyone has a room to grow their careers here and they will work with you if you feel that you need some training and experience for something that you want to try or never have done before.  Good experience with Viasat, I don't know how I got lucky with the company but I love it!!.","After my interview, I waited about 2 months to get a response and my offer letter from people and culture. I thought I didn't get it so I almost went with other company. 

Right now, we are trying to get a new person and we are losing good candidates to other companies because they could not wait any longer for an offer letter or a response from people and culture. however, Viasat is a growing company and I know people and culture could get overwhelmed with other tasks.

Pay can be a little tight to live in California if you are moving from a different state and you are used to a certain pay grades. Make a decision wisely with their offer when you know it is extremely expensive to even get an apartment in North County and pay a lot more taxes here in California. there are other locations for Viasat but especially relocating to Carlsbad, You have to make some changes in your lifestyle."

4. If you show passion and talent you can move up - internal promotions are common. Even if you're good at your job, if you want to change positions they care more about your career goals than your value in your current position.

An ergonomics team that makes sure your workspace fits your body's needs, stocking the kitchen with preferred drinks, feminine products in the restrooms, game rooms, clubs, gyms, discounts on entertainment, hotels, theme parks and more, education reimbursement...the list is too long for this review.","1.

Viasat is THE fit!  I have been able  to make pre-school holiday parties, work from home when my little one is sick, OR step away for the day if some extra care is needed.  The culture brought me to Viasat and the culture is a HUGE piece of me staying here at Viasat.  It, in turn, makes me want to work harder for the company because of its work/life balance it provides.","No company is perfect.  Although the pros keep me at Viasat, it was an adjustment coming in and learning the culture of a flat structured company with no strict processes.  They have made several adjustments since I have joined that has made it easier.  This is by NO means a deal breaker for me.  I take the relaxed atmosphere and have learned to strive in the ambiguous environment, it is just not for everyone."

Viasat wants employees to have a good work-life balance, but when the ""work"" part of the work-life balance is so negative, it puts a dapper on the work-life balance.  Viasat wants employees to have a good quality of life, too.  Again, quality of life could - and would - be much better if the workplace was not so toxic.  The health insurance benefits are very good.  The wellness center onsite in Carlsbad is a great benefit for employees in Carlsbad.  The partnership with Crunch Fitness is a great benefit for employees in Carlsbad, too.  Viasat is doing great, meaningful work.  Viasat is literally connecting the world and providing service and opportunities to those who would otherwise not have access to the internet, etc.","I am honestly not even sure where to begin.  The CEO hosted an All-Hands recently, and while it's always nice to see him talk, he has requested that employees reach out to their Managers or their HR Business Partners if they're not happy.  He mentioned that if they've done both of these things with no success, that they should reach out to the Executive VP of People and Culture herself.  And if that doesn't work, you can go to him directly.  So, what do you do when you've raised issues to your Manager, your HR Business Partner, the Executive VP of People and Culture, and you know that the same issues have already been raised to Executives, including the CEO, too?  The fox is guarding the hen house here.  Speak up, so that you can be black listed.  If you want change, change jobs.  If you want to move up in your career, be a ""yes woman"" or a ""yes man,"" and turn a blind eye to all of the toxicity within the company."

This is the worst group I have ever worked in. Can’t even really call it a team since leadership is big on people completing (in a negative way) against each other. 

HR/TA Leadership has put people into manager and director positions that absolutely should not be leaders in any way. The result is managers and directors that are terrible listeners, poor communicators, huge on throwing people under the bus, in it only for themselves, insecure, indecisive, manipulative and back-stabbing.

Substandard designs. Won't spend money on anything to improve design or throughput. Cashflow negative. Health plan sucks. Ask for but dismiss ideas for improvement. Production items are basically barely functional prototypes. Engineers and technicians expected to do the work of managers. Managers sit in unproductive meetings all day and are blind to the issues with products and processes. Zero configuration control and document control. Basically a garage operation with unrealistic/unobtainable goals with the existing products and processes. Executive leadership lives in some fantasy utopia but has no clue as to what is happening. Much needed equipment as low as $40 requires 8 different managers to all buy off. Marginal designs with hundreds of deviations written to get it out the door without ever incorporating design changes to address design flaws. You will be given fake or inactive charge numbers so PMs dont have to spend money. Overall staff that accomplishes anything is totally burned out. Corporate structure is completely top heavy producing zero results.

If you are not part of the old buddies network you are doomed and set to fail. The management allows bullying of minorities with no consequence to the senior managers that do it. This is done in violation of all federal laws and in a company that swindles the US government in their contracts.

Thankfully i saved my emails because I will be filing a lawsuit against this company for discrimination, retaliation and other damages. The management there is terrible, unqualified, and remind me of the e4 mafia in the military even though the e4 mafia has been banned and this is also nor the military.

635,Viasat,Love a challenge and a career - over a decade in ViaSat's People and Culture Team.,2018-05-03,5.0,P&C Team Member,"I have worked under the most strategic, progressive and approachable P&C leader my entire career here at Viasat. Under her leadership, have developed my career into a business savvy, seat at the table, analytical, influencing business partner. Opportunities to grow by working without a master policy book but looked to make judgement decisions, backed by analysis, collaboration with peers and stakeholders and being confident to get up if I scrap my knees on a wrong decision to try again tomorrow. No challenge to hard for this P&C team member as I am backed by my team and the P&C leaders to make decisions and learn from them.

Partnership with TA team thriving with P&C Business Partners and we continue to bring in exceptional, diverse talent. Our TA team is extremely hard working, smart, dedicated and really fun to work with.",No cons from me. Viasat is thriving and our leaders are focused on the right objectives. Continue to wake up every day excited to come to Viasat!
636,Viasat,"People don't leave jobs, they leave managers.",2018-05-02,2.0,Recruiter,"The benefits package is great and I paid between $20-$40 co-pays for medical appointments. There is an onsite Wellness Clinic located at the Carlsbad campus and this was a wonderful resource. The flex time is also good and allows for employees to choose their own work hours. While the company allows employees to work from home, there is no clearly defined policy therefore it’s up to manager’s discretion, ahem, favorites.","Hiring manager satisfaction is low and this is evident by observing the relationship between the technical business areas and the People and Culture department. The People and Culture department is very political and drama filled. Management promotes a hostile work environment that fuels the high turnover rate, especially within the University Recruiting group. I’ve never seen such high senior leadership turnover within a corporate Talent Acquisition department! Why is Viasat unable to keep a TA leader for more than 6 months? 

There is a lack of accessible, accurate and meaningful TA metrics. Constant complaints about the speed and quality of hiring efforts are correct. At Viasat, nepotism is a flagrant problem that disrupts workplace satisfaction and results in unsavory recruiting practices. This nepotistic hiring practice doesn’t ensure a well-rounded program of the BEST candidates, it ensures that kids get to work with their parents over the summer. Several times, I was directed by management to hire a candidate who was not qualified for the role, purely because he/she was a relative of senior leadership. There is very little LGBT or minority representation within the intern program. This should be a huge red flag to potential candidates, as well as senior management. 

My time at Viasat was disappointing due to the lack of career development and growth. There are no formal training programs during onboarding and orientation. TA is plagued with outdated and non-existent technology for attracting, managing and selecting candidates. 

 It’s a sink or swim environment that prides itself on tolerating ambiguity, but without policies and procedures, the company commits unfair hiring practices. I’m not sure the recruiting department would survive an audit."

The company has some nice perks like parties and gym and onsite health center.,The team that is supposed to shape the company culture is so corrupt and fueled by favoritism. They say they encourage people's questions and opinions but the second you question anything then you have a target on your back. We've seen it happen. People have been fired and pushed out so since we have no way at work to voice our concerns then at least Glassdoor can give us that say.

641,Viasat,Shareholder,2018-04-12,3.0,Current Shareholder,"Working with Brilliant People (except for ""blind spot"" described below)","As an employee, shareholder and a staunch supporter of Viasat, I’m writing this Glassdoor review in hopes of highlighting a “blind spot” that needs immediate attention.

Viasat owes its success to the brilliant people that continually push the envelope and create innovative solutions to solve tough problems.   The company culture of fearless innovation can only thrive when people are encouraged to bring their best ideas forward.   Viasat has been building the infrastructure and leadership team to allow for exponential scaling up, but has chosen to ignore a critical business function, HR.

The HR Sr. Leadership  has risen well above the level of competence and threatens the very culture of the company that they have been entrusted to foster.   With a team of approximately 100 people,  HR is responsible for the highest turnover in the company.  The  self-serving management style is MANAGEMENT BY FEAR with no accountability, no goals and no process or business standards.  Due to ineptness, anyone that has an opinion is pushed aside, ridiculed, coerced into leaving or eventually fired.  HR engages in dishonest, illegal tactics, to hide behind the fact that the top HR Leadership is grossly incompetent.  Actions are taking a toll on the business and threaten Viasat’s future ability to scale up and succeed.   

One has to ask, why does Viasat allow this to continue?"
642,Viasat,"Interesting projects advertised, but most work is on decades-old defense contracts",2018-04-05,2.0,Engineer,"Free snacks

A lot of nice (but very mediocre) people.

Boring projects.

Which team you're on is highly dependent on your personal relationship with upper management.

Advertises flexible hours but the company is cutting down on Work From Home. You will frequently be expected to work long hours.

This is ultimately a government contractor and most of the work you'll be doing is boring. Their premier product for the government has been around for decades. 

Expect to get moved to different teams based on the politics in upper management. There are some exciting opportunities, but by and large you need to be friends with someone in management to get on them.

Some teams are very toxic and unpleasant."
643,Viasat,Wonderful company and amazing team,2018-04-03,5.0,IT Project Manager,"ViaSat is an incredible company and it’s an honor to be a part of such a capable and driven team. Everyone is extremely capable and the culture is one of innovation and challenging existing paradigms. 

My experience has been wonderful every step of the way and this began with the wonderful support I received from Ardella Wade, the Talent Acquisition Recruiter I worked with. Ardella was extremely knowledgeable and helped highlight all of the great things that ViaSat has to offer in addition to helping me out at every step of the recruitment and onboarding process. She really helped me to successfully transition into this new role and has been here to support me ever since. 

My team is comprised of very experienced engineers and my manager is extremely knowledgeable. We are always on task and I’ve taken on my new role very successfully. The whole of the company is very knowledgeable in Agile and Scrum methodology and it’s refreshing to be a part of a team that knows true Agile as opposed to a bastardized versions of it. 

Another great aspect of working at ViaSat is the work/life balance. The company is all about wellness as well as giving back to the community. We have numerous fitness and wellness challenges as well as a wonderful fitness facility which the company pays for in addition to providing other benefits, for employees that participate, making for a very healthy and happy work environment. 

If you’re driven and great at what you do, then ViaSat is a great place to work!",There aren’t too many cons I can think of. The only con that comes to mind is that the hiring process itself can be a bit lengthy being that the company doesn’t rush to hire anyone without the proper vetting which in the big picture is also a great thing!

645,Viasat,Much better than it used to be,2018-03-23,5.0,Software Engineer,"I was originally pretty dissatisfied with my experience at Viasat. I felt like I wasn't being listened to, I was being forgotten by my manager, and it felt like things couldn't get better.

I managed to orchestrate transferring to another department and things are MUCH better now. A big part of that was a change in supervisor, but I also think that things company-wide have generally gotten better over the last couple of years.

Communication with management is good, we've started to adopt better development practices, and I feel like I have a voice in my own career. I'm getting the ability to shape my path into what I want to do, and I'm getting support from my supervisor the whole way. I just wish it took less than 15 months for me to start feeling that way.","Things are still pretty scatterbrained. I'm not sure why we pride ourselves on our ""ability to tolerate ambiguity""; if we just sat down and properly engineered things from the beginning we wouldn't do so much monkey patching.

HR is also perennially a mess, especially our recruiting outfit; turnover is extremely high and it makes following up on candidates difficult."

Engineers are typically highly experienced and provide a wealth of information. Opportunity is available to those who are willing to step up and extend themselves beyond their comfort zone. The company will reward employees who go above and beyond their already well-compensated role.,"Viasat uses a flat org chart in lieu of a more structured hierarchy to promote more individual contribution, but that makes it hard to find out who is really in charge of a particular project/program. Being a government contractor forces a onerous time card system which creates nightmares on how to bill to which program, even if you aren't working on a government program. Sometimes programs that go off the rails put very demanding expectations on overtime that goes for more than a few weeks at a time."

Down to earth, wonderful, family focused good folks.","Transitioning from a ""Fearless Grounded Inspired  Resourceful"" band of start-up minded team players and  take on the worlders to a big Bureaucracy has been very challenging.  I know it's not easy.
Everything I have ever read on management says that people don't leave jobs, they leave managers.     
We're no longer flat, agile, nimble, real.  We're wasteful and frustrating.
The fear of spending too much money or doing something wrong has created layers of very costly layers to provide adult supervision constantly for things we used to just go do.   Can't be cost effective.  Impossible.  
There are layers of huge problems of folks that cause problems, and won't lift a finger to fix or alleviate them.
The ""D Suite"" (layer) gets a D.
I read once that 
""companies will whip you like an egg white with one hand,
and offer you a Stress Seminar with the other""

This can't be unique to this company.
But the old song we keep hearing is that such is inevitable when companies get bigger.   
One of the worst things anyone could or should ever say, is that's things are inevitable.  So is failure when that status quo mindset is adopted."

They are penny wise and pound foolish in this area.

704,Viasat,The difference is in location,2017-06-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Not much for Atlanta location.,"After many months of keeping an eye on the reviews posted for this company, it's interesting to me the pattern of reviews when taken in context of location.  There's a lot of very positive reviews out there but when you look at where the majority of those reviews come from, they come from employees who work at the mother-ship in Carlsbad (i.e. San Diego).  On the other hand, there's very few reviews, much less positive reviews, from employees based in Atlanta.  One could argue that this is simply a matter of numbers....many more employees in California than Georgia; however, I think not.  

There's definitely a trend that's been established with regards to employee satisfaction in Atlanta.  Is it fear that's causing few people to review them or is it something else?  And those that do review, generally don't have nearly the praise and admiration as those in other locations.  You just have to ask yourself....what's going on there?"

I think some of the other departments, like recruiting, are understaffed."
789,Viasat,Big company and getting bigger......with all the benefits and trappings,2016-05-02,3.0,,"First off, I have to say that my overall experience working for ViaSat was positive.  I gained a ton of experience and new skills.  I was generally well-treated.  When I made a mistake, they let me know about it but gave me the opportunity to learn from it and become a better employee.  It's really a great place to work if you're the right type of person and you can continually validate your importance and value to the company.

Excellent pay.....on par with peers in California mother-ship.
Casual work environment with mostly great people (there's always a few that don't play well).
Flexible work schedule as long as you get your work done.
Room for advancement IF you're the right type of person.
Technically challenging work.....not your typical product or challenges.
Probably some of the best benefits in the country (again a byproduct of being a California-based company).
It's truly a great company and you can succeed there if you are good at ""playing the game"".","These are just a few things I've noticed over the years. I truly don't mean to come off as a disgruntled former employee.  These are just things that someone considering this company should know about upfront and be able to wrap their heads around.  These cons are probably no different than any other company of equal size so please don't think I'm picking on this organization unduly.

As the title says, it's a big company that's getting bigger...and with that all the political and bureaucratic trappings that go along with it.  It's getting harder and harder to feel like you accomplish anything there due to all the procedures, processes  and politics that seem to be a requirement in a large company.  

As with any company this size, there's office politics involved.  If you're an engineer, you're especially susceptible.  If you want to stay technical and not move into any kind of management, you'll eventually be shown the door simply due to the fact that as your salary grows, so does the bulls-eye on your back when cost-cutting is necessitated.  

If you're a young person especially straight out of school, you're golden because they can mold you and convert you to their way of thinking more easily; but more importantly, you're cheap.  If you're an experienced person, you better be an expert or guru in something in order to be valued.  Even then, you're longevity is not guaranteed.  They don't think twice about letting someone go who has 35+ years with the company and still contribute.  I've seen it done on more than one occasion.  They definitely would rather take on more risk with younger, cheaper personnel than less risk with older, more experienced personnel.

If you're someone who doesn't ""play the game"" of politics well, isn't good at managing up the food chain as well as down, truly tries to do the right thing but has the propensity to be perceived as a ""pot stirrer"", speaks his/her mind without regard to political perceptions (even if you're right), then this is NOT the place for you.

At least in some disciplines, they do tend to design by the seat of their pants, putting only the minimal amount of engineering diligence into product design as they can.  This is great for the financials and anyone can understand that but it leaves the product open to failure and liability. 

Management in general seems to always say all the right things in a public environment but behind closed doors, it is perceived to be a different story.  One of the latest mantras was ""It's OK to fail but fail quickly and move on"".  Everyone had a really hard time believing that because too many times a failure led to a reassignment, downgrade or outright termination."

I've been with ViaSat for over 10 years now and I've never gotten bored. Frustrated? Sure...but what sets this place a part from other companies is that you can actually influence change. So if something is frustrating you can speak up and have a say in shaping the environment. The benefits are excellent. The opportunities to learn are great. The culture is work hard and play hard. The people are fantastic. If you are driven and want the opportunity to chart your own course this is the place for you.

The department I work in does promote from within and opportunities are available on a fairly consistent basis.  They have changed key points of management and restructured the organization.  Initially there was some confusion related to these changes but it actually appears to be working.  Work life balance is significantly better than it had been.  My peer group is improving as management really focuses on hiring great talent.  Team members are also staying longer.  I received very fair raises in the last few years that made me feel like I was being recognized for my contributions.  I am encouraged to pursue training opportunities and provided chances to participate.,Tools and applications are the biggest problem.  There are so many and they are not really supported.

Benefits are great but at a big cost to the compensation. Very innovative and moving forward in the industry, starting to get name-brand recognition. If you live in North County (San Diego), it is a great tech company to start out at.","Simply put, the pay. I have been offered several jobs that match my work load and responsibilities by competitors, and they ALL beat my current salary. ViaSat Compensation team says they analyze their pay versus other companies and positions in similar industries, but it seems as if they don't. They pay new-hires in the same positions much more money than people that have been there for years, and it has nothing to do with experience or education. They don't seem to value loyalty when it comes to compensation. If you are a new-grad looking for a company to work for, this is it. If you have been working there for 5+ years and find the raises (despite fantastic peer and manager reviews) to be mediocre, take another offer. It's unfortunate, as they are losing people to other companies strictly for pay reasons, and that is a WEALTH of knowledge and experience that is leaving the company."

The benefits are great and it is acceptable to surf, bike, or train for your upcoming ironman nearly anytime.","This might be harsh but I saw it repeatedly, as a DOD contractor the company has a very relaxed attitude and lacks empathy in certain circumstances to its customers. A very California mindset in the culture, which isn't ideal in some defense circumstances. There is also a common problem where at some level services are promised in unrealistic time frames, so the teams that interact with the customer are setup to fail. There is also a lack of product information so it is a culture with a lot of tribal knowledge and people can be on their own searching for answers. No extra compensation will be provided for trips and travel. Bonuses are never given out at mid to lower levels. I suppose it could be the company grew too fast too soon to scale well."

Poor compensation, bonuses are rarely given to anyone and are so small that they are insulting to the few that receive them. Bad inter-office relationships. Carlsbad thinks that Denver is incompetent and Denver thinks Carlsbad doesn't know how to run a service based business. Denver has a history of massive internal power struggles. Especially within the Tech Ops and Engineering divisions. They will put you on ten projects at the same time and expect you to work until you drop dead. Upper managment believes in a carrot on a stick philosophy. They will make you promises behind closed doors that they never intend to keep just so they can exploit you a little longer. HR is incompetent and doesn't understand how the rest of the industry determines market compensation. No room for career advancement. Whatever job you are hired on for is likely what you'll be stuck doing there for several years. Good luck if you're thinking about working for ViaSat in Colorado, you'll need it."

The benefits were mediocre, but they did offer extra perks like  massages and yoga that you could pay extra for, and a fitness facility. The Carlsbad facility is much nicer than Denver, and the people who work in Carlsbad seem to have a better work life balance.","There was a lot of politics around getting work done with other departments. As a developer, I was constantly being overworked and underpaid, even though Viasat said that my rate as a developer was average. As a developer, there was very little opportunity to move up in the company and a lack of written requirements caused a lot of excess development time. 

If you work for the company, you will have to speak up so you do not get taken advantage of as a developer. You can easily work long hours with very little appreciation for your work. It is important to stay firm on on call pay, because if you do not mention it, in some departments they will not pay you and expect you to be on call constantly.

If you try to transfer into another department and negotiate a higher salary, they will withdraw their offer and you will be stuck in your current department. Also they try to convert you to salary so that they can take away 5 extra days of paid time off and no longer pay you overtime. HR and management do not look after their employees and are more worried about their budgets and how much work they can get from each person."

The Denver office touts that it is work/life balance-friendly, but it's actually not at all. Pay is mediocre, and long hours are expected of salaried employees at all levels. Toxic managers are held onto tightly if they've 1) been there a long time (particularly former Wild Blue employees) & 2) understand the very complex, proprietary infrastructure. It seems such managers are above being let go no matter how business-inappropriate their actions and words are. HR is a complete joke - don't go there with any issues you'd like to actually get resolved. The culture is HIGHLY meeting-centric, so there's little time to do one's actual work unless s/he works the previously referenced long hours. Upper management in Denver wants to be worshipped (no exaggeration). Gossip that hurts the functionality of the Company abounds and isn't discouraged by management. The network is held together with bubblegum and duct tape. (The engineers are very smart and talented. They've just been handed a huge mess to try to manage, so the lack of network integrity isn't their fault.) There are only a select few who understand the overall architecture, and that knowledge tends to be hoarded. Such knowledge definitely isn't shared in a way that's accessible and understandable to new employees, no matter how technical they already are coming in the door."

Also, upward mobility is limited. It seemed like nobody left, so you're stuck waiting for someone to retire or be promoted (rare) before you have an opportunity to move up.

Salary is just average for this type of company in California; beware if you are single.

The company invests quite a bit in continuing education & development opportunities, including tuition reimbursement programs and sponsorships for advanced degrees.  The culture is very open and collaborative.  This company is full of really really smart, good people.","As the company grows and our programs become more large and complex, the average time between reassignments becomes longer.  It used to be that a program would last 6 months, or a ""long"" program was a couple years.  So one could reasonably find themselves with opportunities to switch between programs or even business units relatively regularly, if they wanted to.

People are friendly, and the Carlsbad campus is very nice.  If you're on the right project and are a meaningful contributor, you'll be recognized and typically be given interesting and challenging work.  Lots of smart people to learn from.  Most employees are very happy.  If you're self-motivated, intelligent, and friendly, you'll probably do well at ViaSat.","Some projects are understaffed and weekends can be necessary to get the work done on time.  Schedules can be unreasonable as projects are often won by promising unrealistic short schedules to the customer.  If you're not a self-starter, you may get lost in the noise.

937,Viasat,"Great company, with continued growth and success!",2013-02-20,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"It is a very casual work environment, which can be an adjustment for anyone coming from a ‘stuffy’ corporate setting. Staff are very pleasant and the overall culture of the company is easy going and fun; kind of like a college campus. The company invests a lot into their employees, spending money to keep them happy but also let them know they are appreciated. The pay is pretty good in comparison to other companies in the industry in the San Diego area. Location is ideal, and onsite amenities are excellent. Very smart people employed at ViaSat, but you never get the feeling any one is pretentious or too good for anyone else; employees really do help each other out. Certainly can get busy, but that is a pro in my book as it means days are never boring, challenges are always present and opportunities to learn are available. Additionally, it’s very exciting to know that ViaSat is expanding rapidly and obtaining several very good contracts….there is a sense of security in the company’s longevity as they continue to grow!","Some of their processes can be a bit convoluted when they don’t need to be. There isn’t usually a formal training process, essentially you learn on the fly and I found things that were never shown to me after several weeks of working there, plus depending on who you speak to there is a difference of opinion on how to do things. With most companies that are growing, there can be lots of change and adjustments. Occasionally, there is some ‘gossiping’, it never gets out of hand, but employees have a round-about way of reporting their grievances or issues. Leadership is not as visible and seem to blend into the mix, which can be good or bad depending on your preference. It may have been due to lack of internal talent, but there never seemed to be much internal movement. They are literally bursting at the seams, so times can seem chaotic, but if you can roll with the punches, eventually things will settle down."

-On the whole the people are nice to work with and pretty laid back","-Very understaffed and lots of overtime involved.
-The salary isn't competitive enough for software developers
-If you're a software person, this is not the place for you.  You won't get to work on the cutting edge software/technology like other companies in the bay.   What I found is that the people who rise in this company have EE/DSP/Digital Communications backgrounds and they get to work on the exciting stuff.  Software developers are treated like a commodity here (aka seen as code monkeys).
-There's really no room to grow here, the company values seniority over everything else.
-Compensation increases are the same across the board, whether you worked hard or not.
-Most of the people at the top don't do much at all (Engineering Director and up level), it's all political.
-Most people are bored with their work."
944,Viasat,"Pockets of technical competancy, Understaffed, with consitently unrealistic scheduling. Abusive middle management",2012-09-20,2.0,Senior Electrical Engineer,"The company is founded by engineers, so in pricniple is an engineering oriented organization. Engineers actually have their won offices and are not relegated to cubicles.  Reasonably good benefits if you can hang in there.There are pockets of excellence in the company that can make the work challenging and rewarding, however it is highly dependant on the group you are associated with.","Many groups are highly political and not open to oustsiders or innovative design approaches. Many extrapolate the success of a handful of organizations and a handful of individuals (e.g the launch of ViaSat's own satellite) to support the  belief they are ALL the best and the brightest. Much of the design work I saw was journeyman at best and much of the hardware is based on archaic discrete level design..... cheap and many times effective, but nothing to write home about. Projects are either understaffed or so aggessively scheduled, that the engineering and support staff are expected to make it happen on their own time. Many engineers love their work, so passively submit to this routine, predatory as it is, especially in a tight economy where many live in fear of losing their jobs. This situation takes unfair advantage of the engineer at the very least. The IEEE could learn a few lessons from the AMA in this regard.
There is a level of arrogance in the company that is pervasive and counter productive.The arrogance manisfests itself with abusive. ego driven interactions between engineers and an unhealthy lack of cooperation between groups, particularly in different geographic locations, based on an attitude that their particular group is the only one with any brains or competance. My experience with the RF organization in particular is that they are at least 10 years out of date with much of their analysis capabilites, still relying on spreasheets to simulate applications that need more advanced system and hardware analysis. In the Carlsbad facility, they have have not yet begun to understand or appreciate the need for EM simulations for their RF hardware, or advanced Systems spurious analysis where their outdated spreasheets barely scratch the surface. Several of the key middle management are no more than bullies who remain largely and blissfully uninformed or misinformed.  I am aware of several engineers who left the organization based on the aggressive and abusive behavior of  one manager in particular."

As a result things get released to customers less than fully baked.  Luckily Viasat has good lawyers.

Viasat also has a tendency to replace groups of people instead of taking the time to figure out who is valuable and who isn't."
953,Viasat,Excellent Place to work,2011-10-27,4.0,Software Engineer,The culture and environment at ViaSat are geared towards making the employee happy and willing to excel with new opportunities and positions. They are willing to move people from one position to another if they think that the new position will be a good fit.,Sometimes the management does not see the individual work being done and can overlook competent people. There is a culture of long hours on many projects and a common 'work more to finish it on time' attitude. This can burn people out.
954,Viasat,Not recommended for RF engineers looking for career growth,2011-10-23,2.0,RF Engineer,"The company does not layoff its engineers often, and offers many positions with low levels of responsibility for those looking to coast. The fear of layoffs within the company is often out of proportion.

The 401K matches up to 10%, and annual salary raises are provided between 5% and 10%.

A free gym membership is offered to the gym next door.

The location in Carlsbad, CA is a 10 minute drive to the beach and offers all the fringe benefits of Southern California weather.","For an RF engineer, Viasat offers little skill development and technical growth in the field. The work consists of chain analysis via excel spreadsheets, PWA layout, RF testing, and working with production. The RF testing is the largest portion, with the majority of the time spent in a lab doing RF Tech level testing (eg measuring RF parameters across multiple samples using spectrum analyzers, network analyzers, etc). For a design engineer, this work isn't appropriate and doesn't develop skills in creativity and analysis inherent in RF design.

There is almost no work with critical RF simulation tools such as ADS, Momentum, HFSS, etc:

Ansoft Designer is used for lumped filter analysis, however this work doesn't develop any useful simulation skills. Simulation is never taken seriously because none of the models are accurate.

Skills in design aren't developed among its junior RF engineers: 

The framework consists of a handful of senior RF engineers (+10 years) who primarily do a design such as a transceiver chain using excel, then pass the PWAs for testing to the junior engineers. The junior engineers then debug issues (usually involving a schematic error) and make measurements across multiple samples to support the design. The designs use off the shelf components  for 1 - 2 GHz transceivers , with the analysis and component selection typically rehashed.

Management has serious flaws at ViaSat:

The managers are picked by seniority over ability to manage the project and its engineers. This results in managers who do not handle the project and its engineers with dexterity, but rather go to war with forcing them to meet unrealistic deadlines. ViaSat wins its contracts by underbidding the competition with an unrealistic schedule, then puts aggressive managers who can push the RF engineers to work long hours. On a prototype project, expect to work 12 hour days taking measurements over several months.

I'll close with an RF engineer I worked with recently. In order to meet the project deadlines, he would leave work before his kids woke up, and arrive after they'd gone to bed. He consistently worked 12 hour days in the lab doing testing and tuning, developing no new skills but rather working to keep his job. This is not atypical at Viasat. If you plan to interview here, dig deep with questions to the lower level RF engineers to find out the full story."

956,Viasat,Rewarding,2011-09-05,5.0,,The flat hierarchy is good at minimizing politics. The company is also very engineering oriented which is nice coming from companies where Sales drove all.,The lack of an org chart can make it confusing on where issues should be escalated.
