5,Vrbo,Advancement within the company is near impossible,2022-02-02,1.0,Customer Service Representative,"Travel/Wellness Reimbursement, Paid time off.","When I applied for the position I was told I would be doing basic customer service role expectations. During my orientation that changed and I was told I would be advancing to a Tier 3 position within the company which had my training class very excited but the catch was we would have to go through training, after our ramp up period we would interview with departments of our choosing and then accept an offer within a few weeks. 

Weeks turned into about 6 months with no update in sight and 2 new hiring classes. I was informed by recruiting decision making of advancement would be delayed due to the brand new hire classes so everyone gets a fair shot of advancement. Upon my investigation we were not told we would also be competing with external applicants for new roles as well. 

Communication is not great, you don’t feel supported and it feels very micromanaging and toxic culture. 

If you apply, keep in mind it can take months or years before advancement or not at all."

However, based on my experience, if I owned a house I wouldn't hesitate to list my property with the company.","In my opinion, I think there are a few updates that can be done to make advertising easier for some people.

If you can stomach the mind numbingly boring work, then the insurance is great, as well as a lot of PTO/Sick time - trust me, you'll want to use it ;)","When you're hired, leadership likes to wrap up Vrbo in this cute little travel startup packaging, and how everyone is one big family singing kumbaya. You quickly find out that you are part of a large corporation (Expedia), and they do not care about your feelings about your job, policy, or frankly anything. They only care about you hitting your metrics, and you constantly feel like you will be replaced by an outsourced call center who they pay fractions less. 

The pay, at least for Customer Service, is very low, and raises are practically non existent. After leading my team in metrics for a whole year, I was offered a raise of 18 cents an hour. Yes, 18 cents an hour. The only hope you have of any sort of movement in the company is applying to new roles, which are very limited, and those promotions are not even performance based. On top of that, it takes MONTHS to hear back from anyone, regardless of if you get the job or not. 

How to sum it up? This place is a dumpster fire - which is a shame because it sounds like before Expedia ruined everything, it was actually a great place to work."

 -We have gone through 3 company re-orgs  in the past 2 years.
- All the best engineering talent has left due to company instability, corporate red tape, and constant changes.
- Women representation in the engineer department is sad and women aren’t promoted as quickly as male peers. 
- There are inexperienced managers who aren’t given training before giving them leadership roles.
- Soo many silos. 
- Due to covid the company is tight on funds and not adequately taking care of the employees they do have left. No pay increases and limited promotions will not help retain talent who have dedicated their lives to this company during a pandemic."

While there are good people in both divisions, the culture and work expectations are different depending on where you work. Besides the ""pro"" of some good people you'll be working with, the compensation is competitive with other technology companies.","The company shift since the Expedia acquisition is to be expected, but there is a misalignment of objectives between Distribution and Software that leads to missed expectations and uncertainty. The Software org is silo'd and senior leadership struggles, which negatively impacts the teams. With the layoffs, particularly the latest round aimed at long-term knowledgeable employees not in Austin, morale is low in Austin, Seattle, and Sydney. The uncertainty and lack of alignment is increasing, and staff don't feel confident about the level of transparency from senior management. The focus on Escapia Software customer service, especially, seems to be shifting to other company concerns, which distresses staff who are very committed to the software customers."

The dev team was slow to respond to the broken code and left everyone else to find ways around the broken code."
104,Vrbo,Extremely Toxic Workplace,2020-06-03,1.0,Creative,"I’d say free coffee, but that’s setting the bar pretty low. Then again, Vrbo loves a low bar.","There’s no path, no plan, no leadership, and soap opera-level drama is around every corner. Trust is absent amongst leaders and coworkers. Zero accountability. People who should be promoted aren’t, and people who are promoted; well, it’s just surprising that they were ever hired in the first place. Inept can’t begin to describe leadership, and I don’t just mean the C-Suite. 

Expedia is a soulless company. I was hired when HomeAway was solo and before VRBO was made into a pretend word called Vrbo. HomeAway was also directionless, but it was a happier place with happier people who were also smart and not predisposed to mind games and unethical behavior.

Most of the money you make, will go into the hands of a great therapist. 

If you find yourself there, trust no one. Especially your boss."

Wonderful group of people with a fun and hard work attitude,The company has lost its way since being acquired. Needs to get back to basics and focus on the customer.
107,Vrbo,"Used to be great, ruined by parent company",2020-05-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are a couple very smart people that work at Vrbo. If you’re lucky you’ll get to work with them. But most of then have left already. The budgets are pretty big so you do get to work on some fun stuff— if you’re on the right team. But none of the pros matter because of the cons.,"Expedia. Expedia is the nightmare conglomerate you hear horror stories about. Completely directionless, tons and tons of layers of middle managers who only gum up the works and prevent any real progress from being made. The worst manager I’ve ever worked with got promoted to director for doing “favors.” RUN AWAY! Do not take this job. I’ve had a lot of managers in my career, and she was by far the worst. Perfectly emblematic of Expedia— all talk, no game, no plan, no talent, no actual work. And right before layoffs she was given a director role, but didn’t Direct anything. Directors by definition there are supposed to manage managers, but she didn’t. Bad at her job, constant failures, no leadership ability, petty, doesn’t even meet the baseline criteria and gets promoted. Sure. We all knew it was backroom (or back pages) deals.

Similarly almost the entire security team at Expedia has left. Most of them should have because they were awful. Some of them found better jobs. Tons of executive turnover too, because none of them can pull their heads out of their assess. DO NOT take any job on the security or compliance(GRC) teams unless you want a huge black mark on your career when they inevitably (AGAIN!) have a breach. 

There is a guy working there that is supposed to be based in an office in SF, so they pay him SF rates, but he lives full time in ROUND ROCK, TEXAS. And also never does anything. So he makes $300k and literally doesn’t do anything. Hasn’t accomplished a single goal. So who’s more inept? Him or the people who haven’t figured it out and fired him yet? 

Basically anyone who still works at Expedia or any company owned by them (which is A LOT of companies) is a loser. Or smart and already looking at other jobs.

Also it feels great to work at the permanent 2nd place company. Work here if you want to tell people you work at “like AirBnB, but more expensive with less options and a bad interface.” It really sucks working somewhere you can’t even recommend to your friends or really use yourself. Pathetic.

In short only take a job here if you like never accomplishing anything, constantly having your priorities changed, having to manage up, being pulled into all sorts of time wasting bs, and being promised the world while being delivered.... nothing.

DO NOT WORK HERE. DO NOT WORK HERE. DO NOT WORK HERE."

116,Vrbo,Shame for Expedia to have this brand under their umbrella,2020-02-28,1.0,Partner Success Manager,Some initiatives like Day for Charity,"As per subject line- it’s a shame on Expedia to call VRBO part of the group. The culture is nothing like the rest of the group, it is even based in a different buildings than the rest of Expedia.
Extremely toxic culture where unethical and unlawful behaviours are accepted. Could be compared to a snake pit. Backstabbing, two-faced managers and colleagues, who only care about their own promotions. Exceptionally unskilled management, especially on sr.director and director level. Leading by fear & dictatorship. Partner Success and ‘supporting’ them Training Team are the worst in my opinion. Partner Success has nothing to do with Account Management or Sales- it’s just a call center with KPIs like: number of calls per day and call audit score(!). This is just encouraging robotic approach to the role, no relationship building, strategic thinking, growing revenue. If you don’t like using your brain, this role would be good for you. Team members are treated like school kid (very strict and poor school), where every activity is tracked, but no flexibility allowed. So the team members are not allowed to work from home, while it’s OK practise for managers. 
The training & coaching (as they like to call it) role is in fact just a QA role, where the main responsibility is to audit calls following an idiotic audit form. Most brain-killing, boring role you can think of. No development or creativity available. Promotions given only to those who glorify the management and  keep the Senior Director happy, never mind that managers, senior managers or team leaders are lacking proficiency in English. It was insulting for me and my intelligence to see some colleagues being promoted or becoming managers.

* Very toxic atmosphere, incapable and incompetent management higher leadership where bullying & harassing is promoted
* Don't be fooled by the ""part of Expedia group"", this company and these 2 departments in particular have nothing to do with Expedia, all values of the group are violated on the daily basis
* ZERO flexibility- even though technology allows, there is absolutely no option of working from home  just because it's a personal preference of a few senior leaders
* Extreme micromanagment
* KPIs have nothing to do with the actual work, were put in place just to have more control over every activity and for the leaders to look good
* Recruitment out of sync- they will promise you the world while the reality is really rather sad
* No strategic vision
*Promotions are given only on favouritism basis and to people who play 'political games'
*The team is so demotivated and afraid of senior leadership (one director in particular) that nobody even applies for management roles
*Managers have no autonomy and power to decide about anything, there are just there to follow Sr.Director's orders.
*HR is always on the side of the company and accepts all above mentioned behaviours.

Base pay is low for the cost of living in Austin unless you have years of previous experience. They present that options to switch shifts or departments are possible upon hiring,  but they are dependent on performance targets that are hard to meet due to the aforementioned changes and miscommunications to customers.  The customers really hate the company and do not have a lot of trust in it. It makes it difficult to advocate for the changes.

Expedia Group Benefits;
25 days of vacation plus 3 compensatory days","VRBO Spain is managed by the UK, so all the benefits that Spanish companies have in Madrid, you can forget them at VRBO. Also I can see people aren’t motivated, all the departments complain about what is done to the teams, I see colleagues being fired constantly (some with reason, others without it, using metrics that are not real to fire you). Apart from my team, there is also a huge disappointment in the other teams, from Partner Success to Finance to IT, so before joining VRBO, tray to see if you know somebody there that will tell you how managers and Human Resources treat the employees. 

Other cons of VRBO Spain are:

-	NO WORK FROM HOME: forget working from home (only IT can do remote work, the rest no), because that only applies to the US. When you see an American company without home office, sounds really strange but that’s what they have in the UK and Spain can’t have more than the main EMEA office;

-	NO FLEXIBLE WORKING HOURS: in Spain all companies do intensive work journey on Fridays and during summer time, finishing at 3pm. In VRBO that won’t happen because UK wants it like that (no respect for the cultural background of the country where VRBO office it’s based);

-	MANAGERS DON’T PROTECT WORKERS: HR is always getting people fired because that’s what they love to do. No protection of workers, managers are silent because they don’t want to get fired, and all you hear is “that’s what we have”, allowing stress to flow freely. Also you feel you don’t have a saying about your clients, because the management in Madrid only follows the orders of the UK, and if the UK thinks it’s black or white, that is valid, and not your point of view;

-	NO DOCTOR HOURS: if you need to go to the doctor you have to compensate those hours;

-	NO SICK HOME STAY: if you stay home because you have a cold or you feel sick, since there’s no work from home, they will take one day from your paycheck or you´ll have to spend a day of vacation in that (pretty amazing, right?);

-	EXTRA HOURS NOT PAID: you arrive earlier and leave after your hour, and you receive zero for the extra hours;

-	MICROMANAGEMENT: everything you do is controlled by your managers because in the UK they want to have full control of what you do – calls are nonstop, managers do PIP’s to employees all the time, they control the breaks to go to the bathroom, you must write down all the hours you spend doing something, you must, you must… Too much control because top management in UK want to control all movements of Madrid.

In the US VRBO is way more flexible about these points, so if in Madrid they start to implement what they have in the US, people would feel happier and wouldn't leave. I hope in the US they will read this and start implementing changes in Madrid office, because you are losing your most precious asset - your workers!"

Managers like to take credit for all work delivered and produced by their teams leaving little room for self exposure and development within the company. Massively underpaid for work delivered in comparison to people within the same department who are on 50-75% more a year. For a company that says they are all about developing their people this is hardly the case - majority of learnings offered are suitable to those already in established careers, if you are not a Senior Manager or Director (which it seems 80% of the workforce are) then good luck trying to find progression.

Company enforced scientific method, but does not provide accurate data to measure success. If you do provide data that shows something they do not like, you get a lot of we should fix that and then nothing happens. We need better coherence between teams to force data consistency.

A decent chunk of frontline calls that you receive is fixing someone else’s mess. There is a process for reporting that kind of thing but it’s so cumbersome no one takes the time to do it. This happens predominantly due to the lack of down-time for the avg agent. You’re pretty much chained to your desk 7 1/2 hours a day and even when you get to tier 2 or 3 support they are still micromanaging your time. If you can deal with those 2 things then you’ll love it.

That is, they have no influence or power other than to approve vacation for direct reports.  New EXPE Product forces are running the show now. So, what you get is Engineering Managers randomizing slack chats and starting fires to look busy. They stay greenlit at all hours of the day/night on slack, but yet provide zero business value unless you count asking unbelievably stupid questions in standup just to act like they are contributing. It's all a horrible painful political game. New world order EXPE product says jump and Engineering Managers say how high. Management who are at risk of being managed out are now firing direct reports for NON-work misconduct. I know because a colleague was recently fired for outlandish reasons. I'm writing this review because I want my colleagues' story to be known (and some of my own experience). 

My colleague, who worked in a different group put in for vacation (2-3 weeks) as time off to help her elderly father in poor health. My colleague's manager said that was fine and to report back with weekly updates. Two days later her manager asked if she wanted to take FMLA (family medical leave). She said that wouldn't be necessary. Two days after that she received a voice mail from her manager that Friday at 5 pm stating her position had been terminated due to unapproved time off. She said that after having 6-7 friendly email exchanges with her manager prior to the ""you're fired"" voice mail there was not one mention that her time off was unapproved. 

Her attorney said the reason they asked about FMLA is that employers can't fire you if you are on FMLA. She filed for unemployment and documented everything. Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) ruled in favor of my colleague, stating that the firing was improper. TWC wrote: ""Our investigation found that your employer fired you for the reason that was NOT misconduct connected with the work."" HomeAway fired her with no severance and terminated her benefits that same day. At least she was able to get unemployment.

Do you really want to work for a company who treats their employees like this? Go work for Google, Facebook, Apple or for that matter anybody other than HomeAway/Expedia or whatever they are calling themselves these days VRBO.lol.","Too many to list here! Toxic work environment like others have noted, low pay, managers are two-faced poker players and have zero backbone when it comes to making decisions but are really good at throwing their own direct reports under the bus. Product and non-Engineering functions are running this company into the ground and people are leaving in droves, especially experienced A+ players who will not tolerate a toxic environment where you can't disagree about anything, less being looked at as an antagonist and trouble maker.

Since the EXPE buyout, HomeAway is very draconian in process, childish in how they treat their senior/staff engineers, product has ego the size of TX, incompetent scrum masters who call themselves technical project people run scrum/agile from textbooks from the ’90s,  and the politics and political correctness is like a cliquish high school.

Don’t believe the positive canned reviews created by HomeAway HR Branding. The majority of the positive reviews are canned and similar in language and structure (i.e. “Great Place”, “Great Place to Work”, “Great Jon”, “Great tech + great culture”, Great for Families”, “Excellent place to work”, etc.). Seriously? These canned reviews are being propped by HomeAway HR Branding Content personnel because attrition is at an all-time high. If these (fake) HomeAway sponsored positive reviews weren’t in place the company would have a 2.0-star rating and John Kim a 39% approval rate."

Just no way to move up much beyond what you start with,"-People have been leaving in DROVES. Both by choice, and many pushed out, laid off, fired. Especially in Marketing even at a time when the company is extremely profitable. 

- Horrible executive team, micromanagement from the CEO John Kim who is widely disliked within the company.   (note many of the positive reviews here on Glassdoor are an attempt by HR to improve the ratings)  Its  a very toxic culture.  Simply take a look at all the departures lately including in HR.  Any employee at HomeAway will tell you how much they dislike John Kim the CEO and how disrespectful he is

- No love for the marketing and PR department. The absolute worst place to be at HomeAway...now ""VRBO"" if you are a marketing or PR person, stay away as you will not grow here.  The new executive here has no marketing experience at all. 

- Misleading HomeOwners ""Partners"" ?  maybe someone should ask the company on the record- exactly what % of the homes listed on HomeAway/VRBO actually get even 1 booking a year.   This is a topic the public should inquire about (especially homeowners being enticed to choose this site over AirBnB)   Compare the performance of homes listed on AirBnB to ones listed on VRBO."

You will come to realize not only will you have to provide basic support on how to use the website but also be the customers therapist, property manager, investigator which can be emotionally draining. Although not all calls are like this, there is a good percentage of inbound calls that are like this.

- Free Friday breakfast (tacos, bagels or kolaches but they're worthless for the shifts who are late or overnight)
- Free Snacks/Drinks
- Accrued vacation - 4 weeks vacation, 1 week sick, 2 floating holidays","I'm speaking only for the CSR department. Which most days I'm absolutely amazed actually functions. I have never worked in a company that was so miserable and demoralizing. 

- This company expects college educated work ethic but hires and pays you for a high school diploma. 
- They hire people every month to train BUT they randomly choose an S1 or S2 salary. So we are all doing the same work but some people are paid more and are chosen to be paid more for absolutely no apparent reason. There are more qualified people here being paid less for the same work. That is a fact. They tell you they're only paying a standard 14.75/hr wage but they're lying. I was livid when I found out.
- It's a crap shoot with supervisors. There are only like 4 good ones at one location. The good ones try to support you and advocate for you but there's lots of favorite playing around here. The politics is unsettling to watch. 
- They spend 2 months training you to support owners and then after 4 months throw you into taking care of travelers with like 4 hours of ""training."" It is much more extensive and they have absolutely no training materials. Their version of training is having 70 people in a group chat on slack assisting with situations. It's horrendous. You also don't get a pay raise with any of the new responsibility. You are also still supposed to meet metrics even though you are now taking less owner calls which is what you are graded on. 
- They micromanage EVERYTHING. You are treated like a child and not trusted at all. They are literally like big brother. There's no positive reinforcement, only repercussions and that never contributes to the growth of your employees. It stifles them and kills morale. There's no room for wellness so if you have a tough day of calls and want to take extra break time just know you'll get yelled at for not being on the phones constantly. 
- There is 0 transparency about expectations for lateral moves to departments around here but it seems like if you're white and male you're more likely to get promoted. 
- They had issues for months with not having cleaning staff on the weekends. Your employees have to work weekends and you can't even have cleaning staff for the facilities while they're there? Also the only time they clean or keep anything in pristine condition is before some big CEO event was taking place there. 
- They tell you there's so much room for growth and professional development but there's not.  You will be in your position for at least a year before you move up for a $1 raise. It's also impossible to move from a low position like this to upper management. 
-There's a HUGE disconnect between CSR and upper management. Those salaried people seem WAY happier and are treated much better. That being said, they don't seem to fix consistent issues with the product and spend a lot of time inventing new ""solutions."" They have no idea what we deal with in the trenches."

Do not mention politics at all... unless you're a liberal. My coworker and I (he's a liberal, I'm very Libertarian) will have nice conversations about issues. We are respectful, don't fight, and just talk like 2 adults should be able to, but we have coworkers who give us backlash about it (which is already ridiculous,  I have never given backlash when they talk about socialism or anything, one of the people wore a shirt with a socialist dictator on it- one who killed thousands of people). So we stopped, figuring we were upsetting people and we didn't want that. However, another time at lunch I was watching a speech my Ben Shapiro with headphones on, and someone i'd never met came up to me and was angry that I would watch this (he used exploitives) I was blown away and reported him, don't know if anything was done. Another time  I wrote a quote ""The power to do good is also the power to do harm"" by Milton Friedman (Nobel prize winning economist, economic adviser to Reagan) on my whiteboard and someone erased it, could've been cleaning staff on accident however.

Management is not involved with anyone and barely knows peoples names, only the supervisors are ""sorta"" helpful.  Your opportunity for growth is very minimal unlike they say theres potential. Pay is well below average for a call center and theres no opportunity for increases. Even if you move up in ""visas"" meaning you handle more issues for no or minimal increase (like 20 cents) for 2-3x the work.

278,Vrbo,Most diverse company I ever worked for,2018-03-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Having read the recent comment on the International Women's Day, I was prompted to say how different and positive my perspective is of working at this amazing company and how appreciative I am, as a gay woman, for feeling supported to be who I am. Not only did the flower symbol not offend me, but it allowed me to find out the actual meaning of the flower symbol in the IWD history and share it with my partner. We were both touched by it. 

HomeAway recently launched new values and I can honestly say that I have never worked at a place that genuinely cares about culture this much, in a positive way. I particularly like the openness which all senior leaders live! If I remember correctly, over 600 people volunteered to support the launch, which is now embedded in every part of the business. The President oh HomeAway, like really cares about different opinions and I feel like he deeply listens to me every time we get a chance to talk. In one meeting, a manager paused the discussion to see if anyone else has a different view, refusing to continue without a different opinion, which I found super empowering. 

The investment in people development is awesome. The quality of programs and the choice is impressive. 

Overall, trust. My thoughts and decisions are met with a healthy degree of challenge and support, my line manager makes it super clear that he is there to help me succeed.",Location. Previous office was easier to get to.

280,Vrbo,Top-down injection of politics is creating rifts which our customers will pay for,2018-03-09,2.0,Software Engineer,Great office layout.  Great vacation policy.  Workers in general are pretty relaxed and easy to work with.  Opportunity to temporarily work remote or at any of the several offices around the globe.,"Since the Expedia acquisition, the company has internally been on the rapid decline. The new CEO has seen fit to push politics to the forefront of the agenda rather than the needs of our customers.

Many  of us liked the talk of promoting diversity in the beginning.  And this may even sound great to you reading this.  But the manner in which is it being forced from the top-down is causing rifts.  They are even pressing for people to take the scientifically dubious ""implicit bias"" test (which is highly ironic considering they are attempting to brand the company as being scientific).

To illustrate the type of strife this is causing, on International Women's Day, some of the women (I don't know who they are, but I believe they are involved in promoting events and activities either at HomeAway or possibly Expedia as a whole) decided to celebrate and raise awareness of the day by generously buying flowers (thanks!).

This stirred some controversy as most of the commentary on this was that it was a regressive action as opposed to the sign of appreciation and promotion of the day that it was intended to be.  There were a handful that voiced their appreciation of the action, and given the environment, I have a hunch that there were more who felt the same, but didn't want to stand out.

Additionally, it's become acceptable to tell individuals not to speak on a topic unless they belong to certain groups.  There was a discussion regarding an increase in the number of women in a certain group.  And it was rightly pointed out that it still was not equal.  A man pointed out that it was important to celebrate the progress on the way to the goal, but was told something along the lines of ""maybe we should let the women speak on this instead of the men"".

Mind you, this was not a random comment in the hall.  This was in a company chat room.  Which the CEO personally reads.  Which makes it clear that the company is ok with certain discrimination and wants to encourage, no, force, this division from the top down.  My guess is that it's an attempt to drive off those who disagree with the direction and create more of an echo chamber.

Bottom line, if you care about the work and satisfying customers, HomeAway is to be avoided."

That was only emphasized by the declining bar for new hires which caused the overall quality of the company to go down fast. HomeAway was a top tier company with top tier talent, unfortunately now it is a mid-tier company with low quality talent."

The monthly review format is a massive time and energy sink that almost certainly does more harm than good.  

The ""120 process"" supposes a flat company structure but the company is very hierarchical and will be even more so when thousands are hired in Austin.   There's no real reward or incentive to contribute.

The actual website(s) are still a mess.

But, fact is, sometimes they starting to sound like the First Order speeching against the Resistance... Just saying.

The lack of progression (In the Customer Service department anyway) for a such a huge company worth billions of pounds is shameful. 

Furthermore, for such a 'profitable' company their employee benefits are sparser than a desert. No discounts in shops like similarly-sized companies or anything like that. Just your standard cycle to work and healthcare schemes which virtually every other business offers their employees anyway. 

Any opportunities that do arise are few and far between and they ALWAYS go to the same people (Already in senior positions) without fail instead of giving other employees who have exceeded expectations and targets consistently over long periods of time. 

Job recognition is about as existent as Narnia. No matter whether you have gone above and beyond, management do not take any notice apart from the odd email to the Customer Services department if they're in a good mood. 

If any employees make a mistake, they're demeaned by their seniors instead of helped constructively. 

The seniors penalise colleagues around them for helping others and yet new hires find them virtually unapproachable due to their disgusting attitudes or they're never available to provide them with assistance anyway.

Also, don't be fooled, it is not a start-up anymore, it is one weird brand of a giant travel company.
The basic problem if you're a high performer at HomeAway is that it isn't really a software company. Its product is vacation rentals. There is lots of money pouring in because we have acquired every company formerly in the market. But, the business is pretty well figured out. So, we have hundreds of expensive developers with little to do but reinvent wheels all the time. If you don't mind writing code just for the sake of career development and to have a nice time working with people, then it's a great job, but again, we don't have a software product.

Loyalty is NOT rewarded
Only the cutthroat can survive and move up at this company
You will be completely overworked and left without any supporting resources unless something critical breaks
There's four weeks vacation but you'll never get to use it, it does roll over year-to-year but when you leave the company you only get paid out for TWO of your accumulated weeks of vacation
Meetings, meetings, meetings
Any operations department has a heads-down culture, people rarely converse with one another, it's super weird. I didn't know the names of anybody that sat in my pod/row of desks except my immediate team.

396,Vrbo,Great company but still needs improvements,2017-02-14,4.0,Customer Service Representative,I worked with HA full time for over 1 year and  made great long lasting connections with many people. I enjoyed helping the Property Owners with many different issues. HA definitely cares about the balance between work life and family life. They also have plenty of growth from within.,My only concern lies with some of the management team. There where times when I had very difficult calls and depending on which supervisor assisted me I had 50/50 chance of actually getting the help I needed to help the Property Owners.

The teams use modern technology and don't have to deal with too much technical debt.,"The company does not retain important hires. Regardless the reason for other departures, mine is simply because working for HomeAway is a dead end job.

410,Vrbo,Going downhill fast,2017-01-02,1.0,Customer Service Representative,"Free snacks and drinks, very nice coworkers. A great deal of benefits for hourly employees.","- Supervisors can range from very accommodating and hands-off to outright incompetent and overbearing. There is no consistency so this one comes down to luck.

- Game-changing decisions are rolled out with what seems like a remarkably low level of coordination or thought. General support will often find themselves trying to come up for excuses for poorly handled and/or broken rollouts.

- Obsession over metrics with a 'leadership' body that seems remarkably out of touch with anybody below their pay grade. Very ""salesy"" vibe in non-sales roles with a ""take it or leave it"" approach to handling complaints or offering a solution to extraordinarily low morale.

- High burnout rate, leadership seems ok with this and is planning on leaning on this high attrition as they role out more and more off-shoring of their support staff.

- A sort of cultural schizophrenia as the company moves rapidly to becoming another generic large company while still flirting with a startup feel.

- Everything breaks. Constantly. This one may actually be a ""pro"" as it gives you time away from some of the most vile/abusive callers you could ever dream of, but it ends up just producing even more abusive and violently angry callers.

- If you started on the phones you will likely be stuck on the phones. The days of people moving up seem long behind this company - CSRs are disposable.

- Incredible imbalance of effort on behalf of, well, everybody. Coming up with creative ways of slacking off is a necessary survival strategy.

- Training is patchwork and doesn't last long enough 

- Website gradually catching up to 2013 with bits and pieces with all the nostalgia of 2007.

- Odd and inflexible scheduling with an arcane time-off request process.

- Making mental calculations of 'benefits' versus 'self respect'"

Decision making process is protracted. Company seems obsessed with copying airbnb but does everything a year late. 

Takes forever to get anything done and teams don't seem to care at all about helping each other

Customers hate the platform. Customer service is like 75% of the company because there are so many complaints.

- Super nice culture, where you can be yourself, socialize with co-workers, share ideas, decorate your space, dress as you want, managers are approachable and friendly yet professional.... for me as an extrovert this is fantastic
- Interesting and challenging projects coming up constantly, if you want to try yourself and get involved, you will have the chance for sure... managers value talent
- Nice, modern, colorful, welcoming facilities, big kitchen with games, chill out area...+ All sites have great location with good connection to public transport
- Training always available and encouraged
- Great technology to work with, also helpful and nice help desk support
- Social events, (Summer party, Christmas party, Halloween, after work beers...) and  all-office meetings to share information among departments and share time together
- Productive, constructive, proactive, fast-speed environment and hands-on mentality, ""willing to improve"" mentality that I appreciate a lot.
- Ethics and core values that I relate with: ""Adventurous, Authentic, Heart, Drive, Enjoy Life, Together"". 
- Great work-life balance. First time ever I see the management saying ""go home, you have a life!""
- And of course....... free coffee, + sodas + fresh fruit . Always a great plus.","- As it has grown so much in the last years, seems the speed of the activity is a bit ahead of standardized processes in some departments"

The position required TONS of travel to support all of their software clients located in ALL the premium resort areas around the US, Hawaii, and Canada. I have been to all of them!  

Instant grew by acquisition and at one time we had clients on five different property management software platforms. Everything from DOS to .net and everything in between.
We were the first to organize large, expensive industry educational outings in all of the major markets. Being British owned they definitely knew how to throw a party wherever we went. 

One week I would be in Rhode Island then Florida then Western Canada followed by three weeks in Hawaii.. That was typical.. Wearing out suitcases.. Make some wonderful friends with my clients along the way and saw some amazing sites in all of these beautiful locations.
We had set the industry standard for Property Management Software and

I have to thank the owners for providing me with the best job that I will ever have had. 

Instant was eventually bought out by Home Away and that was an end of an era. There is a lot more money coming into the vacation rental industry now but it is not as nearly as fun or interesting as it once was. The 'personal' touch with the clients began to rapidly decline once Instant was gone..

I learned to be an excellent property management software salesperson and BDM. Made many lasting friendships in the industry.","They were bought out by Home Away.

I have never had a potential employer put some much time and effort to get me onboard. I applied for the Customer Service position, and was offered another position they were implementing as a new one...Billing Representative. During this process, I was told the Billing Rep. position was accepted by a HA employee, therefore, they offered another position as Product Support. After all that was said and done, I get a phone call the individual declined the offer and they offered the Billing Rep. position back to me.

Great offices, some really great people.","The people in every department other than sales seem to absolutely love their jobs. There are currently 3 sales departments - FRBO Sales, Small PM and Large PM which are all managed differently and have different expectations for work/life balance and rate of pay. In FRBO, the overtime is capped but most need to work overtime in order to even hit 100% of quota. This team is micro-managed at 3 different levels and the overall energy is low and mostly negative. The FRBO Sales Team are paid at entry level and although they have accelerators on commission, it is rare to over attain as the quotas are extremely high and increase each month. Small and Large PM Sales are on a much more laid back level that encourage freedom and flexibility to work regular hours, not click in/out and are not micro-managed at all. Favoritism is HUGE at HomeAway! A promotion will not be given regardless of tenure and attainment unless you have taken each of the Directors and Managers for lunches. This is openly advised by lower level Managers, in order to be given favor for promotions.

Atmosphere is 'light-hearted' on the sales floor and everyone works hard creating good synergy amongst sales peers. Quarterly celebrations if the team as a whole hits goal.,Mid-level managers are overruled by directors and have limited power to run their teams from the front lines efficiently. Disconnect between sales and the rest of the company as 'one hand doesn't keep up with the other'. Sales is treated like an after-thought and do not share in quarterly bonuses the company provides to the other teams.

There is absolutely no concept of ownership of a project. Everything is divided piecemeal across teams to the point of chaos.

Horrible planning processes that waste so much time and energy and are an embarassment to the teams they supposedly represent. 

I've never worked somewhere where time was managed so poorly. So many meetings without accomplishment. 

There is a lot of jargon that is HomeAway centric that does not and should not make sense to new people. However, instead of adopting industry standards, HomeAway creates its own strange, cryptic standards and language. 

No understanding of how Jira should really work.

I've done my fair share of call center jobs, and while it's a dead end for many, I embraced the challenge as I thought it would be a good next step for me. I've seen what works, and what doesn't, and initially I had thought HA was doing everything right. 

Well, then I was wrong. Then RM2 happened, then more and more changes occurred. What you need to consider is the average HA/VRBO user are generally older, retired, and often have this as their only means of income. With that comes with a general lack of technological savvyness, and being quick to anger and agitation that they perceive HA is forcing change onto them which they may not think is best. Now of course, you can never please anyone.

I often sat down with my, at the time, lead, and discussed how to best handle the situation. I told him, ""Well, you hear the calls, you understand the concern here, right?"" The fix was to continue to build up trust and support in the product, and educating the users on the changes.

Their answer was to throw mandatory OT at the problem, hence MEGA burn out. Oh well."

Lots of vacation time","-Misleading job description 
-Can't use the restroom without permission
-30 seconds between ENDLESS calls
-Mandatory overtime without an end date (I did it for 2 months which meant I was spending roughly ten hours a day in a call center EVERY day)
-Customers have hold times of anywhere between 10 minutes to 30 minutes which means they are extremely angry by the time they speak with anyone. In short, we were understaffed which is why there was so much overtime required. It could have been avoidable."

It still has the size of a large start-up while benefiting from the financial health & strength of a more mature company. At an individual level this means that there are many opportunities for one to grow and have an impact.

Genuinely love the way our leadership team makes itself truly approachable, to either explain the way forward or listen to new ideas. A good illustration is our ""table talks"" every friday, where all our leadership team is present for teams to engage.

Last but not least, the team and company culture: open, work-hard play -hard, supportive.. Pretty much what you would expect from any other large internet company, but certainly worth calling out.

I would strongly encourage to join if interested in fast growth environments.",Must be ready to work under strong pressure and with a certain level of ambiguity. Again to be expected in such environment.

The heads of the company do a great job of keeping people at levels informed of what is going on with the company and do a lot to get everyone together at corporate events.,Specifically in the call center for customer support- there is not a lot of support when dealing with angry customers.  There is so much information to learn when you start and it is hard to know everything and then when someone asks for a manager it is really difficult to get someone who will take the call.

The laid back and friendly environment makes for a productive and outstanding place in which to work whilst everybody is always on hand to assist you if you need help.

The fact that the company is so large & international only further adds to its appeal as there is plenty of scope for career development and there are so many ways in which you can be aided in working towards your desired position within the company.","Right now, there are none."
560,Vrbo,A great family to be a part of,2014-11-25,5.0,Customer Support Representative,"Without a doubt the best company I've wirked for. People are very friendly, there is a real sense if comradery. The business takes very good care of employees too, and management is keen for employees to be given lots of responsibilities to encourage their careers to evolve.","When I left the company, it was going through a transition from a start up to a public company. Consequently a lot of new burocracy was introduced and a lot of people who had been with the company for years were unceremoniously let go by new department heads who were brought in from the outside. I was unaffected by these changes, but the new atmosphere was not one in wish I wanted to continue working, hence I started looking for other opportunities elsewhere."

Input from every team member is given due consideration when problem solving. There's some leeway for self-direction and (theoretically) the opportunity to move between teams while here. The benefits are great, the work day and week are almost always accommodating to each person's desired schedule.","There isn't a career path beyond senior/staff developer that can be worked towards with tangible feedback. Many of the listed benefits are diminished or not available unless you're in the headquarters in Austin. In some respects, the vacation rental industry is about a decade behind other tech companies.

Everyone is nice and there's really no bureaucracy.  I go to very few meetings and get to work on cool web technologies including Microsoft stacks & Java stacks.  There's lots of cool things to do in the UI layer here too.  I get to tinker with lots of JavaScript frameworks.  My co-workers are all smart& laid back, we get to learn from each other regularly.","You are a remote worker from the main HQ, so there's the anonymity that comes with that.  It's not super bad, but it exists.  Also, I hate logging JIRA tickets for everything in the world, but you do that here."
563,Vrbo,Horrible experience.  If you don't mind a position where you don't get the training you need and the support this is the company for you.

It's really difficult to be up-to-date. If you miss 1 week you're lost. Apart from the fast paced environment, the company has still lots of start-up defects, like lack of organization, duplicities that could be easily avoided, un professional managers, too much information to swallow in a short period of time.

568,Vrbo,Open friendly  progressive company with a strong strategy,2014-10-26,5.0,Account Manager,"Whilst I can't think of a central London office with better views, that isn't the best thing about HomeAway London.  There is a really positive culture and whilst not unreasonably we all have to deliver our results for the company to continue to prosper there is a good friendly vibe to the place, people are friendly and willing to help, and at the end of the day there is an ethos that we can have fun doing our jobs and coming to work as well.  
I have never worked anywhere where the senior management share the vision, goals and data as openly with ALL staff, which is very refreshing and reinforces that this is a team not just a corporation.","Working across time zones has its challenges, and complexities but in the main they are workable. There are at times a lot of meetings and weekly updates come around fast however this does at least encourage accountability and fosters openness."
569,Vrbo,The right balance between tech giant and high-growth startup,2014-10-26,5.0,BI/Strategy Associate,"You feel like you’re playing a role in building something
The Apples and Googles of this world are great, everyone knows they’re great, they’re probably still going to be great in 10 years. For me working at companies at the top of the tree feels a little more like being a cog in the machine than someone who can grow the company and make it better and I find that very disengaging. Related to this is company size, HomeAway is big but not so big that it’s tough to feel like you’re contributing or be recognised for doing so.

An established and profitable company
HomeAway is developed and successful enough to compete on comp with larger tech players which most startups can’t. HomeAway is a well capitalised and profitable so you avoid the uncertainty that accompanies many startups reliant on external funding.

Work/Life balance is great
I find people are committed and focused on their jobs but equally to their lives outside of work. This means working time tends to be more flexible, working from home (at least part of the week) seems to be an option in most roles. I work hard but I love the control I have over when this is, I feel I can leave as early or late as I feel is appropriate given my workload without anyone thinking better/worse about me for doing so","As per the title HomeAway strikes a great balance between a tech giant and startup but that doesn’t make it perfect

Brand
A company with a great brand is instantly recognisable and can (rightly or wrongly) give you instant credibility as an employee. You won’t get this with HomeAway. Most people (even in the tech industry) don’t know of the company and certainly don’t recognise its scale.

Speed
HomeAway can feel slow relative to a smaller company at times with can frustrate some people. I tend to see this as an inevitability as a company gets to a certain size but am sometimes disappointed by what feels like a constrained ability to iterate and improve our product offering

Responsibility
Although HomeAway is not so big that it’s difficult to be recognised you’re still not going to get the roles and responsibilities you would in a smaller company as quickly"
570,Vrbo,"Fantastic environment, fantastic people.",2014-10-24,5.0,IT Helpdesk,The HomeAway culture is unlike anything I've experienced before.

It's also just a fun industry we work in - much nicer to spend time writing software that helps people have vacations than something dry.",Fast growth with time to market pressure.
586,Vrbo,Finally a company where the employed is not a number,2014-10-08,5.0,Sales Engineer Onboarding Coordinator,"Employed is being appreciated, and his work as well. Managers are used to listen, to suggest and to follow each step until the correct process has been completed. Great environment and communication even if we are far each other.
Salary is well structured basing on the position and it's possible to find motivation to grow into the company each day.","Targets are challenging, but employed have enough weapon to get them."
587,Vrbo,It's great to finally work for a SUCCESSFUL company that CARES about its employees.,2014-10-08,5.0,Software Engineer,"HomeAway doesn't waste time or resources. Everything I build as a software developer gets used and adds value to the company. I can't tell you how many man-years worth of development I've seen thrown away at other companies because they built something nobody wanted or needed.

Our leadership is strong, has a vision, and knows how to execute on that vision. At some companies leadership talks but nothing happens. I don't see that happening at HomeAway. Our leadership is in command of our business and I see change, good change, every year that I'm here.

HomeAway is successful and they share that success with employees. I'm very satisfied with my salary, bonus, benefits, and incentives. It's clear to me HomeAway cares about retention and doesn't see me as just another cog in the wheel.","We have very interesting problems to solve but not all of our work here is glamorous. Yes, there are a lot of legacy solutions around that still have to be kept up so not everything we work on is earth shattering or exciting."
588,Vrbo,"Great company, smart engineers ...some growing pains",2014-10-07,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Great offices  all over the word.  To highlight two - HQ is at 5th and lamar, and our London office is overlooking Buckingham Palace!  There is also a program called ""DeskAway"" that allows employees to work out of any office they choose (subject to manager approval of course)
- ""bear stay"" is another perk that allows employees to stay at a HomeAway property free of charge.  Employees get 1 bear stay a year
- The people are wonderful, engineers are smart and helpful.  Bryon Jacob is the Principal Architect and is exceptional.  Not only is he brilliant, but he's also one of the nicest and helpful individuals i've ever worked with.
- 4 weeks vacation
- Tons of other smaller perks - bike lockers, health fairs (massages, free flu shots...)
- Stock options that are actually worth something
- Executive team knows what they're doing

All in all, I've always felt like HomeAway goes out of their way to make this a fun place to work.","- 401K matching could be better (the max match is up to $1000 and it vests over 4 years)
- Work-life balance is sometimes a bit lopsided.  I enjoy the work I do but often times i spent far too much time working.
- HomeAway has grown quickly and at times we don't have the infrastructure to support such a large organization"

The business is growing a lto, so there is alot of career opportunities, new projects coming, global collaboration, trips, ...It is the perfect mixture of not being a start-up anymore, but neither a big complex multinational of thousands of employees. It is a matrix organization where your influence still can be taken in account for big decisions, whoever you are.","Fast-paced environment, you need to be open to quick flexibility to do things. It could be challenign for some people who need to have s plan defined 100% before starting something, because at HomeAway there are changes (good ones, though) a lot of times in the middle of a process or project. You need to be open minded and social to be happy at HomeAway, because the environment is very friendly and we feel like a big family."

598,Vrbo,"Some great people, but too many bad apples the spoil the bunch",2014-09-11,2.0,Software Engineer,There are some really fantastic people at HomeAway that make it fun to come into work at times. Some of the work is challenging. They do their best to try to have a culture that is enjoyable.,"A lot of the management is disrespectful and unprofessional. There are people that are making decisions that they are not qualified to make, which leads to problems down the road. Friendships and tenure play more into raises and promotions than actual output or quality of work delivered. Management is more concerned with seeing reports and pretty pictures than actually delivering good products. There are too many cliques of people that all come from former companies together that make it like a high school cafeteria type of environment."
599,Vrbo,Very strong executive leadership team,2014-09-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The VR industry is evolving quickly and HomeAway is a major reason why.  The leadership team is solid, and their strategic decisions are sound.  While the company is global, and fairly large, it still feels like a young and nimble company.",The business is complex due to the acquisitions.

Young staff with great professional skills
The company is rich - They have money and they invest in hiring people (especially mid management positions recently), external acquisitions, product developments .. and also contribute to enhance offices and working environment for employees","Company Growing - Organization tends to be enriched with new intermediate management levels and more complex matrix org and interactions.

602,Vrbo,A great place to work and learn,2014-08-29,5.0,Software Engineering Manager,"People will try to do the right thing. There's a general feeling of the company being run the ""right-way."" Folks at the top make informed decisions based on business value and priorities. On the development side when looking at possible paths of implementing something the proper way of doing things usually wins. Shortcuts are rare and when taken are tracked as technical debt. That makes development, changes and new features much easier to add and maintain. It is a great place to learn how to do things in a way that minimizes long term maintenance costs. There's also a push from above to improve things continuously to make people happy.",The way teams are setup and quarterly goals tracked can lead to silos. There are initiatives trying to solve this problem though.

I work in Customer Experience and we get to interact with all customer segments and help keep them engaged and doing their best. We work hard for our colleagues and HomeAway does a lot of good things to recognize employees and maintain a hardworking but fun culture. People who tend to complain a lot may never have worked anywhere else...you really gonna complain about the specifics of free food being supplied what feels like daily? The company is remarkably transparent in sharing plans with every employee -- we are trusted with a lot of information.","Having grown through rapid acquisition, we are still working to simplify our systems and balance investments new stuff versus making current tools the most excellent they can be. Reality is that growth of teams may also mean that advancement opportunities exist, but you have to go after them. CS is open 24/7/365 and while that is a point of pride in excellent service, it sometimes feels we are the only ones in the company doing so, although that is not true."
605,Vrbo,Best company I've ever worked for,2014-08-10,5.0,Product Manager,The people and culture are by far the best things about HomeAway.  Everyone is extremely intelligent and the culture is very down-to-earth for a company of this size.  There is no dress code and managers trust employees to manage their own time as long as their getting their work done.,"With all of the websites that HomeAway operates, things can be very complex and take much longer than you might expect to get done.  This is the challenge when you're acquiring and integrating the technology and people from other  companies several times per year."
606,Vrbo,Love it!,2014-08-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Solid culture (feels genuine and not forced).
You will work with very talented people.
Pay and benefits are above average in my experience.
Work is challenging and rewarding.
Work-life balance is strongly encouraged (which is new for me).

They provide a shuttle with wifi if you need to get from one company location to another.
Quality work environment and free snacks (be careful, you can put on 5 - 10 pounds quickly)!","Many locations throughout Austin so can be a bit tough when you need to meet with people face-to-face.

They bring in breakfast every friday, and provide ongoing training.","If you are working in frbo sales, pm sales or customer service departments there is no work life balance.  You must clock in and clock out everyday like you are working your very first job.  If you work in any of these departments be prepared to stay there.  It is highly unlikely you will ever get the chance to work in another department or get promoted.  Even though you could easily work from home it is not allowed in these departments.  Managers are young and play favorites.  Salary is entry level and if you are in sales, your commissions are capped.   Systems crash a lot and seem patched together."

The only place I have ever worked where the products I get to participate in actually change and improve an industry. In that way it feels like a startup in a new space.  Compensation and benefits are very good in Austin. Management is focused in evolving people and pushing us hard to  achieve. Product roles require building up leadership muscles given the highly matrixed organization and fragmented aspirations (both a pro and con). On the surface, the products and problems look easy, but they are not given a very complex customer base and the ownership of global marketplace. A great challenge that touches both consumer and SMB classes of problems. One of the few companies where mobile is a value prop vs. a trendy thing to do.","The company suffers from ADD, which translates into resources being spread very thin, product MVPs stretching the the definition of ""minimum"", and a lot of conquer and move on behavior.  It's a delicate balance between being a public company focused on quarterly revenue targets and having a group of passionate people trying to build great products."

The executive team is sharp and always looking for way to challenge the status quo and improve.","There are many initiatives, so priorities can change on a daily basis.

Compensation is very competitive, and the compensation conversation during interview is very healthy and open.
Work-life balance is ideal - if work is getting done, you can do what you need to do.
There have been many opportunities to self-start a project, fill a need, or learn from others.  Between self-motivation, contests and compensatory rewards - there are many incentives for personal growth.
They're always looking for new tech, so it's easy to get experience with the latest and greatest tools and hardware.","Inter-team communication can be difficult, given the fast-pace of projects, goals that overlap between teams and physical location (three offices in Austin alone).

Very goal-oriented and metrics-driven which in my opinion drives the best companies in the world (along with leadership vision and engaged employees).",Not as big as IBM or Dell but no sweet spot of 200-500 employees where you know everyone.  But the size brings benefits in technology investment.

Don't even think about joining the Sales team unless you want to stay in Sales permanently. There is zero chance of moving into another department unless you want to take a pay cut and move down to Customer Support or Trust and Security Department. Chances of being promoted in Sales is slim as well.

Almost everyone in the development org is focused on providing as much value to customers as quickly as possible,"As the company grows, it becomes more difficult to get all parties in a room together to quickly make decisions and turn around solutions.

A lot of the management has been there a long time drawing a big paycheck but are completely apathetic about their jobs. 

HA feels very much like a boys club as well.

The passion is gone. All the passionate people have left to go back to the start up world. This happens when companies grow larger, but HA is doing nothing to prevent the hemorrhage of people. The culture is shifting more to a Dell like atmosphere. Several Dell exec hires were made just before I left."

The onboarding process is very comprehensive and makes it easy to fit in. The office culture is laid-back yet professional and the top managers are easy to contact when needed. The atmosphere is a mix between the young start-up that the company was only a few years back and the industry leader it has become. As a result, there is always something exciting happening, within or outside office hours!

- Great product to work for: working for a vacation product is actually fun and inspiring (if you care, of course...)
- The mindset is right: very few ""smart but too much ego"" managers; while the company sometimes tend to re-invent the wheel, the mindset still is about listening everyone's view and trying new options and ideas
- C-Team cares about the company: the leaders of the company obviously care about the destiny of the company, and keep in very good contact with all offices

Good benefits, although not competitive with other travel start ups in Silicon Valley/SF area. Some smart, hardworking folks in the trenches.","Culture was both hierarchical and political. Apart from a couple of (non-inspiring) female VP's, the company is totally male-dominated. Territoriality is a way of life (""Don't touch that. My team owns it!"") And yet, ownership did nothing to ensure results. (It simply protected insecure higher ups who were afraid they'd be eclipsed by real talent and execution.)  Far from a sense of ""we all succeed or fail together,"" the pervasive attitude at HomeAway was all about ""how can I get ahead?"" The end customer - the homeowner and the traveler - were a complete after thought. It's no wonder that Airbnb has danced circles around Homeaway -- and in a fraction of the time."

While these milestones are all in the past now, the company is showing no signs of slowing down and because we're still relatively small, you feel as though your contributions really can make in impact on the business.

It's also important to work for a growing company whose product is far more valuable than the price charged for it.  This is one of the reasons for our continued success, and the success of the customers who list on our sites. 
Finally, we have lots of celebrations and opportunities for recognition (and accountability).  Quarterly goals are supported by the teams you work with and they throw a wicked holiday party.  The Spring Picnic is a chance to bring your family out for a fun day of petting zoos, great food and games.  There are also several team-specific events like rooftop BBQs and afternoon trips to the movies that go on from time to time.

However, the big C's decided to go 100% corporate on everyone, including the customers. Be very aware before applying here.

683,Vrbo,Nothing but micromanaging,2012-10-18,1.0,Customer Service Representative,4 weeks paid vacation every year - doesn't get much better than that.,"1. They hired some big shots to run the CS department a few years ago and since then the department has gone to pot. They make unnecessary and random changes ALL the time. Most of the workers in the CS department loath the changes.
2. Some employees are allowed to work from home and the rest are not. Their goal is to get rid of work from home completely when other companies are going in the right direction of letting most employees work from home. Work from home is a major benefit these days considering gas prices and it is also environmentally friendly. Get the picture guys and do the right thing.
3. They keep adding more job responsibilities to the role and the pay is the same (not that great).
4. Goals are ridiculous, complicated and add more to our job description.
5. Mandatory overtime ALL the time. They NEVER hire enough employees. The only time they hire is to replace the ones that quit.
6. For an online site, there are TOO many technical meltdowns and bugs. This also makes for ALOT of VERY VERY upset customers that take it out on CS.
7. Myself with a few others in this department feel like we are all replaceable and there is no sense of appreciation for the employees.

The folks who work at the other locations are treated poorly in comparison. For example, the management in the other locations are sub-par and don't truly care about their employees. The management at HQ, on the other hand, go out of their way to help their employees succeed. So, if you are thinking about working here, make sure your job is stationed at HQ.

I highly respect management from my direct boss all the way to the CEO. Lots of advancement opportunity - a couple of employees come to mind who started at HomeAway fresh out of school who are now running large parts of the business, and there are lots of regular promotions.","HomeAway is a big company now - over 1000 employees worldwide. Also, since HomeAway was built by acquiring lots of small companies throughout the world, integration of all these parts and bureaucracy can be a major headache. I think management has a good handle on this (weekly ""table talks"", for example), but that doesn't mean that bureaucracy isn't still an issue. 

Also, it is the case that your fondness for HomeAway is most likely related to your immediate team, and given HomeAway's size there can be a lot of variation between teams. I've worked on some awesome teams, but I can also sympathize with those who have not been as fortunate as I have regarding their bosses and/or peers. If you are considering working for HomeAway, be sure to meet with your prospective manager and other people on the team."
