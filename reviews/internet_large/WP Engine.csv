1,WP Engine,Not as great as it used to be,2022-03-26,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"* Great benefits
* Get to work with and learn from lots of REALLY smart, extremely friendly and fun people
* CEO is personable and is a great beacon of the company culture
* Customers tend to be raving fans
* Quarterly recognition based on peer nomination
* Great tech, cool tools and decent budgets","* Started hiring too many chiefs and not enough indians (to actually get the work done)
* Splitting the company into business units just created more silos, while supporting departments were stuck in the middle; creating some positions that were duplicative of other roles and made it seem as if the BUs were the strategists and the functional areas supporting them were simply supposed to jump and do what the BUs came up with. 
* Let go two female execs and replaced with one male (that, frankly, many people are scared of)
* Promotions are given to those that suck up and lie with numbers, who always have answers (or a presentation) that make themselves look good at the expense of others. No clear-cut path to promotions in many departments.
* ""Never say no"" culture (and if you do, you're being difficult, and/or people go around you until they get what they want)
* Becoming a place of toxic positivity, where employees bringing up issues are deemed too ""passionate,"" too negative, or troublemakers."
2,WP Engine,Great company,2022-03-25,5.0,Senior Product Manager,The colleagues you work with everyday are great.,Can’t think of any right now
3,WP Engine,Only work here if you're desperate,2022-03-21,1.0,Account Manager,"Uncomplicated product, you're selling a few different kinds of upgrades to customers around storage and compute.","1. Like any sales org, the tenured sellers have the best accounts, so you'll be fighting for scraps unless you take over a good book from someone outgoing.

2. Less than average compensation, 50/50 base/commission so you're going to be arguing with customers about spending $100 more a month. Why should they buy a more expensive plan? No reason - support gives away the resources, no hard limits, no cut-offs for going over account limits. This is because WP Engine is trying to go public, and wants to keep customer numbers up, so nobody gets cut off for going over their plan limits. I had customers using 2TB of bandwidth a month on a 50GB/month bandwith plan. If you're looking for an unlimited bandwidth video server, WP Engine sells them for $30/mo!

3. Support staff just gives away storage and support if a customer complains, so long-term customers know that they don't HAVE to spend more money to get more resources, support will just give it to them for free if they ask.

4. Completely clueless, disinterested management who does not care about your success at all, will not help when it's needed, and will just watch you twist in the wind.

5. The product (Managed Wordpress) can be purchased for much cheaper elsewhere. WPEngine doesn't do anything different from a client perspective than other competitors that sell the same thing at less than half the cost.

6. WPEngine does not want a human sales force, they want everything self-serve. Most companies treat sales staff as what they are; the team that brings in revenue. WPEngine treats sales staff as a necessary evil, and any of your complaints will go unheard."
4,WP Engine,Feels like home,2022-03-14,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"If you are looking for a company with a great, respectful culture and genuinely kind and helpful people that's WP Engine. It's a big company that was able to keep the exciting, friendly and joyful atmosphere of a startup, not a corporation.

Besides you can really grow as a software developer using the most modern tools and technologies. You will not lack challenges and opportunities to improve your skills.

- Dishonest leadership and team members

- Dishonest sales practice with customers. A failing product that doesn't help customers and shady tactics to force over the top upgrades onto customers. 
- You are shamed for taking time off
- No understanding of work/life balance
- heavily political. If you are a Conservative or a Christian you will be shamed and attacked every day you work here."

They really transitioned well to remote work during the pandemic which many used to think was impossible. The people are great. More so outside of work, some really suck to work with but are good people. I enjoy my team a ton and love working with them.
Overall the company is great. I'm very impressed with the HR department. I've seen them do some amazing things but they are slow for any policy changes.","The mass exodus has taken its toll on the company. Many of my friends have left. I like to think I don't work for a company but I work with good people. Many of those good people have left and that really takes the shine off doing a job I love. 

Management and staff are very tired of the enabling of bad actors and we can't keep up the fight of trying to create positive change by speaking up about the problems. If you speak up about the bad actors you get met with discourse and told that you are the problem and that you aren't positive enough. So the good people quit and the bad ones stay and make it more frustrating for the teams that are left and then the problem just exacerbates. ( This may depend on your department )

I watched a manager deny a staff member deny an internal promotion that they were more than qualified for and give it to someone outside of the company. That person was amazing at their job, burnt out, and quit because they couldn't fight the losing battle with stakeholders saying jump and they have to say how high. 

Salaries aren't competitive and a lot of people are underpaid. Which is why a lot of people are leaving.

HR is very slow for positive policy change. I understand it's a ton of co-ordination but some people are mis-labeled in their jobs and are underpaid because of it."
19,WP Engine,Great place to work,2022-01-05,5.0,Sales,"A top place to work with awesome culture, development opportunities and benefits.","For the nearly 2 years I've been employed here, I have not seen any significant cons or red flags."

21,WP Engine,"Great company, good culture, and upward mobility",2021-12-29,5.0,Technical Support L2,"- Starting pay is fair especially if you have don't have prior experience (I started at $18/hr). They aren't going to rip you off with $12/hr just because you don't have experience. 
- Company culture overall is very positive.
- Management is on your side. You won't feel like an anonymous pawn. 
- They love hiring internally. If you stick with the company, they are more than happy to help you move up to other roles. You won't be locked to one role forever if you don't want to be.
- Very fair benefits and health package.
- 1 month PTO!","- Though starting pay for tech support is fair, raises are few and far between. For any meaningful raise, you would have to be promoted to a new role."

Lots to learn.,"The entire marketing organization is a hot mess. Happy hours were the worst - and almost always mandatory during all-hands week. These were always uncomfortable situations because I didn't want to be there but felt like I wouldn't be seen as a team player if I skipped. 

Unlimited PTO sounds great - until your team trash-talks you for taking time off, even though you planned the vacation half a year in advance, which is more than you can say for the planning of any project on any team. 

My mental health suffered as a result of daily mistreatment from a couple of passive-aggressive individuals I worked closely with. 

I do not recommend this company."

28,WP Engine,They say they care about their employees but the burnout rate is very high,2021-11-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Remote work
Decent salary
Amazing colleagues
I can't think of more","I was a Flywheel employee, which means that I became a WPE employee after the acquisition. Things went downward after this. Our shifts were increased by 1 hour daily without any reason. The person who decided it is no longer at the company. It means that we have now 4 hours of overlap between teams (US, AUS, EMEA). We were compensated with a pay raise but most of us would have chosen less money and kept the hours that had worked for years. People were threatened to sign the new contract, and in some countries, it was not even legal. The company says that they believe in fighting for their employees mental health but it's not true. They focus in giving some out of the blue days off for which you don't even have time to plan. We also lost unlimited PTO as part of the acquisition. There's a career plan but nobody knows how it works or how to take benefit from it. I felt stuck in doing the same for several years, and there were no plans of letting me grow.

Remotes were not sufficiently recognized. We got VISA card with $20 as a present from the company. You needed to call a +1 number in order to activate it, and the card could only be used within the US. And we got this card on the other side of the world and during a pandemic!!??

Just by repeating that you care about your employees is not enough. You need to take action if you don't want to lose great workers. At this point more than 50% of the original Flywheelers are already gone. Isn't there anyone wondering why? 

Acquisitions are messy, this has been the second in my life, and the worst until now. 

Don't work for WPE, your mental health will benefit from staying away from them."

There are people there who genuinely care.

You'll learn a TON of information.

Can be a varied and interesting role.","You'll work every single minute of your shift. If you clock in 1 minute late, you're late.

Need to go to the toilet? Let everyone on the shift know.

It is always stressful - you'll never really relax. And that's unhealthy. It ranges from panic - when you're handling 3 terrible chats and there's no help available - to a low level hum of stress that comes from knowing that every minute of your performance is monitored.

A good day is when you have a meeting for an hour, to give you a bit of a breather. But a lot of that time will be spent listening to management about the little things that are being done wrong."

- Great office space and general work environment
- Really good work/life balance
- Benefits are good
- Culture is definitely better than a lot of other large companies","- Did extremely little to help employees during Covid, despite the company both saving money on office expenses and regularly hitting sales goals
- The company talks a big game on DEI, but beyond simply maintaining a non-discriminatory workplace, it's mostly performative
- ERGs and related DEI action is mainly driven by employees, not the company
- Managers and department leaders are extremely hit and miss; some are amazing, some only make themselves look good and throw their reports under the bus or even block their career progression to keep reports where they want them
- HR is more interested in maintaining the absence of conflict than actually doing the right thing
- The hiring/interviewing process is both biased and very long
- They'll use your geographic location to justify paying you less
- Review process is extremely slanted -- ""we expect people to exceed expectations"" is one of many ridiculous excuses I heard for avoiding giving people a raise or promotion
- Their referral process is toxic and annoying; they encourage employees to spam social media for a chance to earn money from a clicked link, rather than fostering a culture where employees refer people who they actually know and trust"

Great for someone trying to get their foot in the door in tech sales and build their resume and learn how to work in a fast paced environment.

There are so many generous benefits such as private healthcare, paid lunches. For and SDR, the pay is amazing - especially for someone just starting out in their career. Pre COVID, we were flown to Texas for onboarding which was an unforgettable experience. The CEO Heather is an incredible woman, she takes the time to learn the names of every single new on-boarder despite the companies hyper-growth - I was seriously impressed with this. In terms of product training, this is very well executed and you'll continue to receive a tone of information and training sessions as you progress. Overall a fantastic company to work for :)","A big con for me at the time was the lack of management for the UK SDR team. Although we were managed via the US, I felt we really need a manager present in the office to be our advocate.

Outdated workforce expectations like very limited WFH policy. 

Salaries are often 15-25% less than other players in town. 

Benefits like, flexible PTO policy, and lunch every day was taken away while I was there to pad bottom line. Private equity offerings for new hires was also significantly reduced. 

Groupthink highly present; expected to conform to a limited identity and not a lot of room to ""think outside the box"" for solutions.

- Does the right thing by customers, even if it means we take cut to profits (Ex: Upgrading all servers to next gen hardware without additional charges)
- Quickly realigns strategy when something isn't working for customers (Ex: Admitting we were wrong and lowering prices after raising them a year earlier)
- Great benefits (Work from home, unlimited PTO for salaried workers, downtown location, great healthcare)
- Allows acquisitions to largely continue as they were before, while also learning from them and applying what's worked for them, to us
- Equality is very important. Lots of female leadership and high levels of respect for gender, race and even skill level
- Everyone is ready to jump up and help, whether it's with a problem, a question, donating blood or volunteering
-Transparent with almost all company goals, information and numbers","- Support seems to get the short end of the stick so often. Very little recognition around what they do and the personality of the whole dept. Often, NPS is bragged about and yet rarely do we hear about wins from their team. Sales gets a whole segment of Town Hall and posts all over Workplace about their successes, but Support carries the burden of our customers issues and frustrations and rarely gets company-wide recognition. It may be an entry-type role, but I don't feel like we treat our Support with the respect they deserve.
- Support should be less micro-managed. There's a large amount of work demanded of them as far as metrics are concerned. It doesn't allow them to treat each interaction with the care it deserves. This causes tickets to pile up because they take to long.
- It takes a lot of energy to hear out people's problems all day long. Support should be staffed better."

140,WP Engine,Ejected support agents from headquarters,2020-03-11,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Fast paced tech company that openly shares company progress with their employees.,"My colleagues in Support have been forced to relocate to work out of North Austin. WP Engine recently moved only the Technical Support team from our downtown headquarters to the Domain removing many opportunities for collaboration with other departments and career advancement. This change has caused some uneasiness around the company. Senior Management responded by creating a parking pass that visiting agents can check out when they come downtown. The problem is that Support agents are ranked by how much of their day is spent working with customers, often three customers at a time. It's not realistic for agents seeking knowledge or advancement to drive downtown in the middle of the day, park in the garage, collaborate with colleagues, and drive back to the domain to do their job. This is a great company to work at if you're not in Technical Support."
141,WP Engine,Never reimbursed me for parking.,2020-03-11,1.0,Technical Support L1,Tech job normal perks,They never reimbursed my parking fee after my interview.
142,WP Engine,Best company I've worked at,2020-03-10,5.0,Product Management Leader,"Actually lives its values. Individuals are still able to make a large difference on customers and the financial health of the company despite its size. Market is huge so working on product and engineering is exciting. Engineering problems are difficult because of scale, which are fun problems to solve.","Some people work too much. Occasionally that's due to process issues, sometimes due to celebrating heroics. Management models work/life balance (for example, no emails from the boss on the weekend), but people still over-work. Communication has worsened as the company has grown. Sometimes we tackle too many things at once."
143,WP Engine,Where Company Culture is at the Forefront,2020-02-11,5.0,Marketing,"Company values and culture are an integral part of daily operation.
Emphasis on internal promotions and growth.
Your voice matters and executive management care about your viewpoints and feedback.
Colleagues that are like family.
Amazing benefits, such as health and dental, as well as free lunches and days off.
You're challenged, but in the best way possible.","We're a start-up that's growing rapidly, so there are always going to be challenges that come with that."
144,WP Engine,Great Resume Booster or for Career Shift - Not for Pay,2020-02-06,4.0,Sales Executive,"Amazing culture, they are all very positive and focused on achievements and growing your career. Management really cares and is very invested in the individual's success.

They are really supportive of taking your own initiatives and doing passion projects while at work. They are open to all kinds of ideas on how to grow the business and provide better customer experiences. 

They really do follow their core value of ""where the best get better"" in supporting the individual contributor and leveling them up.

Of all the companies I've ever worked for or with, the most striking difference is that WP Engine actually is guided by its core values. And it even affects the sales teams - where often the sales teams have a completely different culture than the rest of the organization, sales is much more closely aligned with the overall culture at WP Engine.","At least in sales, the pay is lower than the standard for a downtown, technology outside sales role in Austin. They hire in sales one level down from matching your current level of experience and achievement, with a carrot for promotion in 6-12 months. Most solid sales reps are not intimidated by the opportunity to prove themselves both in their sales acumen and their business contributions.

However, this promotion rarely happens in under 1 year unless there is a perfect storm. So if money is important to you, this might not be the best fit.

They promote over-working and don't have a good work-life balance for the sales teams. It appears that other departments do liberally use the ""unlimited"" PTO, etc - but for sales, that rarely occurs. If you want to consistently keep it under 50 hours a week (when not traveling), that isn't going to happen at WP Engine, if the sales reps want to hit target."

Great people. 
Forward thinking. 
Driven by values and a great culture.
Actively engages on improving itself as an organisation.",No major cons come to mind. Every company has areas that need to improve but I can say that WP Engine continually seeks to improve itself as an organisation.
148,WP Engine,"supportive, flexible & empowering workplace with ample opportunity to grow",2020-01-20,5.0,Sales Consultant,"WP Engine invests a lot of time and money into ensuring that their new starters are trained and educated before starting their roles as well as providing continued education and training sessions to help further our product and industry knowledge. 

There are lots of opportunities to progress your career at WP Engine and management works with you to ensure you are placed in a role that works to your personal strengths. Even though Brisbane is a smaller (almost start up) office, there is room to grow and move around depending on what you want to do!

This company puts family first, they truly understand how important this is and offer the flexibility you need. As a parent, I haven't been made to feel guilty about taking time off or working from home to look after my child. 

Aside from the many benefits of working for WP Engine, the people have to be the number one reason I love working for this company. Walking into the office and seeing my team is the reason I start each morning in a good mood. It is rare to find people who are driven, smart and unconditionally supportive of one another.  Our leaders in Australia are incredible. Our leaders in the US & UK are incredible. No one is ever too busy to help you.

If you're determined and willing to commit time to educating yourself and always giving it 100% then you will do amazing at WP Engine","It's tough work, you get out what you put in and some days can be rough but it's all worth it!

Brisbane is still such a new office, we experience teething issues and are still trying to figure out what works best for us, but you will get this with any new company/ international office."
149,WP Engine,Culture at forefront. Career progression promises kept.,2020-01-19,5.0,Solutions Engineer,"The culture is amazing in the office and the company makes conscious steps to keep it open, honest, accepting, diverse and supportive. It truly feels like you are part of a family, and while the work can be difficult at times, there is the support there that you know everyone, from managers to your fellow colleagues, is going to do what they can to have your back. There's no toxic competition here, especially rare in a predominantly sales dominant environment. The executive team is amazing, special shout out to the CEO, Heather, who has a supernatural power to remember you as a person, and even your family, and your hobbies, and is so easily accessible and personal. Finally, the company has kept every promise it's made in terms of my career progression and personal growth, which allows me to plan my life and my family's life with security. If you are lucky enough to make it through the many interview rounds and find yourself joining the family, grab the opportunity with both hands.","What you gain in benefits, culture, growth, learning and work life balance, you give up a little in terms of remuneration. While HR says that the pay rates are competitive, there are definitely organizations that pay more out there. That being said, it depends on your priorities, and for most of the people that end up at WP Engine, that slight pay improvement doesn't make up for the other benefits.

Also processes are becoming increasingly rigid, policy driven, and so, WP Engine is no longer as agile as it used to be. However, that's what you exchange for a more resilient organization, and that's to be expected once you're a company edging on nearly 1000 employees."
150,WP Engine,"Great company, amazing people and culture!",2020-01-19,5.0,Sales Engineer,"Great company to work for, I always feel appreciated, and my managers are true leaders who treat me like a human, not a number.

Lots of flexibility in how I put in my time which gives me a great work/life balance.

I love the company culture, it was a big part of why I joined, and enjoy working with my team mates, both locally and across the globe.

I can highly recommend WP Engine as a career choice, not only is it a great place to work, but the scope for progression is amazing.","Other than maintaining communications across a global team, which any global company faces with timezone differences, I can not think of any cons."
151,WP Engine,"Protective of Culture, Amazing Company, CEO is incredible",2020-01-13,5.0,Sales,"Team culture, the family vibe & the real feeling of ""Be Here Be You"". 

Having worked for a company with a terrible reputation, its been a breath of fresh air working for someone who genuinely cares about you and your well being. 

The country manager here in Brisbane has been a wonderful influence and mentor throughout my time here and nothing is too much trouble.

Senior leadership based in Austin are extremely approachable & the teams in the London and Austin office always make time to catch up to have a 1-1 and share ideas. 

Career development is extremely important to the company and is one of the core values ""where the best get better"", they genuinely want to invest in your future here at WP Engine. 

You will need to be prepared to word HARD, this is not any normal sales position and for the first 6 months you will need to prepare to commit fully to training, development and out of hours learnings. Its worth it. 

We still have a start up feel here, so the team is very much like a family, we are all fiercely protective of one another and like any family there can be conflicts. These don't tend to last long as we all are trying to get to the same goal. 

Advice to anyone considering WP Engine; 

- Be prepared to work hard (and I mean REALLY hard)
- You will need to be driven and motivated
- Be your most authentic self from the very beginning
- Always ask for help and guidance, but be prepared to come up with your own ideas as well",Sometimes the communication from head office can be  slow and we have to find out or schedule meetings to get all the new information on product releases ect.

Great sense of company culture and actually following the beliefs the espouse. Customer inspired!","The pay and treatment of the support department is obviously different from the rest of the company.

The culture isn't a lie: it's legit, warm, and positive. Having such a great female CEO is a huge part of this as it comes from top down. I would follow Heather to the ends of the earth. The C-suite is wonderful, respected, and easily accessible and available.  The worker bees that are making the business run are some of the best people I've ever worked with. I genuinely love this place and my teams. I get to work cross-department easily and without fuss.

Benefits & compensation: Some of best I've ever had, although I know this isn't a company-wide belief. People really do take their vacations.","However, you quit our manager, not the job. Middle management is a huge problem. If you're not an engineer, it's near impossible to get promoted. Career development is either non-existent or constantly changing targets. The company encourages manager reviews, but don't do anything with the ones that are struggling. Employees are left feeling undervalued, underpaid, and burnt out. Working very hard and barely working  has the same rewards: none."
157,WP Engine,Awesome Culture = Awesome Company,2019-10-09,5.0,Vice President Marketing,"- Get to work with some of the most talented, driven and passionate people, especially in the marketing department, anywhere
- The cultural values are meaningless platitudes that hang on a wall; they're constantly living them, applying them and using them as a filter to guide decisions as a company
- Great ideas are celebrated here - everyone is encouraged to think about how they can contribute to the business, make their case and then run with it. Truly gratifying when the full force of the company pulls behind you on something like that.","- Food leaves something to be desired, especially as compared to what's available at other tech companies
- The facilities in most offices are great but in downtown Austin, while convenient, they're neither inspiring nor impressive."
158,WP Engine,It Ain't Perfect But It's Great,2019-10-08,4.0,"Manager, Sales Performance & Development","People First

WP Engine take a ""people first"" perspective and recognizes the value and contribution of its people as the sole driver of our ultimate success.  Consequently, engaging employees with empathy and compassion and seeing employees as people- and not simply corporate resources-  is woven into the cultural fabric of the company.  Put simple, WP Engine cares about its people and the people care about each other.  

Integrity and Trust

WP Engine does an amazing job of hiring people who will do what they say they'll do when they say they'll do it.  We don't have to stress the importance of being honest and reliable because we try to hire people for whom this is part of their value system.  As a result, WP Engine is more agile, quick, and nimble while moving at ""the speed of trust.""  

Collaboration and Cohesion

WP Engine maintains a highly collaborative environment where ideas, input, and feedback are both valued and solicited.  Stakeholders are keen to include insights and perspectives from other teams across the organization.  An argument _could_ be made that we over-emphasize  collaboration with perhaps too many meetings and too many invitees.  On the plus side, organizational leaders are becoming more aware of the need to balance collaboration with efficiency.","Accountability and Candor

Unfortunately, some of the pros above contribute to the cons.  The empathy and compassion that infuses our culture contributes to an environment where there is a seeming discomfort and or reluctance to provide candid performance feedback or hold others accountable for performance, quality, or results.   

Over-Thinking/Over-Solving

The answer to complex questions is not always as complex as the question itself.  It is not uncommon for us to devise complicated ""mousetraps"" on the whiteboard in lieu of simple and direct solutions.  In a fast paced and every changing environment such as WP Engine, simple works best.  Over-engineering (and over collaboration) often consumes our most valuable resource: time. 

Speed vs Quickness

WP Engine tends to emphasize speed over quickness.   By emphasizing speed and embracing ""Minimum Viability"" for our sometimes over-engineered solutions we create a dynamic where ideas take off fast and then get bogged down as the realization that we may have thought all the way through a problem before trying to solve it.   ""Do it right or do it twice.""

Fast, Cheap, Good: Pick Two

We tend to pick all three..."

If you're feeling overwhelmed where you're sitting you can take your workstation somewhere quiet and work from there, or break off into groups. Support has a lot of fun without compromising on our work. All departments are constantly looking at ways to make things better — not just for the bottom line, but for the customers and ourselves.

186,WP Engine,"A fun, challenging and honest environment",2019-01-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've worked with all shapes and sizes of organizations, from Fortune 10 to small non-profits. WPEngine is the only environment I've worked in that has truly put the walk to the talk when it comes to living the corporate values. Honesty and integrity are valued and encouraged, as are just simply being human and caring for one another. Failing fast and learning from mistakes are encouraged. If you want to do the right thing, work to better yourself and your co-workers and enjoy waking up in the morning to come to work, WPEngine is a great place to be. The work is challenging and there are plenty of opportunities to improve from the status quo.","The rate at which WPEngine is hiring and the growth they are seeking is fast. The goals are lofty but within reason. If you're eager to engage and help propel the business forward you will enjoy it. If you just want to punch a clock, you  won't be contributing to helping developing yourself and your team, and this wouldn't be the place for you. If you aren't an inclusively-minded person, you also probably won't enjoy it."

Core values upheld 
Customer at its core

Monthly driven business so constant push can be stressful if you are not used to this daily and weekly push."
188,WP Engine,Best place I've ever worked,2019-01-22,5.0,Staff Software Engineer,Great company vision. Coworkers are amazing. A great executive team is a galvanizing force for good middle management. Silos are minimal.,Compensation will not match biggest tech companies
189,WP Engine,Company values are alive every day.,2019-01-22,5.0,Site Lead/Senior Director of Support,"WP Engine continuously invests in its product, its customers, it locations and most importantly, its people. The company culture is evident in all 6 offices located in the US, Europe and Australia.  Personal development is embraced, WP Engine leadership is committed to ensuring the best get better. An environment where you are encouraged to do the right thing, and  honest mistaken are forgiven. What I love most is life-events happen, WP Engine works with everyone to ensure they've got your back.","If it is a ""con"", this high-paced dynamic environment, driven by continuous product and personal improvement, is not suited to everyone, but if you are customer inspired, aspiring to lead then this is the environment for you."
190,WP Engine,So happy I joined,2019-01-18,5.0,Employee Relations Org,"Scrappy and fun environment
Autonomy 
I get to make a lot of impact in my role
Great manager
Work-life balance
Flexible commuting hours
Lots of internal opportunities and growth",Not all clients/partners understand how larger companies work and the process that comes with growing a company to 600 people. This is a pretty minor complaint.
191,WP Engine,A very special place,2019-01-15,5.0,,"The culture at WP Engine is phenomenal. I've never seen anything like it, at any company of any size. To have this type of culture in a company of this size is a testament to the core values and abilities of the leadership. It's a very positive environment. Everyone cares about everyone, and that comes from the top down. 

You're not just a worker bee at WP Engine. You're a human being with a life outside of work, and the company is structured to ensure you're not working all the time and neglecting your personal life.

The attention to detail and quality is inspiring. The focus on customers is amazing. The insistence that we build a sustainable, profitable company is refreshing.

Teams are close and do lots of great work. Cross-team collaboration is top notch.

Planning for the quarter is done very well. We all know what we're working on and why we're doing it.

The positive energy is this place is unparalleled.",I honestly can't think of anything.
192,WP Engine,A lot of potential...but falls short,2019-01-08,3.0,Customer Support Specialist,"Company definitely embraces their culture, and there's nothing wrong with that at all, if you fit into that culture. The culture is very friendly and easy going, typical geek culture for techies and geeks alike. When I worked there, meals were provided daily, social engagement amongst employees was encouraged, work was very straight forward and getting time off for family emergencies or events was pretty easy to do. Lots of really friendly and knowledgeable people there, and management is always open for comments/suggestions.","This being a relatively small company, and HQ in Austin, the San Antonio office was very lacking in room to grow. In this sense specifically, if you're wanting to move up the tech support ladder, it's a good place to be. If you want to get your foot in the door at a tech company and move into another, more specialized department, forget it unless you want to move to Austin. Additionally, annual reviews for opportunistic raises/promotions are almost non-existent and personal favoritism from management plays a bigger role than job performance. Good place to get started, not a great place to stay long term (unless you want to move to Austin). Pay could be better, but the work environment is very chill, so if you don't care as much about money/success/progression you would likely enjoy your time here."
193,WP Engine,Wonderful place with amazing leadership,2018-12-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Culture: it's not about the free food, snacks, drinks after work. It's about morals, ethics, values. This place generally has that. 
- Interesting work: you'll likely be working with cutting edge tech
- Access to leadership: by and large, the executives are pretty generous with their time. A great asset if you take advantage of it.
- Transparency: they generally let you know what's going on with the business, and what the major strategic initiatives are. That's pretty cool. 
- Training: fairly generous with training. Some of it has even been more on the personal growth, vs professional growth side.","- Risk averse: as the investor money has poured in, leadership at times takes FOREVER to pick a path, and go with it. When it takes various quarters, you're taking too long. Especially in this industry. 
- Pay/equity seems to be generally below market.
- Backwards in some things. For example, want a standing desk? Better get a Drs note. Want to work from home? Better have a good excuse and not make a habit of it. Don't try to customize your desk area too much either. 
- Social pressure: if you're an introvert, you'll probably feel pressured at times to be more social, and do more stuff outside of work than you'll want. 
- Product and R&D isn't  pushed: most engineers are rarely at the office past 5pm. Deadlines are often missed and pushed. There isn't a culture of working hard to make deadlines.  Do anyone of us believe the Amazon, Google, Apple's of the world got that by not holding themselves accountable to timely deliverables?"
194,WP Engine,truly values-driven company,2018-09-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,WP Engine is the first place I've worked where the values are more than a nice thing on the wall.  They are truly held up as a guidepost for decision-making from the executive team down.  It's an amazing culture.,Wish there was a formalized flexible working policy.
195,WP Engine,Great company,2018-09-04,4.0,Software Engineer,Very Flexible and opportunities to learn new technologies,Initial growing pains for remote workers
196,WP Engine,Culture of Feminism at WP Engine,2018-08-30,2.0,Technical Support L2,Good benefits and compensation.,"The majority female executives have taken over the company and created a culture steeped feminism. This takeover occurred not by equal opportunity hiring processes, but by Heather Brunner networking with other women outside of work for the purpose of seeding more women into WPE's leadership roles.  WPE's leadership justifies this by fancying themselves as contributing towards a greater social good by righting the wrongs they perceive to be perpetrated by men. But this is flagrant discrimination. As a consequence of feminist company culture, men are seen as accomplices to the oppressive patriarchy responsible for holding women down, and the low number of women in the tech field. To keep out people who are not onboard with this program, WPE has put together a majority female talent recruiting team.  When WPE recruiters speak about who they look for in a candidate, they have clearly stated that no matter how qualified a person may be, if they are not considered a cultural fit then they will not be hired. What does it mean to be a culture fit? Subscribe to feminism. If you're not onboard with feminism, then you will have a hard time being hired and keeping your employment."
197,WP Engine,Culture Driven from the Top Down,2018-08-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Culture & Values - WP Engine stands by it's values form the c-suite down.

There's room for growth *if* you figure out how to grow (that's not something that will be done for you.),All the positives are also negatives if you don't like them.

-A TON of opportunity to grow personally and contribute noticably
-Solid Healthcare
-Positive culture that lives their values (I put this a second time because its not only true but its even true to the degree that you dare not even hope for, coming into it)","While nowhere is perfect, the things they do well and don't do well they are 100% honest and open about and actively work to improve those things. Its a young company and so its undergoing a some updating of legacy practices that were done ""in the moment"" out of survival or inexperience, but they now have world class leaders actively solving these problems. Really no cons thus far."
201,WP Engine,Sales Development Rep,2018-03-08,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Lots of 'perks', unlimited PTO at the time of this review. Bi-monthly pay, great health insurance options available.","At least in Sales, they don't really allow you to work remotely unless you're sick.

Its disheartening to lose great team members due to higher than average turnover 
It aims to become a top heavy organization 
Has a high school atmosphere, people are very cliquey and most decisions happen behind the scenes

- Catered lunches 
- Stocked snack closet 
- Transparency with how the company is doing 
- Unlimited PTO 
- Flexible office hours 
- Free account with WP Engine","-Took individual stand-up desks away because they didn't look ""aesthetically pleasing""

-Many people are more into socializing than doing actual work. This makes it a difficult work environment to excel in, yet alone concentrate

-Marketing team is essentially a social club, unless you know how to schmooze and suck up to upper management, don't expect to be noticed or excel in your career for hard work. You could get away with doing the bare minimum or work very hard, it'll be noticed the exact same. It's all about how you can talk yourself up, despite how well you execute

-There are many cliques within the Marketing team itself

-Many people say the culture is their favorite thing about the company, but really the culture is about drinking and socializing outside of work - hard to maintain a work/life balance if you're into that 

-Marketing is the most ""un-lean"" department in the company. They've already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on paid advertising this year alone, yet have minimally invested in members to actually produce the content that’s being promoted"

Unlimited time off, provided food, health care was paid for by the company.","WP Engine promotes learning with different organizations within the company, however be mindful that they will fire you for looking outside of your organization."
205,WP Engine,Pros and Cons of Working at WP Engine,2017-06-20,5.0,Technical Support,There is a great culture here where I would consider this a 2nd family with how we take care of each other.  You are surrounded by the best of the best and are free to shadow or learn more.  The benefits are great also.  You are given everything you need to be successful at your job without being micro managed to death.  They hold you accountable as an adult which goes a long way.,"The pay could be a lot better regarding promotions and moving to other positions internally.   Since they do not have a set path for Technical Support after Level 2,  it is easy to become stagnant and lose interest in the job.   This drives an increase of employees leaving the company for opportunities to grow elsewhere.  It can be 'clickish' at times but for the most part everyone is cool."
206,WP Engine,Was able to actually contribute as an Intern,2017-05-24,5.0,,Good people. I was assigned projects that actually helped the business. I felt like I was making an impact. There was a lot to do and a huge opportunity to learn.,"Still a start up, going through growing pains."
207,WP Engine,Hands down the best company Ive ever worked for,2017-05-09,5.0,WP Engine,"THE most supportive leadership team there is,  where staff are encouraged to share all ideas. In the heart of DT with incredible views, & all the other perks that come with a great tech company. The people who work here feel privileged to be here, as the screening process is not an easy one. Genuinely a fun, challenging, and rewarding place to come to every day. The culture and people are amazing.","Not really a con, but it us ultra competitive and your peers are all alpha players. If you are in support be prepared to go above beyond in order to advance. If your'e a person who likes pushing yourself and feel rewarded by going the extra mile, then this is the place for you."
208,WP Engine,Growth Strategy Representative,2017-05-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great culture, people are vested in delivering the best",It is very much a culture however where you don't want to step on people's toes and you don't want to hurt people's feelings.
209,WP Engine,Great Company,2017-04-12,5.0,,Incredible team and benefits. You have complete support and honest feedback to your new ideas.,Growing pains as any medium company but the values in place are truly acted upon.
210,WP Engine,Best. Culture. Ever.,2017-03-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The people are absolutely fantastic. There is a fantastic energy every time I walk into the building,You need to be used to working at a startup (or a similar atmosphere). This is NOT for people who prefer a corporate structure.
211,WP Engine,Technical Support,2017-03-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Excellent culture and environment to work on, Lots of opportunity for time off and good benefits.","Lack of Transparency in recent years, lack of promotion opportunities in technical roles, and poor communication to employees."
212,WP Engine,Great place to work in Support,2017-02-02,5.0,Customer Support Representative,Working in support here has been better than any other company I have worked for.,The workload can get high - they should probably hire more support agents.
213,WP Engine,Great Experience at WP Engine,2017-01-20,5.0,Customer Experience Manager,"WP Engine has a truly amazing culture, which is reinforced by an amazing leadership team. The teams you are apart of and the people you work with make coming into work each day a joy. You quickly find that people are more than coworkers, they are friends, that chose to continue hanging out even after office hours. 

Additionally, for the most part, customers love WP Engine. Truly, I've never seen anything like it. Just check out the Twitters. I think this stems from the support and the service that they receive and the ability for the folks talking to clients to be themselves. There are no scripts and everyone is enabled to do the right thing for the customer and the business. 

Other Pros: lunch provided (M-Th), downtown parking, great city views, cool working environment, quarterly company events (""All Hands,"" Picnics, Holiday Party), growth opportunities","Things move very quickly. The company has experienced hyper-growth, which brings along some long hours, quick changes in direction, and some challenges with ""keeping up."" You have to be okay with rapid change and be very flexible to be successful here. What is a priority one minute may be something completely different the next. Other than that, I find very little cons about the company."
214,WP Engine,Great company with values that will stand the test of time...,2017-01-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Excellent leadership that leads by example, holds employees and themselves accountable, and is fully accessible. 

Great place to learn and make an impact along the way - high empowerment.

Fun environment that works hard and plays hard.

Need to be nimble and agile to be successful, innovative and collaborative."
215,WP Engine,WP Engine Sales,2016-12-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"WP Engine is a great company to work for. It takes 'transparency' (a common ""rah-rah"" type claim for most start ups) to the next level, which is an awesome trait.

The management at WP Engine are inspiring, all levels are humble, intelligent, ultra ethical and just great people, which makes working for them a pleasure. The level of sincerity displayed is also so refreshing, it's great.

The business rewards those that work hard and the ability to move up is available for those whom seek it. 

The lunches Mon-Thur are usually decent and the other standard perks you'd expect are all there also - Free sodas, candy, snacks, bread, coffee, tea, etc.

The business has a genuine 'unlimited vacay' policy... Which of course isn't actually unlimited but they are very accommodating of time off and typically encourage it... which again is something most sales Org's don't promote.

The whole business does great things for others also, from our give back programs to self initiated good deeds for fellow colleagues, WP Engine is a very inclusive and supportive place.","I don't think it's too much of a con personally, but to get ahead you're going to want to work hard, and be available at all hours to get the job done.... I'd say this is pretty standard for any hungry, aggressively growing start up... But if you are coming from a card punching 9-5 role, you're probably not going to like it."

217,WP Engine,Great Culture and Outstanding Leadership,2016-12-21,5.0,Technical Support,"Everyone is very helpful, friendly and capable at WP Engine. Leadership and management are inspiring. They are truly dedicated to your success and take feedback seriously. The company is growing fast and now has global offices. With this growth the company has been able to hold on to a culture that makes it such a great place to work. 

I really appreciate that diversity is valued. There wasn't a ramp up to a time where I felt comfortable just being myself. Everyone here is warm and accepting from the start no matter who you are. Much of the leadership team and management are women which is really awesome to see in a tech company. One of the greatest reasons I am happy to work here is how technical the job is and how much I learn on a daily basis. 

It is also really great that WP Engine is committed to giving back to the community through charity, to the open source community by contributing to WordPress, and also helping to democratize content publishing for the world as a whole. It sounds out there, but I'm serious. It gives me so much fulfillment to know my day to day work is going a long way to help people find their presence or make their livelihood on the web.","The company is growing so fast that you may have to continually adapt to a lot of changes. All of the adjustments have been for the better so far. Along with that, the entire company works at a fast-pace. This is not so much stressful, but things move very quickly. 

There is a lot of opportunity to grow in your career especially with the growth of the company, but it is definitely competitive with the amount of smart and capable people here. 

If you work far from downtown the commute kind of stinks depending on what time you work, but the company does reimburse fully if you use the rail or bus.

The company offers a 401k plan, but does not contribute as of yet. Otherwise the benefits are really great with 100% paid medical, dental, and vision for employees."

Lots of friendly staff who are eager to welcome in new hires and integrate them into the lively culture of WP Engine. If you are excited by growth and change, then this is great fit. Travel opportunities, and a lot of chances to learn other aspects of tech outside of your specific role.","Too high a ratio of sales staff to managers - definitely need more one-on-one time & sales floor leadership.

Celebratory culture outside of engineering","The engineering management is unstable.  No management from 2 years ago is still with the company.  The current engineering management regime is more political and favoritism laden than previous leadership.  

The CTO & founder has gone from directly involved and connected with the engineering team to being aloof and distance.  His role has been greatly diminished over the last year.

The managers that are left (except 1) have little technical capabilities and are more focused on ""moving JIRA issues"" and metrics than software development.

The majority of work these days is either supporting the legacy systems or attempting to move hosting to AWS / Google.  New project's and innovation in software development are almost completely dead.

A lot of budget tightening since the data breach in Dec. 2015.  A lot of walls were put in place after that to make things more ""secure"", but really just made it harder to do anything."

Each individual hits the ground running, with high expectations once they are in full swing with their position.

Decent quarterly parties
Several very smart engineers","NOT A TECH COMPANY.  WP Engine is really a support company.  Supporting individual customers and all their crazy decisions until everything falls apart.  What a customer wants is always trumps technical decisions.
A lot of the technology is dated and new ideas and technologies are impossible to implement.
Good managers are far and few between.  There are a lot of politics and favorites.
There is a lot of kool-aid drinking.  The core values they preach are only followed if it matches the company's needs.
Very little planning.  Work is only done on things that are broken that very minute.
Plan on working a lot.  It is not uncommon to work 80 hour weeks because some customer broke their wordpress site.
They will ""ask you to leave"" if they do not like your ideas.  I saw this happen to people.  You have to make the right people happy or you are gone.
Not a happy place to work."

Turnover is high, and leadership is letting really great people go who actually care about the team.  There is a lack of trust in our leaders today and it's getting worse.  But we smile and show a good face.  Marketing is a really tough place to work.  People have to do what their told and there's a lot of resistance in change. The teams are silo'd and it's heard to break this pattern because the people leading us don't know how. Leaders don't trust us to do our job and micromanage every task. 

No room for growth.

Recognition comes to people who work all the time - all the time!"

This company does an amazing job of making customers happy and it has shown in the fast growth. Come help us do that at scale.,"We are growing so fast that you might not be the right fit if you can't adapt quickly, because you need to be able to work without your job cleanly defined for you.

The projects are very interesting, and the scale is unlike most other places you'll work at in Austin.","It can be difficult to have a good work-life balance especially if you're the technical lead on a project.

Free food, wonderful opportunity to learn or grow one's business-savvy. The leadership team does a stellar job educating employees around finances and how enterprise-level decisions are made.","Teams are quite territorial, and cross-team collaboration can be very difficult. The company doesn't seem to have concrete plans for where they want to go: the long-term roadmap is very muddy. The company's product strategy seems to change regularly, and the marketing strategy is non-existent. 

There's also a strong cult of personality/Kool Aid thing happening here. If you don't want to spend your free time with your coworkers, playing games and drinking and goofing off, you're deemed a poor culture fit, and woe to anyone who wants to be successful here if that happens. The result is the company skews young and inexperienced, as older, more established people aren't super interested in all the ""fun and foosball"" of the Austin tech startup scene."

The pay seems to be worth the squeeze. 

Transparency is pretty good around here.

You should know working for a new company is going to be challenging and frustrating at times, but the payoff at the end is what makes it all worth it. Payoff in being what you learned and what you can use for the future. You need to take a big picture approach when it comes to thinking about working here. It is ok, it is not for everyone. 

The culture should not change either if this place decides to go public all C-Team personnel have already worked for publicly traded companies which means they don't have to leave.","The place could be a bit more clean and organized, sad but true as adults not everyone cleans up their own messes. 

The training dept is growing and learning, so at times you will be tasked to take initiative and learn on your own. If you have a hard time doing that, don't apply."

266,WP Engine,Best company I have ever worked for IMHO,2014-07-15,5.0,Support Engineer,"WP Engine has great benefits, they show how they really care about their employees. Every day brings new challenges that are engaging and cause you to keep learning. I work around a group of motivated and fun people that work as a team to help make sure that our customers are happy. Our CEO walks in every morning with a smile on her face, knows the names of just about everyone  here and takes a moment to ask how you are doing, not how the queues are, but how I am doing as a person and how my family is. 

They feed us all the time. Not only is there a pantry full of snacks, there is a soda machine, stuff to make sandwiches and most time lunch is catered (4/5 days out of the week). We have unlimited PTO but just about everyone loves working here so much that we take less PTO then jobs where you get two weeks off per year. Full medical, dental and vision insurance, 100% paid by WP Engine.","A few co-workers are difficult to interact with, don't embrace our culture or work ethic. To some extent I feel like those individuals will eventually drop out and not affect the work environment. If you can manage to keep your distance you can really enjoy the people that really care about doing a good job and making the culture better."

People get very close and WPE hires people that fit a certain culture and have a certain mentality. We're very social, driven, and intelligent people who strongly care about the work we do and making our customers happy, but we also love to have fun. If you work hard, learn as much as you can, and contribute, it's easy to be recognized by everyone in the company. If you have a good idea, management will always listen. It doesn't matter if you're Level 1 support or TechOps -- a good idea is a good idea. I've seen many employees suggestions (including mine) be implemented. The potential for personal growth is astounding, especially coupled with the fact that the company is growing at a ridiculous rate.

Plus, free parking in a parking garage downtown. That's pretty sweet.","The only bad thing I can really think of is that people might feel pressured to work lots of overtime. Management loves seeing people put in OT (unlimited OT!...for now, at least) and the people that work a lot obviously tend to get recognized more, so I can see how people might feel bad for not working OT. But really, as long as you put in your 8 hours and do good work, people aren't going to view you poorly. People have lives and can't always be at work, and everyone knows that."
