3,Wag!,"Nice company, great work culture, abrupt leave",2022-03-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I love the work culture at Wag! and the people there. The people are humble, open to feedback, and excited about their business. I've learned a lot through working at Wag! and am excited about the new changes as their company has recently gone public.","One con is that I was given one day notice that I was laid off. I had gotten a pay raise the week prior, and I did not expect to be laid off at any point. The morning of, I had been asked to go on a call with my managers and they told me the news. After I had gotten off the call, I had thought I had the whole day to say my goodbyes and share the news with my team and my team under me, however I immediately lost all access to my Slack, email, the tools. There was no way I could go back on the systems, and I was left hung out to dry.
 I wasn't told ""when"" was my last day either, and following up about it with my manager afterward, she admitted she didn't expect HR to respond that quickly. This was such a shocking abrupt transition for me, and it was an emotional blow as I loved working at Wag! & being with the people at Wag! very much, and I took my role very seriously. Otherwise, I love Wag! and love Wag!'s business. They were not looking to backfill my position, too, and despite how abrupt the news was, because of this I was able to thoughtfully think about what my next move is, and am confident in my job search now."

8,Wag!,Good if you don't run into any problems,2022-01-26,3.0,Dog Walker,"I made some easy side money by working with (mostly) great dogs and their owners. I've used Wag during two different eras - pre and post VC. During the pre-venture capital days, I had an amazing experience with Wag. The support team was super helpful and responsive. I felt genuinely appreciated by the support team and I could tell they enjoyed working for Wag.","However, post-VC is a very different story. I ran into an issue when I was working with a new dog and the lack of urgency in my situation was shocking. Support seemed to be severally apathetic. Upon working with them more, I also couldn't blame them. They were severely understaffed and were told to stick to a script when working with walkers and their issues. Otherwise, some of the staff members were wonderful to talk with. Despite being a national company, there is only one call center in Arizona working with all the time zones."

Current CEO is immature, manipulative and exudes narcissistic behavior. He has also been inappropriate with the way he'd talk to employees (nothing sexual, but not something you wouldn't expect from someone in the leadership role).

Back in December the company laid off roughly 80% of the workforce. There was complete lack of empathy and integrity in how it was handled. The people that still work there likely don't want to be out here looking for work during a pandemic and other disasters that continue to happen in the Bay Area (and country overall). I don't blame them, but I can guarantee you that these ""positive"" reviews were probably encouraged by the ""leadership"" to try and make the company look better than what it is.

The saying ""one bad apple can spoil the bunch"" could not be more true here. The company had so much potential if the leadership wasn't poisoning it."

I came into the office to put a 2 week notice (as customary to leave in good terms) . This manager immediately said that they ( or he) were not going to work with me and didn’t give me options. He then said, like with a tone of enjoyment or feeling empowered that my resignation was going to be effective immediately.
I asked to get paid since I wanted to work my 2 last weeks. He then came up with a bs excuse that because I am new, it was gonna be a waste of money and bla bla bla...

What a nightmare. Thank God this happened and they showed their true colors.
All this headache and nepotism for 15.50 an hour. No thanks.

It’s a shame because I liked majority of my coworkers and the office is close to home."

Nice coworkers","Everything else. Ever since new leadership came in things have changed for the worse under the guise that things are getting better. Yes they've been working on improvements to the extremely outdated app BUT the quality of the service they provide and their walkers has been severely lowered in favor of approving as many walkers on to the app as possible. They used to care about walkers having experience but now they hire walkers who have never walked or cared for a dog a day in their life. I'd come into work every day and internally scream at the poor decision making. I'd never use the service and that is telling. Sure there are some great walkers but the risk is NOT worth it. There is also terrible nepotism, cherry picking, and favoritism. Poor performers get rewarded and promoted if they know the right people. Did I mention the below average pay?

1. Managers
2. Supervisors
3. Sr. Agents

The management team in the AZ office needs A LOT of improvement. The managers are barely visible. We understand that it gets busy and there are  meetings that cannot be missed, but you cannot expect your employees to trust you when you are not building a relationship. 1:1’s are not consistent and are sometimes done out in the open where everyone else can hear the conversation. The supervisors are not always approachable and some don’t know the full knowledge of Wag! Which makes it difficult to ask for help. The Sr. agents play favorites. All they do is go on smoke breaks with other employees and talk crap about how much they hate the job which I find very unprofessional, especially if your being paid $18 an hour to help support the team. The whole leadership team also yell at the employees a lot. No one wants to be micromanaged, especially by a group of people who do not see eye to eye with each other and do not lead by example."

For example, the entire Engineering team regularly holds presentations (presented by any member of the team that wants to present) on new and exciting technologies, as well as Wag! platform internals.

There are always challenges to solve, from reducing technical debt to developing growth initiatives. While there aren't many doors to have an open door policy for, the management and directors at Wag! have an open comms policy and take every suggestion into account. 

Additionally, the compensation is great, as are the benefits.","1. Slightly outdated workflow, but always getting better. 
2. Lots of non-technical manual QA (in addition to automated tests). This can be a good thing for black box testing, but needing to explain how to do basic developer tasks in order to get a feature out is a little disenchanting. 
3. Wag! went through some big upper-level management changes in the last year, which has had awesome effects through the organization, from emphasis on lean development to adoption of best practices to remove technical debt. However, much of the middle management has remained, while new engineers have been brought on, which causes a bit of friction as there can be competing values and ideas being presented to engineers. This is actively being worked on, in the form of public forum communication as well as an emphasis on sharing organizational priorities and policies company wide."

If you are being harassed or bullied and you tell your manager or lead, they do nothing and tell you to email HR. They will most likely not do a thing about it. One rep was forced to wear a mens tee for a week straight because they thought her clothes were too sexy even though many others dressed the same. 

They dont care about anything than revenue. Unwilling to fix safety issues for the walkers and dogs that they make their money off of. Don't provide training materials and dogs are often harmed and walkers are bit, some even need serious medical attention which Wag! does not compensate them for. The owners are allowed to keep dangerous dogs on the platform with no consequence. No proof of vaccinations are required. You will make $.75 above minimum wage to calm walkers after being attacked and owners if their dog is injured or worse all day long.

130,Wag!,"Stay far, far away.",2018-07-31,1.0,Customer Care Representative,"- The lunches are catered, which is nice, but what they don't tell you is that the food is the cheapest slop they can find and it regularly gives people food poisoning. Some days the food is literally inedible.

- The health benefits are great.","Management is completely incompetent at every level. People are usually promoted based on if they're buddies with the current management and not their actual ability to manage. This results in most of them having no idea what they're doing day to day and zero ability to handle managing a team of people which very negatively impacts the employees. Policy frequently changes without employees being told, people get told to do one thing and do it then get written up for not doing it another way, leadership makes agreements they don't honor later, leads hand off their responsibilities like handling escalated calls to regular reps, and so on. It got so bad that they had a week where they took people 12 at a time into another room and wrote down feedback on every way management was completely failing its job, and it covered an entire wall. Guess what changed after those meetings? Absolutely nothing.

It's no surprise people drop like flies at Wag. Either they get fed up with the incompetence and misbehavior of management and quit with a fiery Slack post or they speak up and management finds some flimsy excuse to fire them. Also when you get fired they give you a severance pay but in order to get that you have to sign away any and all right to take action against them for literally anything, including violating the Civil Rights Act. Not shady at all, right?

Add onto this the general dissaray of day to day operations compounded by systems that break and are designed poorly in the first place, policies that encourage lying to dog owners and walkers, lying to employees, poor treatment of employees with disabilities, poor treatment of LGBT employees, etc, and you have a miserable place to work that is absolutely not worth the table scraps they pay you.

Allowed to choose your times for a permanent schedule! Uses an app that allows you to drop/swap shifts without going through managers! Diverse and absolutely wonderful coworkers!","FAVORITISM: You need to either live with the managers, party with them, or threaten to quit to get promoted. If you do get promoted without doing any of those mentioned, they’ll only do it if they have no other options. Dress code has been implemented, however, managers still wear outfits that are considered against dress code, and some of their (favorite) employees get away with this too.
HR: A lot of complaints have been met with mediocre solutions. Asking to stay anonymous may not work whatsoever. Agrees to write up employees without verbal warnings/documentation. Seemingly sides more with the company than the employees.
RUDE MANAGEMENT: Some managers are rude. I once heard an employee being berated in public for being on their phone. If you do ask for help at the wrong time, you may be given attitude.
UNCLEAR GUIDELINES: Rules change all the time and it’s definitely understandable. But if an employee gets flack because a manager had given the wrong information, something wasn’t communicated well.
TURNOVER RATE: The amount of people getting fired/quitting has been going up recently. Some have quit because of said write ups that were given out of nowhere. Some were fired for being outspoken about the treatment they’ve received.

-Everyone is positive.  At my last job, everyone complained the entire time.  At Wag!, you just talk about work and what needs to get done.  Drama?  Ain't nobody got time for that!

However, at the end of the day I am happy we actually receive complimentary lunch everyday and even on the weekends working for this company."

159,Wag!,STAY AWAY,2017-07-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,ZERO - literally the worst company.,"This company is horrible! They have zero respect for works and clients - they will literally hire anyone just to fill it up with walkers. It hurts both walkers and customers, walkers can't get walks because the demand isn't there and owners have inexperienced people taking care of their pets! It's a HORRIBLE company - I used to work for the Chicago department and Wag HQ is so unorganized with a huge lack of communication this company is seriously a JOKE. 

Employees - do not apply! It's not worth it and there are better part time/side jobs. 

Owners- don't trust this app for your pups!!"
