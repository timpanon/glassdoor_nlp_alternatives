3,Waitr  ,Horrible Upper management with too many run arounds.,2022-03-20,2.0,Order Processor,They were very loose with a lot of things but mostly in a concerning way and not in a good way. I honestly don't have much to say good about this company I wouldn't recommend it to any would be customer or employee.,HR would constantly ignore me as well as anybody else that wasn't a common team lead. Management is ALWAYS moving around because no one wants to work here. Your job isn't same and you will be replaced whenever they feel like it. They don't care about you and will do anything to save a couple bucks. You would be better off if you only used them to look at menus because their product is awful and working for them wasn't good either.

-gas mileage reimbursement for when you travel to restaurant partners/marketing events","The Market Success Associate position for Waitr is one of the most useless positions a delivery app could have, in my opinion. They frequently changed our expectations because executive leadership knows this position is pointless. Market Sucess Associates do everything but help a market grow and become successful. Once they added a sales quota to this position, I had to get the heck out of there. Doordash and Grubhub are eating Waitr alive, and it was demoralizing when I had to visit a restaurant partner, and they said that they wanted to cancel the service due to low orders on the app."

17,Waitr  ,A Company Going Through A Transition Period and Rebrand,2022-01-18,3.0,Partner Growth Manager,"I worked out of the Boston office for 10 months. They have a small inside sales team. It was all over the phone sales and through email and text. 

Our team was allowed to come into the office and work from home. New hire training was thorough and straight forward through a program called Lessonly. There was not much micro managing going on when I started but that changed towards the end of my tenure.","Waitr is currently going through a rebrand and a transition period. It makes sense for them to do so. Go check out last years stock performance. 

They are slowly but surely moving away from 3rd party restaurant delivery services and they are primarily focusing on credit card processing and cannabis delivery. This transition happened for our office overnight and we were expected to put up numbers immediately.

I specifically took the opportunity to work with Waitr to get out of the credit card processing industry and I ended right back in it. So I wasn't too thrilled about that.

Communication from top to bottom got pretty bad towards the end of my tenure at Waitr. Thats when the transition period started. Things changed daily and weekly and all of us were just confused after weekly meetings and updates.

Work was pretty fun when I started. It was not fun at all before I left. It was high stress and you better hit your numbers or else."

- HR department has poor leadership. Direction of the team is cloudy at best. There seems to be plenty of talk, but no walking the walk. Despite huge lip service to the value of technology, no real use/optimization of existing tools. Plenty of talk about making it a great place to work with virtually no action.

They cancel my location and I was unaware until I spoke with another employee but luckily I transferred to a different location and started. 
Never met my manager and barely spoke with his. I had one day of training and was left in the woods.
Then the worst of all is they fired us mid workshift in the middle of a work week on a zoom meeting within 15 mins of the call and could not even show their faces. 
They have been unorganized since I started and everyone in the department seems clueless and they do not communicate with each other at all.

It's not about networking it's about being on someone's good side. And when I mean about being on someone's good side it's about being on the Management's good side or knowing somebody who knows management or who is a friend of management. This is the only way to move up in the company. If you don't know anything about this. You might as well just not even try. We even had a co-worker get fired and then turn around the next day and even get promoted the next following day. It didn't make sense.

To me, the pay was awesome-because it's my first job in over 11 years, so earning anything is exciting. I'm just starting, but I talked to a woman who also works for waitr, as well as door dash and uber. She never comes home with less than 100 a day. This is a perfect job if your trying to gain job experience-no interview, very simple application process (they pretty much accept anyone who can pass a background check). It's a great way to build your self confidence.","Be careful when using the google maps-the default gps on the waitr drivers app. It will take you to the wrong house many times. Get a good GPS system-which is what i plan on getting tomorrow. Be careful about accepting orders that are to far out there. It won't be worth your time or money spent in gas.

- People who are able to be in charge of Customer Service Agents as ""team leads"" do not need any experience in what they do and just interview randomly and they are suddenly promoted to team leads if they are personally liked by the person who does the hiring.
- Company does not allow breaks when they see rushes for lots of orders coming through.
- Company (worked for the Bite Squad division) fired Mexican team which kept operations smooth, then scheduled every American worker for double shifts and none of us knew that this was illegal, they did this without any of our consent and threatened to ""point us"" if we missed any of the work.
- Team leads became quite rude.

* Very few perks. 
 - Pay is on the low side. Not competitive with other related company for same role. 
 - They do not pay for a portion of your internet or phone. 
 - No bonuses or any other type of appreciation for jobs well done. 
 - They offer free delivery to those who live within delivery areas. If you live outside a delivery area, you get nothing. Recommendations were sent to HR to include everyone in this perk but HR's reply was basically ""too bad"". 
* Upper Management only meets/talks to employees when something is wrong, never to say thanks or offer a job well done.
* Lack of communication between most departments. Most people in Engineering have no idea what is going on, who is working on what, what build is going to be released, what's involved in the release...it's a disaster every week and very frustrating
* Reviews were done behind employees back between managers and HR. We were not involved until it was complete and were not allowed to offer feedback. Outstanding reviews received no cost of living increase. 
* No cost of living increase in two years of employment
* Promised 401k was coming upon hire but two years went by without it. They recently started one and they do not match. 
* Reactive company, not proactive. One person edited a comment in Slack so they locked down everyone's access. Rather than punishing the problem, they punished everyone. They do not trust their employees to even have edit access to comments, even when it means leaving possible inaccurate information in Slack."

It was just a job to make some extra cash while in school, and it was not the best. The nice thing about it was the work was simple, and you really did not have to deal with customers. You would be able to drive and listen to whatever in your car.","I consistently made about 15/hr working 20 hours a week at first but once Fall 2019 hit, I was making about 11/hr. The reason I give it low rating is because they repeatedly lied to employees and benefits were not that great. I've heard plenty of stories of them promising something and then messing up someone's taxes cause it was wrong. You also have to upkeep your car on your own paycheck. Just work at Starbucks cause you get health insurance at 20 hours a week."

Before the newest CEO took over (6 months ago), sales people had the opportunity to make a ton of money. Most of us who were solid producers were making between 100-200k per year. With recent management changes and having a new CSO (chief sales officer) as of July 2020, the opportunity to grow and succeed has become impossible. They recently changed the compensation plan, and those of us making 100-200k, are now going to be in the 50-70k range. They are turning the culture into a high-turnover, boiler room where applicants are promised potential high earnings but it will never be a reality. Save yourself time & heartache, and DO NOT APPLY."

Any feedback that questions established procedures seen as ""Hostile"" or ""Aggressive"" management seems to think they know what's best despite obvious systemic issues from established procedures due to the fact that they wrote the procedures and they ""Have been doing this so much longer than you have."" At least in my small bubble, leadership seemed far too emotionally attached to their work to take any level of constructive feedback seriously unless it panders to their existing beliefs of how things should be done.

Departments don't seem to care if what they do negatively affects other departments ""Were here to do our job, not theirs, theyll figure it out""
Nine times out of ten, new procedures come out half baked and create more problems than solutions."

Constant walking and lifting the hotbag helped me lose weight.","Continuous policy & app changes that make the job more difficult than it already is. The apps required to work with took up a lot of space on my phone, causing it to constantly crash while on shift. My car was worn to the ground in the span of 3-4 months, didn’t make enough to pay for the repairs. In hindsight, it did more damage for me than good; fair warning to anyone that applies, you don’t get paid nearly enough for what you have to deal with."

Ex:

) Being told as a driver to drive 15+ miles to a restaurant to pick up food when there are other drivers closer.

) Being told to fetch a 15+ mile delivery then expected to have your eyes glued to your phone while driving (Which is a incredible life threatening risk) in the event the dispatcher (Who is seated 3-4 states away in an office or remote space) decides to take away your expected delivery to another driver.

I legitimately feared for my life.","*You have to keep four apps open at the same time, and none of them refresh. So whilst you are running around all over town like a chicken with your head cut off, there is a ""Dash Operator"" that keeps calling you WHILE YOU ARE DRIVING to tell you to PICK UP YOUR PHONE AND REFRESH THE APP. 
These apps use a MASSIVE amount of your phone's processor power. I have a friend who delivers for another company now who actually MELTED HIS PHONE from running all those programs at once.
*NO COMPENSATION FOR MILAGE OR DAMAGE TO YOUR VEHICLE THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT

However, if certain shifts are continually short on people, they will make it mandatory that you pick one of those shifts up. So much for ""making your own schedule"".","They pay $5 an hour plus tips. The hourly rate barely covers gas which means whether or not you get a decent check rests completely on the customer's shoulders. They do not pay mileage. $5 an hour plus tips is all Waitr pays you, period. So that's you on the road, taking all the risk, putting miles on your car, paying for your own gas, tires, oil changes, insurance, etc to deliver food for Waitr and make them money while they compensate you next to nothing. If you get into a car accident while on the clock, it's still your problem; not theirs. Your insurance premium will go up, your car will be wrecked and Waitr bares no responsibility whatsoever and does nothing to reimburse your losses. Almost all the money I made ended up being put right back into my car because of all the extra miles I was putting on it to make Waitr money. The delivery areas are huge. I was driving on average 120 miles a shift; FOR $5 AN HOUR! Management refuses to hear complaints and have actually fired people simply for questioning the company leadership. If you move up to better positions within the company you can do quite well. But those positions can be available rather infrequently and being a driver is horrible. The company will NEVER back you up against rude restuarant employees or customers. They expect 100% of your loyalty and hard work while paying you a trash wage."

That's the only thing that could be considered a pro.","They pay you 5/hour plus ""tips."" That's it. (And people don't tip.) In the time that I've done this gig the tips per order have averaged well under $3/order. For that amount of money, you provide a car, gasoline, and assume all of the increased maintenance/depreciation. And they can easily make you put over 100 miles on your car in a single shift. Imagine that, that's around 30,000 miles wiped off a car's life in a year doing this gig. 10 oil changes and a new set of tires ruined, all for 5/hour plus tips. You can't reject orders, you can't see the tips before you accept an order or where the customer is, and you are forced into accepting orders by the Dash that are extremely far away. They don't even show you your aggregate total made in tips per day until the next day, and they don't break it down by order. Why would they be so shady about what you're making? It's a question you can answer yourself. Bottom line, when you deduct the cost of gasoline, you're already making below minimum wage. When you add in depreciation and maintenance, you're making zero money, and might even be subsidizing Waitr out of your own pocket for the true cost of making deliveries."

261,Waitr  ,Don't.,2019-01-09,1.0,Delivery Driver,Pretty much none aside from picking your own schedule.,"Where to begin..

So one of the main issues this company has is the CEO thinks having no order minimum actually brings more business which actually may be true but it attracts the kinds of customers any established business would not want. To say this company completely safeguards the customer and openly lets them take advantage of drivers is an understatement. You will at some point end up taking an order with a single item that cost no more than a few dollars and drive it 5+ miles away to a greedy customer who is either only tipping $2-3 or none at all. Basically, no delivery fees and no order minimum attracts all the cheapskates. Now here's the best part about that: you aren't able to see what individual customers have tipped you. That's right. They claim that in the past drivers retaliated but if there's a customer who is a habitual no-tipper, why are they even allowing that customer to keep conducting business with the company??

Secondly. the amount of managers and Dashes who have zero clue what they are doing is crazy. They have backgrounds in restaurant or fast food management and the Dashes have absolutley no dispatch experience whatsoever. They are literally regular people hired off the street or off Craigslist. Just an FYI to the management, just because you've been doing a job the wrong way for 2-3 years doesn't give you experience in that field. If you bring up any concerns or suggestions about how to improve things, the managers will tell you ""you might not be a good fit for this job"" but they allow bullying and harassment to run rampant and if the bullying is being done by lead drivers and drivers who are well-liked by management due to brown nosing, they will never face any real consequences even when they do something that would get a normal driver fired. For example, two lead drivers I worked with were caught making a ""rant channel"" on the company's Discord server (the Waitr IT staff discovered it and let management know) where all they did was bad mouth other drivers, dashes, and managers and basically just complain about their job. Keep in mind these are the same drivers who have bullied people in the main group chat when drivers voice their complaints to Dashes or managers in the open where everyone can read it. Do they get fired? Of course not, they just get a warning or a write up and that's it. There was even a female driver who literally freaked out on a Dash and used profane language, etc and was she fired? Of course not. Suggestion for any drivers: do not voice any opinions, complaints or anything in the main chat. If a Dash assigns you an order that is extremely far and unreasonable, just private message them. 

One thing that they will not tell you when they hire you is that you will be literally competing for deliveries when its slow. The app is designed to where the only way to see new deliveries that pop up is to down scroll to refresh the screen. So basically drivers who have no life will sit there in a parking lot while its slow refreshing the screen every 1-2 seconds  and will grab every single restaurant order, regardless of how far away they are, but will ignore orders to more fast-food type places because they know people who order from there more than likely don't tip very well. The managers actually encourage this kind of behavior by rewarding the top 3 drivers who got the most deliveries at the end of the month (they get a $20 gas card or a t-shirt.. lol need I say more). So are you good at playing mobile games like Flappy Bird where you have to constantly mash down on your screen? Then Waitr is the job for you! Protip: stick with actual professional delivery companies like Uber Eats and Door Dash.

I also think it's worth mentioning that all the positive reviews left on this site for this company were done by either managers who currently work there or done by employees who were asked by management to leave a good review. There was one day where a certain manager basically begged all the current drivers to leave a good review on this website due to the influx of bad (truthful) reviews so that right there basically sums up the company."

Therefore, you end up praying you’ll have a “good month” and that the maintenance to your personal vehicle + fuel at least somewhat evens out. Does Waitr honestly believe people will forfeit their services by requiring a mandatory tip? At this time, contract drivers receive half of the drivery fee + tips (but no hourly pay). Regular drivers receive $5 hourly + tips. It’s a profitable night when the customer isn’t cheap and tips you more than $0 - $1. 

How do I know some customers tip $0? Because I have had to leave a shift early after 2 hours and having completed 5 orders in that time. The amount of tips that day? $0.

**Mandatory 20 Hours A Week**

The company mandates that a driver must work a minimum of 20 hours.
Shifts open up on Wednesday on a first come, first serve basis. So whoever can click the fastest gets the best shifts. 

In the Temple, TX market, the majority of the prime time afternoon and evening shifts have been reduced to 4 hours, down from 5 hours, when the market opened in January of 2018. The company also mandates that drivers must take a 45 minute break after working 5 consecutive hours. The reasoning behind the 4 hour shift block change was to increase productivity. 

This change was due to the increased number of employees calling in sick or taking time off last minute, which left the company short-staffed during busy periods. But, when a company pays their employees so little, there is a definite lack of motivation. Especially with those that already work a full time job. They quickly realize that it's not worth the effort to make an extra $20 for 4 hours of work. 

Drivers will typically go over their scheduled time during a shift as they are required to accept orders up to the end of that shift. This model basically guarantees that Waitr will be able to sucker more than 20 hours out of someone. For someone that is working another job, in order to fulfill your 20 hours a week requirement, you will now have to schedule 5 days a week of 4 hour shifts, or work two 4 hour shifts in one day. Working two 4 hour shifts in a day will most likely take up 10 to 11 hours of your time after it's all said and done. This job is not like Uber or other on-demand delivery services where you can freely pick your own hours without being hassled. 

**Pay**

Drivers are paid $5.00 an hour. Anyone that has worked in pizza delivery knows that the majority of the large companies, Domino's for instance, pay their drivers $7.25 an hour plus mileage compensation, usually around $0.25 to $0.28 per mile. At Waitr I typically average 18 miles per hour driven on the clock at the end of the month because their delivery zones are so large, and manage to make somewhere around 1.6 deliveries per hour in my market.

18 miles per hour at $0.28 per mile is $5.04 per hour. I consider $0.28 to be reasonable for an older car like mine, although the IRS mileage deduction, which W2 employees can no longer claim in 2018, mind you, is $0.545 per mile. For a newer car, I think anything less than $0.35 per mile is ludicrous due to depreciation, but I'll spare that rant from this review. 

My numbers are based on AAA cost of operation expenses for 2017 as well as what similar companies reimburse their employees for similar jobs, i.e. food delivery 

So where does your $5.00 hourly pay really go?
Towards vehicle upkeep, of course. 

Waitr drivers are living exclusively on tips. This makes their customers co-employees, so to speak.  It's not much different from being a waiter in a restaurant in that respect but, I can almost guarantee that because of fuel and operating expenses, you'll make a lot less.

**Tips**

THERE IS NO MANDATORY GRATUITY ; CUSTOMERS DO NOT HAVE TO TIP!!!

For a 20 hour work week I typically only take home $10 to $15 in cash tips. 
Tips on credit cards are susceptible to taxes and, after taxes, I typically take home between $4.00 and $5.00 per hour. $4.30 per hour seems to be about my average at the end of every month. So, if you are comfortable living on $4.30 per hour, then this is definitely the job for you!!

In my 4 months on the job I have seen at least 90% of the drivers quit. The company is a revolving door of employees. Once new drivers figure out how much they're really making at the end of a few weeks ($5 an hour, or less), they quit. Management is more than happy to hire more people. This is how the company operates, and it will continue to expand until people refuse to work for Waitr."

Recently, Waitr has continued the trend of taking away any power from their drivers.  They've made it to where you can NOT see where you are going to deliver to anymore until you accept an order.  So efficiency has plummeted. I've gone from driving 60 miles in a night to driving 130 miles in a night, while making half the money I used to.  The app is buggy and crashes constantly.  It is a huge power drain on your battery.  Data usage is through the roof.  You can not see what customers tipped you and which ones didn't.  You are basically a mindless drone that is lucky to make $8-$10 an hour after fuel cost.  But be ready to do a lot of repairs to your vehicle.  The company will not back you if you get in an accident.  You are basically just another body that is replaceable.

The turn over rate at this company is the highest I've ever seen.  They hire 15-20 drivers a week (because that's around the number that quit per week).  The average employment time of new hires is around 2 weeks before they figure out that this isn't a good and safe way to make money.  You get absolutely no perks with this job, aside from a free drink or 2 at select restaurants.  You are constantly at risk of getting in an accident, due to having to be on your phone while driving. 

I haven't even mentioned the ""brown nosing"" in this company.  You want to move into the office and be recognized for hard work?  Well, that isn't going to happen unless you spend nearly every waking moment in the company chat (company business is conducted through GroupMe, yeah, imagine 500+people trying to organize things in a phone chat room).  Those who are recognized are those who constantly post memes, make jokes, and other non-business related posted in the company ""business"" chat room - basically a moron's playground.  These drivers get ""favors"" from the office that other drivers are not privy to.

Management is extremely poor.  They do not care about you, your suggestions, or concerns.  Everyone in management is either related, friends, or under qualified for the position.  They do not understand simple business concepts or customer service. 

There are no restricted zones.  You will get forced to take orders to very dangerous areas at night without a second thought about your safety. 

Lastly, be prepared to spend around $15-$20 in fuel per night, between driving and idling, in order for you to make maybe $40 in tips."
336,Waitr  ,Not what it used to be,2017-12-18,1.0,Delivery Driver,Schedule flexibility. You can work basically any hours you could want within their hours of operation.,"The company has made no effort to care about its employees. Every update to the employee app and company policy change has made it harder and harder to actually do an otherwise easy job and make any decent amount of money because a select few decision makers care more about snuffing out ""cheaters"" moreso than improving the quality and efficiency of the app.

The current version of the employee app is a laggy mess and is near impossible to use without crashing, even with my Galaxy S8. This has ruined the quality of the service and is causing the company to hemorrhage clientele and tens of thousands of dollars in refunds (all because maybe 10 out of 2000 drivers found ways around the imposed app limitations).

This company is the most mismanaged piece of crap providing a subpar service to uninformed clientele you will see in the entire south. They think that they can just throw government grant money at all of their problems (via marketing) until the issues resolve themselves, all while the majority of their employees struggle to break $8/hr after car maitenence costs."

338,Waitr  ,Great for startup experience- careful of the burnout though,2017-12-10,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Unlimited growth, especially if you’re willing to relocate. Being a start up they like to promote from within. Casual work environment.","Burn out, is easy especially if you’re in Management.
Start-up mentality leads to a “do more with less” attitude by the ELT and Board in terms of resources and compensation for their management staff."
339,Waitr  ,Attn College Students,2017-10-29,4.0,Delivery Driver,"Flexibility of scheduling,  much more money than anything else for a college student.  I am a long term driver and they listen pretty well.","Inconsistency of business,  busy when it rains and or cold and slows in summer.  Promotion is a pay decrease and a stress nightmare."
340,Waitr  ,Amazing place to work!,2017-10-26,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have work for Waitr for more then two years now in multiple positions.  Yes, as the company has grown it has changed but it still has the start up vibe.  The company is trying new products and services to stay on top of the industry.  I like the laid back environment, and pretty much being able to where a Waitr shirt and jeans everyday is nice. Everyone that works there is very nice, and upper management is available which is not typical in a company that has over 4k employees.","Communication and training! Since the company is growing so fast there is a lot of miscommunications and lack of training.  I came from Corporate America, where there is a ton of extensive training.  So it takes some getting used to."
341,Waitr  ,Great opportunity,2017-09-26,5.0,Delivery Driver,"Flexible schedule, easy tasks, great pay",Too few ordered in my market area.
342,Waitr  ,A Great Fit for Almost Anyone,2017-08-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Waitr is operated by a generally-friendly group of people, willing to help on the job and to be flexible with scheduling. There is a 20-hour and weekend-shift minimum for each schedule... but how many jobs actually allow you to make your own schedule each week? Scheduling off is very easy to do, and many people enjoy working for Waitr including students, teachers, and all other types of people of all ages (18+). The opportunity for a decent, weekly, paycheck is very good.","There are occasional instances in which the management team is simply too busy to answer every call, and the drivers must make judgement calls that they may or may not be prepared to make. This is a small kink in a company which is rapidly expanding."
343,Waitr  ,Waitr is a great place to work,2017-07-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Management is great. The work is fun. There are tons of opportunities to grow.,The pay is terrible but it is a startup. The long term benefits will more than make up the current low pay.
344,Waitr  ,Horrible job,2017-07-10,2.0,Delivery Driver,"You pick your own hours and days to work. 
Minimal effort is required for this job. 
Weekly pay every Friday. 
No boss on your back if you simply keep track of orders.","5$/hr as of July 2017 plus tips 
You WILL drive your car into the ground. 
They do not pay mileage or gas expenses. 
20-30 hours a week you will make on average 200-300$ not including the gas and wear and tear on your vehicle. I put almost 1500 miles on my vehicle and made 600$ in 3 weeks. 

Dash (shift leaders) are apathetic and are not concerned about drivers well being or real life problem(s). 
Most customers tip on the card which will be taxed on. You will drive through rough terrain and risk damage to your vehicle. Waitr does not compensate or reimburse you for accidents/spills/damages to you or your vehicle. 

No room for company growth."
345,Waitr  ,"Ok job, not the best.",2017-07-05,3.0,Delivery Driver,You Pick your own hours and can text or do whatever while clocked in. Won't see manager at all after you get hired. Literally nothing else.,Gas and miles. Money isn't always the same each week. Very boring. Sometimes can be unsafe. Tips aren't always good. Chat room can be like high school drama at times.
346,Waitr  ,Interesting but definitely in the startup phase,2017-06-06,2.0,Driver,Flexibility. Haven't seen my boss since the day I got hired,Wear and tear on your vehicle and lack of consistency and communication
347,Waitr  ,Not for everyone,2017-05-16,3.0,Delivery Driver,"Good Money if you stick with it, make your own schedule, never have to see coworkers but they are all pretty awesome and you'll want too, bonuses given if you work holidays","They don't give money for gas or mileage, will put some wear on your car, communication from management sucks, no raises given to drivers after a year, input not really wanted or listened too"
348,Waitr  ,Never Been Happier at Work,2017-05-09,5.0,Partner Marketing Manager,"Incredible environment full of creativity and enthusiasm! I've never liked going to work before signing on with Waitr. Working a job was always something I just had to do, so, for most of my life, I simply drudged through other jobs with disscontempt because it payed the bills.  It's not everyday that a man can be excited to  go to work, but Waitr has pulled off the whole working thing with effortless style.","Too many people stop me in the streets when I'm wearing my Waitr t-shirt to tell me how much they love the Waitr app. I usually don't mind being famous, but sometimes I just want to sit down and enjoy a coffee and read the newspaper. This must be what Keanu Reeves feels like all of the time."
349,Waitr  ,Software Engineer - Web,2017-04-15,5.0,Software Engineer,"Very Engineering-Centric Culture. Engineers all worked closely with each other and had total project ownership on what they worked on. No matter what your skill level, your input has value at Waitr and you feel as if you are an integral part of the process. Management was not afraid to defer critical decisions to the engineering team in times of need.","If you are a remote dev, you don't have as much exposure to the other engineers of Waitr, and they are still working on fostering that full connectivity...it is easy to feel like an outsider if you work remotely or outside the main office."
