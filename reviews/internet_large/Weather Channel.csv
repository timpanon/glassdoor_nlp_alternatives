They give Bonuses occasionally and claim that's how they can give you a pay raise. That's not how bonuses work.
They rarely promote within (unless your the favorite) instead they hire a freelance

Company is generally trying to innovate and stay ahead of the market to the best of their ability.","Leadership is a bit shaky in terms of defining and communicating what the strategy is and how the company is going to get there.  Often times it was a high-stress, short-term goal driven environment.  Bigger jobs were almost always filled by outside hires, and often times those hires were not any better than the people on their team who missed out on the promotion and then had to report to inferior managers.

The benefits were great.  The food at ""The Front"" (the cafeteria) was great:  especially the omelets!

The department that I started in was great, and was a great fit for my talents and prior experience.  For those of us with more experience, there were plenty of opportunities to mentor newer (younger) employees.  The management in this department was conscious of employees' outside lives (you know:  some have kids, some don't) and made sure that everyone had a chance to have an outside life.  There were opportunities for advancement as well.  You'd also get overtime for those extra hours.

Your schedule isn't going to vary a lot except around big weather events.

Premium pay for working evenings and overnights (unless that's gone away).","The workforce **used** to be stable (one reason I joined the company at the time) until the NBC Universal/Bain/Blackstone purchase.  Then layoffs began to come in the fall as certainly as the leafs changing color.

The department I started in had a reorganization which led to my position transferring to another, and a lot of my duties as well as my schedule changed.  This ended up being a bad marriage of job and person.  Management in this department worked with the ""good ole boy"" network and there was zero opportunity to advance.  The schedule was set by seniority because (in management's words) ""we've always done it that way"".  This department also wouldn't approve OT, but for big events you had to stay.

If your schedule involves working weekend overnights, plan to burn a week's vacation just to get a weekend off.  God forbid you have a family with school-aged children if you're on that schedule.  God forbid that you're single and trying to have a social life on that schedule."

Even during the years we're doing well, they still laid people off. It's demotivating to see your friends go every year no matter how much money we're making.

They are working with  a skeleton crew. Think working more than 40 hours per week. Think about working on weekends multiple times. They squeeze everything they can out of you. It's a thankless job. 

There's also no growth. They only allow a handful of promotions a quarter. So many people who are qualified don't get promoted when they deserve it. Sometimes, they are stuck in limbo. In fact, they don't seem to be concerned about your future or growth. They are too busy to fight fires or battle politics to focus on their employees.

123,Weather Channel,Big Brand with Big Problems,2015-06-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Excellent vacation, 401k and a yearly bonus if company does well.","Management: 
The Weather Channel has so much potential but bad management holds it back. Managers are more focused on making their personal goals instead of developing and mentoring employees. Managers need to know how to give constructive feedback and help employees succeed. Yelling, bullying and threatening behavior should not be tolerated, but it happens in more than one department that I know of. Since the management culture is so bad, people are quitting because of it.

Human Resources:
HR is strictly in place to support management, not regular employees. If you have a problem in your department or with your manager, your choice is to accept it and ignore it or find another job. HR will not support you or be fair or even investigate the issue. This has happened in more than one department that I'm aware of. 

Performance Reviews:
Your review is based on a bell curve, meaning you could do well, but your review will be compared with others in your department and adjusted accordingly. Managers have admitted that they really don't have control over your rating sometimes. They could give you a great one, but be asked to lower it because of the bell curve. On the flip side, if your manager has it in for you, they can give you marginal ratings on purpose and you will fall outside of the curve automatically. This of course means you will get no raise or bonus, no matter what great things they may say about you in the written part of your review.

Technology:
It is not up to date and is unstable. Employees can't do their jobs properly and meet their goals and fixing the system is not a priority. It's a running joke that you can't call the help desk because they either don't understand the urgency of your concern or don't know how to fix it.

Career Opportunities:
You will have very little of that. The company is known for putting employees in a box and it's hard to get out of it. Your goals are based on what they expect of you in your current role and there is zero interest in helping you to get to the next level in your career. 

Salaries:
If you are an entry-level employee, your salary will be very low. If you have experience, you'd better know how to negotiate. Like most companies, they will get you for as cheap as they can.

Overall:
Overall, The Weather Channel is not a great place to work for most people. If you are a favorite, you will be happy for a while. But eventually, you will get tired of not having the tools to do your job and not  having anyone take your concerns seriously. It's unfortunate because it could be so much better - there are talented employees here - but bad managers and lack of accountability are tearing this place apart. There is high turnover both in layoffs and staffers resigning. If you decide to work here, have a back up plan and if you notice any of the issues mentioned here, run for the hills. The issues are widespread in more than one department. It's an epidemic."

133,Weather Channel,"A Scathing Opinion of a Culture of Backstabbing, Self-Aggrandizement and Duplicity",2015-03-07,1.0,Digital Editor,"There are many incredible people that work at The Weather Channel. Most are extraordinarily passionate journalists and meteorologists; they made the days much more tolerable. 

The Weather Channel has many journalistic and meteorological resources in its ""war chest."" These resources allow to people within the company to be better storytellers and meteorologists. Forecasts are often dead-on and have better lead-times than competitors.","Where to begin? 

Let me preface the following with this: It's been nearly a year since I parted ways with The Weather Channel and despite the murky circumstances surrounding my dismissal in 2014, I remained silent. 

That said, recently a member of The Weather Channel staff – a manager no less – actively engaged in slandering me to a potential employer, just this last week. 

Given this latest revelation, I figured I would opine a piece regarding my time at The Weather Channel.

Here's the gist of it: 

Based on my experiences and in my opinion, employees are treated like a cog in a corporate mega-machine. Don't expect to have the boundaries of a work-life balance respected if you choose to accept employment at the company.

It's my opinion that favoritism and underhanded politics are pervasive in the digital department at The Weather Channel. Based on my experiences and in my opinion, middle managers in my former department often collude with one another to discredit direct reports they don't like and, many times, to undermine upper management. 

These middle managers see themselves as an omnipotent presence lurking over the shoulders of many of their employees. They lack empathy, leadership prowess and any appreciable managerial skills. They see themselves as infallible and since there are no consequences for their Machiavellian style of management, they continue to push good employees out.

This is exactly what happened to me and unfortunately I'm not alone. During my nine months at The Weather Channel, I observed at least three of my – experienced, well-educated and hard-working – co-workers unceremoniously kicked to the curb.

In the time since my questionable termination, additional people have been terminated, marginalized or ""repositioned.""

It's my opinion, based on my experiences and the experiences of other former co-workers, that the culture of my former department is rooted in the principles of duplicity, nefariousness and corporate anarchy.

It's my sincere hope that things will change. But, with Comcast/NBC, Bain Capital and the Blackstone Group as their corporate overlords, I doubt an appreciable change will happen at The Weather Channel anytime soon."

I have never in my life worked for a company who cared so little with the professional development of their employees. During my time, a lot of very qualified and talented employees left due to being unappreciated and unrecognized for their hard work. This was especially true on the Cable side. The management of this team in New York was horrendous. They displayed blatant favoritism and sexism. It was overheard that a senior manager (surprisingly a woman) only liked to hire men for certain roles, which could be clearly seen by the team she had in place. The management team was extremely manipulative and took advantage of younger employees. Working long hours and not being provided overtime pay was commonplace. It was a choice between staying late without pay to get work done, or being yelled at for not finishing your work and not managing your time properly. So most chose to stay late hours without payment.

They do not promote from within enough, even though they have many talented employees who have put long hours into their jobs. Many people left due to these circumstances.

155,Weather Channel,Growth pains are exactly that,2014-09-01,3.0,Director,"The people are pretty much universally awesome to work with. Dedicated, intelligent, professional and collegial, for the most part. 

There are definite growth opportunities for the company in mobile. Weather is a killer app in mobile and the company is positioning itself to take advantage. Business development is pursuing the right partnerships with the right companies to lock out competitors and to grow the brand. 

There is a great deal of money going into improving the product offerings and improving the quality of the forecast. The company is getting smart about data analytics and is committed to providing the most accurate forecast in the industry.

I think the overall strategy for growth is pretty sound but there are real challenges as well.  There is commitment to grow and the leadership realizes you have to sometimes spend money to do it. The previous administration was much more cost focused and that led to slow but predictable growth. The downside was that the company was mired at the back of the publishing industry. The most recent leadership has made a great deal of investment in changing that.","The pace is relentless and you are never disconnected from work. There's no time to recharge. You feel guilty taking any time away and will have to work overtime to catch up after any vacation. Since the company is partly owned by a few investment firms, there is real pressure to grow at all costs. This means any dip or stagnancy in the financials is met with quick cuts at the middle to lower tier of leadership but the decision makers continue to get the benefit of the doubt even when the strategy isn't panning out. 

While I believe in the commitment of the leadership, the results have been iffy. Growth has mainly come in mobile. Weather is a killer application for mobile and therefore the growth is a no-brainer. It is not necessarily the result of a strong leadership but was probably going to happen anyway. Overall digital growth is slowing or stagnating. 

Cable is flat and dying and the main strategy to move to move long-form content has proven sketchy.  The shows are ""me too"" type copycats rather than anything original. The cable providers and distributors have a lot more power as people move to the web for weather info, as proven by this year's spat with DirectTV. Weather Company had to cave to get back on DirecTV because going without the money wasn't an option. The CEO picked a very dirty fight and really believed DirecTV had to negotiate. He miscalculated badly and ended up looking very foolish in the media when he made a very public apology. 

The HR strategy is a disaster.  Recruiting is improving but identifying and retaining top contributors is poorly done. There is no real retention strategy other than making a last minute counter-offer when people decide to leave. There is no career development other than what you make yourself. Compensation for new hires is based on market but those who have been there a while are left behind. It's like pulling teeth to get the company to acknowledge that.

IT has made a lot of strides in terms of the latest technologies but, as a cost center, it is not scaling to support the org as the org grows. This slows down the org in some respects, especially in terms of sales. 

Politics have typically been pretty low level but the sense of political competition is growing of late. It used to be much more of a place where everyone was pulling in the same direction. That has changed in recent years and there's much more of a CYA atmosphere in place.

Lastly, there seems to be only one tool in the toolbox for leadership. If nothing else is working to grow revenue, reorganize the teams to find ""strategic alignment"". It may not fix the problems in the org but it makes the board look like the execs are doing something to right the ship.

The recent upgrades to the look of the network are nothing more than window dressing, designed to obscure the rot and deplorable moral that has plagued the company for quite sometime.  Dysfunction is the rule rather than the exception at TWC, with managers in charge of departments they know nothing about, and employees constantly in the dark as to the intentions of leadership.  Speaking for the broadcast side of the company, departments that once worked together as a team are often at odds with one another, and meaningful communication from the higher ups is mostly nonexistent.  We have an executive team that would rather spend their time in New York rather than the home base of Atlanta, and employees can't help but wonder if that might influence whatever moves they might make next.

183,Weather Channel,"Once an ok place to work, now totally dysfunctional and unpleasant.",2013-11-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Good brand to have on your resume.,"I don't even know where to begin. I was with TWC for about 5 years. It was once a pretty exciting and pleasant place to work. Over the last year, the company has become extremely dysfunctional and a really sad place to work. As it was noted in other reviews, there have been several shake ups in executive leadership over the past 3 years. This current executive team looks like they are here to stay. While I have no doubt they will bring in the big bucks for TWC, the company is completely using and abusing their employees to get there. All employees on the digital side of the business are extremely overworked and are not given the resources they need to become successful and develop their careers. If you want to work here, get used to staying late into the night and coming in often on the weekends. I tried to express the needs of my team to upper management many times over the last year and nothing helped. If you want to take time off to recharge your batteries, get ready to fight with management to get time off. And if you are lucky enough to get more than a day or two off, be ready to get calls & texts all day from your co-workers that are equally as swamped and exhausted. It seemed every other week there were company wide e-mails announcing the hire of new VP's and leadership positions that came from the David Kenny corporate tree. However, if your team needs that extra head or two for the year to provide much needed help, don't place any bets on it. This is not an occurrence that happened in one department, but across all departments on the digital side. I often worked with other departments that were understaffed, and any sort of staffing relief came from temps or contractors who had little clue what they were doing. And then once their contracts were up, there was no effort to get these people back, dumping even more work on others. HR likes to play the ""career development"" card, but very rarely did I ever see this occurring. Promotions were rarely seen, and any effort by an employee to learn something about the business and help expand their skill set was basically ignored. Many employees, including myself, were extremely enthusiastic and wanted to learn many other aspects of the business, but no one was there to help facilitate this. Communication is extremely poor between departments. If you have a task or project you need interdepartmental help with… good luck trying to figure out who is in charge. Even if you find the person in charge of, get ready for work that is apathetic and often times down right rude. I can't blame these employees though. They were dealing with the same issues as all of us. The sales team calls all the shots as well and are never held accountable for their actions. They are often putting their co-workers in extremely difficult situations that are set up for failure. This sheds horrible light on other hard working individuals without any accountability from the sales rep who made the sale. Pay is very underwhelming for all the work that is being put in. After I had enough of this environment, I was presented a very promising opportunity with significantly better pay at a different company. Once I let management know this and put my notice in, I was treated as though I had committed some atrocity. Counterparts and my direct manager were extremely happy for me… Upper management made sure to make me feel guilty. It was very contradictory considering all the people the company had laid off over the past 3 years. I expect to see high turnover at this company in the coming months. I am not optimistic about the direction of this company."

If I didn't know any better, I'd swear that the Emancipation Proclamation has been resended.  The lack of people of color in upper management is disheartening.  Managers are downright rude, uncaring and hell-bent on causing as much emotional pain as possible.  David Kenny and his lackies are the worse kind of leaders (andI use that term loosely).

Since the change there has been 3 rounds of new management the latest being the most disruptive.  Talent and knowledge has become irrelevant and dismissed.  New management installed because of who they knew not because of what they know.  Moral is extremely low in alot of areas.  The 80/20 rule (quantity over quality) rules supreme.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the upper management is beyond awful and are pretty much incompetent at their jobs as 'leaders'. The ones that I work under are rude have no comprehension of the concept that by treating their subordinates poorly, you will get poor productivity and turn employees bitter. Everyone around me is bitter, some have been for years and I don’t blame them.  I myself have been physically stressed out due to this job and that has not been the case anywhere else I have worked at in the past.  Work/life balance? Nope. That is the “hidden fees” of the bit above average salary in the Pros section above.
Everyone that I work with talks on a daily basis about their fears of being fired and the threat is real. That is no way to come into work on a daily basis. The scary part is that this is the case in most departments throughout the company, not just mine.
So many reorganizations that processes and people change on a weekly basis and things are flat out not communicated to employees leading to: confusion until the next reorganization, which comes with more turnover by employees either being fired or laid off, then new employees that have to learn new processes from other new employees who really don’t know what they are doing or how to train them properly. Repeat cycle. It is reinventing the wheel over and over and over again with worse results. Not sure how that is possible, but it is.
I am leaving this company very soon as are other mid level co-workers that see right through the façade and will do the same. 
My best advice is to not work here.  Seriously. The household name might look nice, but there are a ton of ugly layers within this rotten onion. Look at the majority of the reviews here and decide for yourself. Not even as a first job unless you want to see how a company should not be run."

The latest round of execs (which seem like they're here to stay) have brought New York business mentality with them.  
- They're moving us from the normal 'cube world' to this new 'open concept' which is basically glorified school tables.  With this change, they can cram more than double the number of people in to the same area with those people no longer having pictures, privacy, white boards, a quiet area to work, etc..  All the while the management has yet to really explain why they're making this drastic move other than 'it worked in their last position'.
- The family culture and values are gone, replaced by cut-throat Wall Street type ethics.  Employees that have been at The Weather Channel for any amount of time will agree, we no longer feel like valued employees but more like subjects under the new managements rule.
- Internal promotions and growth opportunities have seemed to dry up.  With a number of groups expanding and new management structures being introduced, the number of internal hires are miniscule to the number of external hires, most of which have personal/political ties to the new executive and upper management.
- The parking lot fills up a lot later (in time) than it used to, and empties a lot earlier.  You don't see people coming to work early to get a jump on that big project, or burn through some ideas that may be valuable or 'out of the box'.  Instead, you see people coming in as the last 'class bell' is ringing, and leave 5 minutes before the 'shift bell' rings.
- A once fully transparent management group has been replaced with a completely closed up one.

But the frequency with which they occur here seems less a result of any strategy and more like the occasional whim.

There's little room for upward growth in a lot of the roles but if you think there's need for another VP or Director that's not you, just let someone know and I'm sure HR will create a position and fill it in a week or two. Compensation and revenue structure was changed to the point where whether you're an average or a hard working worker, you'll get screwed either way.

212,Weather Channel,I'll take it as a personal achievement that I've made it this far.,2013-04-01,1.0,,Great workmates & a lot of interesting projects,"A lot of interesting projects but only if you know how to suck up (like really really well or have been there since forever), you'll get to work on one. Otherwise you're just a fly on the wall working on stuff you cannot advance your career with, and it doesn't matter if you have talents that's beyond them because I've seen it happen a lot. I've seen a lot talents wasted even after working there for multiple years. Doing the same things and looked down at, but stayed for the money and name in resume. I've also heard talented people telling me that their work is worse here because there isn't any high expectations of quality work, better work is ""not needed,"" ridiculous deadlines. Don't take this from me, ask some of the more reputable talent agencies in Atlanta, TWC is a no-no. I can be blinded by money, but it took a while to find out that it isn't a fair exchange. It's a blood-sucking company, it drains my energy just dealing with management (a lot of micro-managing if you're a fan of those too) and the crap they give you. It's affected my life and when I get back from work, I'm just too tired for anything, even though it's been slow day. Don't sell your life away, they pay you better because nobody wants to work here. You'll also notice that most colleagues including your superior aren't talented. And if there is one, they're leaving the company. Talented people know how to take their talents elsewhere, where it's acknowledged, appreciated, and not suppressed because you seem like a threat. They fire people like crazy and make big shows out of it. Reason can be anything they can pull out of nowhere. 

There is a lot of immoral activities happening within the company, I shouldn't go into details but you'll hear of it and it also happened to me. Sooner or later I hope these people get caught because they are the ones making a lot of decisions around here. It has affect my time at work and am planning to get out as soon as I can. I've become a different person ever since I worked here and not a good one at all. Do not buy into what they tell you will happen for the better, it's been forever and nothing changed just more talk. Cannot be trusted at all."
213,Weather Channel,Where is the TWC we used to love?!?!,2013-03-31,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The (non-upper management) people are great. Lots of talent and hard-working people. Good location. I like the people I work with.,"If you've worked there a while, look out, because they are chomping at the bit to get rid of anyone with any sort of tenure. They are more than willing to send you packing, in order to make room for more VPs or higher (or more contractors). The company is so top heavy, it could topple over at any moment. There aren't enough worker bees to get the work done, but plenty of VP+ to oversee and crack the whip. Seems like the only criteria you have to meet to be hired as a VP is to know the right people, or to have worked at IHG or Bloomberg. And if you want to be blamed or thrown under the bus, you're in the right place. And let's talk about the ABSURD floor plan they are planning for the building, starting with the 8th floor. They will be putting everyone in desks that line up in a row, right next to each other - like a conference room table. No walls, no room to put your things, no comfort whatsoever. It's great for those who love to have someone else's germs spread all over them, especially when that person is sick. And then there is the noise and discomfort of watching someone blow their nose, or have a coughing fit. And how about those crunchy snacks they like to eat... Right in your ear. And there will be NO offices for anyone, so forget having private conversations with your managers. They are using the excuse that they have to configure things this way because they have to fit more people in the building. I don't see that as an issue anymore, since everyone is either getting laid off or quitting because they're so miserable. And yes, almost everyone is extremely miserable. There are very nice looking, smaller cubes, with low walls that would still allow more space. Not everyone needs to be set up like an Agile team. Management doesn't care!!! Things have gone downhill since the sale in 2008. Employees used to be happy, ratings were better, etc. I sure do miss the old days, when it felt like someone cared."
214,Weather Channel,A very charged environment,2013-03-20,1.0,Designer,"Getting to work closely with meteorologists was a great chance to learn and grow. If you enjoy the weather, this is a great environment to in which to learn as much as you want about it. The met meetings are always a great way to learn what's going on and what's going to happen next.","Where do I start? The toxic environment that is there now is reason enough to stay as far away as possible. There are no opportunities to get promoted from within the company any longer. It seems only outside people are being brought in now days. The older, more seasoned employees are being weeded out in large chunks and young, less experienced, less knowledgeable people are being brought in. The essence of what made TWC unique is quickly going away and is turning into a cut-throat, politically-charged, and toxic environment that is impossible to endure, much less enjoy.  

There are so many VPs there that it makes you wonder if there are any other types of management.  To top it off, there have been 3 CEOs in 5 years. The changing of the guard to the most recent CEO happened overnight and was shrouded in a veil of secrecy.

The many rounds of layoffs in 2012 have employees looking over their shoulders as to when they will be next.  Layoffs now days are not personal but it's hard not to take it personally when you are being escorted out of the building with a little box in which to take a few small belongings, only to find out later that many of those belongings were confiscated due to someone thinking you had stolen your own things. People's hard drives were taken and never returned. Contact with former co-workers was essentially cut off. Bam, kicked to the curb.

This is unprofessional and mean. I don't recommend anyone work for a company that is willing to do this to people that once loved where they worked.

This looks to me like a company grooming itself to be sold."

The pay is above average for IT in ATL (but the long hours will cancel that out). Decent benefits.,"Where do I start? This was once a great company to work for and I just shake my head to see what it has come to. All the other reviews about senior management are right on the money. David Kenny came in and basically pushed out the old regime and brought his own guys in. Most of them came from hotels and other industries and have no idea how to run a media company. There are so many VPs that I've lost count. There are constant power struggles amongst the VPs and EVPs and it's the old blood who usually gets the short end of the stick.

The new managers that come in are programmed to treat the employees who have been there for a long time so badly and show them so little respect, that they have no choice but to outright resign or leave the company that they have built over a long period of time.  Most of them do not try or even care to try to learn the culture or get to know their people. Anybody who tries to speak up is quickly blacklisted and slowly pushed out, either through 'poor' reviews or displays of outright favoritism towards 'their guys'. Going to HR with any concerns is fruitless because they just go along with whatever the new management says (pretty much like puppets) and do not offer much support to the rank and file.

The PTO policy is good, but it is for show. The new managers that have come in make it impossible to use your vacation. There is always a 'deadline' and it is never a convenient time to take time off. Their reaction is 'oh well, it is customary to leave unused PTO days on the table'.  Internal promotions are literally non-existent and you basically have to leave to get a higher position. Most upper management has been brought in from the outside."
220,Weather Channel,The Weather inside is frightful,2013-02-12,1.0,Director,There are few Pros - and I mean that both as in Professionals and in positive attributes of the company. The salaries are OK for Atlanta but don't let that lure you in to this mess.,"The lack of professionalism and experience amongst the middle and senior management ranks is truly astounding. This is due to the fact that David Kenny and most of his Sr Mgmt team have none to little media experience and background, and they continually hire their cronies who have similar backgrounds at outrageous salaries. They enjoy talking about past conquests and their connections - but in 1 yr the needle has not moved, I believe anywhere else, this would be considered a failure. 

The inexperienced and unmonitored VPs are like naughty teenagers - continuously fighting over turf and outright warring against each other. Someone else reviewed it perfectly ""Loads of VPs tripping all over each other... and actually tripping each other too"". Senior Management is fostering and rewarding a cut throat culture where truth and integrity are punished - and anyone who has a different point of view or opinion will be made so miserable they will wish to be laid off - I have personally witnessed that with 3 colleagues.

I have also observed that there are no minorities in Senior Management and very few women, in fact in the last yr they have gotten rid of the only woman of color at the senior level and many others in middle management - it is becoming the ""Whitewashed"" weather Company - dangerous if you are a minority."
