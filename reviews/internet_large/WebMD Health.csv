I learned a lot and gained experience, but that was thanks to my boss not WebMD. I should have left earlier.","I have never worked for a company that is so full of themselves and cares about money more than their people than WebMD does. WebMD originally interested me because I care about improving the overall wellbeing of people and their health. This was not the case in this company. Best advice if you are thinking about working here, don't. 

Here is a summary of my thoughts working here over the years so no one else experiences this:

1. Think you'll get your annual bonus? Think again. During Covid, business was booming and work was increasing. Due to unforeseen times and uncertainty they withheld our bonuses and merit increases from us for months. Then, they proceeded to inform us that business is better than ever and this was a record year. They are so money hungry they will work you and promise all sorts of incentives and will never follow through with their promises. 

2. Want that raise or promotion? They'll hire someone else before promoting within. If inflation wasn't enough, your 3% raise you get with the company is the only thing you'll be seeing for years. It's almost laughable that the company won't increase salaries to market average-Turnover is huge because of this. Meanwhile, you have the VP's sending company wide emails showing off their elaborate vacation trips and wishing everyone a great holiday, while you can barely afford your mortgage and working overtime. 

3. HR department is nonexistent. Need help or answers with company policies? Expect to get ghosted and not receive an answer at all. This company is so slimy. All they care about is money. If you work like a robot and never want an increase in your salary then this is the place for you.

4. People are so judgy here. In the office, do not expect to get a smile back from anyone working around you. It's more of an older crowd, and seems like they never developed small talk or social skills. No one cares to develop personal relationships with each other. You will never have a voice in the company unless you are CEO or a VP. All they care about is Internet Brands.

5. This company is definitely not an Amazon or Facebook. There are zero perks to working here besides the name. So many other companies have a better onboarding/incentives/work life balance/growth. All the employees here are miserable and the ones that stay are too afraid to leave because they still have hope the company will change. The company has gone downhill fast, don't feed into their lies and promises. Don't waste your breath offering advice to upper management either, It will never happen and the company is not changing."
21,WebMD Health,You will never feel less appreciated,2022-02-28,1.0,Marketing,The work you do is for a good cause.,WebMD does not appreciate their employees or pay them a decent wage. They will pay you as little as possible and do everything they can to avoid paying you benefits (lots of forever freelancers).

This place is nothing like what is sold to you in the interview. They will tell you anything to get you in the door because this place is so understaffed and they have no idea how to sell any of their products efficiently. The products are half-baked and in no way compete on the same level as their competitors. The company is run like a jealous child who wants the toy the other kid has. Directions change with the wind because of this - sales teams lie and oversell capabilities to make sales with no thought on how it effects the relationships after they collect their commission.

Nepotism and cronyism is rampant. Senior leadership has no vision or ability to inspire workers. They take no responsibility or initiative - just pat their own backs during town halls despite the lack of real successes. They finesse the fact that our ""wins"" are flimsy at best. One of them is a known tyrant that everyone is afraid of. 

Many more but I'm honestly emotionally exhausted. They will chip you away slowly until you start gaslighting yourself."

The new CEO likes to look up ridiculous studies online that he doesn’t even understand and then forces editorial to cover them. And don’t get me started on his stupid company-wide “inspirational” emails with videos of himself telling us why we have to work harder and longer with no pay raise, and love it while we’re doing it. All the good upper management left when the new CEO entered the picture, and now they are left with “leaders” who have had no or very limited journalism experience who are riding the coattails of their very talented and hardworking worker bees. These worker bees are constantly being given lofty, vague goals with no plan or guidance on how to reach them — because again, the leadership don’t know what they’re doing. 
 
 There is no consideration for work-life balance or even serious events in your personal life. Don’t count on coming here and finding any support if you need to take any time off for an emergency. If you can’t find your own coverage, sorry, you’ll be working through your emergency. The same goes for vacations. You’ll be bullied into working long hours every day and on weekends. 
 
 Promotions are completely arbitrary. If you’re the type of person to not complain, keep your head down, and work hard, expecting that your good work should speak for itself, tough luck — you will never get a decent pay raise or promotion. If you are the type to bring up concerns and give constructive feedback, you’ll be told you’re being too negative and should focus on the positives (basically meaning that at least you have a job), and that will be that. 
 
 People are leaving in droves, because we all know this is a sinking ship. Stay away."

Prepare to be be put in the roulette wheel for calls. What you get no one knows. Your metrics will be held against you whether it is productive available work, or the busy work that can potentially be a greater part of the hour. 

Prepare to cold call for long stretches of time- and that will be held against you. In times of scarcity, prepare for layoff. In times of plentiful work, prepare for ""Mando"" overtime. This was ongoing for 10 months. If you do not do it, it is held against you. Even if the management was late to the game on the request in the month. 

Prepare to talk nonstop for your shift. You will be exhausted.

This company loves to micromanage to the fullest extent of the word. 

Hope you are competitive. Everything is a competition here. They pose it as friendly competition, but is it really friendly if everyone is scrambling for the available work.

-Decent WLB
-Free Snacks
-A ""name"" on your resume","A morgue lacking in culture, values, and innovation. 

The tech infrastructure is a continual maelstrom of errors and backend glitches. There is perpetual confusion amongst internal teams on how internal technologies work, resulting in even larger errors and further encouraging a negative feedback loop. Automation is generally not a consideration even in iterative processes for fear of custom client asks (get good engineers, build a validator). Some managers in Analytics will not even know Python is, a reveal into how utterly lacking and behind the place is in terms of their tech people.

More generally, across all teams, the people here tend to be overworked and cannot afford improvement due to tight deadlines and lofty understaffing. Furthermore, there is a culture of ""old blood""- newcomers beware of a non-innovative company. Good ideas will be turned down. Most people have been around for years and have not kept up with the shifting industry. On top of that, the culture overall is exceptionally business-oriented and bureaucratic. Your team members will not ask how your weekend went, rather they will jump straight into ""business"". Forget about getting to know your coworkers at a personal level. People also tend to have inflated egos because they work at ""WebMd"", a recognized name, while oblivious to the mundanity of their work and the prosaic nature of the business.

Overall, the culture is complete garbage, the people are too overworked, and the work itself does not account for the name. You will not do your best work here, and should you want to make something of your resume, just avoid this place all together. If you are just looking for a job though, and you're patient, then this will do. Think of it as a stepping stone or the place you go to let your career die."

I was hired for my seniority and experience or so I was told. Got a job proposal after 3 interviews (1 face to face) unfortunately actual work had nothing to do with the scope of the role required and absolutely nothing but what we discussed during interview stage with the hiring manager. 

I guess they were just interested in filling a vacancy. I honestly failed to understand what exactly they do surely they failed to mention. For the first 4/5 months I spent my time trying to understand and adapt. Definitely pointless. No proper induction nor help of any kind. 

A few points:
1. Bad work environment and non existing company culture
2. Poor and useless induction 
3. Outdated process, (political dreadful environment?) no  sharing culture, rude back stabbing manners and incompetent people as a result only the most selfish emerge
4. If you tend to have any sort of logic “don’t go in there”, there is none
5. No clear project scope, again maybe none 6. Outdated process (long, old fashioned and uselessly complicated production chain)
7. No retention/track of previous results or/and mistakes hence no improvements

I've known several teams that keep losing their members but HR doesn't even bother investigating. These managers are the real morale killer: egotistical, micromanaging, insecure, and indecisive.

Secretive - it' common practice for different groups to work on the same projects in secret with the hopes they get a chance to present to the CEO and get a a pat on the head. Unless of the course the project fails, in which case, they already have scapegoats lined up.

Powerpoint hell - no communication can occur without a powerpoint. Powerpoints about powerpoint is quite common.

They can't decide if they are an agency, a start up or a corporation - so they try to be all three at the same time, and it doesn't work. 
People were already overworked before buyout/layoffs.   Culture is not inclusive.  Teams/coworkers are ""clicky"" (including staff/managers having affairs with each other).

Technology is way behind, so you won't learn anything new here or get experience that will help you get a job going forward.  They cap salary increases for promotions, so the only way to stay at a market salary is to leave after a couple years.  They will hire someone outside of the company at a much higher salary than someone within.  They do not do anything to value and keep their current employees and/or invest in good talent.  Management has no interest in historical experience.

Mid to upper management is mostly a boy's club, and they take care of their own.  All that matters is being able to manage up and be a good ""talker"" to get ahead.  Most of the mid and upper management could care less about their employees and really don't care much to even manage across, much less down.  Actual hard work and action is not really appreciated.

** If you're pretty damn good at your job, you'll be the sharpest tool in the shed
** Depending on your office / department, my understanding is the culture really varies

The reason I give the company four stars instead of fewer is because if you really want an easy-going job, with generally nice people, and don't stress the severe career ambitions too much, this isn't a bad place to hang out for a couple years.","** Salaries are on the lower end of market average.

Office is very nice with lots of free coffee, fresh fruit, subsidized beverages/snacks and plenty of perks and activities.  The people are very friendly, but you may have to work at it a bit as many are also quite introverted or mainly socialize within their own departments or established groups.  Depending on department and position, work-life balance is just fine.  Many people who get burned out can only blame themselves for being perfectionists, trying to be all things to all people and involve themselves in every project and control more than they need to.  More of that in ""Cons"".  :)  The pay and benefits are fine.  Matching 401k, good health benefits, 13 vacation days to start, some flexibility in schedules is allowed.  I can't think of much lacking in this area.  Tactical collaboration is quite common but it depends on the departments.  Some are a joy to work with.  Some are a nightmare.  The overall culture is positive.","When I first started here, I thought this was a place where people could make a difference.  It is not.  The CEO and CFO of the company make almost every decision - even many very basic tactical ones.  The company makes money off pharma ad impressions.  It is completely financial and ad/page view driven.  Customers are never mentioned (unless they are referring to the pharma ad clients).  That sets the tone for the business.  Product and Editorial are ruled like fiefdoms.  Decisions are made in a vacuum even though project teams are typically made up of 30 people - because maybe one person will freak out if they don't know what is going on and maybe one other person might have one piece of information that will be helpful.  The technology that drives the website is ridiculous.  The time and personnel required to just do basic web production and ""innovation"" is staggering - several times that of other companies in tech, web media - and still we can't do what many other companies can online.  High levels of technical debt.  Communications and processes are poor.  It is rare to find people who understand more than their own department.  It definitely skews female and is a very politically liberal (i.e. Democrat) place to work.  I am not saying this is a con, but if you are uncomfortable with hugs,crying, talk about feminism, female body parts, or want to discuss Republican ideology, you might want to look elsewhere.  The company is putting itself up for sale, so the only projects are pure page view, ad view-ability, and financial plays.  While the culture is positive, this varies widely.  The life seems to have been sucked out of this place.  People are so hyper-focused on excruciating minutiae and details that won't make a bit of difference, so they drive themselves crazy by obsessing over the few things they can control.  Some people have way too much work to do.  Some people have way too little.  The VPs in Atlanta are not leaders.  They are docile people-pleasers who just report up the chain."

Nice name to have on your resume.","I had high expectations coming into the position, despite being warned by other current employees that I shouldn't take the job.  The morale is embarrassing low and senior management is aware of this, but does not seem to care.  My guess is 60% of the employees are looking for other work and are only staying because of the decent pay - most do not seem to be truly invested in the work and many complain about their jobs on a daily basis.  Because of the low morale, its also creating a backstabbing environment and causing massive divides within teams.  

The leadership team or ""ELT"" as they refer to themselves as, walk around like some mythical creature that nobody is supposed to talk to or look at.  They have no vision of how to run a company, lead or inspire their teams or communicate to people like they are humans.  They hide in their offices, rarely communicate with their direct reports except to criticize their work or level of dedication to the company.  It is the most demoralizing environment I have ever been a part of.  Its completely unprofessional on many levels - even the ""ELT"" talks negatively about their peers which makes for very awkward and uncomfortable situations. 

The saddest part is there are a lot of very hard working, talented individuals that are trying to make a difference, but are not allowed to because of ""ELT"" and their lack of experience leading teams.  If you want to work in a place that you feel you're making a real difference or want to have a voice then stay far, far away from here."

There is also a total lack of career paths.  Very few promotions happen from within the company.  Several talented people on the AM team left for this very reason.

There is also virtually no work / life balance.  Regularly scheduled work from home days are not allowed; no guests at the company holiday party (i.e. no dates/spouses/partners/etc).

The honest reviews below have all spoken to this and it warrants prospective or current employees to heed fair warning. 

There is little room for advancement, even if you are considered a high achieving employee. Middle and upper management is unprofessional and unclear - at times specifically misleading employees about the direction of the department or company. If you choose to work here don't expect to enjoy the environment, don't expect to advance professionally, but get ready to watch some of the best managers get laid off semi-annually or more frequently. The review system is top down, low achieving or poor managers are protected by their review system since lower level employees never have their voice heard.

Even then, I couldn't put myself through that abuse long term and had to leave.","Throughout my career, I have never experienced such poor management and purposeful deception from a company as I encountered while working for WebMD.
The brand carries a lot of potential and excitement from new employees hoping to make a difference with a company claiming to care about the health and wellbeing of the public. That’s an inspirational cause to be a part of. Unfortunately, it’s all a façade that becomes very clear in no time at all. 
To really get behind an organization that touts health, home and happiness, you can get a very real vision on how these “priorities” are applied to their own contributors. A peak behind the curtain will show a staff that is grossly overworked, woefully unappreciated and severely undercompensated. 
During my time with the organization I watched a painful amount of talent walk through the door, submit to months of abuse, only to be laid off or leave for another career opportunity. 
Leadership has absolutely no power and no resolve to fight for their staff. Time and time again, pleas for better treatment or reasonable hours went ignored and disregarded. I’m afraid even since I have left there have been additional layoffs and even more talent has walked out. 
WebMD is an atrocious company that fails to empower their leadership, fails to treat their employees as human beings and continues to fail to live up to their principles. It’s a shame, I had such high hopes with this organization, now I cannot advise enough – do not work here."

It is very disappointing to see them.  WebMD was once a highly respected company and stooping to that level is a new low.

There seems to be at least 2+ managers or senior managers for each person who actually produces work.  Every employee is highly overworked and over stressed.   It is a shame to see such talent go to waste.  

Cries for support go ignored, meetings with managers get cancelled regularly, and of course, there are a select few favorites that get the much-needed attention while the rest of your department may flounder.  There are too many silos of information and lack of inter department cooperation.  There is a very ""us vs. them"" attitude when in reality, we should all be working together to make a great site for our consumers and clients.

All in all, you are being set-up to fail, and then managers are able to use that as a negative in an already very shady review process each year."

I felt like I had opportunity and was recognized for my contributions. 

I worked on innovative projects and had incredible learning opportunities.

I made lifelong friendships with many of my former colleagues.

Today there are a handful of good people left.","I could write a manifesto. I will start by saying the positive reviews are fake, posted by a horrifically nasty HR department desperate to save their jobs. You will not find any positive reviews for NY or ATL offices.

I came from dot com and expected WebMD to have something in common with that type of company. Boy was I wrong! Absolutely terrible benefits, and people are not valued AT ALL. There is no opportunity to advance unless you are a pet of the current president, CEO or Chairman.

Do not even think about taking a job here if you are a woman of childbearing age. Not only do maternity benefits suck, the facility for pumping is a roach-ridden closet in the kitchen. Worst of all, myself and several other women were punished in performance reviews for taking maternity leave, denied compensation and advancement in blatantly illegal ways.

Expect open positions for badly needed resources to be filled with the unqualified children of the executive team and their friends. This happened several times during my tenure, forcing hardworking employees to pick up the slack of the extra FTE AND try to keep self-important non-producers happy and not complaining to daddy.

There has been a yearslong cycle of replacing senior leadership at regular intervals. In 2014, the leadership of Medscape took over the WebMD consumer business and utterly destroyed it. All senior leaders were replaced with Medscape people, none of whom are held accountable for their abysmal performance because of their personal relationships with the current president.

And finally, the HR department actually harrasses the employees. They change performance ratings at their own whim with absolutely no understanding of the business. And please don't think about having some champagne in the office to celebrate a milestone for a colleague unless you're OK with HR busting in and grabbing it out of your hands and dumping it in the trash.

Finally, the company has completely ceased to invest in innovation. Not only can they not get a site redesign out the door in less than 3 years, they are barely investing in any of the systems that keep the lights on, and letting all of the innovative products that were developed before the current regime die on the vine. 

The only thing that matters is selling banners in the most basic way. As long as people keep clicking through from Google so banners can be sold without much effort or imagination, nothing will change. Leadership cares ONLY about the stock price, and the minimum amount of investment in people and systems required to keep the change coming through the toll booth.

Don't get fooled by the brand and think you'll be doing anything ""good"" for people other than continuing to enrich the gross people that have run this business into the ground. It all comes from the Chairman. While he and his cronies rule, this will never be a positive place to work."

442,WebMD Health,"WebMD Health Services - I understand the reviews, but it's different now.",2015-12-08,4.0,I'm In Client Delivery,"Since mid-2014, WebMD Health Services has restructured itself and shed a lot of dead weight around the ""middle"" - we had a significant population of managers who were creating fiefdoms.  Intra-office engagement had become fairly adversarial.  The lack of leadership was obvious, and we were hemorrhaging talent due to the instability.  The restructuring came with its own bumps, but since then, the environment has moved in a really positive, team-oriented environment.

The Wellness market segment continues to grow, the regulatory environment has become well-defined, and WHS has a much better idea as to how it fits in this niche.  Our current leadership team seems to this cynic to be genuinely committed to ensuring that we focus on improving our products and processes.  Our previous leadership - not so much!","First - we're a software development company that happens to develop and manage Wellness programs.  We're not a health care company.  You really have to understand that before you interview here.  If that's not your segment, MAYBE you can find a niche, but you have to be comfortable with software, data interchange, and complex relationships with clients and their vendors, no matter what you do.  If you're used to a comfy, slow-paced insular environment with a lot of bureaucracy, you're not going to get that here.  We're more like an agency.

I started with WHS in 2012 and loved it for the first year and a half, but was seriously considering pulling the plug in early 2014 because the company was something of a mess.  The complete restructuring in mid-2014 and pitiless elimination of weak leadership encouraged me.

We've fostered a really positive team environment which shows when you speak with current employees.  That said, there are jobs that I wouldn't do here.  Be positive that you truly understand the job role you're interviewing for - we've made a lot of improvements with our job descriptions but there are still weak spots.

Recruiting is hit and miss.  If you talk to a recruiter and they leave a bad taste in your mouth, HANG IN THERE!  If you get a chance to speak to the hiring manager and your potential team - they will give you the scoop.  The hiring process is frustrating for all of us.  We're trying to improve this through HR, because the recruiters can be awful.  IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE AT WHS, TALK TO THEM FIRST AND THEY WILL MOST LIKELY BYPASS THE RECRUITERS.  Ask them to submit your resume through the internal referral system as well.  If your resume lands in a manager's hand with a strong endorsement, there is a much better chance that you'll be recruited more aggressively.

Finally - I don't consider this a con, but a lot of people do.  If you're in a client-facing role, you get to work with clients.  Yay!  A lot of people don't have the stomach for this.  Be sure that you are comfortable with speaking with all kinds of people, of varying knowledge levels and professionalism, before you take a client-facing role.  People who are used to just cruising don't do well here."

The new leadership brought in over the last several years are stellar and have a clear direction for the company, are savvy at their respective roles, and are just genuinely good people!  Plenty of opportunity for rewarding strong performance and opportunities for advancement.  Also feel very much a part of a team, heading in one direction with a common sense or purpose and vision.  You will work hard, very hard, but you are actually working for something meaningful that you can be proud of (at least in my case).","Workload has been heavy, but management is doing a good job of making some adjustments to that moving forward and ensuring there are an appropriate number of resources for the given work.

If you're looking for a job here  you're in luck because there's so much turn-over you're bound to get hired.","Not much opportunity for advancement and WebMD will invest very little in your career development.  Leadership prefers external hires for choice positions with direct reports.  But if you're hired at entry-level you are likely to remain there.  You might get a promotion from ""associate"" to ""senior"" with a small pay bump but you'll probably never see any meaningful advancement into leadership no matter how talented you are.  You're more likely to train your latest manager how to do the job and then watch her get promoted for being totally ordinary. 

What else?  This place used to be filled with fun, smart, creative people but they’re leaving or have left.  The only thing that matters anymore is meeting quarterly revenue projections.  Managers operate in constant crisis mode as they’re barking at you to launch as much content before the end of the quarter as possible; your work/life balance is a joke.

I feel good about the work that I do here and I'm proud that we're changing lives in positive ways.

I won't restate all of the bad things said in other reviews, except to say that they are all true. I would like to touch on a large problem of discrimination against workers WITHOUT families. If you are single and childless, expect to pick up all kinds of slack for your coworkers with families. These coworkers will be given even accommodation you can imagine -- lesser workload, flex schedules,  the opportunity to convert their jobs to remote positions. Meanwhile,  single employees are expected to be in the office at all hours, every day, and will be given more and more work, along with more time-sensitive projects, to compensate. 

This was my personal experience, as well as the experience of numerous other (now former employees). 

Oh, and don't bother trying to file a complaint with HR. You'll be retaliated against, because HR will immediately turn around and report your complaint to your manager. HR is not on your side -- always remember that and never trust them."

A pool table, ping-pong table, and big screen television in the employee lounge. Walking work stations. Competitive benefits. Imaginative social events, and a bunch of *really* smart people working in the technology side.","The company announced a 27-person layoff (which included my hiring manager) just three weeks after I arrived -- and it was about a week before Christmas. The timing of that action lacked empathy, and it was the most poorly communicated action I've seen in my corporate career. My team found out we'd have a new manager and report up through a new department in the middle of a conference room of about 80 other people.

Worse yet, there was no contingency plan for the work left behind by those who were laid off. Consequently, I was assigned a large, multi-million dollar account with about one hour's worth of training. As I grew to know the account, I realized they could have trained me for a week, and I still wouldn't know everything I needed to adequately serve this complex, high-maintenance client. 

The company reorganized to create cross-functional service teams, but it lumped Communication Services into those teams even though it didn't really fit. After a painful few months with a manager who had no idea what I did for a living, there was acknowledgement that Communication Services needed to function independently of the cross-functional teams.

Under another new manager, our team was extremely short-staffed, and the quality of our work suffered as three of us tried to balance the same amount of clients that five communicators had served in the past. Cue this manager's departure, and suddenly I have my fourth supervisor in the space of one year. 

Don't even get me started on ""Performance Management."" I can't be sure if it was just that last new supervisor or a culture of secrecy and distrust, but I was never permitted to see any of the feedback collected for my performance review, I was never allowed to formally refute collected feedback that I could *prove* were lies, and I was never given an opportunity to rectify any of these perceived problems."

Loss of talent and good people due to HR policies and executive politics. Don't expect to come in, demonstrate excellent work, and move up. Policies reward hiring from outside vs nurturing from within. They latch onto anything that may prevent upward movement of internal employees. Announcements banning midyear promotions are commonplace. Tend to bring in clueless management to manage superior internal candidates. Soul-crushing.

Senior management tends to be inept, unknowledgeable, political, petty and fake. Prepare to play the blame game constantly. Prepare to kowtow to clients and throw away any ethics you may still have. Yes, sales will sell the impossible because they're made to be so desperate. Go look at any of the sales planning departments. Prepare to spend more time proving you need resources to executives and finance rather than doing your job. 

Projects and timelines are a joke. The lack of retention of technologically capable talent results in projects that sit in queue well beyond their scopes. Production and tech roles are filled via contractors while upper management is filled via full time roles. Results in a blackhole of talent.

Decisions hinge on the whims and subjective opinion of the President. Overall air of doom and gloom. Capable people are run into the ground and go unrewarded while petty politickers rise up. Never witnessed so many managers give crap to direct reports for taking vacation or asking to work from home. Hope you get a good one if you're thinking of working here.

465,WebMD Health,Spiritually bankrupt. Putrid work culture. Employees viewed as the enemy.,2015-09-03,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Company has aggressive competitive stance. Work environment is casual and offers nice office perks. Health and retirement benefits are good.,"The fish stinks from the head down, as they say, yet the focus at this company is continually  on what employees are doing wrong, not doing, or should stop doing, to improve business. Instead, top management needs to understand that you can't be absent, or be insulting when you do make an appearance, and expect people to respect and want to do well for you. Increasingly the company has been more HR-centric and focused on rules rather than leadership. Ruthlessness has become confused with competence. Favored employees receive successive promotions and raises, more support staff, and greater flexibility, while other diligent workers face reduced resources, dismal performance reviews and compensation increases, dead-end careers, and increasing restrictions. The disparity in treatment is beyond obvious. Longterm inner-circle division heads who have risen in the ranks are out of touch with current business practices and are skilled only at navigating the putrid political environment and sucking up to the company president. If the company is ever to push beyond the barrier it seems to continually hit and never surmount, this tier of management needs to go. HR is now dominated by egomaniacs who are more interested in hearing themselves talk and engaging in gossip than contributing anything that might improve culture or morale. They view and treat employees as the enemy, when they should be fostering and leveraging employees'  expertise. Pursue working here only if you feel the brand would enhance your resume, and have your next job in mind before you accept one here."

I got a bad review for being out on Maternity leave. I was told by employees this would happen to me when I became pregnant, but I didn't believe it until it did. I was given an in development rating because my year wasn't long enough bc I was out....HAVING A BABY while working at a HEALTH COMPANY.
2. There is no maternity policy- just the substandard go on disability. But they give the exec team 8 weeks of FULLY paid vacation. Why not just pay out the full three months? You can certainly afford to- you spend 50x more money on awful catered sandwiches that end up in the garbage everyday or water bottles that are NOT being recycled. 
3. Culture- when I resigned the manager of our group never acknowledged I was leaving. A person who was my manager for almost two years said nothing to me even though they knew I resigned without a job. Nothing. Completely ignored that I was leaving the company. Very bizarre but very telling about the type of culture they are creating.
4. Content- I wrote many emails to the teams to let them know this content should probably be updated, and was wrong or very outdated. Nothing was changed or updated. No one cares enough to correct things.
5. The CEO once said they wouldn't take a deal if it was bad for business. A certain large GMO company is currently advertising on WebMD. This isn't health focused. They have lost their own vision. 
6. SO TOP HEAVY with VP's and Directors. There are so many decision makers not enough action. There is no where to grow here, no career path unless you are somehow connected to the corner office.

Everyone with any talent or foresight is running for the hills, especially in the Atlanta office. Revenue management is threatened by anyone with talent and a mind of their own and does whatever it takes to prevent those employees from gaining or maintaining ""power.""

Once efficiently-run departments have turned into constant, self-imposed fire drills and constant chaos/ disorganization due to mismanagement.

If I had to describe middle management in one word, it would be ""dysfunctional"", with an alarming level of immaturity and cliquishness. One minute, I would be told to take more initiative and ownership of my work;  the next, I was being micromanaged. All this coupled with constantly shifting priorities, absolutely no positive reinforcement, being underpaid, and having to document every single interaction in case my manager decided to throw me under the bus made for a VERY unhappy work environment - and this is not just my experience, as almost every single one of my teammates experienced the same.

Also, forget about actually getting a promotion, even if you've been there for years  - WebMD does not like to promote from within.

If you work under the right circumstances, it can be a good existence, e.g., remote employees who don't need to face commuting time or expenses.","Hijinks and arrogance start at the top.  CEOs eventually fall out of favor, and provide for ""you can't make this stuff up"" type of stories.  The only one from the outside lasted less than a year, and was the only one that would make eye contact, smile, or engage much with the rank & file in the hallways.  Executive ranks have always leaned heavily towards having to show both employees and customers that they are the smartest in the room.  HR is squarely in the transaction business. Mediocre health policies, e.g., maternity leave, for such a well-known health company.  Tough place for a middle-manager to come in and crack successfully.  Ten-plus company values are posted but you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone that can off-handedly name even a couple of them.  A 'morale' committee was formed several years ago but disbanded due to lack of morale.  Supposedly there is robust attendance at ""WebMD Survivor"" parties that occasionally happen.

1)  Do not take a job at WebMD unless you really need to.  It is a very dis-spiriting place.  You will waste your talents here.
2)  If you do take a job at WebMD, do not stop looking for other jobs.  Virtually every manager and above is openly looking for their next career - many of them successfully so.  As proof, take a look at the turnover rate among senior management - it is incredibly high.
3) Once at WebMD, do not trust HR or senior management in Portland.  I've seen several people burned as a result. Glassdoor's editorial policy asks for no ranting... So let's just say that there are some in the senior management team who are in over their heads, and treat their employees in less-than-kind ways.
4) Expect layoffs.  There is a grand tradition of December layoffs.  It is WebMD's way of celebrating the holidays.
5) Expect revenue shortfalls (at least for the WebMD Health Services division).  There will be pressure on raises, bonuses, funding of projects, etc.
6) Expect disfunction between the division-level management team in Portland and the New York management team.  As a result, projects will get approved, then dis-approved.  Promises will be made and unmade because of poor NY-Portland communication.

Final piece of advice before taking a job at WebMD.  Find someone who has worked there for a few years first.  Buy them a drink, and encourage them to be open about the company's prospects.  Then make an informed decision (oh, and by the way... WebMD retains a reputation management firm that posts fake posts on glassdoor and other sites - you can usually spot them by their brevity and the fact that the ""con"" comments are vague or not really ""cons"".  Read some of the shorter posts with a critical eye).

It is a shame, really.  WebMD has been in a position to do great, meaningful work, but have time and again missed the opportunity.  Take your talent to a place that can use it effectively."

Sales people sell things to clients without making sure the infrastructure exists to properly implement because they're so afraid of losing the business, and then when the implementation goes wrong, the implementation teams are to blame.

Many pieces of the technology stack are older solutions that have been shoehorned into newer requirements, and it shows. Data is bad across the organization, and while some of this has to do with general issues in medical data, there are clear gaps in data handling processes and technologies, particularly data import systems that also suffer from age.

Problems are compounded by a lack of organizational maturity. Business processes and procedures are almost entirely absent. Change management is not practiced outside of technology releases, which compounds difficulties in addressing organizational issues by making even tactical attempts to address strategic issues more messy and painful than they need to be.

Additionally, most senior personnel have been promoted from within the company. While this certainly shows dedication to the existing workforce, it has also meant that finding new (or even industry-standard) approaches can be difficult and implementing them even more so.

There is no more vision and the consistent Org and departmental changes leaves one to wonder where the company is really going . Leadership keeps bringing in new management that is very sketchy, questionable and is adding more turmoil. Moral and work enthusiasm has been decimated by the management which is the type of atmosphere they foster and I severely doubt that it will get better anytime soon. 

There is no growth, advancement and do NOT expect to be rewarded for hard and good work. It is simply not appreciated, you may get a Pizza Party and a pat on the back.

Yes, the stock price went up but if you let go of half of your work force, free up the payroll, cut most of employees benefits and perks, dump the additional work load on the remaining employees, make them work double or triple and not having to compensate them for it. I would think the books should look pretty good but that business model is absolutely not sustainable and eventually will backfire.

It also says a lot if the COO/CTO of many years abruptly resigned to go somewhere else after giving employees pep talks reassuring that WebMD will turnaround and want to make things better. It is quite evident that it is not the case. If WebMD doesn't proactively change things they will lose the talent that has been shouldering all of the productivity that it has left. I didn't realize how bad it really was until I left and many others feel the same way."

That's entirely unprofessional. I had worked hard to ensure that all my work was complete before giving notice (even working until 1:00 A.M. the night before) and we were at the end of our release cycle so the manager just said he wouldn't need me for the next two weeks. Sure they might not absolutely need me, but that's breaking an unspoken social contract, and both the manager and I know that I could make myself useful during that time period. Giving notice is a courtesy that allows the employees to transfer knowledge and finish what they are working on when necessary, to the benefit of their employers. If the employer just decides to let the employee go early on a whim, then what is the possible benefit for the employee to give notice? I could have just not given notice and quit the day before my new job started, but unlike the engineering manager at WebMD, I conducted myself in a professional manner. Now I am left without a paycheck for the next couple of weeks (over Christmas), 3 paid holidays that I would have enjoyed over that period are history, and I quite likely will have to pay the full cost for insurance for my family for a month as typically insurance on a new job doesn't start until the end of the first month, while insurance from the previous job ends at the end of the final month. Thanks for penalizing me thousands of dollars because I had the courtesy to give you notice!

In addition there is no criteria to become a software architect, or data architect, or security architect at WebMD other than that you have worked there a long time. A couple of the architects were knowledgeable, but more often than not they are just longtime employees who are fully versed in the WebMD system with little software architecture and engineering knowledge.

As a former employee, let me explain how:

Nepotism.  If you're considering WebMD and want my advice, my first answer would be a question ""are you friends with any current director or VP?""  If the answer is ""no"" I would simply keep looking.  That one factor is the single biggest variable in your likelihood of success at WebMD.  If you're not a friend, all your great ideas and energy will be seen as a threat.  I've seen it over and over during my 3 year stint with the company.  The Atlanta office is basically run like a government agency, the only difference are that the hours are longer and the work is more intense.  

I read a Glassdoor review from a WebMD HR person and they nailed it.  If you're a high achiever, and you're not someone's longtime friend, you'll be perceived as a threat.    Forget about transparency on growth and development because there is none.  If you work hard, you may get a an official email saying thanks, and sadly some sideways stares from your supervisor.   Work hard enough, just not TOO hard.  Ask to grow, but don't seem ambitious.   Yes, it's very complicated, but the downward trajectory of the company is very simple.

For all those hoping that having a ""great brand on my resume"" will make up for this malaise, you should probably also consider the opportunity cost to your career as you stagnate for years working so hard to receive so little in return, with no promise of a brighter future."

Bad management all around, very out of touch and have no real understanding about technology their knowledge is very dated. The company has really so much potential but for some reason we keep getting duds in the leadership roles. We lost so many good and talented people but yet all of the top heavy management were able to keep their jobs not sure why because they are about 80% of the problem. Here are bullet points why the company is going down the toilet
- No Employee Retention
Over the past 6+ months the leadership team was able to demoralize this company to lowest as it has ever been. They have no plan to change this.
- Leadership is totally out of touch with what the company does
We create the traffic, the content and the purpose but managment is so clueless and they shut any real initiatives down or simply ignore them.
- Maybe they just trying to make the books look good on paper and could careless if the company will pull through or not.
- Employees do twice as much work with less resources. how long do they think that this will go on?"

624,WebMD Health,Totally mismanaged especially in Atlanta,2013-01-01,1.0,,"great people with lots of talent
Great location
Used to be a fun place to work","Well, what isn't bad about the company? Sadly, it wasn't like this all the time. Once all this management was brought on board things became worse by the day.  Majority of the senior management team are cooks without cooking knowledge and some don't even know how to use the pots and pans but yet they decide the recipes.

I truly feel sorry for those employees that were left behind because I know that Webmd will work them to the bone without providing any real compensation or rewards. I can only blame the leadership because the company wasn't like this in the past it all started around the office relocation in 2010 or so.

It is very frustrating having to listen to individuals that have never designed or developed anything in their lives but get to make the decisions, even worse is that the results are so blatant in your face (not in a good way) but maybe this is the direction they want to take the company.

I can tell you it is very disheartening to see a company which has an excellent reputation and was doing some great things but being undermined by some really bad leadership and decisions. Unfortunately, it appears that the company is very reactive and they haven't figured out that the employees are the best assets because they have created all of the products, they understand the technology, they live the development but the guy that doesn't have a clue gets to make the call.

I believe those that were laid off actually were the lucky ones because they won't have a problem finding employment anywhere else. Those left behind will have to work for 2 now since half of the office was dismissed, even though they stated it wouldn't be the case but you can't believe a word they say.

I can't predict the future for Webmd but from where I was, I see hard times but sometimes things have to be destroyed before they can be rebuild. Just wish my former coworkers good luck and keep your head up. On the bright side those that will work for new companies may be able to make recommendations!"
625,WebMD Health,It was good....for awhile,2013-01-01,3.0,Former Medscape Employee,"There are talented people there, people who will appreciate you and try and mentor you even across divisions and teams. People complain  about the benefits and pay but they were good for me and I even had a few that weren't offered by other companies. I did have some good managers and at times I felt I was able to contribute some things of value and worth. I was appreciated by a few teams. The company has a rich history and I did gain a lot of skills from my jack-of-all-trades duties. It was good for a long time I was there.  And actually much to people's chagrin, the Medscape business model was pretty successful for a long time and probably was has kept  WEBMD afloat in hard times.","I did feel underappreciated at times. Was sometimes demeaned. On certain teams there was the sense of ""watch your back"" and  politic (aka suck up) or suffer the consequences. Those that did were promoted (even if they were dead weight slackers)  those that didn't were reassigned or let go entirely. The lay offs were not handled well- suddenly people were there and then they weren't and no communication just orders to pick up the slack. The workloads were insane on some teams 1-2 people doing the work of 3-4 on another with equivalent workloads. There was  no work-life balance in the past few years I worked there.  Common to work through vacations and holidays. No advancement and sometimes contractors were paid more for work employees were doing or used as an excuse to justify not promoting people (no positions). My managers were mostly fair, but some were terrible. Low morale and people who tried to increase it or call attention to problems were ignored or targeted. Review system a joke - like winning the lottery every few years. It wasn't always like this, it was a good work place for awhile, which also upset people. We weren't opposed to change and growth as long as it meant we weren't devalued - but we were."

CEO and team keep iterating ""innovation"" but yet the workforce has been reduced tremendously on a already tight ship. The work for those left behind has probably doubled and they simply think that this is possible to ""innovate"" under those circumstance, it is very blatant that the new CEO never work in tech.

WebMD has no sense of employee retention, it must believe that it must be an honor to work for this brand. The company will have to ante up on the remainder of employees which pretty much has been the cream of crop or those with the most knowledge base because their workload has just double and the company has not mentioned any types of incentives to keep them around. A few will stick around to see if there will be some sort of compensation for the massive pressure placed upon them

The brand has much potential but unfortunately has been completely led wrong, if it doesn't get it right this time it may be the last straw. Not sure what happened but it used to be a fun company to be at. It turned from a sunny day into hurricane sandy.

In my experience, VERY questionable personal tactics by HR and Senior Managers to get you out the door, questionable review process, etc.  I often felt the sense of favoritism and burn and churn on the employees.  Pushing employees to push clients into areas that weren't always in thier best interest.  I simply would not reccomend this company to anyone thinking about making a move there.  My peers were great, but management was terrible.  You had to be very sneaky, kiss up, bypass rules to survive here.

Workers stretched to over capacity BEFORE lay off, now severely reduced in talent and man power  any type of innovation is questionable, remaining talent will have to pick up the additional work. Absolutely no type of incentives offered to employees remaining including, the standard yearly bonus or raises which more than likely have been cancelled as well, after months long endurance of severe stress and work conditions. The question currently lingering within the offices Laid off group may be actually the lucky group whereas those left behind will be subjected to more

The products are way behind the current industry, there is no innovation, bright people spend hours wasting their time trying to develop good ideas, only to have them shot down by senior leaders so the entire business is either paralyzed or stagnant. The investor spin on why the business is declining (e.g. due to patent cliffs) is a ridiculous excuse for lack of leadership, lack of vision, lack of innovation, and  general incompetence throughout the ranks of the company.  The new CEO appears more concerned in meetings to want to have the last word on every idea, rather than empowering smart leaders to develop and pursue good ideas for the business.
