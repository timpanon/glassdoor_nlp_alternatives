WildLife is one of the companies with the highest talent density I've ever worked at, and this made me develop myself a lot during my period there.

Good compensation package.

Good middle management people.","The executive team constantly changes the goals of the company, making it hard for the teams to plan. The decision-making rationale is not clear, and many decisions are influenced by personal beliefs (which are susceptible to bias) instead of data-driven backed-up. 

I also feel that the company focuses a lot of time on explaining why things went bad instead of thinking about how to improve things, which in my opinion is one of the main reasons why the company is not reaching its full potential today.

Career leaders are quite confusing, and discussion regarding this topic usually only happens twice a year, instead of happening regularly."
16,Wildlife Studios,Wild Culture,2021-07-13,1.0,Confidential Employee,"Money, good benefits, perks (food at the office, happy hours)","Toxic environment and culture: it is common to see sick employees, with exhaustion, depression and burnout due to high workloads and limitless pressure. We have been working from home for over a year and there is no effective financial aid or mental support. Subsidizing therapy sessions and keeping people working 16 hours a day is paradoxical and hypocritical. 
Incredibly, the entertainment is left only to the users: the culture is boring and bureaucratic. Things just don't happen because you fill out thousands of meaningless documents that get stuck with the executives or the CEO. 
Leadership is young, male, and weak. In general, composed of bright students from Ivy League universities and who do not value people. They are completely focused on business, and in general treat people like robots, with very few exceptions. 
Diversity is a joke. There is no affirmative action to include women, homosexuals, transgender people, black people, or people with disabilities. Almost all employees have the same education, live and go to the same places, and think alike. 
At top management, the company is a complete mess. There is no direction, and depending on what book the executives are reading, things change course completely, without explanation or logic. The OKRs are poorly written and uninspiring. The company's vision is non-existent, as is the practice of its values. 
Due to the lack of direction, it is common to see excellent people questioning their own ability, because nothing is good enough for the executives. 
For the user, the experience is terrible: they are not valued, the games are full of bugs and only made to make the company money. There are not enough staff to serve everyone, because this is not the company's priority. It is common to see players, in forums, complaining about the lack of assistance (yes, the company just leaves the game generating money and stops giving support). 
Apart from money and a few good people, there are no good points to be considered."

18,Wildlife Studios,Burnout as a culture,2021-07-05,1.0,Game Engineer,"There is no pro, for real.","You have no time control, you work overnight everyday trying to achieve impossible deadlines. Its part of the culture to publicly humiliate employees under you (they may tell you that they are a horizontal company, but they aren't! The company hierarchy its very well defined) and to ""quit the meetings if the slides are ugly or difficult to understand"" (that is exactly what we are told to do).

Basically, you are not human for them, you are a machine. Inclusion is just part of their marketing.
Oh, and do not expect to work with the same peers for too long, they all will quit the job or be fired.

But if you already know somebody that is on the top of the hierarchy of the company it may be interesting to join the company, they have a career plan for you."

There are many young talents, but for the same reason above mentioned most of them are not willing to listen to any criticism and suggestions from more experienced professionals; instead, they become defensive of their solutions and thus not constructive. They are frequently not pragmatic; just follow ""fancy"" technologies instead of considering simple baselines.

I have an impression that the leaders tend to avoid any real hard work and not even trying to really understand  what is actually going on.

A bit of nepotism is also present versus the older employers -> two weights for the same measure.

If the company does not put in key points more experienced talents, it will fail in a few years (not on the board level but on the team level leadership)."

Meritocracy does not exist. Don´t be trapped by cultural values, because nobody uses them positively

If you get stocks, don´t get trapped! You will have to wait a 5 year vesting period to receive all, and you can´t sell them when you want.
Human and personal values are nonexistent for most of the management."
42,Wildlife Studios,Founders are off what make the company lost in several dimensions,2020-08-30,1.0,Manager,I like working in small teams with big challenges,"Founders make our experience worse, every meeting with them is a disaster. Every time we leave the meeting feeling that you are the worst person in the world. 

The process to get new games is equally bad, we don’t have new ideas and the only one that have more visibility are the ones that copy other titles (like Archero, Hay Day or Coins Master).

Inclusion and diversity should be much more then books or TV shows. We should focus on retaining our diverse talent. Several diverse mind were just sent away, including the head of HR, a woman highly skilled that was part of the executive team. The current speech is almost that we should have diverse “exterior skin” but with the same brain, what is not true diversity."
43,Wildlife Studios,If you’re not a referral from the CEO…,2020-08-28,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"— Young and easygoing environment.
— This is a great place to meet some of the best talents in tech, learn, and challenge yourself.
— You’ll be working with the latest technologies.
— Parties, crazy happy hours, company events, Friday's traditional happy hour, cinema, etc. Also, there’re some clubs, like sports, tech., and, if you want to be someone, you have to be chosen and invited to the book club.","Note: I’ll be generalizing here because this represents a big portion of the core business and an HR Department should resolve this, but the CEO doesn’t want to share his power of decision. However, there are incredible leaders in other departments.
— Burnout isn’t rare.
— If you’re ambitious, make yourself at home, but don’t expect to grow by working hard.
— There're some EGOs in the company that grew beyond healthy limits affecting the people and the company’s culture. Higher-management doesn’t seem to see this is as a problem, they don’t realize/understand how that’s affecting people's morale. These ego-people actions affect negatively the company results. You can speak up, but things won’t change, actions aren't taken. And people will suffer retaliation. 
— While it’s not explicit, everyone at the company realizes how higher-management looks down on some people. 
— Meritocracy does not exist in this company.
— Work as hard as you can, 14~16/7, and if your profile fits and your manager is mature enough, you can get into middle-management. And if you don’t have personal connections you'll get stuck. If you want to continue growing, remember it has nothing to do with the value you generate for the company. Hard work doesn’t mean a thing.
— High-level management will constantly remind you of the importance of generating as much value as you can (encouraging people to work as much as they can) to gain visibility recognition, and supposedly raises, promotions, and equity. This won’t happen if you’re not one of their favourites. Just 10% of the company has stock options. They’re the old ones and a few favorites. Basically a closed group of friends. And if you get some stock options, you'll have to wait a 5-year vesting period to receive a meaningless amount of stocks. Very difficult to sell by the way. You only get the chance to sell a limited amount of stocks when the higher-management wants… and that can happen every 2 or 3 years. it’s just not attractive.
— If you choose to believe in them and sing the hard-work mantra every day, you’ll be years working a lot, and finally realize nobody's watching you, nobody recognizes your work, management just care about their interests, your quarterly feedback comes from a parallel reality (if you’re lucky to have one), you’ll hear absurd excuses for not being promoted or for not receiving a raise when you deserve it. And it doesn’t matter how many times you communicate you’re not happy, nothing will change.
— You’ll discover that there're others in that same situation. Some of them simply quit and spread the word that Wildlife doesn’t give its people the value and recognition they deserve. I heard that before joining Wildlife. Others receive offers from other companies and Wildlife retains them offering a higher salary. Some reject Wildlife's counteroffer because they are already disappointed with the company."

Here the challenges are always getting bigger, and coupled with strong teammates, allow for a great place for learning and development.

The company also has good compensations overall, but fails on that area on some aspects (look at the cons).","The management is trying a lot to change, but keeps missing the target.
The Execs might not perceive what is going on daily, and the middle management does not have the autonomy to make changes. This makes the management dysfunctional, and the feeling that the company is kind of schizophrenic.

They keep promising changes, on Diversity, Compensation, Work-life Balance, and much more, but never deliver on that. It's not that it is without a try, I've saw so many Middle Managers try with no avail.

The problem is deeply structural and core. The company focus 100% on profit, and on data, and anything that is not proven by data won't ever do. Unless the execs believe so and break this ""rule"".

The combo ""We are fast"", ""We are candid"" and ""We innovate with research"" (Which actually should mean that we only do what we can prove though data), makes for a highly hostile environment of pressure of doing the correct thing, quickly and precisely, or you will listen to ""candid feedback"".

This combo coupled with the obsession with growth makes it impossible for the company to fix most issues, since at heart it does not really care about them.

The company says it deeply cares about their people, but this is not really true.
The company knows that keeping people is important, and keeping the morale high is important too. And that is why they always promise more and more, and give really cool events on a frequent basis.

But people are saw as tools, allocated to any project, game as task just as a number, depending on how they will give more profit."
