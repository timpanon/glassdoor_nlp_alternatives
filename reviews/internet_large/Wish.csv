2,Wish,Not Everyone Valued the Same,2022-04-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Unlimited PTO, flexible WFH, and when placed under the right manager there is opportunity to learn and grow within your field. It is a good place to kickstart your career.","Terrible communication between departments. Every team has their own agendas and projects. No one even knew my team existed for the longest time. This was because higher management never recognized the value that every department adds. Some teams really are put on a platform higher than others.

Having been at Wish for 4+ years, there was no sincere recognition of your wins. They formed a bad habit of bringing in outsiders instead of moving up/promoting deserving long-term staff who knew the business model and operations very well just based on their firsthand experience."

4,Wish,"Please run, quickly, far away",2022-03-31,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Base pay. 
There are some good (if not beaten down) people who work here.
Thought the new CEO would be a change, but I'm not even sure he understood what he was getting into.","If you can find a company with lower morale, I'll eat my hat. Wish is a hot mess. 

First, if you're a woman, please run as fast as you can away from working here. The women of Wish ERG is a joke, they laid off all of the leaders of that group, and the rest of us are too exhausted from being mansplained all the time to pick it up. If they hire one more male of Indian descent into an executive role - all of whom shut down any female opinion until it's repeated back to them by one of their bros - my eyes will roll out of my head. 

Second, there's this big ""turnaround plan"" that - if you listen to questions in the weekly town halls - the vast majority of people don't think they can pull off. That's because everyone is operating out of fear of losing their jobs, and everyone is silo'ed. There are zero people looking at the big picture, it's every MAN for himself. 

No one is trusted to do the job that they were hired to do. ""Oh, you have expertise in a thing? Prove it, by running ""tests"" that give data that shows exactly what you said in the first place, but we still don't believe you, so we're going to do what we want anyway."" Or, ""oh, you have a strategy and a plan? That surely doesn't apply to ME, just do what I tell you because I have no experience with this, just because I said so.""

I got into a discussion with a Vice President who probably makes three times what I make about why a platform won't do what they want it to do, when it LITERALLY does not work that way. If you have a problem with that, let me introduce you to the CEO of THAT company - but so glad we had a half hour call where you could argue with ME about it, when I could've just written you a 1-sentence email, but clearly you know better."

If you are ok with working with a company that bases the growth opportunities on popularity over actual work then this is a great place to work.

62,Wish,"Hardworking people, dim future",2021-08-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I joined Wish because of the team I would be on, the innovation and experimentation. There are definitely people who are passionate, inventive and problem solvers.

- Salary & benefits are highly competitive, one of the top reasons I joined
- Still a fast-growing company with untapped potential
- Growth opportunities (or so I was told)
- Data-driven (I think? Not sure decisions are actually made on high quality data)

 The company *could* have potential to turn things around, that's what I saw within it.","Unfortunately, I'm writing this review because I wish I would have listened to the other reviews and taken them into heavier consideration. I'm not a ""disgruntled"" employee, because I'm still within my first year here and have no attachments for these reasons:

It's a dim outlook for Wish's future for the following reasons that I have experience while being here within the first 6 months.
- 1. Look into the entire life-cycle of this IPO-disaster. That should be an exciting, forward moving time to employees and it was so screwed up
- They're in a code and marketing freeze
- Cross team communication is absolutely non-existent
- Hiring practices are rough, there are definitely employees who are incompetent in their roles, or can't articulate in English (as a U.S.-based company, everyone needs to be able to communicate as English-speaking) which creates a whole other set of issues
- If I can feel the uncertainty in business goals, so can everyone else. Alignment is key, and clearly there isn't any alignment or influence in business goals, because they're changing constantly. Pick a lane, own your decisions, and stick to it
- Too many initiatives going on at once, it just doesn't make sense
- The word of the year is Trust for the company, but it's so far in the ""trust"" hole, not sure how they will get out
- Overstaffing/over-resourcing. You can't staff your company if you don't have a plan in place, which Wish does not."

No one cares about communicating at all with non engineering roles either so its a mystery of changes that affect the rest of the company but no one knows when or how or why, if you speak up about it your complaints will go nowhere

The people here who think it’s okay are so lacking in perspective that they are totally disconnected from reality. There is no overarching business strategy and the engineering efforts frequently totally disconnected from the business goals. Moreover, the business model has some serious and fundamental flaws, but instead of acknowledging them and working on solutions people who have been here for a long time (and hence lack perspective) get defensive and angry.

* Management is mostly unqualified, lacking experience, skills and knowledge - sometimes even basic understanding of the English language. Struggle to see the bigger picture, always settling for short-term (minimal) success.
* Promotions are based on favouritism - manager referrals/friends are regularly promoted despite minimal contribution and time at the company (3 months or less). Regardless of individual efforts, spotlight is shed selectively on those the management is promoting.

-Hiring. Wish has a huge hiring problem. High-quality candidates often pass up Wish for FANG companies. With limited options, the candidates who are brought on board are not sometimes not qualified. When it becomes clear that they are struggling, they are given a PIP (employee improvement plan) and if they are unable to improve, they are let go.

120,Wish,don't bother to come,2020-04-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Peers are easy to work with,"biggest problem is management. inexperienced people sit at higher positions but have no clue to scale their engineering teams. this gets engineers worn out quickly though they market this as ‘giving people trust, responsibilities and opportunities to make impact’. managers are generally rude especially the young ones in their twenties. these managers not only technically incapable but also lack of basic skills to collaborate across teams

promotion is never transparent. totally depends on how your relationship with manager. most managers see you as a resource and only cares about how quickly you finish a feature they promised to their boss. there are smart mofos knowing how to rest & vest and yet get promoted, only because they know how to please the manager better than you, although you are the one actually doing heavy work

code base is terrible. close your eyes,  picture the worst school project you ever seen. wish code base is 10x more terrible than that. nobody give cares about quality. half done features get launched with countless bugs. management doesnt care about user complaints because they believe this is how they can iterate fast. they thought they are like facebook and try to mimic move-fast-and-break-things. sadly things are broken from time to time but don’t see them move anywhere

hr team does not care about employees and simply can’t even guarantee performance reviews to be done in time. there is not a single time performance review is competed on time

teams hate each other. engs look down upon non-eng people. engs make too many decisions on features and non-eng people has little to say. they believe this is ‘giving engineers trust and responsibilities’. why the heck do you hire designers, business development, data scientists if you trust everything on your engineers? there is such minimal communication between teams that they are sometimes doing the same thing

career development is impossible. engineers get assigned repetitive tasks with tight deadlines from time to time. proposals on innovations are suppressed as it doesnt help managers to deliver things they blindly promised to their managers. you end up repeating same boring things

there are three directors developing data science teams but yet there is no proper ab testing framework developed. teams doing experiments from time to time and there is no way to guarantee ones experiment doesnt overlap with another. funnily every team claims their feature improves gmv by x% based on experiments yet the gmv doesnt grow accordingly after experiments concluded"

The office has a great view and you get a lot of ownership on your work. It’s almost too much ownership because when you leave or get fired there is no documentation and things break.,"The company is poorly structured and has Very green employees that were promoted too quickly.  Basic things like performance reviews aren’t really used. You can come to work and poof you’re fired even before being notified of that being on the radar. Wish is unpredictable. A common thing I found was the lack of responsiveness. If a senior manager or the CEO doesn’t like what you are asking it’s very common to just be ignored and then fired within a few months. It’s a bit inhuman to not just be direct because employees get left trying to understand what is happening. 

There isn’t clear understanding or process on how to get things accomplished and the attitude that it’s a startup so just get the work done has not been going well during my time at Wish. Hiring seems to be all over the place, just throwing more new employees into the mix and it’s very common to meet other people on unrelated teams that do part of the job you were hired for. My first month at Wish I met 3 people working in the same space that all thought they were hired as the point person. It feels like there was no coordination in planning and people were hired, just to hire. Wish is broken and lacking direction from upper management."

Limited engineering resources - Even with the company prioritizing engineers over everyone else things move excruciatingly slowly as engineers are too afraid of the tyrant CEO to innovate.

You get to join a small team and watch it grow into a big and structured team.

You work on a project and you can see exactly how it impact the business.
It's not uncommon to see the project you worked on by yourself drive in millions of dollars to the company. Not many companies can say that.
Sometimes you even come up with those ideas yourself. We have that freedom and flexibility as well.

The team here is amazing. While everyone is professional and respectful, we're also all friends and I feel very comfortable talking to anyone here.

My work life balance here is reasonable. 
Most people work the standard 40 hours week with unlimited PTOs.
We only stay late when something breaks, which fortunately, isn't very often.

Compensation is quite competitive. We've gotten much better lately at recognizing employee's achievements and impacts to the company. This has been reflected in the latest compensation round, which is very generous.

Even though I'm a full-time, I can also say that the internship program here is also great. You get to do real work as the full times and make the same level of impact. You'll work on real features in our products, no dumb projects that will get thrown out after you leave.

We also got small perks like free catered food, bartender at happy hours, fitness reimbursement, education reimbursement, health care, quarterly team outing, etc.","Common start up problems

157,Wish,Looking Back through the Months,2018-08-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Comfortable work atmosphere. 
Everyone within the team is easy to approach to ask questions or share ideas.
If one does have new or creative ideas, this can be done freely without any restrictions. One can speak with their manager and their ideas can be shared or even accepted to the idea board for future projects. 
Most conversations are done via chat, so one can concentrate on their work while quickly responding to messages. In my opinion, I prefer that way because I want to focus on my work. My hands tend to stop because I need my eyes and ears to listen to someone talking.  However, I do like when we discuss about new topics in meetings are during a standup because ideas are spread faster and clearer that way. 
Everyone whom I met and known are down to Earth. It is easy to make friends at the office. I have seen a couple of colleagues after work head out to have dinner or spending a weekend together. 

Fast paced, busy, but also exciting work pace. There is always something that needs to be done. I have been working here for some time, and I always had something on my plate to do. Of course, there are mandatory repetitive tasks that must be done daily, but there is also new tasks that challenge myself. It helps me learn and widen my knowledge of my position, so it's always exciting. 

On a different note, I like the food at the office. Every week the office kitchen restocks on snacks and drinks (juice, soda, coffee, tea, milk, etc), so I can come and eat some snacks to start the day. If I am particularly hungry, I can check the fridge and make myself a toasted bagel with a spread of cream cheese. 

Good balance between work and fun
Since working here I am finally able to return to my hobbies that have been limited when I was a student. After work, I am not over exhausted, so I can spend time with my family or pick up on fun activities like playing games or reading a book. During weekends I go out to cafes and restaurants and travel to different areas in the Bay Area. Vacations are allowed.
I'm enjoying life more since I started working here.","The company is fast paced, so time management can differ depend on the team, and this caused some confusion and conflicts with deadlines. Conversation only within a small team also contributed with this issue, so while team 1 assumed this one task would take a few hours, team 2 - upon receiving the task - estimated that this would take a day to complete. Then, questions arise from either teams on why and how there is a difference in time completion (team 1 wondering why this task is taking so long, and team 2 wondering why team 1 is demanding on whether the task is done or not, when they are still halfway done). The issue can be resolved if team 1 and team 2 sat down and shared their procedures, but this is often difficult to do when work is fast paced and priorities like these are lowered. 
However, I have noticed a change in this, where there are days when teams have the opportunity to share their work procedures and techniques, and more frequent group discussions that elaborate and estimate the true deadline. Since then, tasks are passing in and out smoothly and both teams are pleased at the result."

One of the really exciting things about Wish is just because you were hired for one task, that doesn’t mean that’s what you’ll always be doing. If you excel at what you were hired to do, if you see a gap that needs to be filled, if you have the idea for an impactful project that could help the company you might just find your daily tasks changing. There’s so many bright and encouraging people working here who recognize good work.

The obvious benefits are unlimited PTO, catered lunch and dinner, reimburse gym memberships, etc, but there’s so much more to working at Wish than the benefits. 

One of the things I really respect about Wish is that the opportunities presented to you do truly make an impact on the company, that you get to share ideas on how things could be improved. Projects are encouraged, and overall its an atmosphere of talented individuals always thinking “how can this be done better?”.

I actually like coming to work each day. I love seeing what my team can accomplish. I’m really proud of the people here. Even during the rough times I still feel lucky to be part of Wish.","Overall communication needs to be improved! The number one issue I’ve faced throughout my years here is a lack of communication. Teams often don’t communicate with each other as much as they should. Sometimes, one team knows nothing about what another team is working on, and then they make decisions that greatly impacts the other team. Wish as a whole needs to work on communication, and thinking how all parties can be affected when they make a change. 

There was a rough patch in 2017 which really made me question how valued I was to the company. Myself and others have encountered dispect from some managers in the past, but thankfully things are a lot better now after all the shake-ups that happened late 2017/early 2018. I know it’s not the same for every team, but it’s been better overall recently. I do believe Wish has ultimately bounced back stronger after the late 2017/early 2018 shake-ups. The aftermath of those events honestly did reignited my drive to excel at Wish, to encourage and connect with my teammates, and to improve my own communication with all teams I work with on a daily basis. There were some rough months, but if you managed to weather the storm you can see the for the most part things are better than they were before.

Pay and RSUs are still a little uneven. While I do appreciate recent efforts to get people to market, this is a company full of talented, hard-working individuals who willing to go above and beyond for Wish, so I’d love to see salaries and RSUs continue to move in the right direction!"
159,Wish,Great if you want to Contribute a lot,2018-08-04,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I joined wish because of the responsibilities and impact I would be getting compared to other roles in other companies. The team is small so communication is great, it’s fast, and everyone is super friendly.  Outside of the teams though.. that’s a different story. We work really fast and it’s super fast paced. Everyone’s opinion is listened to and anyone can lead Their own projects if they are willing to enough. We are data driven and your success will be based on your numbers and impact. We have flexible PTO, managers are offhands a lot of times and you definitely have a lot of flexiblility in your work. This is really great for people who don’t want to be micro managed all the time and execute their own ideas and goals, but within the company’s needs and direction though.","be prepared to be low balled in terms of salary and RSU. Do your market research before accepting an offer here. 

Based on my personal experience and talking to many peers in the company, your salary and bonuses are definitely not based on your achievements and impact. I was significantly underpaid and only just got a raise, which they think is fair but to be honest it just finally brings me to market parity after working here for so long. Even if you go above and beyond in your role, you will still be paid the same amount as your peers. This is extremely demotivating for those who want to contribute more and for those who actually care about the product instead of encouraging mediocrity."

However, it seems to be improving with implementation of new processes and changing habits."
163,Wish,You will have large impact,2018-07-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Your ideas have a lot of weight here at Wish as long as they're backed up by data. It is very easy to lead a project that you believe in and it will have instant effect in the company. When you've exceeded expectations, people make it known. It is quite easy to succeed with a good attitude and with drive. It seems like it's a requirement to be friendly in order to get hired here because the entire company is just really really happy.",Some of the teams can be very young. There are benefits to having a wide spread of ages where Experience and Innovation can balance each other out and a little bit of that is missing.
164,Wish,Amazing company with unlimited potential for growth,2018-07-25,5.0,QA Analyst,"I can give the cliche answers that are definitely the truth such as the amazing skyline view, bi weekly happy hour, paid benefits, catered lunch/dinner but this company is much more than that.  

I’ve had the pleasure of working at Wish for the past year and from day one my opinion and ideas were not only valued but implemented!  How quickly the company is scaling and how lean the team is brings a lot of responsibilities that are outside of one's comfort zone and assists with career growth and development.",I feel like I have to pull teeth here to find anything wrong.  A lot of independent work can lead to a lot of quiet time and minimal interaction across teams.  Being a lean company with a startup feel there is often a disconnect between various teams but that has been improving immensely since the day I started.  Increasing our professional development stipend would be great to help current employees learn new skills to benefit both the employee and the business.

As someone who is worked in the tech world for some time now, I've learned to look past the ""rose tinted glasses"" such as: Bi-weekly Happy Hours, daily provided meals, unlimited snacks, and the beautiful skyscraper views. Wish has honestly offered me the great opportunity to work with amazing, intelligent, data-driven individuals who are curiosity, constantly learning, and excited to take on more responsibilities. 

People throughout the company are always open to questions, and there are plenty of opportunities to dive deeper into professional interests and growth.","There is a communication gap across teams and offices. But I think this is being worked on and continues to be improved. 

The onboarding wasn’t the greatest. Had to ask and inquire for access to all the services / requesting for supplies. Also, the onboarding meeting was for the interns which didn’t feel as relevant as an FT employee."

167,Wish,Great company to grow your career!,2018-07-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Wish is a fantastic place to work if you enjoy working at a place where things get done fast! The culture allows you rather motivates you to constantly experiment. Your work is not limited to the job responsibilities of the role that you get hired for. If you are able to spot a problem, back it up with data- people are going to listen to you and also help you find a solution!

I love that Wish offers flexibility to work across multiple projects and people value your opinion. The company also promotes a great work life balance - bi-weekly happy hours at our 42nd floor (a huge Bar with a legit BARTENDER!),  karaoke events are a great way for co-workers to connect with other outside of their team.We are currently having a pool tournament which everyone is SO excited about! We have quarterly team outings, lunch and learn sessions, and catered food every day!

I truly believe Wish is known for its people and the passion they carry for their space. Everyone here knows that they are making a difference in this giant e-commerce industry yet we still have a long way to go, together!","Every startup culture has its struggles. Things change here every day - new requir3ements, new experiments - which can sometimes lead to low transparency across teams. But I believe every startup goes through this phase and we just have to find new ways to improve any company's shortcomings."

managers here, especially of  the early established team is incompetent and vicious to the dev env around the company, she has built a bad example of a manager.  she is looking at micro issue and solving yesterday’s problems in a brutal way with flaw techniques. she is reluctant to take advice and refuses to admit any mistake she has made and tried to blame anyone worked on it didn't communicate well. she is chaotic and disturbs ppl with a lot of trivial nonhelping questions so that she can get so-called ETA of whether you can finish the task in next 10 minutes or 1 hour, because that matters, A LOT to her.  she always lets her ego and limited/naive experience make decisions for her. 

a female co-worker used to 'work' here  left on her second month because she cried out on the team meeting said she couldn't bear the intense env here and she missed her old team and managers. good for her, she realized the problem cannot be solved without  manager performing  normal duties or being closer to professional.

well, we're looking for a manager who is constantly learning and evolving, while encouraging ppl on the team to work together and strive for the same goal."
170,Wish,Perfect If You're Looking For A Short-term Opportunity With Little Career Growth,2018-06-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Located in San Francisco, nice offices.
Some people are dedicated to the mission.","-Clear favoritism to certain individuals who are otherwise unqualified. Some have been promoted without merit. 
-Lack of long-term vision. Focus is on short-term cash grabs. Wish has ended up recycling the same ""innovations"" over and over for the last 4-5 years.
-Layoffs occur without warning. The heads of most teams outside of eng have been let go within the last year without replacements. Entire teams have also been let go, leaving existing employees to scramble. 
-Fear of the CEO (aka fear of getting fired) results in poorly planned product rollouts, resulting in a ton of back-peddling across all business units."
171,Wish,Know what you're getting into,2018-06-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great market opportunity, going after the under-addressed low-end retail market
Excellent level of talent at the company, some of the best and nicest engineers (lots of canadians)
Excellent views, great benefits, and big upside with the company","With all those pros, it might seem odd that I'm giving this one star, so let me explain. 

The CEO is toxic. He creates a toxic work environment which is punctuated with fear and paranoia. 

Things were going great at the company until about mid 2017. Suddenly the CEO seemed to change his thinking and started aggressively managing out his senior leadership team. These were people many of us had come to the company specifically to work for. They brought the culture we were at Wish for and now they are gone. Instead of having that buffer of experienced leadership, 2018 brought with it the toxic downstream leadership of the CEO. 

Look at how many people have left in the last 6 months. These aren't low level, poor performing employees. These are people who came from top companies with significant contribution to Wish and equity positions who have departed. Some were managed out but some decided they had enough and left. 

You should know this going in. This is as clear of a warning as you're going to get.  If you're good enough to get an offer from Wish, you are good enough to go to better companies in Silicon Valley. Life is too short to waste it chasing money in a toxic culture."
172,Wish,Avoid - Avoid - Avoid!,2018-06-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The actual Wish product is great, and somehow, they've hired great people along the way. But, the negatives outweigh the positives.","Avoid working here! Over the last 6-8 months, it's become one of the worst cultures I've ever seen. You are constantly in fear for your job. Engineers are too afraid to make any real changes out of fear of breaking something and getting fired. This hinders the innovation that the CEO wants - but which he created. 

If you want growth and opportunity, this is not the place for you. They underpay people and expect you to overperform. It's sad to see everything happening because the actual product and what it's giving to people globally can make a huge impact."

Sure every great company has it's ups and downs but the one thing that keeps the company thriving is its dedicated, talented, and studious employees and management who share the goal of building this company to its potential.  I have had the privilege with working with some of the most interesting, down to earth, and intelligent people whose number one focus is Wish and its consumers.

You are given ownership and the opportunity to learn new things, work with different tools, and build out features start to finish. Due to this you have a great chance here to truly make your imprint on the company and the direction it heads.

176,Wish,Updated Review:,2018-06-05,5.0,Operations Specialist,"This is the second review I am submitting to glassdoor, it’s been about a year since my last one and the company has changed a lot. Since then, the following benefits and initiatives have been addressed:
-An annual Professional Development Stipend of $750
-A mentorship program to cultivate leaders is underway
-Regular events to cultivate a culture of curiosity and learning
-An in-house social space for events and happy hours
-Improved catering services (lunch and dinner w/ exceptional nutritional information and accomodation) 
-Corporate Partnership with the Lakers
-Sporting Event Sponsorships: Mayweather vs Mcgregor match and others to come
-Continued additions of talent: these people are fun, hardworking, and truly embody values of empathy and dedication
-Continued upward trend financially 
-Athletic leagues and internal competitions (ping pong, march madness brackets, fantasy football)

Beyond the surface level improvements, I want to share my experience as an employee here for almost two years. I acknowledge that my experience is not universal, and the past 7 months at the company has been trying for many (including myself), but I still come to work every day with energy and determination.

Things at Wish are fast and there’s always work to do. It’s a place where innovative ideas and data take precedence over titles or tenure. At times, it has felt like being put in a pressure cooker, and the growing pains are alive at well, but ultimately this has forced me to acknowledge my agency as a leader on my team and across departments. In spite of hefty work loads and uncapped possibilities for improvement, Wish is a huge advocate for work-life balance. Employees are encouraged and empowered to utilize flexible vacation and work from home and traveling regularly is a common shared interest among employees. Team outings and happy hours are integral components of Wish’s culture.

Wish is a very social place to work. Engineers and management want to hear from non-technical team members and interns. Where structured or traditional communication paths are lacking, there is instead a clearing for direct person-to-person conversation and brainstorming. It isn’t uncommon for me to receive slack messages from heads of other departments or emails from the CEO (I am not a manager or an engineer). Beyond that, my coworkers and I are like family. We talk about our personal lives and we hang out outside of work (camping, karaoke, dinners, watching the Warriors, judging dating profiles). I feel connected to these people and I am so proud of what we have all been working to build together.

We at Wish are pioneers. Global e-commerce is blasting ahead into the forefront of the dialogue on global trade. On a daily basis, we are confronted with the uncertainty of building and growing in the midst of global enforcement gray areas and the setbacks of logistical infrastructure. Wish stands apart from other e-commerce platforms as it embraces these challenges. The CEO stands by the commitment to bring affordable goods to those who have been forgotten by high end marketplaces like Amazon. To him, transactions are not the end game, but rather to persevere and ensure that individuals in rural America, Brazil, Africa, and Sweden get the items they love. Some have asserted that our CEO is crazy or that we are scam site, and to those people I want to say that mad people make history. Wish is about bringing the world closer together, inspiring fun and joy, and making the commercial experience accessible. 

For those who want to be a part of this experience, I invite you not only to apply, but to download our app and try it out. Our users are crazy about us, and they’re the reason I work beyond the call of my official title. We are not perfect, but I can’t think of a place I would rather be every day.","I noticed the reviews for Wish have taken a downward turn in recent months, and I’m not surprised. I won’t discredit what has been reported by others, but I do firmly believe that there is another side to the story here. 

1) Lack of leadership or management
I have been present for a number of reorgs over a very short period of time. These are stressful, cause confusion, and inspire fear; however, this has resulted in massive opportunities for those who have stayed. Everyday I am watching leaders rise around me, and while many of these people don’t have the backgrounds of seasoned managers, they inspire me. As our mentorship programs roll out I am optimistic about the development of these coworkers. I do miss a number of the people who have left voluntarily or involuntarily, and it would be unfair to brush over their contributions to the company and the people. 

2) Lack of communication/transparency
This comes up a lot in the conversations I have with my coworkers. Wish isn’t a large company and the desire to collaborate cross-functionally is very present. Given these two factors, it makes sense that there should be more open communication. Truthfully, we seem to have grown exceptionally quickly and it’s difficult to keep up with all the new people who have joined, but I have never found someone who has been unreceptive to starting a conversation. 

3) Lack of cohesive company values
Wish hasn’t previously invested a ton of resources in articulating its culture into a cult-worthy mission statements and slogans. The values aren’t outwardly apparent at times, but I can see the shared experience in the attitudes and actions of my coworkers. I’ve heard we are in the midst of brewing some Wish-Blue Culture Kool-Aid to be distributed company wide, so this is something I’m excited to see. 

4) “Tyrannical Dictator CEO”
Peter Szulczewski is a very intelligent, data-driven, and intimidating (read: terrifying) man. But, (are you ready for this?) he occurs to me as a truly funny person. I would describe his humor as extremely dark and dry. He’s been known to use Game of Thrones and Silicon Valley references in company meetings to illustrate his points. While this doesn’t land well for everyone, I find myself hyena-laughing in these meetings. He has the ability to make fun of himself and is receptive to feedback from any employee. No first-time CEO gets everything right, and Peter is no exception. Granted, I don’t work directly with Peter. My interactions with him are limited to the following: 
1) Emails (some of these are addressed at 4am and I’m convinced the man never sleeps)
2) Company Meetings
3) I waved at him at the company holiday party and he looked confused
Ultimately, I think he is a powerful person. I follow him and his vision for the company because I believe in his judgement and I admire the courage he embodies in the risks he takes. He recently said he was willing to accept the responsibility of being the “bad guy” because he cares about Wish. Peter might not always be the leader we want or expect, but he’s what Wish needs."
177,Wish,Acknowledgement,2018-06-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I acknowledge everyone who wrote a review about Wish on this site. Expressing your experience, no matter how it may be interpreted, is a valuable contribution to any company. There are many people who may not even speak up at all, so the fact that you did is a generous act. I love Glassdoor because it gives people a voice, and we all want to be heard.  The one thing that always seems to be missing for me is that there are always different perspectives to be expressed, yet they rarely are expressed in sync. I’m by no means discrediting anything anyone said. I’m adding some things in here that may not have been expressed in previous reviews. I currently work with Wish. First and foremost I absolutely love the people I work with. It’s a very unique experience to work with incredibly caring people who are committed to making a difference whether its with their teams, their tasks at hand, or the company as a whole.  

A story about our CTO:
We were planning a holiday party for 500 people in December 2017. The largest venue available that matched the beautiful experience we were committed to creating for our employees was Verso/Forgery. The venue promised us that our interns would be allowed to attend the holiday party if they wore wristbands. A week prior to the event, we received a call from Verso/Forgery stating that the interns would not be allowed to attend. Our CTO was notified of what was happening and stated that we leave no one behind at Wish. Willing to walk away from an incredibly hefty deposit on our current venue, he asked us to find another venue. If anyone knows about planning parties in December when everything is already booked, we were out to create a miracle. The team didn’t have a second thought and got right down to it. I was very moved by the choice our CTO made because that day I discovered the high level of integrity that he operated inside of for the company as a whole. 2 days later, the venue changed their mind and agreed upon letting our interns attend once again, and then called hours before the party to say they absolutely couldn’t let anyone underage in because they would take the chance of losing their liquor license. Our executives and our team got their thinking caps on, spent hours calling restaurants to be able to treat our interns to dinner (because most of them were already booked with holiday dinners), and found one that they attended with our Head of Recruiting. In addition, everyone plus their guests all received gift cards to chose to spend as they wish. Our intention was to ensure they were cared for through a very unfortunate circumstance since there was no time to reschedule.  

About Our CEO:
Being a CEO means that you completely turn your life over to your employees, investors and Board of Directors. You personally hold yourself responsible for all errors in strategy, judgment or performance. You must motivate yourself, your employees and partners no matter the financial obstacles and ensure the integrity of the business. You make sure there's money in the bank with plenty of revenue to execute the company’s vision. You are always weighing risk and evaluating decisions in order to make the correct one. The risk taken is often tremendous with no guaranteed result. There is no playbook available as each accountability is completely unique.  Being a CEO means that anything in your personal life most often isn’t on your priority list.  It’s been my experience that our CEO operates with great care and concern from the perspective of the company as a whole. There are hundreds of things that go on behind the scenes that no one will ever know about because as a leader, he doesn’t talk about it. The choices he has made, whether they are deemed wrong or right, I would assert he made them so that Wish would be thriving in the long run.  They don’t call company “growing pains” painful for no reason. I’m definitely going through my own personal growth as we evolve. It’s inspiring to be with other employees taking on their personal growth while we are implementing new structures and reorganize.

About our people:
Beyond management, there is an attitude of commitment to navigate in the uncharted waters that lives with the people of Wish. They are taking the initiative to pour themselves into inspiring projects.  We all have experienced shut down at times, yet in such a fluid workspace there’s always a way to achieve the projects that you believe in. We have employees who started with transactional work who have advanced within their teams to now be managing those teams.  Someone worked at a well-established Silicon Valley company for a year and was never given the opportunity to contribute beyond her expected role. Within less than a year at Wish, this person was given the opportunity to initiate and design a tool that is now being implemented. She was empowered to collaborate this project with the head of completely different department to achieve this. We are not confined to our titles here at Wish. There was an employee who was so inspired by hearing the ideas from the people of Wish for an upcoming Hackathon that he offered a very large cash donation of his personal money to the winners. He ended up donating in excess of what he committed to because he was so inspired by the ingenuity of the different projects from people across all departments.","Lets get real with some things we deal with:

It’s been my experience that as we explore our corporate structures and core values, communication gets missed. It can be confusing and frustrating if you can’t get an answer to something you’re committed to. We are now developing relationships with other departments where the may not have happened in the past. The result of this seems to have given us agency to be self-reliant. 

We are missing some top-tiered leadership. 
People are now owning their leadership. Where the path ahead may not always be a straight one, there is in fact always an alternate route. We often take that route where ideas often speak much louder than any hierarchy. We don’t seem to have an expectation of what things “should look like” rather we are dancing in creating our future as a team. 

To keep it real, I don’t claim to know everyone’s truth. This is my truth. I actually encourage you to speak your truth."

The perks are standard with tech companies (free food, snacks, flexible schedule). The office space and the view are impressive.","There is a strong God complex with the engineers that all the upper management has cultivated where if they have not come of with the idea they will not make time to build, update, or adjust anything that would help either workflow or customer experience.

This company preaches a culture Data Driven results, that is not true. Metrics are very important but to a fault. Not everything has to be a huge change, if you have 3-4 small changes that can equal some large idea. Along the same lines the transparency and communication between teams is horrible, it is possible to be there for months and not talk to someone in another team who can help you directly. Sometimes even when you have the metrics to back up the idea, it will still not get done because no one wants to do it.


Everyone is underpaid compare to the market average. 

The CEO is does not see that if this company and idea fails it will be because he has micromanaged everyone into fear of not being forced out of their jobs, which will drive away all the top talent. (especially if the stock is vested)"

The company business model has huge potential for growth internationally if they can get their act together","the CEO seems to be on a firing rampage since Q4 2017, its ridiculous how many people they have fired (mostly non-engineering) and for the most insane, fickle reasons.  CEO blames mistakes on everyone else except himself and constantly calls every team or project a failure.

No maturity and developed processes in onboarding, managing and growing talents they took so long to recruit, which is a waste. 

Company seems to be focus on preserving short term bottom line versus building a business for the long term, as reflected in short sighted and punitive policies

A lot of rude managers in the company, particularly 25 year olds who started as interns at the company from the beginning and have been thrusted into leadership roles with no training or directions. Some of them are brilliant, but most of them are hopeless and just trying not to get fired by doing as little as possible so they dont break anything. A lot of self-preservation by  this bunch by back stabbing others and spreading false rumors. Complaints to HR about them go completely ignored. They need to step down as managers and let others take the lead.

Other newly installed managers are simply there because they are the CEO's friends. What is this? A family run business?

Some non-engineering folks who are resting and vesting do 11am-4pm days without doing real work and no one cares. terrible for morale and productivity of everyone else"

Horrible management and culture. Some tech managers could be offensive. Some co-workers showed no respect to others. They talked about your personal affairs in front of and/or behind you.
They treat you as labors rather than individuals.
Not recommend to anyone. I will go back to a well-known corp with awesome culture. Lost trust to these so-called ""startups""."

- Most individual contributors who work at Wish are generally very friendly, collaborative and pretty sharp. This is the company's biggest advantage 
-Flexible hours","- Enormous communication gaps across certain teams and a complete lack of trust for non engineering folks barring finance. 
- Certain managers can be extremely offensive and rude. I've seen emails, slacks and phabs where personal attacks have occurred for unrelated reasons 
- Lack of clarity in terms of what each team is trying to achieve 
- Fear of being fired/failure has made this company a nervous wreck. This isn't the case under all teams but there are definitely instances where people's managers do not step up or take accountability for their teams flaws
- For a 300+ person company there needs to be more structure and training for employees. Review process is also a black box."

The CEO of this company is not only incapable of running a business but he is also the worst communicator in the history of humankind.
Communication is not encouraged and it’s no surprise given the example the CEO sets for his employees. I’ve never felt as ignored in my entire professional life as the time I worked for this joke of a company. Nine times out of ten you would get no responses to any emails, chat messages or invitations you sent to any colleague, either in your department or different ones. Someone please explain this people that in order to run a business you need cooperation between departments and the first step towards cooperation is communication... So reply to your emails!!
I honestly think it is a miracle Wish has not yet been eaten by its competitors as this is no way to run a business.."

Leadership is horrible and CEO takes great pride in firing department heads on a very regular basis (seemingly monthly). Most employees are incredibly unproductive for fear of making the wrong decision which could lead to their termination. Incredibly low bar for talent. Communication is non-existent which stems from the top down. My daily work was insulting to my intelligence and I could have held two jobs simultaneously without anyone noticing.

You will be disappointed if you are looking for a large corporate setting with processes, templates, signoffs (aka politics).

Everyone is empowered to try different things to make an impact. If you are unwilling to be objective and push the limits, this will likely be a poor match.","This is a fast pace environment. It is easy to get consumed because there are so many opportunities to move the needle. Prioritization and learn by trial and error are critical.

I feel like my work actually makes a difference in the overall health of the company, which is not always a sure thing when you work at a startup, but here you really have the opportunity to make a big impact.  I have worked at startups that are chaotic and have poor management systems in place that make accomplishing meaningful projects impossible, which is not the case here. I feel empowered every day to think outside of the box on ways to improve the product, internal policies/procedures and my professional skill set. My managers have been some of the best I have ever had in 5 yrs of working in the tech world. They have been nothing but supportive in the 2 yrs I have worked here and have made me feel confident that my career path here is strong.  Other than that, the benefits are awesome - unlimited PTO, meals catered and amazing health benefits.","Company tends to hire from outside rather than groom and promote within on certain teams. There is no 401k matching program in place.  A formal career path structure is in the works of being created, however, is not firmly in place which does make new people feel uncertain on how they can grow.

Big chunk of engineering team is actually interns that rotate every 4 months. 

Culture is truly strange as a result. Not combative - just really immature and strange. No one talks, no one asks questions of management. Systems and processes are ridiculous. Not a place to grow professionally."
