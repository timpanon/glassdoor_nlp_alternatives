26,Wix,Great company to work for / can be better in benefits,2022-03-23,4.0,Sales,"CEO and the leadership are really people to work for. They are influential. They care about the business and the people. Great culture. 

People are constantly learning and growing. 

The company is rapidly growing under different brands. Room to grow. 

They are the industry leader for a reason. 

Leadership really do care about their customers, and they want the customers to have the best experience.

CEOs' support in Ukraine is highly respected by the employees. All the leaders did their best for their employees which was heartwarming.","Side benefits are not really competitive compared to the other tech companies: 

Health Care doesn't cover dental. It hardly covers most consultations. It doesn't include family. The tech industry average in health insurance is much better. 

Maternity & Paternity benefits are way lower than the industry. Maternity is less flexible and paternity is only 2 weeks. 

They need to match the tech industry average and also it is a necessity for the well-being of the employees."

29,Wix,"Good coworkers, Bad pay, Ugly management",2022-03-21,2.0,Customer Care Expert,"The coworkers you'll have at Wix will be incredible, friendly, and down-to-earth people. At most jobs, you'll have ""work friends"", but at Wix, you'll just have ""friends"". It's also dependent on your Team Lead, but you tend to have some flexibility in your PTO requests. Also, people will tout the ""Benepass"" food stipend we receive which amounts to $220 every two weeks, to be used on lunch food delivery - which is appreciated, but doesn't even begin to make up for the poor pay.","The pay is atrocious, comparative to other extensive tech jobs like this, and despite being a location that's only ever been WFH, Wix ATX demands you live in Austin Tx - which has some of the most expensive cost of living in the US.
Management is a disaster, so much so that intense brain drain and turnover are happening, and Wix is having presentations about how turnover isn't real, and that Wix's ever decreasing stock value is fine.
Wix's constant refusal for the bare minimum livable compensation for its employees has recently resulted in the complete shutdown of their San Francisco location, and the same thing is likely to repeat in Austin too.
Extra effort or additional job responsibilities are not rewarded via increased compensation, and there are no quarterly or annual pay reviews. You have to manually request your Team Lead to put your name in for a raise, and most employees don't have good relationships with their TL, and have to get swapped to other teams in order to go anywhere in their careers here.
I know of multiple people who have had their Overtime hours not compensated with overtime pay, and the heads of the company have made presentations about how they want Wix to be run like Amazon, and look up to Jeff Bezos, which speaks to the experience of working here more than I ever could."

51,Wix,People-First Company,2022-03-02,2.0,Account Executive,"WIX loves its employees, resulting in a company culture that is the front and center priority. Beyond phenomenal benefits, including a bi-weekly food & grocery stipend, you can expect random gifts in the mail and plenty of online and offline parties, hangouts and events. 

The work on the sales teams is fast and furious and focused on quantity more than quality connections with clients. The high sales volume and commissions floor (you have to meet a certain percentage toward your monthly goal to earn your commissions bonus) creates an atmosphere that quickly leads to burnout even for top performers. 

The company provides plenty of opportunities for upward mobility and lateral movement into other jobs for top performers, providing a nice escape hatch for those unhappy with their roles or who want to try something new. 

WIX is easily a 5-star employer, but in my rating it falls short of earning five stars due its underdeveloped processes on the sales teams, commonly leading to sales staff burnout and high turnover.","The fast-paced, high volume sales roles remain undeveloped. The tools and data supporting the sales teams is lacking, requiring a lot more administrative work than you'll find in most other Account Executive roles. The actual role is still misunderstood by management and company leadership, causing inconsistent policies and goals. Sales staff members are bogged down with too many customer support-related tasks instead of remaining focused on meeting the demands of high-volume selling. Teammates who win at any cost by cutting corners and sacrificing their client's best interests are more often praised, rewarded, promoted, compared to those who perform well and do the job as they were trained."
52,Wix,Wix Student through manpower,2022-02-27,4.0,Quality Control Monitor,"The people are great, and the benefits of being a part of Wix employee are enormous. The job is very convenient - work and life balance. You can work remotely and schedule your work in convenient time.","Being out sourcing is problematic. You don't have the salary and the benefits of being an employee of Wix. The projects are short, and usually you don't get a chance of being a part of Wix family. Its really problematic."
53,Wix,Good,2022-02-27,5.0,Customer Service,"Good culture, nice people, great perks","Difficult to grow, low salary"
54,Wix,Starts great then the truth comes out,2022-02-27,2.0,Customer Service Expert,"Nice co-workers, get a food stipend each week which is helpful, send you cool gear","No pay increase unless they decide you “deserve” it, so you can move up multiple positions with no raise in sight. You go from entry level support to “expert” without warning (“additional” training = higher/harder role no pay change) and the work you are expected to do is drastically different and more demanding. Your “reviews” from callers and the amount you do eventually becomes judged even though they claim it’s quality over quantity. If you are more conservative politically then you need to know you have to attend LBGTQ+. BLM, and other left side leaning zoom seminars and are encouraged to do things like change your zoom background to things that support those types of movements and it is clear that if you are right side then you need to keep that to yourself. There is horrible communication from top down, the team leader says you have certain expectations and then the next day it can be completely flipped and even the TL doesn’t understand what we are supposed to do next. Cannot move to a new role until minimum a year in the company even if they are just sitting open. Cannot choose a specific area even though they will ask who wants to."

I got to work on websites as a Tier 2 agent, so I handled the advanced cases.","Sometimes it gets tedious, but just stay engaged.

Night shift was long."

Lots of innovative young people who care about the company’s success.","No work life balance if you are in new business sales, taking even 1 or 2 days off sets you back immensely in your month. Unattainable expectations and goals for essentially B2C sales rather than B2B sales. There’s a cap on commission, and management still expects you to perform more if cap is met even though there is no additional pay. There is also NO pay if you do not surpass more than half of the goal by end of month, regardless of all the outreach efforts and held meetings throughout the month.

They pay more at my local sandwich spot. Seriously this place will have you going homeless before they up your base pay. No matter how hard you try or how much effort you put there is no clear system for a raise here. Dog eat dog.

KPI KPI KPI they will micro-manage you using daily metrics to treat you like a robot. 

Managers are the best with the BS they will tell you a whole lot of nothing when it comes to anything you are asking for. 

They will consistently feedback your work but don't even try giving out your own feedback it won't matter. Depending on who your manager is your work will be very different even having the same role. You will work here for years but the ppl who just got hired will make the same as you. The best employees leave consistently, they don't care. Turn over rate very high. They didn't want to pay ppl more in SF so everyone quit until they eventually just closed the office."

106,Wix,Culture and Opportunity,2022-01-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Wix was my first full-time office job. I was with the company for 4 years, and I do not regret a day that I spent with them. I've made plenty of friends, met wonderful people, and worked with a ton of intelligent people. Being in the SF office is refreshing. You are surrounded by some of the most genuine people and form a bond that is irreplaceable. My team was one of the smallest which only allowed us to work better together. Management in my department was very hands-off and only ever wanted to see you succeed. As the company grew, my team grew, which opened up plenty of opportunities for me. Almost too many that I couldn't decide which direction to go. Overall, you get what you make out of it.","As I mentioned in the Pros list, the company is vastly growing which from the business aspect is a great thing, however, the culture that was much loved has started to fade. The company became more ""corporate"" and it seemed all that was valued diminished. As an employee, the culture is what kept me and once I couldn't feel its presence I became lost. Wix was going in a different direction and if you can't adjust quickly enough, you can be easily replaced. 

No hard feelings though, Wix will always have a special place in my heart

123,Wix,The Ups and Down of Wix,2022-01-14,3.0,Product Specialist,"-The main pro that everyone can vouch for in this company is that the people are amazing. They made the job enjoyable and the culture that was created is because of them. 

-The benefits is great, your dental, vision, health is all covered and you're barely paying anything out of pocket. Since the pandemic hit, most of us were working from home so they provided bi weekly allowance for ordering lunch.

-Working from Home. Obviously because of the pandemic, they catered to our safety and we were able to successfully work from home. 

-My first 2 years here were the best. Awesome teams to be on, Team Leads who understand you, and barely any ego in that building. Someone said it down below in a review, but they definitely know how to celebrate or have a happy hour on Friday. Whether it was a end of the year party or their monthly themed parties, they were fun while it lasted.

-They sent a lot of gifts. Sometimes things you don't really need lol.

-Let's talk a bit about the actual work now. It doesn't matter which ""career route"" you take at Wix, they will definitely help you get there. The one thing they preach from day 1 to year 5 is "" you don't have to know everything"" I appreciate that they said that because they make you learn a lot of learnings, do a lot of positions, sometimes it feels like you can't do the work because it's overwhelming, but ultimately this is good for your resume.","- Within the time there, you are taught A LOT of tings. And those things you learn will eventually pave the way to different positions within Wix but the compensation does not follow. In the years there I was only presented an opportunity for my only raise in my 2nd year and that was that. 

-In all hands meetings we are restricted to not asking certain questions that had anything to do with raises or anything broken within our products that needed attention badly. 

- Yearly raises don't really exist. When you attempt to ask for it, they will "" try"" for it but it's not a guarantee.

-There are no sick hours. This is a big one.

- the gifts and online concerts spent can be probably be put towards future employees opportunity for a raise.

- Due to the pandemic and that we were able to get our work done working from home, the decision to shut down our entire SF office was sudden and we were un prepared for it. Because of this, we went through a re structure that was so unorganized, we really didn't know what the next move would be. Because of this we were dispersed to their active sites outside of SF and there was never really a proper send off and I never got to see my fellow colleagues in person again.

-As a call center we went through a re structure that planted almost all of our agents working on specific products, no longer taking calls. But those that were left over were not given a chance to go to their desired products because we were "" needed"" to stay and take calls, some of us didn't have that choice unfortunately . As a result some agents like myself stayed taking calls and an incredible workload came with it without much help before new sites were hired. If it's not broken they won't fix it. They'll keep depending on the same people when in reality, they have so many agents who can get the job done."

Wix has some of the worst case of promoting engineers to managers I've ever seen. This happens a lot in tech, where the company seeks to reward a talented engineer by promoting them to a management position, but it's so rarely the right thing to do. Wix was riddled with incompetent, immature and unexperienced managers.
Higher-up management is nothing to gloat about as well. In my time in Wix I didn't have a single 1-on-1 talk with a manager higher than my direct one, and in the few interactions that I did have with them, they were distant and unpleasant.

Toxic work environment.
There's a lot of competition under the surface, and interactions with colleagues and other teams were more often than not unpleasant.

A messy organization.
Wix got to a stage where it's so big that the current management paradigm just falls apart. It's hard to tell who does what, how to find the right people, etc."

Pay people for the extra training they constantly receive or watch the all hands zoom meetings become smaller and smaller.

The endless trinkets and “gifts” will never make up for the years of scrounging to pay bills and live in a city like Austin. 

If your excuse is Austin is a new office and is still figuring things out. 

#1 there is no office

#2 why are you employing people just to lose half of them from being to ill prepared to start another location? 

If you haven’t already, read the comments from “the wix people team” to other negative reviews on this app. I promise you their response is the only thing they have done to make things seem like they are being worked on.

206,Wix,Smoke and Mirrors with lots of responbilities,2021-10-19,2.0,Customer Care Expert,"Met some cool people, remote work, weekly lunch credit.","Every single week from the moment you are hired will include vast amounts of new subjects they expect you to become an expert about.
They will very quickly switch from training you to okay, you need to just know how to do this. 
A month before even getting their ""Advanced Tech"" training (which was just opening console log) they started making me and a few colleagues take calls we weren't trained on. 
This leads to users/customers just being pissed at you all day for taking a call that you know nothing about.
Then on that call they will expect you to become best friends with this person who is mad already they have been on hold for hours and you can not help them.
Once you finally learn the million different products, they will start making you take on more responsibilities that offer NO increase in pay or compensation.
Even if you get a raise, they will give you this ridiculous spiel that in order to accurately gauge how much you should get paid we will have you work this promoted role for the same money until we know what we want to give you. You would think that if you earned a promotion, you earned the money. No, you don't according to Wix.
You will NEVER get this money.
You can literally take on all the responsibility they will throw at you, have high numbers, high surveys, and be helping colleagues but it will not be enough. 
You are just another cog that will be replaced with another cog who will inevitably be replaced again.
The higher-ups in the company are laughable. 
The only time you will hear from them is when they want to tell you how lucky you have it and that there is more work for you to do.
Most people you will get to meet will fall in 3 categories. 
First is the people who are new/newish like you. They will think that this is a great opportunity and that the people are so nice and listen to you.
Second, the people who have been there so long they finally got the promotion and are brainwashed into the ole Wix is perfect, Wix is amazing mentality.
Third, the people about to quit. They will have probably been doing the most numbers and have the highest surveys but they are tired of hearing your work is being noticed and not being given a raise. They don't want a stupid bucket hat or a board game. They just want the money they were led to believe was attainable. 
Seriously, do not work here. You are just going to be double talked to and everyone will beat around the bush about everything. No transparency, no compensation, no growth."
207,Wix,My Experience,2021-10-18,5.0,Team Leader,They do everything they can for their people and it all stems back to an amazing culture.,Not a ton of corporate structure if you're looking for that kind of thing. For others that's a benefit.

beneath the surface there is a toxic environment and horrible managers. (and the HR is not the address for issues, they are busy with the next party)
The way they aspire to present the company culture vs the way that it's actually is- are total opposite.

On the surface, it looks like a great workplace that cares for its employees.","Even though high level HR policies are great, the day-to-day isn't. Their policy of being direct with each other is often abused and taken too far. Not everyday in the workplace has to be a battle with other people. It's draining mentally and causes less productivity and hightened negative stress. Politics is way way more felt than it should be.  Ownership, which is one of the company's values, is not only not happening - everyone is trying to throw it on someone else. 
Marketing is going through a lot of changes that aren't being communicated properly. People you work with are leaving / encouraged to leave aburptly and most of their co-workers don't get to say goodbye. It leaves remaining employees with bad taste - this is really not how it should be done. You also don't know what will happen next, where is the department going? Is there a future for you in it?"

266,Wix,You can make more money at Dunkin!,2021-08-25,1.0,Customer Care,At least they pretend to care?,"Under-qualified managers are living large with substantial salaries, while the highly-trained experts are struggling to afford groceries. 

The people who work below you will probably make more money than you. 

Management lies and are shady about everything compensation related. 

You are not compensated for your actual position--they will make you take on endless responsibilities and new roles and then tell you that money doesn't ""buy happiness"". 

The most severe micro-management that you will ever experience. 

Upper level management is so incredibly out of touch with what the day-to-day is like for customer service experts, often resulting in infuriating and unnecessary KPIs. 

The company is based in Israel, which is a non-issue except for the fact that culture differences are not taken into account, resulting in terrible miscommunication and disrespect. 

They will send you random stuff as ""gifts"" that will clutter your apartment--instead of pay you a fair wage. 

IF you ever get a raise (which is unlikely) you will have to wait about 6+ months to receive it. 

They do not care about you and they will not care about you. 

They believe in ""organized chaos"" while dealing with customer's livelihoods--go look at all of the negative comments left by customers who use Wix Payments. It's laughable.

They have left a management position open for 6 months. After interviewing internally, no one even received a second round interview. For what reason? They lied about how to be promoted. All previous efforts were rendered worthless.

Women are not treated the same as men--in pretty much every way. Just ask all the men in management or the men who have gotten raises or the men who have gotten additional opportunities!

Wanna know how to get a raise? Have a great sales career from GoDaddy/Mainstreet Hub! The management will love you and treat you well, even if you completely lack skills directly relevant to your position! 

It's a sinking ship. Seriously, do not work here.

And to 'Wix Team' member who responds to this: This has been discussed at nauseam with every tier of Austin management. Don't pretend to take it seriously after reading a scathing review, just to avoid even more bad things about you on the internet. Lie away and say that it is being addressed, we all know that absolutely nothing will change. What a disgraceful company."
267,Wix,Treat your employees with respect.,2021-08-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The people. Co-workers and the friendships that i have made at this company are the reason why I stayed for so long. Beautiful office.,"Treat your employees with respect. Metrics change every week, with no supports or additional training, work load can be unbalanced and stressful. Will be asked to take on projects without additional pay. Also, promotions gets no pay raise, as you have to apply for a raise which is determined by upper management, that everyone who is doing similar work also applies for—so think Hunger Games for raises. Workforce management has no empathy for the work load agents are taking on and agents often get reprimanded for additional time they take on interactions, without seeking to understand. Furthermore, CEO has actually breezed over questions about pay increases and decent living wages during town-hall Q&A, which was horrifying. Technical issues are glossed over and often take forever to be fixed because Wix always is looking for the next shiny thing, without taking the time to make the product better—and listening to employee feedback."

271,Wix,"It's alright, with pros and cons.",2021-08-20,4.0,Customer Care Expert,"- The people are really lovely to work with. Colleagues look out for one another. There is no 'competition' among your coworkers; only collaboration. 

- Great and healthy work atmosphere. You feel cared for. If you need guidance or advice, you are always in reach of your mentor or TL. You're encouraged to take your breaks and lunch, and they emphasise on the importance of 'shutting off' your work mode once you are done with your shift. 

- You learn a lot about interesting products, and it's a good step into the industry of website-building. You also learn about things that can be applicable outside of Wix, like how SEO works and its impact on a site.

- Nice benefits. For example, remote workers get their internet bills compensated for, which I thought was very thoughtful and nice of the company to do so.","- Trainees go through a 8AM to 5PM work day. You can really feel that extra hour. For care experts out of training, the hours are also long. 

- Unclear terms about annual leave. In the contract and handbooks, there is no term stipulating the notice period for annual leave. When I applied for annual leave, I was told that I needed to give a notice period of two weeks and got my request denied. A coworker told me that she heard that the notice period was months in advance. 

- A lot of things to learn. It can be overwhelming for new employees to process the sheer amount of information dumped on them. Yes, you can always contact a mentor or TL for help, but in the end, it is up to you to understand and absorb this information. There were times when it felt like I was training to become a product specialist, not a general care expert."

This is a mature product with substantial growth coming in the next 12 months.",Some operational challenges associated with getting deals across the finish line but these issues are actively being worked on

Depending on where you land, you may find yourself surrounded by excellent, highly professional people you can learn a lot from.",Big and very corporate. Things get stuck sometimes because it's tough to advance them through such a huge system. Not easy enough to change roles.
285,Wix,Stay Away from Wix Answers - wasted 18 months of my life,2021-08-09,1.0,Enterprise Account Executive,Very few. Met some very sharp and friendly individuals. Bonded through commiseration.,"Leadership is aloof, has ZERO accountability, and is borderline delusional. Their inability to stick with a strategy has caused a lack of confidence that has permeated throughout the organization. It has also caused the rest of the company to view this division with disdain. When one strategy doesn't work the blame is passed around and falls on those who had nothing to do with the decision making. Speak up or out of turn and you will meet your demise. Product could be viable but not mature enough or ready to scale at the Enterprise."

288,Wix,Old-school factory dressed as hip startup,2021-08-07,2.0,Product Manager,"- Colleagues are highly professional and will be there for you.
 - The high growth in the stock price has yielded incredible compensation.","- Forget bonuses and a yearly raise even if you're a superstar. No one actually cares how you perform as no individual KPIs are given to employees. Would you like a raise? It's your job to speak up, leading to highly awkward conversations with direct managers.
 - No feedback process and no one actually listens to the employees. Wix does not send any surveys to collect employee sentiment. Hence decisions are only made by a handful of like-minded individuals.
 - Management are all white men who think people should arrive at the campus at least 3 days a week - encouraging ""team spirit"". Employees are highly frustrated and no one even thinks about flexible work-week.
- The company desperately (sometimes even pathetically) pretends to be a hip-young place while most of the employees are tired parents who would like to go home instead of drinking beer on the rooftop."

299,Wix,Glorified Call Center,2021-08-01,2.0,Customer Service Representative,"Weekly food delivery credit, health insurance coverage, WFH Equipment stipend, occasional gifts in the mail.","Lots of red flags that are easy to ignore when you work for a big tech company that offers good benefits:

- The promise of easy advancement in the interview/onboarding process is outright false. They tell you it's easy to move up early on in the job so you accept the offer, and then change the rules without warning or justification so that you can't apply for a new position unless you work in your current role for *at least* 12 months. 

- The wage structure and pay raise structure is bizarre and obtuse at best; misleading and manipulative at worst. I don't know how this is handled in other departments, but for CC agents, merit increases are NOT offered on a regular basis. Instead, getting higher pay is dependent on an arcane and nepotistic process wherein your manager ""nominates"" you for a pay increase based on how well they think you're doing at your job. Your nomination apparently then is reviewed by site managers and compared to others who received nominations so even if you get nominated your odds of getting a pay increase are slim. Worse still, this process encourages you to sycophantically buddy-up to your manager or work as hard as you possibly can fulfilling daily KPI-metrics to chase the carrot of a possible pay increase dangled over your head. 

-Moving up in the company to more advanced positions doesn't guarantee a pay increase. This should be self-explanatory. 

-Constant adjustment and tinkering with day-to-day expectations. Multiple training sessions and increases in responsibility/workload (such as supporting ""Priority"" users who are demanding, condescending, and verbally abusive) with no pre-arranged increase in compensation. 

-The expectation of complete product knowledge that encompasses a VAST amount of information across dozens of proprietary verticals, most of which are buggy, constantly misbehave, or are difficult for ""experts"" to understand, let alone less tech-savvy users (The bookings system is a notoriously frustrating example of one such vertical). 

- A lack of cross company support for experts on my team who worked late night shifts. Often times in high pressure situations (angry users, high call volumes, urgent issues on calls that necessitated extra support) the expectation was to ask for help in a slack chat. Shift managers RARELY reached out to assist you with problems, which pushed the burden onto other agents, causing them to drop what you're working on and help someone else stuck with a complicated issue on a call. With this dynamic, agents are constantly working on three or more problems at a time, balancing the workload between phone calls, email responses, and live chat.

- On the above note, managers are quick to Slack message you in front of your whole team to demand that you take a call and shame you if you aren't available, but aren't responsive when you politely ask them for help with an issue on a call or see if they can step in on the phone for a de-escalation situation. Somehow they're available when they need you to do something, but are always ""in a meeting"" when YOU need THEM to help you."

You are stuck doing calls all day as an advanced agent and you can look at the schedule and see other advanced agents being scheduled for other things like chat and emails and mentoring, but you're stuck on calls all the time. You voice your opinion and nothing changes. Management don't have a clue what's going on - especially management hired externally. 
People are promoted without the role being advertised - a lot of nepotism going on. There are little to no supports in place for mental health.
You are given more workload with 0 incentives.
The training is abysmal. You are expected to go on calls when you have 0 clue about the product which gives you so much anxiety on the calls as users know when you don't know what you're talking about, and they obviously want to speak to an expert. Especially on the advanced team, you literally have no clue about the product and how to solve the issue 99% of the time even though you're in the ""advanced department"" and it just makes you super nervous and anxious talking to users. If you get anxiety about the job, nobody seems to care."

It was like working at a college frat. They would have Halloween parties that will go for a whole week, free drinks, managers will get drunk with employees, they would smoke on the terrace and all contributed to an informal culture. If you didn't participate in their party, they will look bad at you. They have rubber bullet guns to launch at whoever you wanted when they were working, when you had to deescalate an angry customer they would blame you instead of support you on how to handle it. They would terminate with no good reason whatsoever. They will take away your lunch breaks to work on their meetings. Managers resort to favoritism to make their decisions. Older employees were paid less than new ones were lied to about advancement opportunities. All my co-workers do not work there anymore and were not happy with their experience.

Great support network across the company, so you are always able to get answers to any questions that may pop up. 
Customer support is care focused, meaning that you are there to help people overcome challenges and provide insight on how they can grow. This means that there are no call time goals to meet, but your performance is measured based on the quality if your interaction and how the customer feels looked after.","Because the company is very forward-facing in its approach, this means that certain product issues may not receive any attention in terms of a resolution, and customers can be left waitinf a long time for a feature to be released or a product to be fixed.

I asked for a pay raise, and they simply never got back to me. I was not taken seriously. They are not truthful or forthcoming with the requirements of the job. During the hiring process, I was assured that I would not be judged by numbers, that it was ""quality over quantity"". Then, a few months in, I was given a daily and weekly KPI number I had to hit. The job's expectations did not match what I was told during the hiring process, in many ways. I had to meet with my manager once a week about the numbers, and was interrogated if I didn't hit them. They take being ""adaptable"" to a whole new level. You are not given clear expectations or enough structure and guidance to do your job well, but are expected to hit a number. It's a lot of constant, tedious work with little pay, and rarely an increased pay for overtime. They cover up their exploitative company culture with overly friendly people and commending people who are ""flexible"" and ""adaptable"". The higher up executives/CEO are quite rude and send condescending emails. This is a very poorly organized company. I would not recommend working here to anyone, it is not worth the headache."

Katie, Mayu, Akane y’all held it down in your departments I admired you three so much. I’ll miss those tiny dogs.

To OPS/IT Kasi was a real one with Janelle. Kayla and Noam came in and you didn’t skip a beat thank you. From Coop to Kim to Gio I hope you know how truly valuable you are and that you all were so appreciated and worked so damn hard thank you.

Finance team Angela you’ve held it down since day one.

The OG QA Sebastian.Tony, Phillip,Clayton,Dominick,Grady,Krysttian Tony, Evan. Thank you guys for always being willing to help even when things were breaking you held it down, It did not go unnoticed.

The OG Elites Talos,Edgar,Lara,Robin for some how juggling your work and helping others too all while doing it with a smile. Could always hear the laughter coming from that side.

SFTL’s y’all really keep the ship afloat. It was incredible being able to work with you for the time that I did. I have only great memories.

Jorge and Aneesah you the last ones left represent! I was lucky to have started with you two.

To Chatara,Devin L, you are wonderful people I have the upmost respect and admiration for, you’ve earned what you are getting and more.

To the people who where ever on my team past to present. You’ll never know how grateful I am to have had you all riding with me through thick and thin. Y’all were really like a second family and helped push me to be better at times when I really needed it. Believed in me and were side by side with me it was truly an honor.

To the rest of the CC. You are such incredible people Wix couldn’t do what it does without you. So much talent, knowledge and kindness it was truly a special place to be. I would of rode with y’all till the wheels fell off. I hope you know your worth and make sure you get what you have earned. Keep your heads up and take care of yourselves much love.

Dan","I could take about how I was mishandled from the start. How I was retalited against by my SM (I have a few emails if you are interested in seeing) how SM's are widly disconnected from the day to day and underperfrom but have no one to view their ""productivity"", how HR seems to be more concerned with what could turn into a Legal case then actually being there for the people during their time of need but I know that would get no where. To talk about people being underpaid in one of the most expensive cities in the world and how they rather have virtural concerts then pay their employees a resonable wage but I don't know what would come of it. probably the same that has come in my time being there.

All offices have politics, but unless you are part of the ""It Crowd"", you will always be low-balled, manipulated and pressured to do more without compensation. 
Expect to do more than 80 hours of work per 2 weeks, but be compensated for less. 
Your time card, even though clocked in at precise times, will be changes without your knowledge. 
It's hard to find what can be used to assist you (perks, benefits, reimbursement) that will never be told to benefit you, unless you speak about it. And even then, you will be shunned away by any management personnel from bringing anything like that up. 
There are no reviews, don't ask. 100s of people have tried bringing it up to our CEO/Management/HumanResources, but with nothing to show for it.
Severe disconnect from East Coast to West Coast. And worse from US to Israel (our HQ)

2. Many great professional people to talk to and learn from.
3. Nice offices with great perks (Although some offices are really overcrowded).
4. Wix looks good in your CV.
5. Very few companies do hire really great people and keep their standards of quality high: Editor, Payments, Domains, ADI, Design System, and some more. Smaller and R&D teams usually suffer from poor management.","A few bad apples hired a couple of years ago now grow into a part of the culture where those things become a norm:

1) Lying to CEO about product-market fit, numbers, and research to justify your workplace and not get noticed for running your part company poorly. There're multiple teams now who do this on a regular basis and it all comes top-down from company heads and product managers. Such behavior doesn't benefit the company, nor any of the employees, and only helps company heads and product managers to keep their jobs and massive benefits. Please consider who you hire and keep before it all goes on fire. 


2) Growing a culture where top-down decisions from management and avoiding any hard questions is the new norm in many teams. It's become more and more often when management just shuts down any more or less hard questions from the team about planning, culture, etc.


3) Inconsistent internal policies. Compensation is always up to negotiation with your manager and it highly depends on their mood and your ability to spend your personal time to show how you adore their work and present yourself on a regular basis. You're not noticed until you're literally poking your manager for a raise or some change. It's a norm for your compensation package to be reviewed for a 6mo or even more. The bureaucracy and lack of transparency in this process are insane.

There're also multiple internal rules that do apply to certain people and don't apply to others. Keep it consistent or don't make rules public at all.


4) ts a norm to get an ego-based decision being pushed to you. Keep in mind that everyone in any team you're collaborating with will have a strong opinion on your decisions: from C-level to average Joe – everyone will tell you how to do your job, often even will block your request as leverage to implement their vision or just make a straight order to make it happen like they want to see it. I know there's a team focused on solving those bureaucracy problems now, but it still works like this. It's a very rare occasion when there's a respect for your decisions or a will to learn how they were made before critique is given.


5) Awful medical insurance. It's quite often that you need to pay 70-80% out-of-pocket for medical procedures. Yearly checkups are not covered by insurance as well as most doctors and procedures for which you have to pay 100% out-of-pocket. Dental or Vision benefits are completely out of the question too. This is the worst medical insurance I've seen in Ukrainian IT. 

With the COVID situation, lab tests are totally 100% on you and they cost 30 to 100$ for each test. Even if you had a contact in the office, you're not covered for testing or treatment at all. You're basically on your own with your medical problems."

I've seen Wix go above and beyond to support employees through various personal situations, which made me proud to be part of the team. 
Working at Wix is ""fun balagan"" (which means chaos in Hebrew).

- Enthusiastic and friendly coworkers who pump out initiatives and product updates at an impressive speed.
- Great benefits, including stock, insurance, meals, and branded swag.","- With so many offices and departments, teams can be siloed, which slows down communication and makes it difficult to figure out the best contact for specific questions. This leads to some product updates lacking key features due to insufficient collaboration.
- Lack of clarity on who is responsible for what often hinders progress. Sometimes Person A will unexpectedly find themselves responsible for a project that Person B had initiated.
- It does not matter if you consistently exceed goals and have your contributions celebrated by leadership - if you ask about performance reviews and/or raises, you will be told it is not “the Wix way.” This lack of growth within teams means employees feel the need to hop into other teams to secure a “promotion.”"

A great culture, amazing perks, and great managers.","Unfortunately, the pay just is not comparable to other companies. While the perks and benefits are great...that just isn't enough anymore. Most bay area tech companies offer these perks and benefits now in addition to a much better pay. Wix needs to reconsider what they are paying their employees. Structure is also a bit off at the company. I  believe that having to go through TLV to get anything and everything done is time consuming and not efficient. You are loosing employees because of this."

There are no one year reviews. 
Numbers are more important than the overall work of hardworking employees. 
If you get promoted into another role it is not a promotion until your title changes because then you’re still expected to complete the work you were hired to do while also completing the work you were promoted to do. So instead of getting a title change you get more work, the same pay and are still in a customer support role. (The promoting tasks assigned to you aren’t tracked.) 
The managers go into meetings all day while the team has to rely on each other for support. Someone less senior than you could be micromanaging you. 
The managers send out this daily update that one manager can complete and send out to all employees. 
Lots of office scandals and hookups.

If you work hard you can move upwards, maybe not very quickly but it’s possible. I’ve always felt like they’ve been really understanding in the sense where if you have a family emergency, or need to take off suddenly for a doctors appt, or are having any problems outside of work. Generally the people who work there are what make that company, I never dreaded going to work because everyone was fun to be around.","It is a call Center, so if you don’t like being on the phone most of the day, probably not for you. The only con I can think of is that the pay is too low, especially for the Bay Area. It’s nice that they allow you to work overtime, but I don’t want to have to work overtime to supplement my regular income to ensure that I can just scrape by. As far as I know, it doesn’t seem like the raises are too high either.

They changed the call wait time from 2 minutes to 1 and then everything went down hill from there. I was often told I was giving quality calls but they were too lengthy. Got in trouble for things that are pretty ridiculous and natural things humans need to do to get through the day. The people on the other line will be a mystery always, and sometimes be prepared for cursing or put-downs for being stupid and not knowing how to fix a ""flash"" website; really...who uses that anymore!? Basically I would only take this job if you are fresh out of college and need something to build your resume; it's not the best, but it's not the worst for customer service.They really do try to make it pleasant.

813,Wix,Customer Service Representative - job review,2015-04-22,1.0,Customer Service Representative,"- Predictable work hours; weekends and holidays off.
- Adequate health and dental benefits.
- You’ll meet some really talented, hardworking people here. You'll also probably make at least one good friend.
- Good resume builder.","Working in the Wix call center is grueling. Honestly, calling it grueling doesn’t begin to describe how powerfully depressing this job is. Eight hours a day, five days a week, answering angry call after angry call. That’s what your life is when you take this job. But it’s a call center, so that’s to be expected.

The reason I give this position one star isn’t actually because of the work itself but because of how terribly mismanaged the call center is. Don’t expect to ever get promoted. Or to earn a competitive salary (no exaggeration, you’ll make more working at the Genius Bar). Do expect to be micromanaged beyond anything you’ve experienced. You can also expect to witness significant HR violations including blatant racism and cultivation of a culture that supports sexual harassment. Oh, and sometimes you’ll have unpaid mandatory work meetings on your schedule (they’ll make you sign some unclear waiver that somehow prevents you from suing them for this... although I suspect you can't legally forfeit your right to be paid for the work you've done). 

All that said, I’m not surprised by the number of positive reviews are here. They actively recruit employees to leave good reviews. Additionally, they devote a large amount of time and resources towards “team-building”, which for some is great. If you’d rather spend weekends and nights with your family, however, or with your cat or your hobbies, they will make you feel very uncomfortable for not participating. These perks are a giant, misguided bandaid."

In the SF office, micro-managing is the norm.  You cannot go to the bathroom without someone questioning you about it.  

Not much room to grow career wise; compensation is not competitive. 

At various times, company wide emails have circulated containing homophobic and racially insensitive images and jokes.  There was specifically an email sent by one of the higher up executives pretending to come of out the closet.  Then later claimed someone logged into his email and sent it as a joke.
Another email had images of caucasian college students dressed up in black-face, and the leadership not only defended it, but chastised anyone who spoke out against the racist photos."

837,Wix,My Second Family,2013-02-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great team members... As a group we have a ""family"" feel to us. Great environment to work in that includes a full functioning kitchen, a balcony that overlooks the Mission, closely located to Bart for an easy commute, and cute dogs running around the office. Overall this company helps me get to know my own neighborhood better by providing tickets to local events, weekend hikes in our beautiful neighboring counties, and volunteer work around the city. 

Interview process was like no other I've had... Group setting called a ""Mixer"" with interviewees and company employees hanging out and chopping it up. Casual environment and even had to attend a a social event to see how'd I'd do in a ""party"" environment. Interview process was actually fun (which is a first)",Walking Mission St either really early in the morning (5:30am) or later on the evening (sometimes as early as 7 or as late as 9 9:30) can be a little scary. Don't feel safe in this neighborhood.
