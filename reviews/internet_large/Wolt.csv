office location
looks good in your resumé
snacks in the office","salary is surprisingly low.. very low. 
poor management
chaos
HQ's policy in Finland is great and valuable but the Hungarian team does not follow it, only on paper
racist, sexist colleagues
my first and last payment was incorrect because there is no one with HR or payroll knowledge (which was also surprising in a company this big)
they do call you after working hours and also on weekends (forget your private life if you want to do your job well)
the flow of the information is also very poor - you will not get enough information to do your job
unnecessary meetings about the same thing every week, but without any progress
bad meeting culture: imagine that you have 10 things to discuss and 1 hour to do this. They talk and talk to long and do the brainstorming on the ""overall"" meeting - which should have been done earlier - and every week you will only get to talk through the first 3 points."

207,Wolt,One of the most exiting startups in Finland,2019-05-24,5.0,Team Lead,"I have a long background working for great software consulting companies in Finland and what I've learned is that the project you work on is the most important thing that determines workplace happiness and how much you're learning. Working for a startup or product company, you choose the ""project"" by choosing the company, and for me the ""project"" of building a quickly scaling food delivery startup is better than any project I did in almost 10 years as a consultant. I also really like working on a product that I use multiple times per week.

Although we've grown a lot in the 2 years I've worked here, the product team (currently just over 60 people) is still fairly small compared to the everything we build, so each developer and designer gets a lot of responsibility and power. It's  often a surprise to people coming in for interviews how many things we build, the customer facing app is just the tip of the iceberg.

Decisions about the tech stack are left to the teams, but our culture is one where we care more about solving the business problems than playing with esoteric tech - our choices of React in the frontend, Swift & Kotlin for mobile apps, React Native for the courier app and Python + Scala (+ Rust and C++ in some places) in the backend are fairly mainstream - my experience is that playing with crazy tech is something you do when the actual business problem is not exiting enough.

Our operations run in many countries, so we're naturally international. This is also reflected on the product side of things, even though everyone is working at the HQ, we have ~50% of the engineers from somewhere outside Finland. English is the company language and spoken also in informal settings like lunch, if and when there is someone who doesn't speak Finnish at the table.","Wolt is a quickly growing company and with that come some growth pains - for someone coming from a great consulting company, not everything process will be as smooth as it could be, and sometimes you have to push yourself to see the changes happen. Usually things do work out like I'd like them to, but it won't be handed to you on a silver platter.

The fact that the busiest times for our operations are evenings and weekends means that you get messages on slack outside normal working hours. Nobody is forcing you to answer them, but at I least I have a bad habit of responding to bug reports in the evening once I get the kids to bed"
