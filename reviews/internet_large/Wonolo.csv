0,Wonolo,Zero Regrets Joining the Wonolo Team,2022-04-05,5.0,Recruiter,"Wonolo has an incredibly empathetic and collaborative culture. We're all on the same mission to empower the in-demand workforce and that mission shapes how we work. Transparency, kindness, and excellence are at the forefront of every interaction. I'm so glad I made the jump to join the team.","Just like with every growing company, scaling processes can be a challenge. However, every challenge is met with an opportunity to improve and be better. There is no ""this is just how we've always done things"" behavior. We're constantly ensuring Wonolo remains a great place to work."
1,Wonolo,Empathetic Leadership and Respect for the Individual,2022-04-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The top three reasons why I'm still a Wonolo are:

1.) Empathetic leadership - the leadership cares about its people and doesn't treat us just like another headcount
2.) Respect for the individual - I feel valued and empowered at Wonolo; my strengths are leveraged to excel in my current position
3.) Anything is possible - There are so many opportunities to make a difference at Wonolo, and I am given the opportunity and trust to pursue them.","Compared to my other workplaces, Wonolo doesn't have any big cons. The only area of improvement for me is:

1.) Clearer path forward - this is usually normal for start-ups, but there is often some haziness in terms of the specific strategy moving forward
2.)"
2,Wonolo,Amazing,2022-04-01,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"The connection to the management is unmatched!
All tools are provided to succeed.",As any start-up will have there can be growing pains.
3,Wonolo,"Great Culture, Strong Mission",2022-03-31,5.0,Marketing Specialist,"Wonolo is aiming to reinvent the future of work. Although scaling and growing fast, the company has managed to maintain a great culture centered on transparency and collaboration.","Truly a great place to work, no particular cons."
4,Wonolo,Proud to be a part of something AMAZING,2022-03-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"There's not a better company to be a part of than Wonolo. 

1) Transparency 
2) Trustworthy Leadership
3) Great Culture 
4) Great support from the team",Not that I can think of at the top of my head.
5,Wonolo,Work-Life-Balance / Transparency and a Rewarding Mission,2022-03-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"As a working mother of two kids, under the age of three, and an employee of Wonolo for a little over 4 years now, I can honestly say that work-life-balance not only exists at Wonolo, but is highly encouraged and valued. I have the flexibility to take time off when I need to take care of the kids, or just need a mental health day for myself. Being a remote first company also adds to that flexibility and balance. 

The leadership team at Wonolo is also top notch. Their commitment to transparency is fantastic and they all have a great open door policy, where you can reach out to them at any time. I don't know too many companies where the CEO will Slack you to see how you're doing, but that's not out of the ordinary here. 

The company's mission is also very rewarding and you are able to see your individual or team contribution towards the goal on a regular basis. It is truly a pleasure and an honor to be serving communities of people who have traditionally been underserved, providing them a flexible way to work so they can support themselves, their families and their dreams. It's definitely what drew me to Wonolo in the first place and it continues to make me proud to be a Whammy (Wonolo Employee) to this day.","Just like in any start up, the mission/ goal generally stays the same, but the road map/plan to get there often changes. If you are someone who is not flexible or doesn't like to pivot / change, then you might have a difficult time thriving here."
6,Wonolo,I've found my tribe.,2022-03-25,5.0,Key Account Manager (KAM),"Where do I start? I am typically a job hopper in all previous roles because I felt underutilized and was not challenged. I thrive in chaos and always put maximum effort into everything I do. From Yong to the Wonoloers this has been the most rewarding experience I could ask for. I have the autonomy to make decisions, we work as teams daily, everyone is genuine, and Wonolo values mental health while working remotely.","As with any start-up, there is a lot of change. Some decisions are excellent and some are harder to get on board with. However, as long as we speak up and are honest with our Leadership Team they always listen or make us ultimately feel comfortable about the reasons why."
7,Wonolo,Great Company to work for,2022-03-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Wonolo is a strong company with significant growth year over year 
- Leadership is transparent, has strong vision, and clear communication
- Focus on culture, and DEI
- Fair comp packages comparable to market standards","Wonolo preaches on our culture and DEI, but it's not always enforced within individual departments or teams. We have decent representation in the C-Suite, but there are teams that are severely male dominated in management positions across the company. This jeopardizes the authenticity of Wonolo's word and culture."
8,Wonolo,One of the BEST work cultures you can hope for!,2022-03-23,5.0,Finance,"Meaningful mission, transparent management, professional and collaborative colleagues, and remote work are among the many great things at Wonolo.","There are growing pains as we work to streamline processes to keep up with the rapid growth of the company, but this is normal for any startup."
9,Wonolo,"Motivating, empowering, career accelerating",2022-03-22,5.0,"Director, Customer Success",We work tirelessly to solve problems together. We leave our egos at the door and focus on consistent improvement for our users. Creative and results driven mindset is encouraged & rewarded. Every last employee has not only the opportunity but the expectation to make an impact. Our leadership team has high EQ + deep pulse on our business - they make decisions from the bottom up and exemplify transparency.,Fast pace & high expectations - not a con for folks who thrive a rapidly growing start up environment.

13,Wonolo,A truly amazing place to work,2022-02-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I was a bit skeptical reading online reviews about this company's culture. How could it be that good? But I was extremely pleasantly surprised to learn its even better than the reviews even portray. I've worked for many companies that say they have an incredible culture, but Wonolo truly embodies that.

Wonolo is mission-driven, has very intelligent employees, compassionate leadership, and is growing/beating goals each Quarter.

- I feel heard by my managers when I come to meetings with any hesitations or issues that come up

- Collaboration between teammates is natural and provides a wonderful environment to get quality work done quickly and effectively
- Growing fast, no limits to opportunities!","- Investment into career pathing could be better. Since we are a startup, we just need to keep building out resources external to Wonolo (conferences, etc)"

- The company mission is what makes me motivated about my work. You get the opportunity once a quarter to talk to users and hear their stories. It puts what you're doing every day into perspective.
- Small team, big impact
- Good benefits","- Dealing with legacy code: not everyone's cup of tea. Personally, I've loved the challenge and had a lot of fun figuring out tough problems"

30,Wonolo,"Your Search for the IDEAL Company is Over, You've Found Wonolo!",2021-10-18,5.0,People Team,"Wonolo is without a shadow of a doubt the best company I have ever worked for. 

1) The Mission
Not only is the product such a ""no brainer"" idea that is changing the lives not only of businesses across the U.S. who are struggling with national supply shortages, but also the lives of gig-workers who are looking for flexible and fulfilling opportunities. We empower the underserved workforce to pick up jobs that are not only fitting with their busy schedules but also changing the game with the gig economy by offering so many perks (portable benefits, time off, a commitment to a LIVING wage (the first gig economy to commit to such an offering), etc). We are disrupting the traditional staffing space and making a real impact in the lives of people who need it most in our communities. I can honestly say, I end start and end work every day motivated and excited to continue toward this powerful mission.

2) The Growth Impact
Not only is our footprint and corporate team growing, but the opportunity to grow and learn new things is limitless. There are so many ways to up-level your skills and try new techniques/strategies (without having the red tape of 10 different levels of leadership to get something over the line). I appreciate the idea of continuing to improve yourself 1% every day and it is evident across the organization's commitment to never settle for the status quo. We are just barely scratching the surface of an over $140BN industry and we have never been in a better position or more stable than we are now.

3) The Leadership:
Have you ever had the CEO of your company regularly check in on you to see how your family was doing? How about a CEO who emails the entire company and specifically mentions 3 things that he has learned from you (+ 3 things for EVERY single person at the company) in the last year? How about a CEO where when you shoot him a Slack asking for his opinion when you are at a crossroads for an important decision and he replies that he would love to call you since it is important? I have never felt more valued and truly appreciated than I do at Wonolo. Thank you, Yong + every single leader at Wonolo.

4) The Benefits:
Compensation is extremely competitive for the tech start-up space. Non-commission based employees receive a base salary, up to 13% bonus that is based on company revenue targets (yes, paid out MONTHLY so you don't have to wait until the end of the year), 100% covered medical/dental/vision insurance for you and 80% for dependents, MEANINGFUL equity packages, unlimited PTO, and flexible schedules (AND an actual work-life balance where family is THE most important thing) with the ability to work remotely from anywhere in the U.S. or Canada. The company also offers maternity and paternity leave for 3 months (100% covered) + a 4th month transition period + $3k baby bonus. HR is working on getting us a 401K match hopefully in 2022!","With great opportunity, comes a bit more ambiguity than more established companies. If you are the type of person who enjoys lots of structure, already built out processes, and a lot of direction into what your day-to-day look like, the start-up world might be difficult for you to adjust to. The individuals who thrive here are constantly looking to improve existing processes, strategies, and up-level the team they are on."

- Opportunities for Growth: if you perform and show you're capable of taking on more responsibility, opportunities definitely exist for promotion and career growth!","- Rapidly evolving and change is a constant: On-demand staffing is hard, and the company has to be nimble as we grow. As a result, the company is quick to evolve, however, this means roles and responsibilities may change, teams may change, and you have to be willing to adapt and grow with the changes.

- Processes are not always clearly defined. We're going through early stage growth, and like any new company, not all processes are clearly defined. This can present challenges, however, also opportunities if you're able to create the vision and define the process."

So if you are looking for a role that will not change throughout your time at Wonolo and do not want to continue adjusting your skillset to grow with the company, then Wonolo might not be the best option for you."

60,Wonolo,They want you to like working there,2021-05-26,5.0,Current Employee,"They are a very transparent company, you're aware of what other departments are doing and have opportunities to showcase your contribution to the company. There's a weekly ""kudos"" where team members can shout out their co-workers for going above and beyond, there's always a bunch of people giving credit and recognition for hard work. There's a monthly meeting where everyone in the company is invited to ask the CEO questions, Wonolo tries hard to connect everyone.","Remote work can be difficult to join into, but that's less about the company and more about remote work in general. They do have a lot of social meetings to try and compensate for it. Some people love them, some people have it on their calendars so no one schedules anything over it and some people dislike the work day interruptions, so there's a whole spectrum of involvement. I try to go when I have the time."

Your bosses care about you and what you have to say. They care about helping you evolve and improve. They assign you tasks that they think you'll be most interested in. Upper management genuinely wants you to be happy and to feel fulfilled. 
This is not one of those companies that hire you just to fill a role. 
It feels like a family and a thriving family. 
Everybody works together but there's also a strong understanding that employees each have their own working style. Some need time to focus and accomplish the workload that is most beneficial to them, whether it's at night or in the morning. As long as it gets done.

The mission of the company is one that makes you feel good at the end of the work day and is what originally attracted me to the company three years ago. The culture is truly amazing and inclusive and it's not only creatively and enthusiastically fostered by the HR (people) team, but by all of the management team and employees alike. Wonolo is a remote first company which gives employees the flexibility to travel and live where they want, as long as they can still do their job. That being said, even though we're all remote, you always feel connected to the team and we come together as a company via Zoom a few times a week to align and celebrate our wins. I believe the benefits, perks and the compensation are great and extremely fair. The unlimited PTO and the work from anywhere flexibility really provides excellent work life balance . There is also plenty of room for growth and professional development.",Wonolo may not be for you if you if you can't handle a fast paced start up environment that's constantly evolving and changing.

80,Wonolo,Best place I've ever worked,2021-02-09,5.0,Director of Product,The culture at Wonolo is ideal: you're surrounded by smart and friendly folks that are great to work hard or play hard with. Leadership is transparent and makes a concerted effort to ensure that all voices are heard. And Wonolo constantly gives back to the Worker community even at the expense of the bottom line. Really love working here.,"Not a huge fan of being remote-first as the Wonolo office was super fun, but it's pretty tough to say that Wonolo is responsible for this decision"

84,Wonolo,Loving it after 9mos at Wonolo,2021-01-27,5.0,Functional Leader,"I've worked at both large established companies and 30-person startups, and my 9mos at Wonolo is among my most rewarding professional experiences. Why? Much of what you probably already read in other reviews:
-Our mission draws candidates who believe in creating opportunities for underserved workers, and our recruiting team has done an exceptional job of hiring across diverse backgrounds with a focus on entrepreneurialism, humility and a collaborative spirit. 
-Company culture starts at the top, and while I've worked with amazing leaders in the past, Wonolo's exec team has built an amazing company culture focused on impact with empowerment and empathy at the forefront. Employees feel valued, heard and supported -- which in turn inspires them to take risks and do their best work. 
-Yong, our CEO is deeply customer-centric and constantly looking for ways to elevate Wonoloers (workers), customers and employees. Others within the company have created cool opportunities to connect with our workers to stay close to our mission.
-There is fantastic transparency from leadership on the opportunities and challenges ahead, and have worked collaboratively with functional leaders on a strategy to succeed.
-With the shift to remote work, Wonolo has embraced flexibility in working hours and locales and done a great job of adapting to employees personal and family obligations.","-The company has embraced remote work during Covid, and done an admirable job of keeping the collaborative culture alive at a distance. It is still super hard to adapt and feels lonely at times. As someone who started remotely, it can feel even little more isolated since many folks from pre-covid are closer. 
-There is a ton of manual effort behind-the-scenes to help workers and customers succeed. While our technology keeps improving to address day-to-day hiring, scheduling and payroll issues, we need to keep investing aggressively to be able to scale.
-Our market strategy has evolved over the last few quarters, and while we've navigated through most of Covid successfully, we have a big job ahead of us if we want to reach our full potential. If you don't do well with uncertainty, or regular changes to your responsibilities, this can be stressful."
85,Wonolo,Proud to be here,2021-01-27,5.0,Account Executive,"It sounds too good to be true, but this company practices what it preaches. Yong, the CEO, is hands-on, humble and honest and that trickles down to every leader in the company. Culture is not just something bragged about during the interview process, it's alive and well here at Wonolo. 

Wonolo has also made clear efforts to keep teams connected while now a remote-first organization - virtual pizza parties, costume contests, wellness challenges, etc! Benefits are incredible and the compensation is more than competitive (+ uncapped commission for sellers!)

Great leaders, tons of resources, growth opportunities and open and honest culture - the list goes on!","No cons! Obviously 2020 required some tightening of budgets, so it'd be amazing to have a stipend to outfit my home office, but that is a frivilous con!"
86,Wonolo,Surface doesn’t match the product,2021-01-14,1.0,Inside Sales Representative,They are good at building internal company pride but make a lot of empty promises.,"Recruitment bonus never paid out, KPIs changing, leadership out of touch."
87,Wonolo,Great culture & impactful work,2020-10-19,5.0,Marketing,"I have worked at Wonolo for over two years, and have seen the company grow significantly during that time. The company and the culture have remained true to their roots -- valuing the mission (democratizing flexible work for frontline workers), honesty, and transparency throughout. 

Employees (or Whammies as we call ourselves) are given the autonomy and trust to do our jobs. And everyone is on the same page and focused on driving impact, no drama.

Management / leadership is receptive of feedback from any and every member of the team. They care that they are doing right by both the team and the business.","With the new WFH / remote work schedule and quarantine, it can sometimes be difficult to manage work / life balance. Especially during the busy season.

Strategy & priorities can change quickly. This is not for everyone, but is par for the course for a start-up and necessary during unpredictable times. As mentioned above, I think Wonolo has handled this quite well, and there is no other group I'd want to weather the storms with."
88,Wonolo,Mission and Empathy driven leadership,2020-10-19,5.0,Marketplace,"+ Transparency and radical candor are celebrated
+ Thoughtful strategy focusing not just on results but creating impact for the underserved",- Some issues with being data driven. Overreliance on pre-populated reports vs true understanding of data
89,Wonolo,Best Place to Work,2020-10-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"best company I've ever worked for, for many reasons:

- powerful mission: we provide flexible work to underserved communities. Too many tech companies are building products for the white collar / high skilled workforce. It's exciting to be part of a team focused on building solutions for folks who need them the most. 
- we are solving hard problems: we are disrupting a legacy staffing industry. We are innovators and pioneers. Aspects of what we are building haven't been proven, we have had big wins and some failures. It's a great place to be if you have a growth mindset and enjoy tackling exciting challenges.
- the team: I'm surrounded by people that I can learn from. Everyone at Wonolo is high performing yet humble. Even though we have reached a certain size, we are still a tight knit group. No politics or egos.
- culture of trust: I have the runway and autonomy to do my work. Now that we have transitioned to a fully remote company, I enjoy having the flexibility to choose when and where I want to work without fear.","We are growing, things move really fast, and plans change. You need to be adaptable to thrive here."
90,Wonolo,Inspirational leaders who care,2020-10-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Wonolo is full of leaders who genuinely cares about your career and personal growth. Since I joined Wonolo, I always felt that I have the full support from everyone in the company regardless of their titles. It's rare to see a high performing team that also embraces transparency and collaboration. It's even more rare to realize that the culture elements we talked about during the interviews actually hold themselves true once I joined.",The collegial culture sometimes lead us to lean towards a consensus-driven decision making.
91,Wonolo,No place I rather be,2020-10-16,5.0,Digital Communications,"Wonolo is a place where I feel welcomed and heard. I have a team that respects my input and makes a strong effort to work collaboratively with me to make sure we achieve our goals. We value transparency, hard work, and fun!","Sometimes hours can feel long, but I know that in the end, the mission of bringing more work to people will be worth it all!"
92,Wonolo,Amazing place to work,2020-10-16,5.0,Senior Principal Product Manager,"- Genuinely full of nice, collaborative people that just want to solve hard problems. Low-ego culture, high degree of trust within your team and with teams you work with.
- High degree of autonomy. You are trusted to develop a good plan or product roadmap
- If you are a product person who likes cross-functional work - this is the place! Ops/Business <> Product feedback cycle and partnership is good. 
- Handled switch to remote workforce well, I feel connected to the team and that I know my teammates well
- Key roles in the company (directors, VPs, etc) are all filled by extremely competent yet low-ego/high EQ/highly collaborative people",- One or two teams where skills/abilities are not up to par; could get more done faster/better if everyone was top-notch
93,Wonolo,A different start-up,2020-10-16,5.0,Director,"+ While a start-up like many others, Wonolo's mission is unlike the rest. Wonolo has ambitions to change the way people work and make a positive impact on people's lives. The mission is infused in the daily life of the company and gives a sense of accomplishment not found in other businesses. 

+ Benefits and pay are competitive. 

+Strong Leadership

+ Upward Mobility","- Strategy and Process can change quickly #startup

- Some ambiguity in roles (+ for some)"
94,Wonolo,Easily the best company I've worked for!,2020-10-16,5.0,Marketing Manager,"Wonolo cares about their employees in every single way - career, health, personal life, work/life balance. Besides the amazing benefits (literally free healthcare coverage), the company is always moving, fast-paced and looking for the next challenge. I feel enabled to do my job and drive new ideas that can impact the bottom line. They're also really great at adjusting and moving with the times. During the pandemic, they took quick action to protect the safety of their employees. They enabled us all to work remotely and choose where we want to live. Wonolo treats us not only as real people, but as adults who can make their own decisions. I can't tell you how much that impacts your day-to-day career satisfaction!","Wonolo is still a young company. As with any young company, there are growing pains to work through in terms of optimal team structure and goals/metrics."
95,Wonolo,WE ARE FAMILY! I GOT ALL MY WHAMMIES WITH ME!,2020-10-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Wonolo truly functions like a well adjusted family. We care so much about each other and about our mission to serve the Wonoloers that use our platform to help pay rent, put food on the their tables and take care of their kids. Yong is an amazing CEO with an EQ as high as his IQ. This is truly a Great Place To Work.",It's a start up and you have to be able to roll with changes that can occur suddenly as we try to crack this market.
96,Wonolo,Great job! Great People!,2020-10-16,5.0,Senior Program Manager,"Always flexible with how rapidly things are changing, and willing to listen to feedback. Everyone seems to be on the same page about focusing and getting work done while still celebrating results and having positive interactions every day. The whole company stays close with company wide stand ups 3 times a week and a good variety of company wide activities keeping the team engaged even while remote.",Can be difficult to get everyone together to make decisions or move forwards projects if there's a lot of conflicts (not Wonolo specific but more of a factor of learning to be a remote workforce)
97,Wonolo,Hands Down the Best Job I Have Ever Had!,2020-10-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Wonolo is without question the best company I have ever worked at. I think it all starts with the mission. I genuinely know that at the end of the day, the work that we are doing here at Wonolo is contributing to the greater good and helping others in our community. In our world, now more than ever, we are able to make an impact on the lives of thousands of Americans who may have recently found themselves without work and provide them the flexibility to pick and choose jobs that fit in with their schedules. It really is rare to find a company in the tech-startup space that is driven by a mission to help others. 

Now, let me talk about the incredible leadership team. Transparency seems to be one of those buzz words that companies often talk about having but there are not many that truly live and breathe transparency. From the C-level all the way down, our culture fosters an environment of asking questions, understanding the ""why"", and valuing each other's opinions (even if they are different!). Our CEO makes it a point to make sure every single person feels valued and appreciated. At the end of the year last year, he sent a company-wide email with every single employee's name and a SPECIFIC memory he shared with them from that year. He also slacks me regularly to check in and see how I am doing. I am not sure of too many CEOs in Silicon Valley who do this. Oh and did I mention, half of the senior leadership team is women? #winning

The opportunity for growth is endless. If there is something you want to learn, a team you want to shadow, a mentorship opportunity you would like (or someone you would like mentorship from.. lots of Ex-Google, Uber, Ivy League Grads, etc) Wonolo is there to help you get what you need. As with many start-ups, the rapid growth of Wonolo has allowed our team to grow and learn at an exponential rate. I have seen people promoted within just a few month's tenures. I have been promoted twice in my 2 years with the company and it goes to show that hard work, a commitment to exceeding goals, and a passion for empowering the underserved, is rewarded. We have competitive salaries, a company stock bonus (paid out monthly) based on pre-set revenue goals for the year (that we have hit every month in 2020 even with a PANDEMIC), fully covered health benefits, 3 months 100% paid maternity leave + 4 weeks transition back to work time (part-time first month back), cell phone reimbursement, unlimited PTO (people DO actually take time off and it is encouraged), and being a remote-first company, we now no longer have to commute to the city and have more flexible schedules with our families. As a working mother, I appreciate that Wonolo values maintaining a healthy work-life balance and understands that family comes first always.","Working at a start-up required you to thrive in an ambiguous environment where there are not always clear cut answers/direction. It is not for everyone. But this is the type of environment where you have the ability to step outside of your comfort zone and make a BIG impact. If you are adaptable, enjoy the hustle of a rapidly expanding start-up, and want to empower the underserved community, you should definitely apply. Right now!"
98,Wonolo,A company with true values and an outstanding culture!,2020-09-10,5.0,Key Account Manager,"- When I first started I was skeptical that this was too good to be true. From day one, I was welcomed by each team, every person I came into contact with, and felt truly needed. Several months later.... still true! I can't begin to say how happy I am with this company. I feel truly blessed to be a part of this organization.
- Every member of the leadership team actually cares about every single person employed here as well as our Wonoloers. That is truly hard to find someone who actually does what they say they will do and stands by their decisions whole-heartedly to support their teams.
- I feel incredibly supported and have everything I need to do my job, including the authority to make decisions and calculated risks for my customers.","- Although it's outside of your control, I do miss being in an office with my peers!

99,Wonolo,"Mission driven, People centric, and Goal Oriented!",2020-09-08,5.0,Account Executive,"Wonolo is an incredibly special place! I have not found an organization where every single member feels as dedicated and responsible for the mission at hand. One of our key values is, ""We act as owners and work as teams."" This is incredibly true! 

Secondly, our culture is people centric. We take an incredibly focused and diligent approach to serving our clients, but we also take great care of one another as well. 
The solutions brought to the table by our teams are nothing short of innovative, creative, and thoughtful. We do not take no for an answer and will always pioneer a way forward in every situation.

Lastly, Wonolo is goal oriented! Goals and metrics are not something brushed under the rug. We set goals, measure them, and celebrate or recalibrate based on achievement. This is top of mind for everyone and the entire team is bought in on what needs to be accomplished. 

I am so proud to be a part of the Whamily and could not imagine a better team in the world!","Wonolo really does act as a family. Since the onset of COVID we have become a remote first company. Now this is an INCREDIBLE opportunity!!

However, there is nothing like being with your team in person, and I cannot wait for the day when we can all safely be together for a gathering or meeting."

107,Wonolo,A company that truly values its employees,2020-08-13,5.0,Director of Supply,"I've worked at multiple early-stage marketplace startups, and I really think I've found a (work) home at Wonolo. The leadership at the company really cares for employees, and the ""Tao of Wonolo""  is constantly reinforced throughout, from our interviews and performance review process to our affinity groups and team outings. We normally had work from home Fridays, but since the pandemic hit, we've moved to a 100% remote model, giving employees even more control of where they work and when they work. Everyone is understanding of balancing work and family life, but you are also given ownership of your projects (and responsibility over hitting KPIs). Oh, and did I mention great health benefits and competitive salary? There's a reason why Wonolo is consistently named one of the best places to work on various lists!","Hard to find too many, but there are some usual downsides of working at a startup that's still finding it's way: goals/priorities may shift quickly, and we're subject to the usual funding cycle challenges (if funding is tougher to acquire, budgets can tighten up quickly).

110,Wonolo,Wonolo - Where the Doers Are,2020-08-11,5.0,Software Engineer II,"- The CEO is incredible, like in the fantastical sense.  His heart is on fire for the mission and his employees and he consistently fights on behalf of both.  His strong leadership coupled with his overwhelming humility makes him a great guy to run alongside.
- Within engineering, allowed the freedom to explore, change teams, and find what really fits.
- The community of peers is great.  I've generally felt supported when I needed it, and that support has felt genuine and unagitated.
- Their is incredible opportunity to grow.  Management is trusting enough of their teams to both provide the challenges, and allow for the space, one needs to grow professionally.
- It's a group of doers and if you value hard work, you'll find yourself surrounded by others who to do.
- The people are fun.  Taking our work seriously, but not ourselves is a big part of the culture here and it's great to see that even during shelter-in-place Wonolo continues to find ways to express that sense of silliness","Wonolo is still going through some of the growing pains and challenges that typically go along with companies of this size.  Things can feel hectic and unorganized.

There can be a lack of structure around certain procedures due to the newness of the company."
111,Wonolo,Awesome place to work at,2020-08-06,5.0,Director R&D,A mission-driven company that puts its actions were its statements are. Deeply cares about its users. True transparency across the company starting from the top. Very little politics. One of the best places I worked in my career.,Don't really have anything negative to say
112,Wonolo,Genuinely Love My Job,2020-08-03,5.0,Key Account Manager,"After working for 3 great, fast growing, challenging companies, I can honestly say Wonolo is where I am building a career. I am genuinely happy in my role, learn something new each day, and consider my coworkers good friends. The management is supportive and realistic. It is the first company I feel like actually cares and encourages me to have a life outside of work. Work hard, play hard. Each day brings new challenges but I am given all the support that I need to continue growing. Working remotely has always been a preference for me so that I can travel and no matter where the rest of my team sits in the U.S., I feel more connected than ever to each of them. Communication is key and this company is transparent and supportive.","After coming from a ""corporate, straight and narrow"" company, it was a challenge at first for me to have so much control over my day and time at Wonolo. There is no micromanaging. It is up to you to perform and stay connected."
113,Wonolo,Incredible culture and mission,2020-08-01,5.0,Operations,"- Mission: Employees truly care about Wonolo's mission to help the underserved find jobs, make ends meet, and grow their careers. Each employee does a job on Wonolo each quarter to further develop empathy for Wonoloers. 
- Empathetic leadership: The leadership team is extremely transparent, personable, and empathetic. After our Q1 kickoff, leadership blocked off several hours just for team Q&A and the CEO has a standing meeting every other week for anyone to drop by and ask questions.",Typical startup challenges / seasonal demand - things move particularly fast in the second half of each year.
114,Wonolo,Intense and Rewarding Place,2020-07-31,5.0,Manager/Director,"Focused, competent, caring leadership. They mean what they say.","Can creep into work/life balance, although they try to ameliorate that."

I have been working with Wonolo for over a year and this is by far the best company that I have ever worked for. This company believes in developing relationships and helping the people we serve. Wonolo is truly an organization that I believe in.",There are no cons currently.
116,Wonolo,Transparency & Autonomy abound!,2020-07-27,5.0,Sales Account Executive,"Yong is one of the best leaders I've ever come across in my sales career. Inspiring, motivating, and unbelievably transparent. Great executive. Management gives you space and autonomy to operate - no micromanaging. General sense of urgency and drive to get stuff done across the company. Super welcoming and positive workplace culture. The team lives/breathes its core values consistently.",Remote work only (which may or may not be your thing).
117,Wonolo,Great Place To Work!,2020-07-27,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"A very pleasant combination of an intelligent start-up environment and healthy / fun culture. The people I engage with on a consistent basis (Sales + Sales Ops + Account Management + Marketing + Supply + Finance) are all very fun, relatable and team oriented. Management provides clear expectations of goals and is very transparent.","This is not a con for me, but Wonolo is a work-from-home company. Depending on your preference of professional environment and how comfortable you are collaborating with teams, this will be mostly done via Zoom & Slack."
118,Wonolo,The Best Company I've Ever Worked For,2020-07-21,5.0,Sales,"-Extremely dynamic workplace - everyone works together to make process improvements and realize goals
-Strong people-first focus; everyone is truly integral to the success of Wonolo and is treated in that regard
-Mission-based company with an intrinsic goal to serve the underserved/underemployed demographic 
-Amazing culture - everyone truly supports one another and celebrates results cross-functionally
-Remote-first dynamic that still prioritizes strong community and connection internally
-Strong opportunity for growth and career development","It's difficult to list cons for Wonolo, but the one that can stand out is the fact that we are a start-up and nothing is set in stone. We are a dynamic and flexible company - which can naturally produce changes to process and workflow. That's a huge value-add to someone who is inspired to make an impactful change within an organization, but it can be difficult for someone who expects a rigid environment."
119,Wonolo,Many opportunities to grow and to learn an excellent learning environment,2020-03-19,5.0,General Laborer,You get the opportunity to work for many different companies and learn different skills,The only challenges are the ones you give yourself
120,Wonolo,An Excellent Place to Work,2020-03-18,5.0,Key Account Manager,"Wonolo is a company that genuinely cares about their employees. They are very transparent, from initiatives to financial reporting and company culture is paramount. I've worked at several start ups before and Wonolo is by far the best. Here's a few more pro's:
-Transparency
-Company Culture
-Benefits 
-An awesome CEO 
-WFH Friday's
-A great snack program 
-Very cool co-workers","As with any startup, it can be stressful from time to time, hoping the company makes it long term."
121,Wonolo,Excellent People,2020-03-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company culture is unmatched. The people are caring, hard working, intelligent, and friendly. I've had the chance to work on lots of really interesting projects and made an impact.","The company is growing quickly, so we have experienced some growing pains."
122,Wonolo,Great Start Up,2020-03-12,5.0,Customer Success,Wonolo has an excellent culture that puts its employees  first. I have not previously encountered a company that truly feels like a family like at Wonolo. Wonolo leadership is also very transparent about what is going on.,Start up life can be a rollercoaster at times and things can change very quickly.
123,Wonolo,Amazing place to work,2020-03-03,5.0,Fullstack Software Developer,Great people and team. Company culture is great!,not that i can think of
124,Wonolo,Great  Culture and Mission,2020-03-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Leadership has developed a  strong culture. They are transparent and honest. Besides, Wonolo  is working on a great mission.",I would say the normal start-up problems and difficulties.
125,Wonolo,Truly Understand How to Build a Culture,2020-02-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Workplace culture has become ubiquitous, and unfortunately, for most organizations holds little meaning outside of a buzzword used during the interview process. And while the free lunches and ability to work from home on Fridays are added perks at Wonolo, they aren’t what make our culture great. So what does? A leadership team that treats everyone as equals, evidenced by the transparency they provide and a CEO that thanks you for your time when you interact with him; a true team mentality because our business doesn’t thrive without everyone working together; and the fact that it’s a mission-based organization, impacting thousands of lives. The leadership here truly understands how to build a culture that inspires you to work hard.","Wonolo is young on the maturity curve and a start-up, if you aren't interested in building a business or don't have a figure-it-out mentality,  this environment wouldn't be for you. Not a con, just not for everyone."
126,Wonolo,A Hidden Start-Up Gem in the Bay Area,2020-02-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Wonolo is a hugely mission-driven company. While a lot of start-up tech companies say they are mission driven, here, the very core of the company's mission to exist is felt every day.  I believe that Wonolo's mission and values separate the company from every other tech start up in the Bay Area -- because on top of helping a start up grow and succeed, it feels good to help individuals find jobs, grow their skills, pay their rent, and more. 

Additional pros:
- Building and Scaling: As a small start-up, things move at a fast pace. If you enjoy creating, building, and scaling, this place is for you. 
- People and Culture: People are kind and nice. This is hard to find in a lot of tech companies in the Bay Area. But at Wonolo, there are truly no bad apples. Everyone is respectful, thoughtful, and generally,  very pleasant to work with. 
- Management and Leadership: The executive leadership team are smart, approachable, and thoughtful individuals. That attitude seeps down to the rest of their teams, and sets a great example of how to swim well together. 
- Lifestyle and Good Benefits: While everyone works hard, you also are able to have a good work-life balance here. We have WFH Fridays, and a flexible vacation policy, and people actually take time off when they need it.  
- Industry and Space: Wonolo is one of the few in-demand marketplace companies trying to disrupt the traditional staffing space, and as a result, it's exciting to be a part of the first movers and shakers. There is a lot of up-side and potential at this company. 
- Inspiring and emotive CEO: Wonolo's CEO is one of the best leaders I have seen and worked with in my career. If you meet him in person, you're going to want to work for him. 
- Diversity: Last but not least, diversity is a real thing here. We actively hire diverse candidates and it is reflected in our leadership team, in our coworkers, and across our users and customers. A lack of diversity is a real issue in the tech industry in the Bay Area so I am super proud to be at a company that not only cares about diversity but shows it matters through action.","Typical start-up problems exist. Wonolo is a growing company and it hasn't ""won"" yet-- which means, we are still working really hard to establish ourselves. 
- We don't have all the bells and whistles of some of the other bigger / flashier start-ups (e.g., we get catered lunch only twice a week).
- Lack of processes and structure while teams figure out the best way to do stuff. 
- Generally, we can benefit from more transparency and crowdsourcing initiatives to help solve problems faster and better. 
- As an early stage start up, and one of the first disrupters of this space, there is some uncertainty as to what the future will look like."
127,Wonolo,I love working here!,2020-02-21,5.0,Product Designer,"Leadership at Wonolo is transparent, honest, approachable and always willing to give you their time. 

The design team is an awesome group of individuals who I enjoy working with every day. We have a collaborative environment that not only spans EPD but also business stakeholders across the business. Design thinking is encouraged, user research is regularly practiced and we have a full end-to-end process that keeps every day exciting and fulfilling. 

Great activities and off sites that give us the chance to socialize and connect with team members outside our vertical as well as outside our office location. 

Fascinating problems to solve as a business!","I don't think this is a con for me, but for people who like more structure, this stage startup at any company comes with a bit of last minute planning, pivots and an iterative product development process."
128,Wonolo,Honest Company,2020-02-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"There is so much information available, you will never doubt how the company is doing or what its goals are. They only hire the type of people you'd want to work with.","Can't say there are too many. Marketplace challenges make the work exiting, but ever changing."

Not just the mission but everyone actually care about the  Middle Class Workers",Typical Startup problem where there is not enough bandwidth and resources.
132,Wonolo,Great Culture,2019-11-22,5.0,Law Clerk,"- Great place to work at with a strong culture
- Senior management and other team members strongly believe in the mission","Typical start-up problems - not enough bandwidth to create internal tools, processes are not standardized / constantly changing.  Sometimes it's difficult to secure buy-in from other departments due to resource pressure."
133,Wonolo,Android Engineer Interview,2019-11-04,5.0,Android Engineer,Great working atmosphere for employees.,Start-up type environment and issues (not really a con)
134,Wonolo,Still fantastic!,2019-10-14,5.0,Supply,"I've been with the company for some time now, and I won't re-hash the pros that other reviewers have mentioned (all true and valid). Because what is most impressive to me is that our culture and values still hold true to this day - even as we've 2x, 3x, 4x-ed in team size. This is no easy feat, and is a testament to the strength of both the leadership team and everyone here in carrying our values forward in our daily work.","A lot of the typical start-up scale / growing pains - it can be challenging to balance speed / efficiency with process development in the day-to-day, and as teams grow ownership in specific areas can be fluid and expansive (not necessarily a con, but I also understand that this isn't everyone's cup o' tea)."
135,Wonolo,Great place to work! Amazing people and culture!,2019-10-14,5.0,Recruiter,"It's great to be part of a company that is so mission-driven.
As Wonolo continues to scale, you can tell that the focus remains on its employees, customers, and users.
The values are carried forward, the leadership team is accessible and the CEO is humble, present and truly cares about each and every employee.
Everyone truly cares!
The company is growing fast and yet the team always wants to bring A-game players, making sure that every hire is an ""Add"" to the existing skillset and culture of the team. 
Big focus on diversity and inclusion.","Growing fast. Not really a con - more of an opportunity to get more involved, adapt fast, evolve as needed and make an impact."
136,Wonolo,Strong Culture = Strong Performance,2019-09-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been at Wonolo for a while now and had never written a review. I'm doing this now because during the past few months I've been impressed and inspired by the determination and support of my colleagues, as well as the clarity of vision and transparency Leadership displays daily.

We recently had our monthly Q&A with Yong, CEO at Wonolo. These are company wide meetings where employees get to ask questions of all types directly to him. Most of the questions allowed us to have really candid and sometimes difficult conversations about those things that we can do better.
  
Nothing about the questions or answers surprised me. What surprised me, in the most positive way, is the degree of safety we feel to be able to have vulnerable conversations in this way, specially at our size ( we are not a small team anymore). This is essential for a team to perform at its best, and I'm glad to be part of it.","Growing pains. Things are moving really fast and the pressure to execute is high as we get ready for our busiest season. It's a challenge sometimes to balance execution with planning and process building (which will help us scale but its benefits we might not see in the short term). There is now a concerted effort to invest in technology and automation, as well as add much needed resources. These are not issues that are unique to Wonolo though."
137,Wonolo,Unlike Any Other,2019-09-09,5.0,Operations,"Bottom line: You will never find a company like Wonolo. 

If someone lands a job at Wonolo, they

1) have a brilliant, gifted mind
2) is a hard worker
3) is GOOD

I have yet to find a company that actually CARES. These people are genuinely good. And anyone who interviews with them will know that Wonolo doesn't hire just anyone. The process involves multiple interviews and every single person's opinion on a candidate matters because we work so cross-functionally.

In terms of the industry Wonolo operates in--the gig economy is tricky because a common question about a  gig economy app is, ""are you keeping the poor, poor?"".  For the most part, the Wonolo app shows entry-level gigs, much like any other gig app. But unlike other gig apps, Wonolo wants their gig workers to excel in their career and life.  This is really what the employees think about-- how can we provide flexible work so person X can go to school and earn money? How can person Y explore a different industry and completely change their career? 

Unfortunately I've departed from the company to focus on my I guess you could say late quarter-life crisis. But nonetheless, I'm still very close to my former co-workers and I consider them family.

If you're reading this review and have done a Wonolo gig, the people at HQ really care and I know I mentioned this above but it's insane the amount of heart they put into their work.  Whatever issues you may have while doing a gig, you can voice them. We listen, learn, and solve for the best possible solution. This may take a short time or it can take a long time. Just know that we don't forget.

If you're reading this review after being offered a position, do not hesitate to accept because this company will offer you great opportunities, but most importantly, Wonolo will make you a better person.","Typical growing pains-- there's constant change and new (great) minds coming into the company, which is why culture is emphasized but personally I think it can be intertwined more with work life."
138,Wonolo,Fantastic Company Culture!,2019-08-22,5.0,Account Executive,"As we are a Mission Based Company - I love working for a company where my personal beliefs of helping people are fulfilled daily! We promote a collaborative & fun environment and celebrate taking calculated risks as thats how we grow and learn!

139,Wonolo,Making work fun!,2019-08-21,5.0,Account Executive,"The culture at Wonolo is something that every company I worked for in the past lacked. I feel that every person genuinely cares about each other and the mission we are trying to do - give more people opportunities. In startup life, every day is different and the way teams pull together to solve problems and change the status quo is exciting.",As an AE territory alignment is sometimes questionable but management is taking the time to give everyone an equal opportunity.

We're growing fast and trying to maintain our culture alongside our recruiting efforts.
142,Wonolo,The best career move I've ever made!,2019-08-16,5.0,Senior Account Manager,"The Wonolo experience is one of welcoming and inclusiveness from day one. Wonolo has an exceptional leadership team that keeps us informed on the big and little issues facing the company. We always know where we stand. 

Our community of employees is one that is closely knit. Friendships are forged almost to the point of feeling like a family. As someone that works remotely, it's a great feeling to ""go home"" every now and then.",Start up life can be tough and is always changing. Sometimes the hours are not 9-5. Especially when we are spread across different timezones.
143,Wonolo,Great Culture and People,2019-08-15,5.0,Business Operations,I love how Wonolo cares so much about their employees. It's evident in the strong culture they've developed. They're passionate about hiring and retaining the right people which I really respect.,"As Wonolo has grown, I think there have been some issues with clearly defining how all of the teams fit together. You can tell there's some strain between the teams as people figure out how to work together and support each other."

-The best CEO I have worked for. 
-Great culture!
-A feeling of helping people.",It's a start up so there are bumps but they are aware and we all work together as a team to continue to improve everyday!
145,Wonolo,Great Culture + Upside,2019-08-08,5.0,Sales,"The company invests in the culture and it shows. People work hard but also have fun together. The leadership team is accessible and open to feedback. Sales goals are aggressive, but the uncapped commission structure offers an opportunity for high achievers to do very well. The total addressable market is massive and the product solves a real pain point for customers.","As a high growth company, there are high expectations for the Sales Team. You should be prepared to work hard in the role."
146,Wonolo,There's really no other place you'd wanna be,2019-08-06,5.0,Growth Manager,"1. You get to work with smart, motivated and humble people

Having a very strong recruiting team means that a lot of successful effort has been put in to hire world-class people. Tons of brilliant, mission-driven people working toward a common goal.

2. Autonomy

There's lots of autonomy given to employees to figure out what needs to be done to help the business grow. You get to take ownership. If you dig a super entrepreneurial environment, this is an excellent place for you.

3. Culture

Strong results orientation:
Company goals and metrics are super clear and constantly reviewed.

Respect / fairness:
There's a culture of giving appreciation when it's due over here, whether it's from managers or peers. You'd hardly feel that your efforts have gone unnoticed. It makes you feel like it is a very meritocratic place to work at.

Fun:
The company cares enough to make working at Wonolo fun with activities, events, culture all-hands etc. 

Authenticity:
The founders model this exceptionally well. To find out more, you just gotta join the company.

Transparency:
The company values feedback and iterates quickly. Have a constructive one? You will be heard.

4. Career growth, support, and opportunities

If you work hard and produce results, the sky's the limit. Wonolo is growing very fast, and there are plenty of opportunities to grow alongside the company. There will be no lack of complex problems to solve or career ladders to climb if that's your thing. Beyond that, the company does genuinely care about your happiness and provides opportunities when your career interests coincide with business needs.","Typical pains that come with a fast-growing startup - some amount of chaos as we outgrow our processes, cross-functional challenges etc."
147,Wonolo,Great People and Even Greater Mission!,2019-07-26,5.0,Senior Analyst,"Wonolo has used their culture to create the groundwork of who we are and how we want to work. It all starts with hiring. They make a huge effort in finding people who will go above and beyond with the work they do, while at the same time finding people who have the heart and desire to help everyday people. We all understand the impact we can have of other people lives but we never lose sight that this is a business and we have ambitious goals. With these lofty goals, we are constantly challenging ourselves and each other. Transparency is huge with leadership and it trickles down to our everyday work lives. We are open to having those hard conversations because we've built the trust and comradery across the company. The ability to freely voice our opinions knowing that everyone's intention is for the betterment of the company is surreal.  I can't be happier with where I'm at and where Wonolo is going. If you want to be part of something big, this is the place to be.","Typical start-up problems that are inevitable, such as bandwidth constraints (having to wear many hats), lack of resources,  a lot of processes are not standardized (a lot of them are changing and evolving regularly), and the pressure to succeed now. 

With that said, I believe this is a personal preference. Some people love this environment and thrive in it. If you want to learn a lot, there's no better way than being getting your hands dirty with a variety of roles and responsibilities. Lack of resources, its time to be creative. Lack of process, step up and build a program around it or make it better. And what about the win-now mentality? If you want to learn from your failures fast and push yourself whenever you miss those goals, Wonolo will help you level up.

Are you up for the challenge?"
148,Wonolo,Great place to be for purpose-driven work!,2019-07-23,4.0,Data Analyst,Wonolo is mission-driven with everyone working towards something bigger than just numbers and day-to-day tasks. Culture of getting things done while also uplifting each other is a common value.,Lack of structure and volatile in terms of organization as is any tech start up.
149,Wonolo,"The amazing culture outweighs any ""start-up"" frustrations",2019-07-22,5.0,Account Executive,"Wonolo has been the best company I have ever worked for. Great mission, great idea, great people. The marketplace Wonolo has created is genuinely the best there is out there. I love being asked what my company does. Love work from home Fridays. It makes up for the days I stay around til 6 or 7pm.","The idea is amazing, the product, like most new start-up products, needs a lot of iteration. Luckily, it is always being worked on and improved."
150,Wonolo,AMAZING Company,2019-07-17,5.0,Account Executive,"At Wonolo you are not just another number. Wonolo is real and they are genuine people who care about the mission, the people who work for them and the users who utilize Wonolo. The culture is incredible as everyone cares about each other and everyones success. Wonolo wants all of their employees to feel like owners and to have them reach their potential by feeling motivated and confident. I used to work for a company where I dreaded my drive to work, now I wake up on Mondays so excited to come to the office and work beside people that are my co-workers and also my friends.","It is not an easy job. As an AE you will have to put your head down and work hard, you are given freedom (which is great) but that means a lot falls on your shoulders. You do have tons of support so you do not get lost however, if you are not willing to grind and find new ways to get your job done, you will not succeed."

-The whole company and all employees are inclusive and make you feel at home
-Amazing benefits that include work from home friday's and unlimited PTO that give you the opportunity to have a well balanced work/home life
-Transparency from every level",-Quicker interview process and ramp time for future employees
153,Wonolo,The Best Company I Have Ever Worked For,2019-07-12,5.0,Account Executive,"1. You wont find a better work culture or better people 

2. You truly feel valued. It's amazing having a C Level team that cares not only about your performance  but about you as a person. 

3. The Nashville office is Incredible! It is by far the nicest office I have ever worked in. The stocked kitchen and twice a week catered meals are a huge plus too! 

4. Work from home Fridays are fantastic! 

5. The yearly retreat to Tahoe is amazing. 

6. You have a HUGE impact on thousands of peoples lives.  This is a place where you are proud to say you work.","It is a start up. You have to be use to/okay with change. Our goals are lofty. Quota is not always easy to hit. There also can be plenty of variables to hitting your number (such is the staffing world),  but you always have the support and resources you need to be as successful as possible."
154,Wonolo,Hindsight is 20/20 - Best Career Move,2019-07-08,5.0,Account Executive,"1. Leadership Team - The leadership team is incredible at Wonolo. Both Yong (CEO) and Lori (VP of Sales) are amazing and go above and beyond in terms of caring for their team and ensuring our success as individuals. The managers are great as well. The manager for the Nashville office, Jordan Wissel, posses all the qualities you look for in a great manager. He is somebody I always feel comfortable going to, he’s an expert on the product we sell and knows how to motivate his team without micromanaging. Yong, Lori and Jordan make it very easy to come into the office everyday. 
2. The Product - The Wonolo Platform is something you can feel 100% confident in selling. The product not only works well, but I fully believe it will take over the staffing industry. The team is always working to improve the Platform and continue to innovate it on a monthly basis. When you have a great product - selling becomes way more easier. 
3. The Office - Nashville’s new office is incredible and has everything you’d want. The office is spacious, colorful and welcoming. I’m big on walking around and moving when I’m on a sales call and this office allows that. We have multiple sitting areas and meeting rooms. We also have a full kitchen (Wonolo caters food for us 2x a week) and has a full/complimentary snack bar. Just ask for it and Wonolo brings it in. We have parking and the office is essentially downtown Nashville so the location is great. 
4. The Team/Culture - The Wonolo Team in the Nashville office is a 10/10. I have never seen group of co-workers with this level of camaraderie. The Team in Nashville is a huge reason I love this company and helps make Wonolo feel like home. Many companies preach about “Culture”, but Wonolo doesn’t have to because the proof is in the pudding. 
5. Career Growth - Wonolo is a young and growing company with an great amount of room for advancement. Again - many companies promise career growth but with Wonolo the proof is there. The company does a great job of rewarding their workers and if you put in the time and effort you will see the benefits. 
6. Benefits & Pay - The benefits are the best I have ever seen. I don’t think I pay anything for them and it’s great coverage. The pay is competitive.","Wonolo is a startup - so there are growing pains, but this is to be expected with all startups."
155,Wonolo,My Recent Interview Experience,2019-07-04,5.0,Office Manager,"This was an enjoyable interview experience.  It's surprising to hear myself say that about an interview, but it is true.  We discussed the role, previous experience, what they're hoping for and what they are trying to build as a company.

At no point did I feel interrogated or pressured to be someone I'm not. During the group interview, I was able to see them interacting with each other, no one interrupted, no one took over the conversation and everyone actively listened to other people's responses.

I have been taking my time to find, not only a job that fit, but a company that I could get behind. I am thrilled to say that I am joining the Wonolo team, a team that supports, challenges and respects each other.","This isn't really a con, more of a heads up. Because there were a number of interviews, there were a number of emails. It was easy to keep track of, but for those who may be behind in their inbox organisation, they may lose track of the most recent email."
156,Wonolo,What a company would be like if I started one.,2019-07-03,5.0,C O O,"After working at large companies for a decade and struggling because it just didn't feel good to come to work, Wonolo is a ray of hope. It feels good to work at Wonolo, not only because of the mission of the company, but mainly because of the people with whom I have the privilege to work. The team here is smart, hard working, passionate, kind, collaborative, and determined. The company is truly people-obsessed - putting users first (which included employees)  and has a strong emphasis on users' happiness. The level of transparency across the company is one I have never experienced before. Same goes for the feeling of autonomy and accountability.

If you want to sail by passing the time, collecting a paycheck, not caring about what you do, this is the wrong company. 

If you want to make a difference, and enjoy your time doing it, I can't recommend Wonolo enough. It has been the best professional decision I have made.",Wish 'Wonolo' was easier for others to pronounce.

The opportunity is huge and the work is very exciting. Most of the problems we are solving have either not been discovered or never attempted.

The company is scaling and adding great people on a weekly basis. The perks are great (Flexible PTO, WFH Fridays, Fun Company Outings) and the culture is amazing.","The company currently relies very heavily on cross-functional collaboration, which is great in many scenarios but can cause gaps in ownership of certain needed business processes."

Even though we have more than 2x'd this year, our culture remains strong.  We prioritize connection and alignment above all else and it shows in how we get work done.  Not only is going to work everyday fun, but it has an immediate, tangible positive impact on others lives.  Best job I've ever had.","It's hard to find cons with Wonolo at this point.  General start up stuff, even though work life balance is pretty good (we work from home on Fridays), we all still generally work a bit on the weekends and into the night if the needs arise.  Benefits could improve."

165,Wonolo,Favorite Company I've Ever Worked For,2019-05-22,5.0,Business Operations,"Working at Wonolo has been a breath of fresh air in my career. I work with a team of genuine, hardworking, humble-yet-ambitious people, and I can honestly say that I look forward to the opportunity of coming into work every day. 

Here are a few of my favorite things:

*Leadership is transparent and inspiring to work for
*Mission-driven company
*Employees are empowered to take ownership and make real change
*Culture is given the highest regards
*Co-workers are kind, driven, and brilliant (many ex-Uber, -Google, -Harvard here)
*Great benefits, Unlimited PTO, and flexibility (WFH Fridays)

While we are technically still a startup, Wonolo has grown in size, maturity, and diversity to make some serious waves in this industry. We are on the forefront of changing the way people work.","The startup life isn't necessarily for everyone. You have to take on more ownership and accountability and often times face more ambiguity than at other jobs, but that's also what makes it so rewarding. 

Sometimes work will fall outside of the traditional 9 to 5 window, but as a whole, Wonolo respects the need for a healthy work/life balance."

167,Wonolo,Worth It,2019-05-14,5.0,Market Manager,"- Really great team members to work alongside, everyone leaves their egos at the door and really wants to help Wonolo be successful and disrupt this market 
- Leadership is very close to the ground, the CEO is so approachable and insightful. Everyone feels how much they care and it makes me, personally want to work ever the more harder. 
- Big on culture, there's always an event or an activity to strengthen our culture and communication. 
- Sense that we're working for something really meaningful, that this isn't just ""a job"" and that means a lot when we all spend so much time at work. It's definitely a worthwhile job and role. 
- There's great growth potential if you really succeed and do well in your role, I've seen many promotions from within and fairly quickly, as well.","- Like most startups, there are always changes and I think a lot of the times we are still iterating and figuring out processes. It's not perfect, but I know everyone is trying really hard. 
- Working a lot and doing a lot of things that are outside of my role to make sure we win. This job wouldn't be a good fit for folks that like perfectly outlined roles and responsibilities. There have been many team members that were hired for one role but it evolved to something totally different."
168,Wonolo,A great culture with ambitious goals,2019-05-13,5.0,Account Executive,"Wonolo - has been made and continues to be made by great people; From leadership all the way through the organization, this place has people that care and work incredibly hard to win. 

Overall our culture balances better than any previous employer of holding individuals accountable while always offering support and leadership. 

We are creating something new, something that can benefit our customers and Wonoloers alike which is inspiring and fun to be a part of.","There can be moments of difficulty, it might sound a cliche but at Wonolo - anything can happen. 

You need to be ready for unforeseen challenges and react quickly to solve them. This can lead to sometimes sporadic work hours not unusual in a start up but you should know."
169,Wonolo,Greatest Career Choice I've Made,2019-05-13,5.0,Account Manager,"- The people are absolutely amazing. I know every company says their own employees are the best, but it's truly the case at Wonolo. It feels like we are one big family who are always there for each other. Senior leadership is amazing and they make the time to talk to all of their employees. 
-  The work is rewarding and you can see your work directly impacting people's lives. It's what gets me up every morning.
- Major opportunity to grow both professionally and as a company.","It's hard to think of a con, but if I had to, I'd say we need to do a better job with new hire training / docs to get you up to speed, especially for regional team members. However, as it's a start-up, you have to expect that."
170,Wonolo,Great mission & culture,2019-05-13,5.0,Senior Accounting Manager,"I like that company is very mission driven with a clear set of values and expectations, lots of heart, and unwavering dedication. The leadership team is committed to continued transparency, shifts gears quickly when needed, shares the good and the bad, and celebrates individual/team wins daily.  I enjoy working in a welcoming, collaborative environment where everyone is working towards the same shared mission, enjoys what they do, and enjoys coming into work everyday to work with amazing people and talent. There’s lots of heart in everything that is done at Wonolo.","Pains of working in a small startup is expected, limited resources and fast paced.  Also limited employee benefits, e.g no Flexible spending accounts or 401k matching."

-Great benefits, PTO, work life balance
-Rewarding career, what we do everyday helps to change peoples lives.","Man, it’s really hard to find a con. But if I had to pick something it would be that our Wonolo team members bleed their heart and soul into our mission so just know you maybe work outside of a standard 9-5 day, but truthfully with Wonolo, it’s not work, it truly is a mission."
172,Wonolo,Caring & Mission-Driven Company,2019-05-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Wonolo is truly a company where you are surrounded by mission-driven, caring, smart people. I came from a bigger company just to a smaller one to gain more experience, but coming to Wonolo I have gained so much more. From amazing managers who are there to help you succeed in your role to amazing leadership teams that have been nothing but supportive and transparent throughout my time here at Wonolo thus far. I come to work every day with a smile on my face and love the culture I am surrounded by. We get catered lunches twice a week and also WORK FROM HOME FRIDAYS, and flexible time off, there is truly a work-life balance here and is encouraged as well.","I would say the normal start-up difficulties, it was kind of challenging coming to a small company where there aren’t any processes in place, but that is the fun and exciting part about it to build it from scratch. No other cons I can think of."
173,Wonolo,So glad I made the move to work here!,2019-04-30,5.0,Social Media Specialist,"Wonolo has been a great place for me to work, because my leadership team really cares about where I'm spending my time. Of course there are daily tasks I have to do, but they're for projects I really enjoying taking on. Also, if there's something I'm not enjoying, I'm feeling more comfortable about sharing that. Transparency is something Wonolo strives for. At first it's hard for me to be 100% transparent, especially when I'm newer at a company. However, as time has gone one, I know that what I say matters, so being transparent is becoming easier.","There's a lot of work to me done, and it can feel overwhelming when I'm the only person on the team I'm on. There's a lot of work to be done for branding and comms, and it would be helpful to have more people dedicated to those efforts."
174,Wonolo,"Integrity, Fun and Growth",2019-04-29,5.0,Mid Market Account Executive,"Wonolo is always about transparency within the organization, which I really appreciate. I worked for a company before where that was not a reality and it makes a big difference. The managment team truly wants everyone to understand the path we are taking as a company and to have input, whether someone is in agreement or not. 

It is a challenging environment that encourages growth and learning, as well as having fun. 

There are Thursday night events, as the company gets to participate in a work from home Friday. 

Cross-departmental connection and relationship building is highly encouraged as well, not only to make meaningful relationships but also to be able to understand what others do within the company. 

Just moved into a beautiful new office that reflects the energy and vibe of the company. 

Lunch is brought in about twice a week, with other treats available every day.

It's been a great experience and I have already had the chance to explore my role and be creative with it, and feel that leadership truly wants to see me succeed.","Start-Up life: it's hard work and it's rewarding. If you're not down to work outside 9-5 hours, this may not be for you. Work/Life balance is encouraged, but so is hard work and commitment to execution. 

No 401K match yet, but again start-up life."

It is motivating to work in an environment where at the end of every day you know you are contributing to a great good, a purpose that is genuinely benefiting and making an impact on others' lives. 

I am also blown away by the level of transparency and respect that each member of our leadership team has for every single individual. During our daily stand up meetings every morning, we all gather as a team and discuss the challenges we are facing, recognize people who have had wins (both big and small), and problem-solve together how we can take our organization to the next level. I have never worked in an environment where feedback is so welcomed and genuinely encouraged. Our CEO sent out an email to our entire Wonolo family on New Year's Eve 2018 and let all 70+ of us at the time know how much he genuinely cares about and values all of the accomplishments we made in 2018. He then proceeded to list off EVERY single person in our company's name and THREE lessons that he had learned from each of us in 2018. I have never felt more valued/appreciated than I do at Wonolo.","We are a rapidly growing start-up and with that comes the excitement of being a part of a ground floor opportunity, but there can also be typical growing pains where processes that worked well for a team of 30 may need to be revised to accommodate for our now larger scale."

Lack of deep expertise from  these leaders on the function they own.

Leadership is all over the place and has only limited  respect from employees.

Everyday is a different day, which will make your job fun, challenging, and exciting. You get to wear multiple hats and see how other teams work separately and together. 

We have fun company outings, happy hours, and activities. We like to say, we take our work seriously but not ourselves (which in my opinion, describes Wonolo culture perfectly).

199,Wonolo,One word to describe my experience working at Wonolo - AMAZING,2018-07-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Wonolo (pronounced ""whoa-no-low"") is on a mission to provide working opportunities to everyone who is looking regardless of your education, experience, income status, etc. 

Since joining Wonolo in Q4 of last year, it has been an incredible experience. There have been good times, hard times, fun times, sad times, relaxing times,  hectic times, but I don’t have any regrets. You’ll experience it all here.

COLLABORATIVE. Here at Wonolo, we practice the truest form of being collaborative. No matter which direction you look, even if you’re seeking a person to bounce ideas off of, you will be met with open ears. The problems/issues Wonolo is trying to solve are complex and everyone here understands that no one person is going to be able to achieve that - it takes a diverse group of intelligent, hard working individuals to come together.

CULTURE. We’re all about the culture add. Each member of the Wonolo team adds their unique experience/background, strengthening the company. You spend majority of your day at work and we know how important it is to form positive relationships with colleagues which is why we proactively have team bonding activities every Thursday (what we call TGIT). We make it a point to celebrate even the small wins because it is not lost on anyone how hard each individual works.

MISSION DRIVEN. Of course every business needs to make money to survive, but our main focus is on the social impact we have on the local communities. We are motivated to wake up and come to work everyday because each one of us is passionate about empowering individuals to find and pick up work when they want. Whether the individual is working to put food on the table for their family, buy a new car, take their daughter to Disneyland, or fund their education, we want to be there and help them achieve their dreams/goals.

NOT YOUR TYPICAL 9-5. Some days you will start early and end late, but there is a work-life balance here that everyone is encouraged to practice from the top down. Everyday is a freak’n experience. 

EXECUTIVE TEAM. What more can I say about them other than The Best Ever. Every single one of the candidates that come through whether they end up working at Wonolo or not, says they have never met a more passionate, down-to-earth executive team - FACT! These guys started the company with nothing, achieved so much already and can go hide in their own corner offices, but they don’t. These guys are transparent and open to hearing feedback from the team. I’m sure they have a bunch of sh*t to do, yet they’ll still find the time to really get to know each individual employee on a personal level. 

PERSONAL GROWTH. Whether you’re in Sales or Marketing or Engineering, you will learn a lot about your profession and yourself. You’re encouraged to develop skills and pursue initiatives that you’re interested in.","If you're not ready to wear multiple hats, work hard, roll up your sleeves, or make a difference in your community, then this might not be a good fit for you."

202,Wonolo,Not Paid/Suspended for no reason/ratings lowered,2018-01-02,2.0,Anonymous Employee,There are no pros to this company,"Last year I got suspended because I canceled a job and accepted another later that day and didn’t go to the second job because I got an alert that said I was suspended for the 1st job. I emailed them 3 hours before the second job to see if I was still active, they took 3 hours to email me back that I was , but it was too late for me to get to the second job. I’ve emailed them 10x about the confusion and they tell me I should of known the rules but this was a weird circumstance. I manage to get back on the system 6 months later and my ratings are now dropped to a 4.2. I did a delivery job and have yet to see the money in my account and it’s been 4 months already. They always email me back and tell me that the money was sent but my bank account reflects that it wasn’t. Tonite I look at the app not signed in and I see a plethora of good jobs, I log in and I guess because of my rating I only see the same delivery job that starts every few days."

Despite having little professional experience I was easily able to find work in my area which taught me valuable skills and helped me advance my career.,"There is a lot of competition between Wonoloers for good, high paying jobs, and you need to constantly check the app if you want to get such jobs."
206,Wonolo,Great work/life balance,2017-02-13,5.0,Wonoloer (Self-employed),This company has saved my financial burden being a full-time student. There are daily jobs which get to choose only if you are available and able to do. For me the best part is that you have the opportunity to work at different companies.,If you don't accept the job quickly you might not be able to get any job.
207,Wonolo,Typical start up job,2016-08-10,4.0,,"Wonolo has a great opportunity to make a very big dent in the enormous staffing industry.  We have proved out the concept, helped thousands of everyday people find work, and become a valuable resource for businesses with ever changing staffing needs. For the most part, the people here are great, it's a very open and humble culture and I consider many colleagues great friends. Everyone truly cares about the company, our customers and our community of workers.","It's a tough industry, with a lot of legal guidelines to navigate as we bend the borders of traditional staffing. We need to figure out where we're gong to add the most value and have the best chance of succeeding and focusing on that like a laser. We also need to acknowledge that when you are dealing with thousands of people as your ""product"" on a daily basis, issues are going to arise, ands every problem can't be fixed with smarter analytics and systems. I believe we need to be honest with ourselves about some of the challenges we're facing."
208,Wonolo,Game-Changer for Your Career,2016-08-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I always say that 1 startup year = at least 3 Corporate America years. It couldn't be truer at Wonolo. If you're looking for the type of job that offers lightning-quick career growth and the opportunity to make a real, measurable impact on the company from Day One, then this is the company for you. As an added bonus, it's a player in a very hot sector, the on-demand economy, so there's an opportunity to shape the story of this rapidly evolving space. And as the company continues to grow, I've been impressed by the leadership team's laser-focus on maintaining our culture and ensuring that we stay true to our original values.","The usual challenges you face with startups: big goals with limited resources, rapidly changing priorities, etc. That said, the leadership team is very supportive when there's a need for additional support and is the most transparent group of leaders I've worked with in my career in terms of sharing the ""why"" behind a change in business priority. In other words, it's a leadership team that actually listens to their employees, which is a breath of fresh air."
209,Wonolo,Recent new hire,2016-08-03,5.0,,"Great interview process. Smart hardworking team! Everyone is aligned around the company's goal to disrupt the staffing industry. Fun, fast-paced startup culture with open communication barriers. Great time to join the company!",I have no complaints. Wonolo is the perfect opportunity to be a part of something great.
