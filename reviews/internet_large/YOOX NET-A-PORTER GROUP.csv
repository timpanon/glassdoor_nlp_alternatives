86,YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP,A giant turned into a sinking boat,2021-09-01,2.0,Senior Software Development Engineer,"Colleagues are great, talented people are willing to help each other to overcome the company poor decisions.
It's the perfect environment to get your hands dirty, as far as you can avoid the political side of the company.
The office is great, although located in West London which makes commuting tricky for people coming from east.
The discount benefit is quite good (40% on every website), although only applicable on items that have been on the website for more than few months, so not useful for exclusive sales or new collections.
Work life balance is good, working tends to be quite relaxed as every single task or project is generally blocked for months behind bureaucracy.","A mix of an ego driven CEO with no experience and the Richemont acquisition, led the company to the worst period in 10 years. What was a giant before, now it's a sinking ship without a plan to recover.
Many years of budget cuts removed every perk of being employed by YNAP, no more allowances, party budgets, learning budgets, but mostly headcount budget.
The company lost around 35% of the whole engineering department within the last 18 months, praised bonus were cancelled for many years, promised promotions were postponed for even more, there's no room for growth and the result is that the most talented people, the ones that really wanted to help, have been forced to change job. The few talents that are still in YNAP are basically searching for other opportunities and the others that made their career just because of time, high-ladder friendships or because they were always answering yes to their manages are staying and taking the decisions that are crippling the business. 
The HR department is inadequate to say the least, with few episodes of reported mobbing. Every single employee complaining on daily basis and the morale is on an all time low.
The new acquirer Richemont doesn't see any value in the company and have no projects or budget for it.
The CEO is an old school person that in the middle of pandemic wanted everyone to go back to the office.
The finance department is detached from reality and willing to fire a consultant from a day to another to fix the budget, while leaving entire departments without knowledge and with months worth of incidents to solve.
There's also a big bias problem where the Italian employees don't want to work with the British ones and they refuse to involve them because of the country they are located in."

105,YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP,"Good exposure, but not a long term opportunity",2021-08-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,I had the pleasure of working with a friendly and talented team,"It became clear that the organisation is not focused on the development of people, there is no clear direction on how things are going, and unless you are experienced already, it is inevitably difficult to progress further. 
The loss of talent and people led to a loss of morale, which then also led to individuals having to carry substantially more workloads while at times, not having much training and experience. 
The technology stack is also outdated, and unless you have a significant amount of experience in it, it is difficult to catch up."

Great place to start as a first job.","This is not a tech company even if they pretend to. A business with a terrible tech stack, no good tech talent internally and if there is, they tend to not stay long. Employee turn over in this business is completely crazy as nobody tends to want to invest time in this business. 
Senior leadership and c-suite have 0 vision which makes the business stagnant and loosing ground to competitors. 
Lack of decision making and therefore everything is slow and again makes the business not agile at all.
Richemont did not help the company as they are completely digitally and tech illiterate. Most people barely understand luxury. 
In terms of compensation and salaries, YNAP will offer way below market compensation with not so interesting benefits. 
Having to work with a lot of incompetent Italians and Richemont people who are far from being switched on. 

If you are looking for an interesting tech/digital business, I would say run away as you will end up with a traditional retailer."

- There’s no focus on the customer, it’s all about pleasing your stakeholders and developing their wish list. During my first weeks, a rather senior leader told me if I didn’t please my stakeholders and make sure they got their wishes, they’d make sure I didn’t last long. 
- Uninspiring projects and features which consist of moving the product as is from an old tech stack to new. In some cases, the new tech is poor and the feature set is reduced and regressed.

show up and leave whenever you like, never have to do a full days work","I can honestly say YNAP was one of, if not the worst experience of my professional life.
whether it be the rapid loss of skills I experienced whilst trying to work with *really* poorly implemented tech solutions by engineers who have never attempted to implement something before, or any understanding of what problem said solution is there to solve. Managers who haven't considered ""why"" when choosing a solution and ""who"" when choosing someone to implement said solution.

You will find that YNAP have almost all the tools you could possibly need, all implemented on top of one another. Except you can't configure them to suit your needs. You'll need to work with something that someone else has implemented with no experience and no exposure to the data you are working with or any willingness to listen to why you want to alter it, or the benefits it can bring.
You'll experience a culture where contractors are treated as untouchable and have built systems in a manner which keep them in a job. Contractors who can happily refuse to carry out tasks they don't consider valuable use of their time or the direction they want to go in. One time I was pulled into a room and asked to justify my position (to a contractor)

I experienced an extremely toxic culture whilst i was there, where every little thing was reported to management, who left me to rot in a corner to the point i essentially shut down by the end of my tenure. I had to take time off ill with stress with bullying and emotional torture common place if you don't fit the bill of who they want.  in my times confiding with other people from different departments, it was reiterated to me time and time again that the experience I was going through was not uncommon around the business.

Their tech stack is just awful! Time after time, I found myself constantly shaking my head in disbelief as I witnessed manually updating files in place on cloud systems, with no version control or audit trail or notification pipelines. Automation tools exist but they are bypassed regularly. IT Security is almost non-existant, with a blanket level of either prod or non-prod access and no granularity beyond that. If you take IT security seriously, this is definitely not the place for you.

There was zero social budget or training budget, I had to open my personal Online Training account up to one of my team, because the level of AWS knowledge was so low in the department and I was refused any budget to enroll him onto Pluralsight or Linux Academy"

Staff Discount - although heavily monitored","Incompetent middle management and leadership team. Some have simply grown with the company are in positions of leadership with no experience. With the merger with YOOX it is very clear we are still two separate companies with different cultures and ways of working. Most of the senior/middle management worked there almost since the beginning, the company is still run like a small start up business with silos and know nothing about being a multinational , multi cultural global company.

Management does not mean experience or knowledge.

Net-a-Porter (not YOOX) was a leader in commerce and innovation, but no longer as it the tech has not changed for several years and now their competitors have caught up.

It is clear because whenever an experienced hire joins, they leave after a very short time after realising that he/she wasn't hired to make any decision or ability to fix anything.

Every decision overlaps other departments responsibilities so nothing gets done as teams are still working in silos without understanding the wider impact

HR department is invisible. It is well known that there is little to no career progression, personal development, high staff turnover and low pay - but not willing to address the reasons why.

They keep on about the value of the company is the people, but do not care about the people. There is zero social aspect or any company culture. Last year the Christmas party was held in the office canteen!

The company employs too many 3rd parties and contractors due to personal relationships with existing employees - this is at the detriment to existing staff and the company as whole. Some are incapable and do not have the experience to even do their role. 

The environment is toxic and detrimental to employees. Lack of trust in the management and leadership team.

Low salary and benefits - they seem to think they can attract and keep talent-based only on the name of the company.

(eg. aesop soap in the bathrooms - now some industrial looking dross),"Where do I begin?

Let me first say, prior to the merge with Yoox the company was fantastic to work for. The culture was great and to an extent the people still make this. 

No accountability - literally everyone passes the buck. So many people have the title but zero power to make any change.

Non-competative salaries - compensation and benefits are so behind the times it is unreal. Comparable roles in other companies pay the market rate. How does the management think they're going to retain good talent and knowledge with this approach?

Roles are created for functions that already exist. Such lack of communication - when dreaming up these new roles - who do you think has been taking care of these functions?

The NAP/Yoox (UK/Italy) divide is toxic. The company changes things for the sake of changing. Things are also changed to be in line with Yoox processes which 90% of the time make no logical sense. Italians need to stop trying to enforce their rules on regions that do not follow the same rules/laws/cultures. NAP was the more successful business prior to the merger - so who in their right mind had the bright idea of following the Yoox model?!

Zero transparency or autonomy.

Expect very late nights in the office (unpaid) and no possibility to take time off in lieu as it's not 'company policy' - if you're thinking to join definitely negotiate that in  your contract. This 'expectation' they have of you to work late despite managing your time effectively is probably one of the worst things. 

NO flexible working policy - aside from having long hours and finishing at 6 there is no flexibility in starting earlier/finishing earlier or  working from home; oh yes working from home is highly frowned upon. Given the  fact that the majority of the workforce are millenials, YNAP is hugely behind market trends."

I decieded to post feedback so maybe somebody see it and made changes.

- Wharehouse management allows full-time workers or who have been  working there longer treat new hires very badly. No wonder people do not stay there long.
- My relative had been yelled at and ordered by other worker to bring supplies or pass something to them when they ran out- saying ""Hey, you!""
- Senior workers are very rude to hew hires, have entitled behavior and boss around.
-New hires are send way back to the end of the line and ""senior"" workers stay in front  of the line selecting easy items, leaving/ passing big/ bulky and complicated orders to the new hires. Management just closes eyes on it and does not alternate positions.  No wonder new hires do not do well and get low positions at the perfomance table (yes they have perfomance table!) at the end of the shift.
- Senior workers and management team are not freindly and sometimes refuse to help.
- Some managers are friends with other workers and gave them special treatments. 
- Place is very dusty! Dust just flows around and iritates eyes and noise. My relative developed a rash and had a headacke after each shift.
- Packaging supplies are not supplied on time and  lot of times my relative had to go and search for the packaging boxes.
- Sometimes management called a day before and demanded  (not ask) to come next day (their day off) and work overtime."

- is basically a HR-less company, there is a HR office but is like it doesn't exist, they don't care about people, don't care about rewarding them, they just make sure they have the lowest salary possible in the market

- most of the senior management worked there almost since the beginning and are very incompetent, just a bunch of YES-MEN, the company is still run like a small family business with CEO that decides everything no matter what and senior management in a limitless effort to please him all the time.
Is not a case that every time that an external experienced senior C level manager was hired he/she left after a very short time (just the time to realize that he/she wasn't hired to make any decision) and then replaced with someone internal........

- company is run by an army of absolutely under paid junior e-commerce managers, junior web marketing specialists and junior developers working overtime.

There is a high turnover rate. They say it's due to production being low or them making mistakes, but these mistakes are made under a trainer. People have been put to work at different things and because of not being trained thoroughly are set up to fail. 
People are fired due to personal reasons. Someone working there for years targeted this one temp. Making up stories and the manager believed her, did not talk to the temp to get their side, and fired them. So there is definite favoritism.  This is not the first time this has happened.
There was a position available that had the possibility to hire within the company. It was stated you'll get more experience but no guarantee of being hired.  No one took it. And because of that, the manager fired employees (days before telling them she wanted them to all to be hired), reason being, to hire others that would want to move up in the company. More like having new hires be ignorant to all the unfairness in the department.
Complaints have been made to HR in the past, but they will brush your complaints under the rug and continue on like nothing happened.

Failure to recognize employees' worth.

Also if you had trouble with a favorited supervisor (there are three) ""surprisingly "" you receive no raise or bonus. I'm not taking about disciplinary problems either , I mean if those three do not like you they will do or say anything to make you look bad in front of the higher-ups. They have lessened the burden for some people so they can report them as lazy , they have not reported call outs so the people who did call out looks like the abandoned the job , then of course resulting in termination."

-Higher pay in entry level roles relative to other companies","Where to begin?

-Parking at the DC is never going to change. Limited spots means anyone that gets to the location between 8AM and 3PM are likely to have to park at the park nearby. You're lucky to find any legal parking between then. Employees do need to give up on this ever changing
-All that has been bred with the company growing and changing is an air of hostility toward peers and managers. Supervisors sit around and talk among themselves about gossip, weddings, pregnancies and people. They try to compete with one another while acting like they are friends face-to-face. It's constant trying to up one another on some superficial status in their lives.  Main point of bringing this up is that it affects your employees. If anyone is actually requiring help or assistance from a supervisor/senior, no one is available at their desk to help. If this is ever brought up as some sort of feedback, you're criticized, judged or condemned. They'll either make an excuse like ""well you could have interrupted or come found one of us"" or ""you could have asked someone else"" or even ""oh, sorry, I was just so busy. Can you send an email for us to do later?"" I'm sorry but if you've been put into a higher position, you should be available to do your job. In no way should your team members or employees feel as though they are inconveniencing you for doing your job that you are paid more to do. Also you're lucky if you even find a manager who knows what they're doing. Some do not even know how to use their phone or write grammatically correct emails.
-With the above, the environment is maybe middle school or 9th grade level at best. You have a bunch of grown adults who act like children.
-They hire based on connections or how willing you are to suck up. It's not oblivious to the floor. Everyone knows the last few who have been put into higher positions should have had no place in being hired. If you cannot action basic functions like transferring a call or creating a basic UPS return label, how can anyone trust you to do any actual complex functions?
-On the opposite end, the place is hiring people who don't even know how to use computers. We are an internet company."

Nice location (mahwa)
Decent cafeteria/cook","Environment
Uninvolved management 
Culture 

Through no fault of my own, a coworker in the warehouse assumed I was friendly with someone she was having personal issues with. In front of everyone, she verbally harrased me and threatened to beat me to a pulp, and I had never once spoken to this person before. The managers were not there and didn't even notice. Thankfully another coworker restrained this woman. She was suspended with pay for a week, and allowed to come work the same shifts as me. Never once was I explained the situation nor did they have the decency to allow me to sit down with this person so we could mediate what had occurred. She  was very hostile toward me even coming back, even though I tried to be friendly because I was scared of what would happen. I immediately asked the managers to switch my schedule, this manager DENIED being able to do so even when I had asked coworkers and they had confirmed she was the person to go to for this. To this day I simply cannot fathom how they allowed this woman with a previous criminal record to get away with this. I never showed up to work after that and was unemployed for a few months because of this sudden situation. 

The starting pay at the warehouse positions was $15-$20 five years ago, the more time passes they lower the salary and the amount that is given in raises. This is in addition to much higher copada if you want to enroll in their health insurance. It is a given you will have to work overtime regularly if you want to afford any benefits. Lastly, the main location in mahwah is very difficult to get to if you do not have a car. There are no busses or trains nearby, and it is a regular problem by which employees of the surrounding area need to seek friends or Uber to bring them. $12 starting, with $0.50 - $1 raises every six months is not enough to pay for a car and all bills at 40 hours a week!"

610,YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP,"Challenging, but in a bad way",2016-09-14,2.0,,"Most of the software that is being written to replace our legacy stack is cutting-edge, an approach that has been followed with the utmost pragmatism. This includes Scala microservices and full-stack JavaScript software that runs on Amazon Web Services. On top of that, the Westfield office is lovely, and I work with some fun, knowledgeable people.

There are societies that are funded by the company. These include board games and 5-a-side footy.

Before merging with Yoox, we also had a pretty good culture. We'd have lavish summer and Christmas parties, as well as quarterly parties in the office. There was also more budget to send developers to conferences.","It's worth mentioning prior to discussing the post-merger environment, that a lot of the old staff members who have left, such as architects, made some very poor technical decisions. This often results in the new team members having to pick up the pieces and rectify everything. Furthermore, we're still massively dependent upon our legacy tech stack. This often hits us when we're on compulsory support (which is admittedly normal these days.)

Since merging with Yoox, the company feels more like a corporation than a larger, successful startup. The new executive team is attempting to replace our new backend services with IBM WebSphere, a monolith that regresses a lot when compared to even our legacy stack, and is simply being shoehorned into the company without good technical reason. Adding to the corporate feel is the use of words such as ""synergies, ""synergetic"", and ""at scale"". These words were never uttered before the merger, but thanks to the execs, almost everyone in the business now uses these terms. It's small things like this that are causing the cultural change.

On one occasion, I was informed that I would not receive budget for a conference that I wished to attend, because there was a similar one locally. I initially accepted this, but soon realised that the company was sponsoring this alternative, thus the tickets were free. I appreciate this doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things, but it doesn't make one feel valued.

And on that note, the parties have stopped, with the excuse of ""the company is too big now, so organise such shindigs within your own department"". The executives in my area have been silent on this matter, thus have used it as an excuse to save money. The quarterly in-office parties have also stopped without any mention. Again, these may be first world problems, but they have effectively destroyed the company's culture and are making the staff feel undervalued.

Also, the business doesn't understand that Yoox-NAP is also a technology company. They claim to be agile, although their definition equates to being able to add business requirements, about which they've sometimes forgotten, at the last minute, while respecting the already-established deadline. Trying to explain the concept of an MVP is futile, with the usual response being ""this feature must go live as our brand could be damaged"" (which simply isn't true,) as well as ""this isn't an MVP, but an MMP"" (Minimum Marketable Product - read: we can ask for whatever we want with an unmovable deadline.)"

There are minimal places to eat lunch in the office and lots of people eat at their desk. Overall, morale is low and jobs can become monotonous after a short period."

This's way below the work and effort the emplyees put in for the progress of the company.

The rich-and-growing business means no one gets fired ever: just don't screw up anything so bad.
No one complains if you take a break or counts your coffees.","In tech talent and hard work is not valued: many people miss any clue about true technology work and just do the minimum to call it work, hard workers and talented people have to spend all time to keep the business running so those getting promotions are the one that show themselves to managers.
Managers are usually so much taken into planning and budgeting that forget real work and workers. Many of them never worked in other places so their plan is ""we've always done like that"".
Salaries are ridiculously low and even if you are a talented engineer you compete with just-out-of-school newbies, because you are just one number on an Excel file.
Raises are given only on ask and are always of pre-calculated entities, nothing is done in relation to your effort or competence: you get the same reward of your worst collegue that has your same seniority (in years of working, not as skill or competence)."

Processes are very very slow, stagnant atmosphere - despite the company's claim of a fast-moving entrepreneurial environment. It couldn't be further from the truth, the pace is rather a typical dinosaur-like corporate one. Very old-fashioned management style and outdated tools (softwares etc.).
No integrity, talent is not rewarded, even discouraged and obstructed, not much meritocracy, resulting in poor quality. Depressing and rigid, manipulative and passive-aggressive atmosphere where most people are too scared to say anything of relevance to them. Many time-wasting activities.

Massive payment issues - pensions haven't been paid correctly over years, salaries (low) sometimes don't get paid correctly either. HR is hardly responding to those things.
Minimal room for growth, hardly any challenges or training.
If you're truly passionate, enthusiastic and committed about everything you do, you might experience difficulties - though there are many people who still work very hard.
Backstabbing, gossiping are considered normal behaviours.
People try to leave as quick as possible, even get manipulated into feeling guilty for it."

Net-a-porter are really putting in a lot of effort to appeal to software developers, such as running and sponsoring events and meetups.

Although I was not part of the Grad Rotation programme this seems like a very good programme and the devs finishing the programme seem very skilled.","From a technical perspective the interest and challenges are low. The tech stack used in a lot of the areas are outdated.  In other areas the tech stack can seem a little bleeding edge.  This leads to management and recruitment being unaware what is happening in their teams which can lead to a mismatch of skills for new starters. 

The merger with Yoox looks set to make the tech stack more unappealing to developers in the London market.

The various parts of the tech team are very disjointed, there is a lack of a tech community and culture."
