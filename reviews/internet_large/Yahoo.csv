It's great that someone is high-value and Verizon Media is made up of great employees, but turnover is tough even when a colleague leaves for a great opportunity. If you can't adapt and help train people, Verizon Media is going to be frustrating. The Apollo buyout is a disruption, and it is TBD what the positives and negatives are of relaunching as Yahoo.

Verbal abuse from customers, no after call work, nitpicking and micromanaging. Forced overtime and will change your schedule while on your vacation without telling you. Having to sell to billing customers and such a tiny bonus it doesn’t even make a difference. No after all work. They give you 30 min a few times a week and tell you to use it  on callbacks so your basically strapped to a desk the entire shift with back to back calls. Only the favorites with family members get in the sales queue and they brag about getting bonuses and perks that you can never get even though your getting micromanaged to death dealing with calls other people would rather not have. 2 months of role playing training even when you come from a sales back ground and nothing to do with your actual job of customer service, tech support or retention. Angry customers that want a sup and sups won’t take the call. No one wants to do their job. No structure to training or anything. It’s a big mess. Threats while in training like get a doctors note or they’ll show up at your door to make sure your actually sick and other reps in building accused people in training class of making a mess in the bathroom. Just all together one of the most crazy atmospheres I’ve ever encountered. I’ll either transfer somewhere else when I can find a actual sales job where the working conditions aren’t as bad.
Also if you have a disability forget about hr or anything else. I was told in training I had to wait until out of training for my back problems and I don’t trust anyone enough to talk to about their chairs. You can’t talk to HR. I don’t know who these people are? The fact that I can never get out of my chair the whole shift and how bad the chairs where have caused constant back pain."

A wide array of tech to learn about
Backing by Verizon allows for deep pockets - R&D is possible...sometimes.

I WOULD recommend this company if you are interested in the following:
*Resume fodder - having a few years of experience with a big company like Verizon is attractive to future employers.

*Salary - the salary is good and has often been described as Golden Handcuffs. You'll get paid well, but you'll find yourself in a difficult position to transition out. This is very commonly discussed among employees. Silver lining of a potentially unsatisfying job is the stability of the salary. It's a double edge sword because some people have trouble tearing free and end up hating their job for years.

*Opportunity to Learn - Learn, learn, learn. Watch what management is doing and note what they are doing wrong, what results, and be diligent to consider how things could have been done better. This will prep you for your future when you leave and can offer experience to other companies of what NOT to do. There are a lot of teams, a lot of tech, a lot of repos, etc - there is no lacking of opportunity to grow your skill set...in preparation of leaving for a job that will allow for promotions and advancement.","Poor leadership

Little to no possibility for advancement/promotion

Constant job freezes - even after offers have been made

Cultural grab bag - merging with AOL and Yahoo! caused chaos that probably won't 
ever go away.

Little to no accountability for personal contributions - some people don't seem to do anything but are still there for years.

No commitment from leadership - every response is vague, every roadmap is flimsy, you simply won't get a manager to commit to an initiative. As a result every project gets scope creep, every planning gets interrupted within a week, etc. May as well just grab a raffle ticket to decide what you work on every morning.

I would NOT recommend this company if you are interested in the following:
*Career Advancement - simply put, aside from a few political maneuverings you won't likely get an opportunity to even make a case for your promotion. The promotion process requires approval from management 4, 5, or even 6+ levels above you. They have no idea who you are or what you do. If they haven't heard your name and what you've done you have next to no chance. It becomes a mad scramble to climb over each other in a fight for political recognition. Very toxic.

*Discipline & Order - Everyone does better when they are disciplined. Some jobs require it, and make you a better person because of it. This job is NOT that job. You will have every opportunity to drag your feet and make excuses why something wasn't able to get done. Never any push back. If you want to join a team to GROW and become a BETTER person then don't join this company."

- Good benefits (private healthcare, flexibility, subsidised gym)
- Beer trolley","- There was no concept of HR in it's true form at Verizon Media. There are ""Business Partners"", who only care about the business rather than the people who work for the business. They lack empathy and do not assist in matters that are deeply worrying to some employees. 
- There were a lot of shady decisions made here and the ""Business Partners"" worked alongside those senior managers to help cover it up, and present the rest of the employees with the standard business lines (which ofcourse everyone saw through). Instead of doing the right thing, which is to ensure that decision making was ethical.
- There is a massive discrimination between where you started your career (Yahoo Vs AOL). The latter meaning that your base pay is stagnant for potentially 6 years.  Any pay rise is put in to your ""potential to earn as a bonus"" rather than in your base pay. If you are promoted then all of that pay rise is not added to your base, and instead it's added to your ""potential to earn as a bonus"". The standard pay rises with inflation are also not added to your base pay either. While this may not effect any new starters at the company, I would question if you want to go and work for a business that has deep rooted discrimination issues? The effected employees have been fighting against this for nearly a year and nothing has changed. The ""HR"" have never listened. Neither have the senior management. There was no justice or equality.
- The promotion opportunities are extremely bleak. There has never been any ""development plans"" for my career progression. This shows how poor this business is with it's people management skills. 
- They do not care when they are losing their best talent. Everyone is just a number, If they can't retain talent, how do they expect to win in market against the likes of Google and Facebook.
- Unneccessary processes and projects to make people sound important internally, but with no real substance or results to drive the business upwards
- Poor senior management that did not inspire the employees"

- There are still some decent co-workers from the remnants of Yahoo and AOL. But attribution is high, and all the good people are leaving rapidly.","- It's basically a mess. Their ad tech stack is so clunky and full of bugs. The leaders make stupid decisions of retrofitting existing platforms with features from legacy platforms. Why don't you just take the best features from all of them and build a brand new one from scratch?
- Not a tech driven company anymore. It's entirely a sales-dominated culture. Their motto is to just meet the ""revenue goal"" and throw as many features into a product as quickly as possible with little regards to software quality.
- All people do here is have meetings all day long. I don't understand how they can get anything done.
- They still keep the quarterly review process where they make you evaluate yourself and assign a score for each objective. You spend all the time writing thoughtful paragraphs, yet the manager doesn't even read them nor does he provide meaningful feedback. He only regurgitates what I wrote word for word. It's pointless. Even if you write a stellar self evaluation with solid facts, you're not going to get proper recognition for the hard work. There is zero potential for career growth.
- No more RSU issued post-Oath. The salary increase is measly and doesn't align with the rate of inflation (it's only happened once for the past four years). Effectively, we're making less over time. RSU is now only given to people who got promotions.
- No transparency on what's coming.  For example, re-orgs happened all of the sudden without prior announcements from the senior management.
- No respect for tech talents, because it's just a sales company now. They wouldn't have a clue on how to cultivate you.
- Did I mention we have all of these unproductive meetings where people just make desperate attempts to highlight achievements for the week when there really is no progress?
- High attrition. Good people are leaving left and right.

A lot of change in the last few years. By merging Yahoo into the fold, we improved the technical IQ of leadership, but there was a lot of business redundancy and disagreements in approach.

Work/life balance is decent for a tech company.

Some of the many layers of mediocre management have been cleared out, so that may improve things for the future.

Reasonably strong values focus, though some of it seems like fluff.","Sales-drive/biz-dev driven leadership. Weak technical leadership (this may be changing).

I've witnessed at least 6 rounds of layoffs across the company, and very little high-quality hiring. Obviously that's not a sign that the business is doing great.

When the CEO of AOL/Oath leaves within a year of forming Oath, that's not a good sign.

Arguably the worst company name in tech: Oath. It was supposed to be a new name with a stronger tech brand than AOL or Yahoo! had. The idea behind ""Oath"" is that every employee is supposed to come up with their own 3-word ""Oath"" that represents their attitude and commitment to their job.

But if your manager makes you work evenings or threatens to, are you really going to go to a party in the middle of the day then have to stay even later?","Working nights and weekends is the culture here.

The ability to work with some powerful technology was also exciting.","Oath is a bureaucratic mess of poor leadership and self-serving values.  Navigating the inner workings of actually getting real work done at Oath is akin to running through a rat's maze.  Every action or decision was politicized; with other teams and departments at open war with one another- to the point that normal personal relationships across ""at war"" departments would be scrutinized and questioned.  Straightforward decisions on how to benefit our customers were seized by upper managers in attempts to land grab or were slanted to embellish how effective that department was achieving its OKRs.  Senior Leadership was deluded to the point of insanity on ensuring that there was a constant slew of ""wins"" racked up each week, without calling attention to true business problems and missteps.  Whenever something DID go awry, leadership would scramble to find any person or team to throw under the bus and absolve themselves of involvement.   When asked to provide reporting of how our particular department was contributing to sales objectives, and it didn't show a positive story, I was instructed to ""make it up"".  Worst of all are the constant, deep layoffs that Oath has become infamous for.  Multiple times each year, hundreds of employees have been laid off, even after assurances from leadership that there is absolutely nothing to worry about.  Those laid off are often top performers who simply have become too expensive for the company.  Seeing good friends cast aside like that on a recurring basis was sad, demotivating, and created a culture of fear that was impossible to look past.  Ultimately I realized that I would never fit in a corporate culture that was fueled by maximizing individual gains at the cost of good customers and employees."

At the start things were great but the culture took a dive in the last year. This was in large part due to the fact that management encouraged internal competition causing employees to withhold ideas and information in fear others would steal the idea to reap credit.

- rampant favoritism towards legacy Yahoo employees (non-Yahoo employees usually have upwards of 5-10x as much work as their Yahoo-counterparts, middle-senior leadership is mostly Yahoo and thus the favoritism rolls down the line from there, employee reductions always hit non-Yahoo employees first and hardest)
- 2-3 major employee reductions per year (this isn't to retain top talent, often times top talent is let go in order to retain favorite employees or to save money on salaries/benefits)
- employee reductions are used as first line tactic to hit short-term profit goals when company is performing poorly
- too many legacy systems, that are not integrated
- poor training and employee resources
- leadership changes ""focus"" constantly without following through with any mission they have previously slated for the company
- very few opportunities for pay increases or promotions, and again favoritism and politics will determine these rare occurrences anyways
- lack of transparency on employee reviews, promotion processes, company/staffing decisions
- because of lack of transparency on pay calculations, the gender-pay-gap is a live and well here
- HR is very poor to meet their deadlines, or communicating to employees, or responding to issues. Often HR and Leadership take the approach of gaslighting truth and blaming employees for company performance, morale, or issues
- terrible morale
- Managers/Directors are just talking mouthpieces for SVPs/VPs; employee best interest is not their function at Oath and they will not ever push back on behalf of employees
- company prioritizes money on ""keeping-up-appearances"" in the industry with parties and events, superficial fringe-benefits (like food), etc, instead of applying it to help relieve employee workloads/resources or instead of increasing direct compensation/benefits"

This means we have lots of junk code polluting some nicely thought-out code, at least in the back-end services I worked on. Most of this junk code is for stuff that did not pan out but may be partially still in service, so it cannot be easily removed. Almost all of these ""delights"" seemed to me to have almost no value, as far as I could tell.

The quarterly review is brutal, since my manager has no clue as to what the team is up to, you are at the mercy of coworkers. It doesn't help to work hard and do a good job. Lots of politics, you have to fight for your survival.

I heard last that the perks are going to be cut shortly, so I fail to see how Yahoo can hire any talent given the circumstances.

Lastly, beware of the chaos and commotion that is Yahoo!. You have to be at the edge of your seat everyday, not knowing when the axe falls. I couldn't survive that kind of uncertainty everyday, not knowing what is in store.

The reason behind the hiring is all the attrition. I assume, there are so many open positions because of the numerous people who are leaving voluntarily. Watch out before interviewing and even more before you accept an offer. Moreover, lots of stuff promised on your offer like bonus will depend on the company's perf, and you definitely won't see that money knowing Yahoo!."

Fun culture, especially if you're at the headquarters.

Good name to have on your resume, despite the company's troubles.","If you're not already in the department/organization you want to be in, it is VERY difficult to cross over to another.  If you're lucky, your manager will have connections to help you network, but you still have to do your own job and cannot fall behind on quarterly goals -- if you do, your ratings suffer.  This can cause employees to strive only for better ratings, not necessarily better work.

Quarterly goal structuring (especially in IT) is absurd, with many arbitrary measurements and sub-goals that can easily end up hurting you if you don't write your goals properly before the quarter.

Quarterly/yearly rating system is ridiculous; nobody except Marissa seems to fully understand it or approve of it and she's made it clear that it's not changing anytime soon.

Those at the bottom (Global Service Desk; Customer Care) are still pitifully underpaid.  Some new hires -- even contractors -- can be making tens of thousands more than full-timers who have been with the company longer and/or even moved to the headquarters after their office got shuttered.  (This knowledge, of course, is NOT transparently known).

As usual, upper management never fully grasps how important the ""little people"" are, especially those who support their IT infrastructure.  They say they do, but at the end of the day, their paychecks are leaps and bounds bigger and nobody is going to do anything to endanger that stability they have ""earned.""  They still view ""IT people"" as replaceable because there are so many out there who can be hired at any time; however, the less you respect your IT org, the less they will respect you.  We may not do ""X,"" but we support EVERYONE who does -- REMEMBER THAT.

Company culture loves to push ""transparency,"" but make no mistake: this is still Corporate America -- if you don't perform a function deemed ""essential"" to the company (i.e. make money for the company), you will be among the first to be culled when the yearly axe comes down."

My last one was a former good engineer who was promoted to be a manager (who probably accepted the position to speed up his green card process and not because he liked) and became a terrible leader, without any kind of people or soft skills. There are also a lot of directors/VPs whose effectiveness is highly questionable, who barely know what's happening at ground level, know a few buzzwords (""automation"" is a good one) and that's all.

- The performance evaluation (QPR) is questionable (to say the least). There's no transparency at all. During layoffs, a lot of people with a ""exceed expectation"" performance was fired. while others with a mediocre performance stayed (probably because they belong to more ""strategic"" groups)

- Company loves to reinvent wheels. For example, out there people use Docker; most Yahoo properties uses  container platform with no cpu or memory isolation very similar to a BSD jail.
Companies use Kubernetes or Fleet, Yahoo uses a proprietary and mediocre platform that probably spent millions to develop it.

The offices are nice, the food is good (or at least it used to be).","The level of incompetence and bureaucratic dysfunction is mind boggling. It's like they recruited the top level of management directly out of Clown College. People in senior management leave and never get replaced; their direct reports hang around waiting for a new manager or at least some marching orders, but none arrive, so either they rest and vest or they get bored and leave. The organization is highly silo'd; the engineers don't talk to the marketing or media people and no one understands each other. There is no chief operating officer who can make these factions work together, so they end up working against each other -- thus explaining why Yahoo cannot get out of its own way. And the HR process is a disaster; it takes months and months to approve a single hire."

At my next ad agency in a different part of the country, the Yahoo team worked even more closely with ours, confirming to me that there was a common value shared among Yahoos all over the world. I knew I had to come here myself when it came time for my next challenge. It was the Yahoo team that taught me about how to succeed in a changing marketplace, demonstrated exceptional customer service, and made me proud to eventually get a job on the vendor side. Yahoo reps roll up our sleeves and teach our clients, we empower them to be self-sufficient in our platforms, and customize trainings to help them succeed. If you care about your work, you will feel recognized and supported at Yahoo by your peers and managers, too. 

Yahoo is one of the most generous, fun companies I have ever worked. The most important difference about my day-to-day coming from the agency side, was new autonomy--not a single soul micromanaged me in my 16 months at Yahoo. There was also no drama within my teams. I was given creative freedom to drive the businesses in my portfolio to fit my clients' needs and had a strong, capable, efficient support team of Ad Ops and Creative Strategists to grow those businesses. I was given responsibilities to strengthen my insecurities and had 1:1 with my manager weekly throughout the course of my Yahoo life. I had time in weekly team meetings to ask questions, present wins and challenges, and make an impact for my peers. My ideas were valued from Day 1, and even only after 7 months of work, I had the chance to apply and was selected to fly to London for a Global Exchange program. I worked in the Yahoo UK office for 3 weeks, which was not only a significant career booster, but yet another personal accomplishment I had dreamed of for years. I don't know any other company that would support such an initiative for a relative newbie. 

I wish this unique company the absolute very best. Despite the difficult press and evident struggles, Yahoo is a company that most consumers have a soft spot for--many grew up with Yahoo products and don't want to see it fail.","I was cut in the latest round of lay-offs, along with 90 others in my role. 

Regardless, the folks working at Yahoo are true believers of Yahoo products; we even used Yahoo mail for corporate communications --a frequent pain point-- (no Outlook/calendar), but were also using integrated Google tools on a daily basis. Some may find it difficult or cumbersome to adapt to these tools, but the overall culture and people that work here make it all worth it."

Constant looming fear of layoffs

Endless negative press

High attrition due to the above 2 cons

SO MANY POINTLESS MIGRATIONS... one quarter it's migrate to this, next quarter it's migrate to that, next quarter the team maintaining that platform is either laid off or bails to another company because they are tired of this BS, next quarter it's migrate to another platform because nobody is maintaining the last one. Repeat.

Many of the internal services are extremely unstable and are not treated with the same respect as a production service. This has resulted in a large portion of the company using services like slack because we can't keep our own damn internal messaging services online.

Recruiters will spam your inbox, even your work inbox... and don't even think of answering your phone. I seriously cannot answer my phone anymore.

ESPP was discontinued about a year ago and replaced with stock grants that have lost 50% in value and take forever to fully vest

Stock price is tanking with no end in sight

Direction and future of company is unclear. Facebook / Google are leeching all of the ad revenue and ad-block software is reducing it

Management fails to see the harm QPR is causing to the company.

You will only receive high ratings if your projects are in the spotlight. This means if you end up with a streak of un-sexy projects for multiple quarters, you are at risk of being fired. The number of people that can receive a high rating is extremely limited. This means if you have a team of 10 world class engineers, only 1 would get the highest rating, 2 would get the next highest, and everyone else would be rated ""average"".

I have to say that my 2.5 year experience at Yahoo under Merissa Meyers have been nothing but awesome. In particular it had several simple benefits that even Google, my new employer, does not have. For example, at Yahoo they used to not only have a company shuttle for commuting but also they paid for my VTA via a Clipper. Google does not provide for VTA. Yahoo gave me a free Mi-fi device which was super cool. They also gave me a phone and paid for the entire unlimited data plan. The food at Yahoo is amazing and for me in particular they had a juice bar that I miss very much. You can basically tell them to put together any combination of fruits and vegetables to make any smoothie or juice you want. Google does not have that so I miss it for sure. The office spaces at Yahoo are really aesthetically pleasing and very well-lit. At Google my current office has almost no light. The culture at Yahoo is amazing with regular company-wide events where celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence or the Guardians of the Galaxy or sports stars come over etc.. Lots of awesome parties. They have a weekly sitdown between the entire company and the CEO along with all her execs where we could ask them any questions we want. The company has a lot of successes that gets hidden by the decline of Yahoo's old businesses, but if you are are employee in one of the focus areas of Merissa Meyers then its a really awesome place to be.","There is so much negative media scrutiny on Yahoo that it made it really hard to hire new good people.

2486,Yahoo,Learn everything!,2015-12-10,5.0,Associate Product Manager,"The APM Program at Yahoo is the best place to become an exceptional Product Manager.  We get a solid foundational introduction the first few weeks, and begin our projects right away.  It's a bit intimidating at first the level of responsibility you're given, but it's awesome.  I meet with my manager regularly, have a few mentors who have helped provide additional perspective, and an executive coach who works with me on developing my leadership style, communication skills, and anything else I need help with.

Throughout the year, we have chats with SVPs, Design directors, Architects, and other teams such as the Accessibility Labs and User Research groups, to learn more about what they consider / how they approach product.  We have outings and fun events with our class and other APMs.  We also went on a 2wk international trip to study tech markets in Israel and Asia, specifically focusing on how tech is created & consumed in those regions by speaking with venture firms, startups, tech policy makers, and university research labs.

There is a lot of change, and keeping up with it can sometimes be challenging.  However, I've found that this has helped me work more flexibly, so I'd consider it both a pro and a con.  Yahoo can only grow as quickly as it has if there is constant transformation, which requires change as the company evolves.  It's a special time in the company's history to be here, and it's cool that my work has such a large impact!

I understand to overestimate an expected goal is to motivate the employee but when the goal becomes unrealistic, then we have a problem. Also, the coworkers at Yahoo Taiwan don't really interact with one another. Everyone sort of just minded their own business and you wouldn't know whether the person next to you simply had a sick day or quit for good.

Many employees work smart and they are intelligent and bright.  Contributing  performers were told they did not meet Yahoo's performance standards when in reality they did. They just weren't political enough to hold onto their jobs or steps on their coworkers' toes to save their jobs in order to get ahead.

A year later I discovered I was being paid about 40% less than my peers, some of whom were were less valued and far far less skilled. Found out only because another dept wanted to poach me and that manager was literally appalled at what I was being paid at the time. I verified this asking other trusted co-workers in similar positions in my dept. They were also shocked at this information, fully knowing my excellent reputation. 

I was so highly-valued that during the constant layoffs, upper management told me point blank I was one of very few out of dozens of employees they wanted to keep to help shape the new regime. I had even won an annual Yahoo award, beating out seasoned veterans in my extended vertical. When it was discovered I was thinking of switching departments, 3 heads privately sat me down multiple times to plead for me to stay. I brought up the gross income discrepancy to them, they promised to try their best, which I believe they did. But even my upper management was powerless to do anything, as traversing Yahoo bureaucracy is so impossible that nothing gets done. 

Ended up quitting because it wasn't worth spending another minute there being so underpaid, and I was too valued to be laid off with their awesome severance package. I survived about 5-6 waves of layoffs in 4 years."

Excellent and talented colleagues.,"A tremendous amount of effort is put into hiring the best candidates only to turn around and micromanage. Quarterly reviews have the potential to build a strong culture if they were used to encourage growth. Unfortunately they only inspire fear based management and, in turn, fear based performance. Middle management is not trained well to improve as managers. Too much focus is placed on appearance of providing support to all product teams and recognition from senior management, rather than setting a strategy for where effort will make the most impact. Direct reports are expected to keep doing more because management doesn't understand (or just don't hold themselves accountable for the fact that) providing quality support to product teams begins with setting a strategy and clearly communicating to product teams what can and can't be covered. Employees end up being asked to do more and more because management doesn't play the role of prioritizing and saying no even when it's appropriate to do so.

2707,Yahoo,Danger! Avoid! Stay away!,2015-07-14,1.0,Advertising,"- Talented, friendly and considerate colleagues. I will always treasure the personal and professional friendships I made here.

- Good benefits: not as good as some of the competition, but generally good. Matching 401k, good vacation, maternity/paternity leave, free food and espresso bars (in some offices).","- A bright future....in the rearview mirror. Yahoo has spent a decade squandering its future, and is now close to checkmate. Platitudes like 'mobile first' and 'delighting our customers' don't really address the systemic issues at this company. The recent foray into online gambling shows how desperate this company is to shore up its sagging revenue - the primary value of Yahoo is its stake in Alibaba and its Asian assets.

- Corporate ineptitude at its finest. The leadership is non-existent, and C-level leadership mixes incompetence with arrogance and lies. The CEO will tell you she doesn't force her leadership teams to stack rank employees, but ask any front-line manager, and you'll see this is a lie.

- QPRs...employees are evaluated on a quarterly basis. Sounds good, right? Not when the evaluations are stack ranked, and there's a forced distribution of achieves vs. misses. So if you're on a team of idiots, you're as good as gold...if you work on a team of smart achievers, you might draw the short straw. And make no mistake - that short straw will result in your termination at some point, or at the very least, you'll have to wait over a year for a raise or promotion. Since forced distribution is a zero sum game, it encourages employees to sabotage each other in an effort to avoid the ax.

- Ya-who? Not only is Yahoo somewhat of a joke in most of society, they are going through a painful, existential identity crisis. Of the last four CEOs, none has been able to coherently articulate an answer to ""What does Yahoo do?"".

- Layoffs. Yahoo has yet to improve its revenue, so the only other road to profitability is to cut expenses. That means cutting people. For a while in Q1, there were weekly layoffs - management doesn't have the guts to make a large cut, so they cut 20 here, 30 there and hope nobody notices. Everyone noticed.

-  Lack of communication and transparency. Weekly 'FYI' meetings are supposed to allow employees a chance to ask questions of management - while great in theory, this is just a waste of an hour when the answers are glib coporatisms from the PR department, or complete avoidance of the actual question being asked. Q: 'What are you going to do about QPRs? They're destroying morale at Yahoo'. A: 'I fundamentally disagree, I think morale is great'. It sure is great if you're bringing in the millions in the C-suite! For the drones, maybe not as much.

- Terrible products. Try using Yahoo mail alongside Gmail. 'nuff said. Fantasy football is the one bright spot, but even that will probably crash just as you're about to draft your QB."

The usual free food, free snacks, onsite gym kind of Silicon Valley perks","Quarterly Performance Reviews (QPRs):  They are as awful as you've heard.  Every quarter you go through a full-on review cycle.  That means having to spend a lot of time justifying the work you've done, a lot of time filling out peer reviews for your coworkers, and a lot of time generally worrying about your status there.  Yahoo! uses a stack-ranking system where everyone is ranked from first to worst.  Everyone is put into a bell curve and all slots in that curve must be filled.  That means that if you're on a high performing team you may wind up in the lower quartiles even if you do good work.  When I worked there if you wound up one standard deviation to the right for two consecutive quarters you were put on a PIP.  I've heard from friends who still work there that now if you wind up in a lower quartile on *one* QPR you're not put on a PIP, you're simply fired.  That's right folks, one bad quarter and you're out.  They pretend that the reviews are objective, but they're not.  How can they be?  It's a nasty political system.  If you're not into that, stay away.

The company has been sputtering along for 8 years now.  Despite many many changes in top leadership and lots of big talk, nothing has really changed.  Yahoo! is always a takeover target.  There is always a threat of layoffs, although now with the harsh QPR system there's a constant stealth layoff going on.

Also as I was leaving I noticed that a new harsher, nastier engineering culture was taking hold there.  Engineers talked gleefully of ""getting rid of the dead weight"" (translation:  mass firings).  If you weren't absolutely stellar you were crap.

If you're anything less than a top-tier engineer, stay away.  Your life there won't be pleasant.  If you are a top-tier engineer, stay away, there are *much* better companies in the valley where you can really shine.

If you need a job out of college, it's probably a fine place to go.  Yahoo! still looks good on the resume.  Just don't plan to stay there too long."

2825,Yahoo,Customer care ran as an american High school,2015-04-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"very good benefits
nice free food","Yahoo! could be a great company to work for if it wasn’t ran like an American High school.
If you have ever seen an American High school movie, with cheer leaders, Football players, nerds, geeks etc.. Then you can get an idea of the environment. 
The customer care department in Dublin is ran by a very BAD MANAGEMENT. I am not referring to the team leaders, who probably are as much slaves as the single specialists (better paid slaves, that is), but senior management. The only transparent thing in Yahoo is the effort senior management put into launching their “favourite” employees forward. They’re also very rude as they can’t be bothered to say goodbye to the frustrated “what’s their face” employees leaving the company but they find the time when their favourite ones “finally” get promoted to other departments. Call me naive but a company whose value is “transparency” should make more than an effort to hire better and more humble management.
Customer care specialists are treated as children, we were told what to do, how to do it, if we could laugh or not, what kind of jokes we could make, and if we were good enough we were given treats (like dogs).
Like it’s shown in any American high school movie the cool guys are always under the spotlight whereas the multitude of nerds, geeks and parias are deliberately left in the shadow, no matter how hard they work. HARD WORK IS NOT RECOGNIZED IN YAHOO! (At least not in the Dublin site and definitely not in customer care).   
Salaries are low and not balanced to the average salaries for similar positions. Yahoo! management likes to brag we work for one of the biggest internet industries but they pay much less the direct competitors are paying their employees (for the same role). Within the team, employees with identical role have different salaries (depending on “experience”) and this cause uneasiness and bad feelings.
Customer care employees have been hired with the promise of email work only, b to b, but after signing the contract they were advised of some “small changes”: there would have been phone and it would have been a c to c support. And if you don’t like it there’s the door, paraphrasing what I was told when I complained about it.
You may think “oh well, I will stay in customer care for a while and I will apply to some internal position when it becomes available”, but you’re wrong. To apply for a position in a different department you have to be in the company for at least 1 year and a half and you have to have very high performances within your role (which is kind of difficult to get recognized for, if you’re not cool). But of course there are exceptional cases, it’s just not clear what is the criteria there, it’s like a leap of faith, you have to believe. In fact, apparently rules do not apply to everyone in Yahoo as I recently witnessed with my own eyes a person getting promoted to another department after less than one year. They say they made an exception. They just didn’t say why. 
I’ve never felt so belittled as I did while working in Yahoo! 
I don’t recommend this company, at least not the customer care department in Dublin. Unless you’re cool. Then it’s fine."

No one pushes back on the CEO- why? The CEO makes all HR related program and policy decisions, and yes- she goes through spreadsheets with lines of names and data- canceling programs, delaying decisions, and refusing to acknowledge that employees are not part of the priveleged 1% and need raises, equity refresh grants, and second chances before they are fired for low performance that in any other company in the valley would be acceptable.

Food has a good variety and has some sections that is always there available for anyone whom has more picky choices. Beverages include good types of coffee that is made on the spot as well as organic vegetable and fruit juice. Some recent leadership and acquisitions seem to be able to boost the company morale. Great work/life balance as no one or team seems to be overstressed about completing certain challenging project.,Stack ranked system makes engineers focus less on the work at hand and think too much into politics and peers around. Promotion system is flawed and sometimes isn't based on performance which makes employees very frustrated even when they worked their butts off and unable to get the right rewards. Good work/life balance sometimes is a a con too. Some people in some team really doesn't seem to work as hard as they should be. This sucks for the company as a whole as we are paying a lot of money to every employee but their output isn't that dedicated.

2996,Yahoo,Exciting environment but a mess internally,2014-12-16,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you get to know enough people at Yahoo you'll meet some really great people that can stick with you for life. Individually, there is a lot of talent there. Some of the best years of my career so far were at Yahoo, even though it was always an uphill battle to get anything measurable done. I met lifelong friends and have kept in touch with the people who were as dedicated to their work as I was. There were a lot of people who just floated by too. You don't have to prove to be a superstar to keep your job there - you can just float along getting things done - if that's your thing.  It was always an internal joke that no one ever gets fired at Yahoo. But landing in a team there with an innovative leader can end up being a fantastic career experience.","As a whole, any individual talent is very often diffused by (1) politics or (2) constant internal reorganizations or (3) by properties choosing to go after what makes money over the user experience. Of course each team is different, so your overall success and happiness will largely depend on who is leading the team and how innovative, forward-thinking and independent-minded they are. I was shuffled around to 4 different teams in my time at Yahoo, and I was lucky enough to have one manager in that time who was inspiring. Another was argumentative and hot-headed, another was completely uninterested in what I did for the company, and another was basically absent - in the year I reported to that person we only had one meeting together. All that said, I still like those people as people, and I enjoyed my time there. I did find it disheartening to put so much effort into a company that diffuses it by being a bit of a misguided mess."

Lots of great engineers have been fired by “performance” just because of managers wanted to get rid of inconvenient people;
Due to bell curve inside team (low 5% should go every quarter) there is no team work at all. Nobody shares any knowledge and help;

- Subjective performance evaluation - heavily dependent on the manager. If you have a good relationship with your manager, you are in for a ride in Yahoo. If you don't have a high position mentor and protector, your goodness will fade away. And of course, that too is subjective because you never know when that person is out of favor with his/her higher level
- Too many platforms. No clear strategy as to what the company wants to do. Platforms are bought, built and then scrapped because someone has convinced the management to build/buy another one. In my tenure, I saw as many as 7-8 platforms for the ad business. If you are not part of the next ""in thing"" in the company, you are screwed!
- Leaders more interested in building empires than leading the team/department/company to become better. Too many layers of managers. At one point, I counted 7 layers from CEO. Too much bureaucracy that it demotivates employees
- The new crop of managers/leaders is no better. As new leaders/managers join, they bring their own favorites with them. Yahoo is going overboard to pay them higher than the industry and giving them enough power for the first 6 months. That is enough to lose some of the earlier talent from the company.

Lately (in the last 4 years or so), I could really see how Yahoo's aggressive bets on innovation really put them in the path to success, e.g.: Hadoop, OpenStack, HTML5, Isomorphic / Single Page Apps.

Now I'm cheering for them from the sidelines, and I hope to see them succeed. I'm also grateful for a lot the people that I got to interact with during my stay there, all the cool and new technologies that I got to work on/with, and all the things that I learned.","Once you end up in a team where either a) the manager doesn't like you, or there is just no chemistry between you and the manager, or b) the manager already has a chosen set of favorite people that they know really well and have strong trust relationships with (and getting a new manager like that could happen any day given the huge amount of re-orgs taking place over there all the time)... it will be only a matter of time before you will start getting bad ""QPR"" ratings, with all the stress and reduced options (even moving to other positions becomes harder once you get a bad ""grade"") that that brings.

* Cell phone
* ICs are usually smart
* Some managers are awesome","Long Standing Issues:
* Meetingitis - ICs for hours a week, managers all the time.  Meetings to prepare for meetings about meetings.
* Too many middle managers, and the ones that ""kiss up and kick down"" get promoted.
* Silos, no incentive to work with other groups or have fresh ideas.  People who do get screwed in the reviews.
* Top down, one size fits all ""Agile"" process imposed, whether it makes sense or not.  Lots of ""Cargo Cult Agile"" used as a micromanagement tool (""Why haven't you done what you committed to?"" - every sprint a death march.)
* Below market wages - by around $20K
* Loaded with H1(b) indentured workers, who get treated like slaves because they can't quit without being shipped home.  This pressures wages for everyone below market. Slow green card process, too - because once people get their green card, they will leave.
* NIH syndrome - long standing habit of not wanting anything in their stack not invented or at least pissed in by in-house engineers.  Only dribs and drabs given back to the open source community.
* HR sides with management, even when management does something so egregiously bad that multiple people report it.  

Current CEO added:
* QPR - quarterly stack ranking, employees compete against each other to not get voted off the island.  You're gauged on how visible what you do is, not on how well you do it.  People are paranoid and demoralized.
* Open plan, no partitions, small desks, no privacy, noisy - symbolizes utter contempt for employees and their need for personal space.
* No WFH - to address a problem with incompetent management not realizing that some employees weren't doing any work, the whole company was forced to come in to the (now nasty and crowded) office.  Swatting a fly with a sledgehammer, and a nasty letter from HR to kick it off.
* Beware changing groups, your previous manager will give you a bad QPR, and if you had one before you're out the door.
* Mimicking Google, trying to draw in RCGs, shoving older workers (and their domain knowledge) out the door.
* People let go in QPR are asked to sign an absolution letter saying there was no discrimination or retaliation at Yahoo in order to get their severance. [I didn't sign - it would have been a lie.]  Letter also demanded the existence of the letter be kept secret for some reason... but only if you agreed to it.
* C-level micromanagement, and when people point out user dissatisfaction or problems, just dismisses the users as ""whiners"" or ""change averse""."

Also, if you are in the top 25%, they will pay a lot to retain you.",Years of decline have resulted in a broken middle management and a bloated workforce.

3075,Yahoo,A good job with the usual corporate pitfalls.,2014-09-20,4.0,Small Business Web Hosting Support,There is definitely room for advancement if you can show ability to take on the tasks. The company is very open to employee input for solving issues or creating new tools. The health benefits package is very good. Immediate management are knowledgable of the product and advocate for their employees.,"As usual in a large corporation, one department may not be aware of what another is doing. Upper management can be disconnected from what your team needs to do a job as efficiently as possible. Despite preaching customer appreciation/specific service levels, money is the ultimate determining factor on some decisions to the detriment of the product and brand. Corporate higher ups can sometimes implement well meaning policies that make the job harder as a knee-jerk response to a complaint. Outsourcing can sometimes be a looming threat. Some back-end systems appear to no-longer have maintainers that truly understand how it is put together. IT can't always fix strange network problems despite creating issues that ultimately hurt your metrics and may result in discipline. Somewhat moderate churn for front line employees and some management."
3076,Yahoo,Overall a decent experience,2014-09-19,4.0,Media Buyer,"Yahoo provided educational classes such a Xcel, word, PPT to improve in your skill set and make your every day work more efficient. The main campus had great food at a subsidised price. The variety of fitness classes was also great.  
Moving positions internally was always possible and preferred than hiring outside, which is is pro if you are already apart of Yahoo. They also take on people who are changing career paths","Too much red tape causing slow transitions with everything. Culture is strongly dependent on the department/ team you are on as Yahoo has too many silos. Management is ok.

Got a couple good stock bonuses.","After nearly 10 yrs of service, and stellar year-end reviews, including two ""exceeds"" rankings, I have been verbally promised a promotion from at least 5 managers. Since I've had so many managers, I have to start over with each one to prove myself. I am still making close to my base salary in 2010!! There is no clear vision on my team. So many people are unmotivated. We're not taking enough risks... Buzzfeed and Huffpost are beating us in the social realm, and it's because we play it too safe.

3083,Yahoo,"One year here, things are improving",2014-09-11,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company is moving in a direction that is shedding the mediocrity and poor leadership of it's past.  There's a culture of success, in that slowly but surely people are focused on meeting and exceeding goals.  While there's a ton of change that in all honesty can sometimes get in the way, it's a helpful dynamic for people that want to feel an urgency towards accomplishing goals from more than just themselves.

There is a culture of flexibility paired with success.  The stories a couple years ago about ""no work from home"" are relatively unfounded.  If you expect to work from home most of the time, yeah...Yahoo is probably not the company for you.  But if you need flexibility, even with some regularity, it's never been an issue provided you're meeting goals, 100% available, and not abusing the privilege.

Finally, this may be a little ""micro"" in terms of point of view, but wanted to share something I was VERY pleasantly surprised by.  Recently, a strategic decision was made to eliminate the team I was on.  That said, this did not mean firing everyone on the team"", rather they kept us all and folded us into the larger organization for which we were a part.  In some cases even giving people (myself included) the opportunity to transfer to other teams where there was interest and a mutual fit.  I'm not sure how often that happens, but I was surprised that that is how the situation was dealt with.","On the downside, constant change has sometimes meant losing focus on the reason for decisions (i.e. as they filter down to the people in the trenches).  I think this speaks more towards a need for better communication from all levels of leadership than it does on poor execution.   

The New York offices are scattered throughout the city, which will change at the end of this year when we're all moved into the new offices, but for the time being there's a sense of isolation.

We're behind in terms of some of our ad tech offerings (though catching up), so unless you can use that as a source of motivation (I hate losing, so it motivates me) you might be deterred."

You always have to wear headphones.  Full time employees don't like to mingle with contractors. Very few managers are nice.  They are under pressure from upper management and CEO.

There were as many as 8 people above me at any given time and much of it was dead weight that got in the way of the company's strategy.  While I was there there were many rounds of layoffs and the people who lasted longest weren't the people who cared about doing the job well but were able to play politics the best, this is especially true in middle management."

I don't think the compensation will be sustainable, though, as the ratio of revenue to employee is poor relative to competitors and revenue has been flatlining.","The leadership is very smart but inexperienced and it shows in a number of poor decisions.  The CEO has lots of product smarts but lacks experience running a company and has made poor hiring decisions including the costly selection of a COO.  HR leadership appointment was made to someone with no HR experience which led to very poor HR policies and programs including discontinuation of work from home option... and quarterly forced ranking performance reviews.  Marketing leadership, though bright, is out of touch and not inclined to listen to employees.  This has led to poor, myopic decisions such as taking a classic, dynamic, and unique logo and turning into something quite bland."
3089,Yahoo,Changing Quickly,2014-09-04,3.0,Senior Interaction Designer,The management teams are supportive and appreciative of smart hard work. The Santa Monica office has a great culture with emphasis on work/life balance. Great place for parents or people who value life outside of work.,"During 2013, the big con was that.

Tough competitive landscape.
Some managers have been there for too long and do not have the fresh perspective or technical competency to bring proper changes. Or on the contrary, the c-suite is pushing down the wrong focus with poor knowledge of what is happening in the field and how markets differ."
3092,Yahoo,"Good for new hires under new establishment, not for incumbents",2014-09-03,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The compensation and benefits are really good. The HR team did it's due diligence in upgrading to better plans that work for singletons, married, partners, for children, even pets. It's always better for new employees regarding compensation. They instituted a ""5-year leave"", which looks and feels like a sabbatical, but employees have to use their vacation time, so it's not like Intel or other companies that have true sabbaticals. Marissa initially brought a lot of attention, ""star power"", female empowerment, which carried through into the general population - helped the morale. The FYI Friday all staff meetings, town halls with VPs, and a CEO Q&A are all good attempts at having clear communication. Not many companies would do this consistently as Yahoo. It is a great place if you are new grad, less experienced in the workforce, and/or hungry and want to spend nights and weekends to create the next big thing.","It really depends on what team you are hired into - and the hiring process itself is very cumbersome. A lot of really wonderful experienced recruiters have left recently, and no wonder, the senior leadership in Talent Acquisition is a bit of mess. If you are a CS grad from a top tier school, are an engineer or in product, and can get past the multiple rounds of interviews and the interview committee, then you have the possibility of a great career at Yahoo. If you are a long time Yahoo employee, before Marissa or Jackie Reses, then it is much harder. That's not to say there aren't instances of established Yahoo employees being promoted. The removal of the remote workforce was a PR debacle, and it sent the wrong message to the employees as well. The company is stating they are like a start up with the backing of a big company - this is true for teams like mobile. There is a lot of self-promoting going on, a lot of managers now emulating what they see from the top. So it's not uncommon for people to completely flake on meetings, show up 15-30 minutes late - a culture shift that is not respectful of each other's time. What Marissa and her new team originally brought in terms of renewed energy is rightly changing to delivery - what has this leadership team done to truly turn the company around? Yahoo has had so many CEOs, so relative to her predecessors, Marissa is actively trying to do the right thing on her own terms."

3124,Yahoo,A great place to be!,2014-08-14,5.0,Technical Yahoo,"Yahoo is an amazing community filled with highly technical, passionate and kind people. Yahoos are really open and the company is focused on improving the products already released and creating new products that users will enjoy. The environment is great for any age and the community vibe gives it the feel on an extension of college. If you thought college was the best time of your life, you will love Yahoo. It's fast paced, the people are great and there is so much to learn and do on campus. You can find great opportunities anywhere.

There are some reviews on here which state something about a bell curve review system where every employee has to fit a position in the bell curve and if you are at the bottom of the bell curve for 3 quarters in a row you get fired... *sigh*, it is complete bull. I wish I hadn't believed it because it stressed me out a little bit when I started, but I asked my manager about it and he just laughed. There were some rounds on layoffs a couple years back when MM took control. There was a rating system in place but basically it was people who weren't trying and who were not committing any code who were laid off/fired. If you go in every day, work with your team, enjoy the fun things at Yahoo and get things done no one will want to get rid of you.

I also heard that if you keep getting the highest ratings in your quarterly reviews that they promote you and give you raises and more responsibility to make sure you are challenged. It isn't about waiting for a spot to come available, it's about making sure that you as a person develop, not just the company. I LOVE that! 

You also get long term disability insurance for free. This is a highly valuable perk!! I had a friend who injured himself scuba diving and is now paralyzed from the neck down. His company didn't provide LTD insurance and he had to ask his friends and family for money to help support his family and pay medical bills. It was heartbreaking to watch someone so vibrant do something they were embarrassed about while losing the use of 90% of their body. Most companies only give you short term for free. If the same accident happened to me I would get half of my salary from Yahoo until I was 65 and Yahoo would also take care of my medical bills. I am sure you could pay extra to increase the percentage to something like 80%, I'm thinking about it. I like to scuba dive.

You *can* work from home, but you need a reason such as doctor's appt, or DMV appt, plumber coming etc. But wouldn't you just rather be on campus for the free food?

One point I will mention is that I had cheaper healthcare at my former company which was a lot smaller. There are about 5 policies to choose from. I used to get brand name meds for $10, now they're $30. It's still a great price compared to Obamacare and sure, I get paid a lot, but I was expecting a little bit better from Yahoo."

One of the core values was communication. Well, hope springs eternal. Too often the right had didn't know what the left hand was doing. Departments were siloed and had vested a vested interest in protecting their turf. The idea of ""One Yahoo!"" was floated for over a decade and will never come to fruition. Back in the day, we were a search company and our competition was Google. Then we became a media company, and our competition was Sony, EMI, and newspapers/magazines. Then we became a social media company and our competition was Facebook, for crying out loud. When I was forced out, we'd decided that we were no longer a media company but we weren't  told what sort of company we were. I'd lived through 5 CEOs, including the resurrection of Jerry Yang, and wow, was THAT a worthless choice. There's a general consensus that Marissa didn't tell the Board that she was pregnant before they hired her. She hired her BFF out of Portugal (before he had the legal right to work in the US, of course, cuz the laws don't apply to Marissa and her senior staff), and very publicly threw him under the bus when she could no longer deny that he was out of his league. She's made some lame hiring decisions, and she's made some really horrible hiring decisions. EVERY offer passes through at least one hiring committee, and then is scrutinized by Marissa. If she doesn't like the comp (and she often doesn't), she will reduce it to what she thinks is fitting and there is no appeal. She talks about hiring the best and the brightest but neither the best nor the brightest will surrender their right to negotiate their compensation. Anyone who does so cannot, by definition, be either the best or the brightest. Free food goes only so far. Oh, and cutting work from home while claiming that it only affected 100 people, most of whom, according to you, rarely logged into the network to actually work seems a little like overkill. Friday 430 pm all-hands meetings is also a nice touch, especially when if you show up at 4:31pm, security will not unlock the doors to let you in. 

The employee population have also gone from reasonably nice/decent to an unattractive assortment of narcissists and ego maniacs who seem to take out their frustration of having no work-life balance and being constantly under the gun and under threat of getting a poor quarterly review that they can take it out on their co-workers.

Even if you survive layoffs for some reason, there is concept of QPR where manager's are forced from upper management to give less ratings. Because of which internally politics will be there.  In the name of QPR they laid off so many people.

I joined Yahoo in June. In the month of Oct/Nov I had a 1-1 with my manager he say's ""Please start looking out"".  I was shocked and asked him why? He says team is moving from India to US. Since I haven't completed a year in Yahoo! he can't transfer me to US. I asked him about internal team transfer he says not possible.

I started looking for internal team transfer also  job search outside. Next week my manager comes back and say's I am transferring you to US please stop your job search. 
Again next week he say's ""Start searching outside"".  I started searching for internal team transfer . Lucky found some openings . But the new team manager says there is no vision for this division after 1 quarter. I can't promise anything

About my QPR, my manager write's in QPR "" My biggest weakness is I should handle org restructing smoothly even if there were so many confusion"" --> How funny is that :P

I have had in average 2 managers per year. And many things are tied to your manager. Thus, this is a big minus. From my perspective, Salary is the biggest con. Opportunities are sometimes not equally given to all; this is again a drawback. So, Career growth takes a toll, at times (for some)."

I was hired to rebuild an existing system only to find out after I started that I wasn't allowed to change said system because too many people depended on it being exactly the way it was (said system came originally from another company Yahoo acquired in the late 90's - think DHTML and Java applets for scrolling text on the screen and you're in the ballpark).

Low expectations that are easily met. Work is okay, good enough to beef up my resume.","Work is slow and not that great. Hadoop and Cloud technologies are well advertized but a closer look will tell you that most engineers are fixing bugs.

Pros are the biggest con. I ruined quite a few years of my career working for managers and especially the directors at Champaign site. Managers have no real control over their teams, all is dictated by the Directors. Some other reviews also mention this and is true that these Directors are technically incompetent and use their political influence to keep themselves at the top. Somehow it has worked for quite a few years. The decision makers in HQ do not want to change them to keep a smooth sailing impression. These Directors have ruined quite a few careers by initially hiring people who were not a good fit for the job, but hiring them allowed to meet their hiring quota. Then they fired some of these people on account of poor performance - of course a bad fit will not perform well. So on both occasions Directors come on top, first by meeting their hiring quota and then when the company was looking to trim, they got rid of the same people. Ironically and ridiculously, some of the same people were hired yet again as part of site growth agenda.

There are three distinct groups of Champaign Yahoos. First with the ones that came in bulk from Motorola. They are the older people. They stick together and take care of each other. Some are good. Difficult to break into this group. Second group is in Champaign because their spouses are in the area for employment. These people are the most political ones and will do anything to hang on to their dear jobs. Group three is made up of independent Yahoos who think they can make a career and living in Champaign."

3362,Yahoo,Behind the doors politics,2013-12-05,4.0,Technical Yahoo,"Salary, work flexibility most of the time.

Marissa has been good for Yahoo! I do not agree with people who diss no more work from home policy. Maternity and paternity benefits are just great. Even though many will not get to use these, it shows what is important to company and the culture they want to build.","Good new talent is very difficult to attract.

There is a cultural disconnect between Chamapign and the rest of Yahoo. People who have never travelled to HQ don't even know. Older managers try gimmicks to keep their influence because they are aware of their technical shortcomings. Sadly likeability of managers is what is keeping them in place. Fiefdoms!

Managers do not give real feedback face to face because it makes them less likeable. Behind the doors though, they do not shy away from taking others down. I know first hand because I overheard a very interesting conversation through the porous conference room walls. There is a very well defined them Vs management Vs HQ thinking."
3363,Yahoo,Bait and Switch,2013-12-01,1.0,Customer Service Agent,The maternity benefit was decent. Benefits and salary paid.  Up to sixteen weeks for women and eight weeks for men.,"I was misled about the position during the recruiting and interview process.  The job description was completely inaccurate. Yahoo blatantly lied and lied by omission during the recruitment and interview process.

I was informed the hours of operation were M-F 6am-6pm and that I would have a set schedule.  During the recruiting/interview process Yahoo informed me the job would entail lots of detailed analyzing and helping clients to the full extent. I was informed that they would like me to learn some of the technical aspects of the job to start but with my background I will be promoted extremely fast. The recruiter even asked me to stop looking for employment after the interview. She said Yahoo really wanted me to join their team and asked me not to accept any other offers weeks prior to actually extending me the actual offer.   

Now fast forward to week 2 of training.  My entire training class gets bamboozled with the information that the hours of operation are actually 7 days per week 6am to 9pm and we would be required to work every holiday. 

Next, the duties of this position were not Customer Service duties. I was resetting passwords all day.  Management focused on how fast and how many calls you were taking rather than the content and quality of the calls. There were no details or analyzing.  Not to mention they didn’t want us helping customers to the full extent.  Example, one day I had an elderly lady crying to me on the phone because she had a sick family member oversees and she didn’t know how to respond to the email. Management wouldn’t let me help her?  I had to tell her to go to the help pages and figure it out herself.  

So as time goes by I discussed my concerns with management.  I ask about future plans and maybe posting out or being promoted.  I'm told, “We’re learning as we grow & we don’t really know what opportunities will be available in the future.”  Management clearly developed favorites and placed these favorite employees on special projects.  The individuals who spoke up about their concerns were clearly held back and treated unfairly.  Management made up the ""rules"" and policies as they went.  To me, this place and especially it's management team are unorganized and extremely unprofessional.  You'd be taking a gamble to accept a job as a Customer Service Agent.  If you're lucky enough to be one of management's favorites, you might be okay.  If not, you will be completely miserable."

It's a big enough company that you are sure to find some area to work in which you are interested.  Yahoo! offers good benefits.  It has an informal culture.  You are generally allowed to do the right thing.  If you're an absolute superstar you'll be well compensated.,"A new way of evaluating employees has come along which, in my opinion, greatly detracts from the once collaborative culture.  On a quarterly basis all employees are stack-ranked against their colleagues in their respective departments.  They are then placed in a ""bell curve"" where each slot in the bell curve *must* be filled.  If you are in the bottom of that curve for three quarters in a row, you're fired.

This means that if you work in a high performing group you could wind up toward the bottom of the bell curve even though you do a good job.  This creates an incentive not to help coworkers, to avoid hiring superstars, and to generally not wish good things to happen for your colleagues."

The new goals/performance review program is demoralizing, arbitrary, and used as a way for middle managers to play favorites. Supervisors and middle managers are not very good leaders, organizers, or managers, and they are under pressure to make their workers perform, so non-managment employees are cogs in a machine. Quantity of output is far more important to managers than quality. There is little to no communication on the media side (engineering may be different, since it's more collaborative in general), and that may be because coworkers are pitted against each other even if they're on the same team.

Having everyone work in the office everyday again instead of seeing random people working from home on any given day and on every Friday has made a big difference. With everyone working together in the office 5 days a week instead of 3-4 days a week the company overall is noticeably more productive now. The free food and free smartphones are great, but by far the best change that has happened since Marissa took over is seeing the company focus back on making user-centric products, instead of developing products primarily to satisfy the demands coming from advertisers. The culture of transparency exhibited at each Friday's all-hands meetings led by Marissa has been a breath of fresh air.","Despite all of the positive changes we've seen over the past year, there are still way, way too many managers.

- You learn scaleability by serving one of the most crowded user base after Google and Facebook","If you work in Yahoo, you should have nerves to handle never ending reorganizations,lay offs and CEO searches ever since 2008. Since then massive reorgs took place every other year: 2008,2010 and 2012, along with countless smaller scale reorgs went unnoticed by media.
After every reorgs and thousands laid off, then yahoo start hiring agressivelly just after couple of months to fill very same racks, so then quickly Yahoo ends up same headcount before reorg started. 

Note for the Immigrants: If you are an immigrant,the outlook is even worse: Yahoo cannot apply for green cards  since it's constantly laying off people. Even though you were lucky to get your labor application while things are quite,your application will be denied as soon as Yahoo does a new reorg, which always does!

CEOs and upper management have no clue about reorg,so they hire Boston Consultancy Group to tell them what to do. Do you imagine any of a hot internet companies like Facebook, Apple or Google ever go and ask management consultancies what to do?

Yahoo has simple answer to most difficult problems: ship it to India! If product X,Y,Z (fill in the blanks shopping,travel,messenger,search,advertising) cannot compete with Google,FB et al,always solution is to ship those products to India,expect the amazing talent of India thrive those products. Google,Apple and Facebook must be stupid not do it this way!

- Multiple re-orgs can be tiring, but hopefully that's behind Y! with the new CEO as of early 2012."
3960,Yahoo,Absolutely the most fulfilling experience I have had,2011-12-21,5.0,Research Engineer,"- They reward high performance very well
- Co-workers are very talented and knowledgeably, so I was always learning from them. Because getting a job at Yahoo is tough (Used to be that 1 job given per 100 resumes), the quality of people here is of high caliber.
- Possibility to work with multiple teams, so you can work on more than one project at the same time and keep life interesting
- Career growth and goals are taken seriously, I moved on from Software engineering to Research position gradually
- Competitive perks and salary
- Fun informal environment","- Media coverage of the company since 2008, The inside reality of the company is completely different from how its portraid in the media."
3961,Yahoo,Great Place to Work!,2011-12-20,5.0,Intern,"Some of the best things about Yahoo! was the relaxed and comfortable environment. Also there was always free treats, such as candy and pop and free lunch. It was a place where you actually woke up every morning wanting to go to work.","Some of the downsides were parking issues and sometimes having to ""makeup"" work for yourself. Other than that there is nothing else bad to say about the company."
3962,Yahoo,gone bad to worse,2011-12-18,2.0,Senior Tech Yahoo,OK compensation and good benefits . also yahoo as a brand is known all over but otherwise there is no good reason to join and keep working for this company,nepotism and low employee morale. also stock options and RSU are uselss. frequent layoffs which target  'non-ass-kissing' employees. overall a pretty bad place to work
3963,Yahoo,Nice place to settle but avoid if you want to grow.,2011-12-07,2.0,,"Fairly stable. Pay, benefits, and workload is reasonable.  Has good community of frontend engineers where you can grown in that area.","Management clueless.  Teams not united.  Each functional team only cares about their own interest: architects want to push their latest-and-greatest platforms, VPs only care about test code coverage to satisfy minimum requirements, QA only care about process, PMs only care about launching new features (whether they make sense or not)."
3964,Yahoo,Pretty good,2011-12-07,3.0,,"cool technology, massive scale, good people","uncertainty, lot of hiring at higher levels limits growth opportunities for current employees"
3965,Yahoo,Could have been better!,2011-12-06,3.0,,High level of talents but wasted,"REALLY bad management, need smarter leaderships"
3966,Yahoo,Fun Job,2011-12-05,4.0,,"Fun employees. Great benefits 401k, medical dental. Office is beautiful and my manager is just wonderful. Very generous with time off.",Room for growth is minimal due to how big the companys is. They need to pay more attention to all.
3967,Yahoo,It was a job at an old company caring more about outdated ideas than changing the world.,2011-12-04,2.0,,"There are smart people that work there. 
The free shwag is somtimes nifty and fun. 
Octoberfest. 
Some interesting products and tools to work with.","4 layoffs in 4 years (and more to come). 
$30ish stock options that were never worth it.
Despite layoffs there are incompetent teams (team of 10 working for 2 years did what 1 competent person could do in 6 months (no exaggeration there)). 
Apparently you ant fire someone outside of a layoff unless you have a years with of screw ups as evidence. 
Poor decisions by upper management and execs. 
More leaks than a boat made of Swiss cheese. 
Constantly reinventing the wheel except that the wheel they always make is square and they never learn. 
Several teams working to reinvent the same wheel at the same time and don't communicate."
3968,Yahoo,A place where you could maintain good work-life balance.,2011-11-23,3.0,Technical Yahoo,"1) good perks and benefits
2) upper management that respects employees
3) friendly and usually helpful co-workers 
4) used to be a place of highly competent engineers bu the quality has gone done in the last 2 years 
5) a great place to maintain work-life balance","1) can be stuck in projects that are not technically challenging
2) little room for career advancement
3) change of focus from upper management that leaves employees with no clear direction
4) level of new hires are overall lower than those that worked there a couple of years ago
5) incompetent first and second line managers"
3969,Yahoo,good culture and life-work balance,2011-11-22,4.0,,"Very open and flexible company culture. You will come across a bunch of talented individual contributors, which are smart and mostly easy to work with.","Higher management doesn't really know where they should be going, unclear strategy to take the company to the next level. Frequent but useless re org oftens leads to chaos and deteriorated morale."
