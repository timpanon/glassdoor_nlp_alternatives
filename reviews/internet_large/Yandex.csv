You feel proud to work for the company.,"Low salaries. Constantly changing departments' strategy. Even if you work 100% towards your goal, it is possible that shortly before the quarter ends, the goals are changed and become unreachable. This was really frustrating. Constant staff turnover. The company doesn't value professional experience and isn't interested in growing the loyal and experienced employees. Main target now is to hire managers from other industries. Often it leads to the fact that a new team lead:
- has no clue in the area of his teams' activity, 
- isn't interested in understanding peculiarities of the industry
- isn't interested in growing/supporting the team, but rather in personal goals
- adds bureaucracy to all the processes instead of process optimization
- sets irrelevant targets to the team, due to lack of product knowledge.

Unfortunately, this happens since past 3 years and I have seen these unpleasant changes not only in my team, but also in the teams from other departments I worked with. Many employees that worked for the company for 5+ years have recently left it."

634,Yandex,"Best IT company in Russia, but don't expect high salaries",2020-05-24,5.0,Software Developer,"IMHO Best IT employer in Russia
Very high expertise, lots to learn from colleagues
Wide variety of bleeding-edge projects: SDC, Search, Taxi, Cloud, Geoservices, Media etc. You can learn from all of them, and most of them affect from tens of thousands to many millions users. The scale is enormous, which makes a very unique experience. The external impact is giant.
Yandex is very prestigious in Russia, and generally it is a ""good company"" (Google's ""don't be evil"")
Wonderful office in the center.
Open-minded people, bright minds around, nice corporate culture, not official atmosphere.
Equality, easy communication with higher level management and other teams.
Working hours are flexible and not controlled -- you just have to deliver the results.
Medical insurance.
Meals compensation. Many cafes and bars around the office, where you can pay with your badge.
Yandex has its own anonymous image board, which is officially recognized. Maybe it is a plus. Most people say it is.","Salary lower than market average (it can be compensated by RSUs on higher grades, but you'll have to compete with workaholics, see below). 
Most of technologies are in-house: cloud, building, deploying, virtualization, monitoring, map/reduce, storage, mono-repo and so on and so on (most of technologies on market don't scale to Yandex scale). Prepare to learn from the start. If you leave -- prepare to learn again.
So-called duty (dezhurstvo): prepare to support internal users, administrate your service, deal with quotas, SLBs, monitoring, fix f___ups. It can last a week (including weekends if something bad happens). And after several weeks -- repeat.
There are almost no system administrators -- all developers are SRE/DevOps, whatever.
Development is C++ centered (hello, building python projects into giant binary)
Work/life balance is not that good -- most people around are workaholics. And you will have to compete with them, because on biannual performance review you'll have to show that your results are better. 
Severe Google-style interviews -- prepare for 8 hours of interviews, at least half of them are algorithms (even if you won't use any of them them in daily work).
Open space environment (can vary from small offices with 8 tables to up to ~40), sometimes very noisy (you'll recognize your colleagues on the street by noise-cancelling headphones) .
Many meetings, not that many conference rooms."

I need to stress this point: remote positions at Yandex are totally different from regular, full-time positions at their office.

1) Incredible corporate culture

It's really fascinating to see this type of friendly corporate culture in Russia.
Everyone is so nice to you, and your manager is like your pal.

2) Great training

Work related lessons and courses are detailed, easy to understand, and you can always ask your manager or colleagues if you don't get or missed something.

3) Pay-per-task (may be a pro to someone)

Most of Yandex remote positions are pay-per-task rather than pay-per-hour.

4) Official employment

You'll get hired under Russian Employment law.","1) Salary way below market rate

You can get paid at least two to five times more at similar positions in other companies.

2) No social benefits or compensations

As a remote employee, you won't get any health insurance or any other social benefits, no compensations too.

3) Minimum work hours requirement

Although most of Yandex remote positions are pay-per-task, you still get a minimum work hours per week requirement."

I describe the view from my corner :)
Work/life balance strongly leans to work, especially true for team leading positions. A lot of people spend their whole life at job and expect the same from colleagues.  
New performance review system is based on stack ranking - rank everybody, find several best/worst achievers every 6 months and deal with them accordingly. What if all real worst achievers already left the team? Does not matter - rank everybody, find several scapegoats and give them B/C- rating. Review system is not very transparent, if you get low rating once, you will be under scrutiny afterwards. Products sometimes are rushed to be released before performance review dates, that leads to shamefully raw and buggy releases.
Quality of code base and test coverage is strongly varied from team to team. Level of strain is strongly varied in different teams."

945,Yandex,Asessor position review,2016-09-17,1.0,,Ability to work remotely (but company doesn't provide any equipment),"Monotonous and tedious work of manual classification.
No qualification at all is needed, so the job is paid just for acting as a human, because classification in general cannot be done automatically at current tech level.
Extremely low payment, e.g. verification one address on yandex-maps with an address on a firm's site, is paid as 1 rub < 2 cents ( 0.02 $ ).
No career opportunities, that was straightly said by my boss.
This is remote work, and company doesn't provide any equipment, I must use my own PC."
946,Yandex,Good for young and ex-ACM,2016-09-11,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Great office facilities: food, cookies, coffee, tea, fruits, gym.
  - Powerful hardware: MacPro laptops, Desktops.
  - Discounts in all cafes nearby.
  - Competitive salary.
  - Great place to start career or to continue with few years of experience.
  - I believe Yandex is significant step forward from common russian software company.","- Cons:
  - Management doesn't understand (or can't explain) why we do something. It's really difficult to get solid targets or directions for development.
  - Management believes all developers have near-to-the-same area of expertise. Thus, task may be reassigned by management to different owner without any discussion.
  - If a member of your team is overloaded, definitely, you would get a part of his tasks, in spite of really different specialization between him and you.
  - Typical Yandex employee is a person with few years of C/C++, surely with ACM experience. These people know 'how' to do whatever they want, but don't know what is really 'worth' to do. Example: plenty projects have their own implementation of string (exactly, zero-copy!).
  - In spite of Yandex tries to be western IT company, in fact, it's Russian company. It means 'special features' of russian management style: management doesn't discuss with employees mission and vision, targets and goals. So, it's not really western-style company at all. Moreover, at my point of view, management isn't really open-minded and willing to hear.
  - Employees don't fully understand what they do (I mean not their particular area of work, but bird's-eye overview), why business gives money for development (and what business expects from development), and finally, the most important, what we desire to achieve (particular technical goals).
  - Company nudges employees to develop their own 'solutions' for work in their private time.
  - Management doesn't have strong business acumen.
  - New managers don't know what does it mean to be a manager, not supervisor.
  - Yandex culture exists only in paper.


- Conclusion
  - I believe Yandex is good place to work only for young people with few years of professional experience and, necessarily, ACM experience. I'm not sure Yandex is good place to work for people with any 'special' skills."

Also there was the case of conflicts between management in Moscow and in SPb that was resolved in honor of Moscow ones only because they were friends of senior managers there. This was unfair and resulted in firing of dozens of pretty skillful SPb managers and tech guys.

The focus is on openness and free speech and internally the company is very open and free.  Compensation is fairly good, confortable office, very flexible working hours.","Organizationally and technolgically many things are done very ad hoc. The company didn't handle its scaling very well, it falls behind the pace it grows with. Anyone can come up with an idea (which is good), but often it is unclear what one has to do for the idea to have a chance to become real. Often it is not clear who is responsible for what, who is in charge of making a decision, how plans of various departments match each other. Many processes are inefficient, producing much frustration. It feels like a lack of big ideas, big vision for both products and technology, and this lack feels on all level - from bottom to top."

There's much more bureacracy now compared to 5-6 years ago. Great ideas sometimes get stuck somewhere in the decision-making and never get to life. It was totally different when I first came to Yandex: the processes were quick and ricky at times and that was whole lot of fun. Now it's more steady, slow and boring.

Despite opening many offices, Yandex is absolutely HQ-centric. If you want to work on the forefront products, you have to move to Moscow. If you have ambition and want a career growth, you have to move to Moscow. All the decision-making is made there."

1170,Yandex,Outstanding corporate culture,2012-09-18,5.0,Software Engineer,"I can't really imagine a better company in Russia and I always have a very warm and nostalgic feeling when remembering the period when I worked at Yandex.

* Interesting and challenging problems with large impact
* Very little pressure in most groups - there's rarely a formal deadline
* This means you can often do a lot of experimentation in the direction you like - you will usually NOT be forced to implement a quick-and-dirty solution
* Lots of super-smart people around
* All the code is open to everybody in the company, so you can e.g. read some crazy stuff from the core search algorithms and learn a lot.
* Everybody is friends with everybody. It's a joy to come to work and just talk to people.
* A huge amount of intra-company communication infrastructure that's very actively used: mailing lists (with search), messenger, a wiki about EVERYTHING, ""100 facts about everybody"", people directory etc. It really helps A LOT to jump on the board or just to creep around and learn more about who is who and what's going on in the company.
* Many of the mailing lists are cross-team (e.g. for java developers in general) and they're active
* Teams are very open. You can talk to anybody; you can send a suggestion to their mailing list and they'll respond, etc.
* Good infrastructure - e.g. crazy stuff for load testing
* The company is constantly collaborating with universities and helping host educational events. You can be proud to be part of a company that's having such a HUGE impact on education.
* Beautiful offices with on-site everything: food, sports equipment and instructors, english lessons, library, showers, games etc","* Salary is middle of the market, not top
* There are fewer interesting tasks in St.-Petersburg than in Moscow (that's why I left)
* Food in St.-Petersburg could be better, and if you take lunch after 3pm, you may find that all the tasty things are already eaten :)
* There are of course some projects with smaller impact or less stellar management. You might be unlucky to run into one - then just try jumping to a different project.
* There's A LOT of ""not invented here syndrome"" all over the company. It can be dissatisfying to spend years developing something really cool and then see other people reimplementing a crappier version of it, just because it's fun for them too (with a formal reason like ""it was hard to integrate""). Well - then learn better communication skills, mate, and don't concentrate just on coding."
