0,Yelp,I assume positive reviews came from pre-Covid experiences.,2022-04-08,2.0,Manager Level,"Great benefits, WFH stipend. Any positives are related to the perks and not the actual working experience. Coworkers were nice.","This place was so bad I left after only two months because the manager was horrible. Management takes no responsibility for any process shortcomings, you will feel like you’re on an island if onboarding remotely; micromanaging, toxic work culture that feels like gaslight city. I don't know if management is afraid of their superiors, but if I asked for more thorough training or more resources, my manager would blame me for not knowing things that only an employee with the company for a longer period would know. Lots of belittling to avoid responsibility for their team member's successes or failures. 

Oddly enough, the hands-off approach to helping employees goes out the window when it's time to do work as they want to ensure you are micromanaged and never away from your home desk. Not on their watch! They give good PTO but the usage expectation is ridiculous - they make you use PTO hours for a doctors appointment, even if it’s just one hour during the work day (aka when most doctors see patients). Not at all a flexible work environment as advertised - they want manager level to be butt-in-seats which is offensively childish. I've had enough real jobs after 8 years in this field to know this is a joke. I assume the good perks people reported here are related to previous office culture. What is the cool and happy Yelp employee culture when only remote??? They haven’t figured it out. It may have been a good place to work years ago, but do yourself a favor and ask former employees what they think of Yelp while you're in the interview process. 

The negative reviews are spot on and I wish I looked at them sooner myself. I quit Yelp without another job lined up and let me emphasize how much happier I was to even be unemployed. I'd advise you skip my mistake altogether."

3,Yelp,Great for entry level,2022-04-07,4.0,Account Executive,"Yelp was a great community for young employees starting careers and wanting to gain experience. Fully stocked kitchen and great benefits were what lured me to the company. There were great amenities and social functions that were catered towards younger, single people with no families or responsibilities outside of work. Socials after work and at lunch were encouraged, but overall work life balance was great. I never needed to check my work email outside of office hours which was not something I previously experienced.","I felt that management was inexperienced for their roles. There is more to management than just being good at sales. I felt like experience, coaching, mentoring, and overall people management was severely lacking within management. Although Yelp offers sales training, I did not feel like their approach to sales was very well rounded or even ethical. I think the majority of people without prior sales experience would probably struggle within the role. Although the benefits were great, the salary and the commission structure really wasn't reasonable in my opinion. Territories assigned to you can make or break your production and commission potential."

It is an absolute grind and you are expected to reach daily and monthly quotas. 9-5 with an hour lunch break. The rest of the time is making calls.
34,Yelp,Don’t apply,2022-03-22,1.0,Account Executive,The health insurance benefits are solid.,"Would not recommend for someone that has prior sales experience. Here are some of my negative experiences there: none of your previous sales experience will matter as you have to follow the script word by word that they give you. Your manager listens to your call and will tell you what to say DURING the conversation, it’s hard enough to listen to your client yet alone hearing your manager on the other ear coaching and telling you what to say

They say you have all this sick day and PTO but they question you when you’re out sick which is not ethical. You are also not salary, you are hourly which is not implied during the hiring process. Due to this, they are non flexible with hours. Extreme micromanaging on a daily basis. You’re constantly reminded (and by constantly, I mean literally every 30 minutes) how bad you’re performing compared to other teams. 

And lastly, they don’t expect you to build strong relationships with clients. They expect a one-call close and that’s it. Scheduling appointments is not encouraged as your “territory” can be swapped at any point. You can have a strong pipeline that you’ve been working on for months and then “surprise” it’s all gone. 

Not your traditional sales environment that you would expect."

36,Yelp,Ehhh,2022-03-21,3.0,Elite Account Executive,"great co-workers, gives you a lot of skills","emotional roller coaster, have to ask to use the bathroom"
37,Yelp,Most racist company I’ve every worked at. From a senior account executive,2022-03-21,1.0,Senior Account Executive,yelp hires some amazing people wfh kind of ruined the whole reason I stayed here and that was the fun work environment.,"Literally the amount of racism in this company is ridiculous. it’s true racism the systematic kind, you’re going to do a lot worse in this company if you’re black or Hispanic. Plus the numbers do not lie. 

 So your sales territory is called a pool, there’s something we call Minority Pools not official thing in the company but that’s what us POCs called them. you’ll know when you have them because most color people have them. They’re not gonna be very populated and there’s not going to be a lot of new accounts they’re probley be very poor. As a poc you will not easily get out of them( if a white rep asks for a new pool they will get swapped out even a couple times a month) while poc oh good luck managers going to give you another minority  pool mine usually came from reps that were fired for not selling. at the same time white reps get whenever they ask for. Example You’ll get the Ozark pool while a white rep will be calling Miami New York Austin.

So for  example I was calling a summer town in Michigan with a population of about 2000 people for six months in the winter. Three years later I’m calling Flint Michigan. I live in New York do you get New York City no I speak Spanish do you get Miami no do you get Austin Texas hell no. I literally had the Ozark pool which is very reminiscent of the show and there suppose to be random I got it three times in a row so every 4 to 6 months they would swap it around and I had it three times. But so did other poc reps. Literally calling one bar within 100 mile radius kind of situation. 

When I first started all the directors were white from the same school. Then all the managers except for 3 were white one was Indian one was Hispanic one was Asian. They put a quota in to hire a certain amount of minorities but because we are given  the worst pools it makes it very difficult to do your job. So basically they end up just hiring outside managers . So a goo pool will get five new accounts a day a minority pool will probably only give you 1 to 5 a week if you’re lucky. So I’ll say if you do decide to work in this company if you’re black or Hispanic you’re definitely in a deficit you can succeed but it’s very very difficult. don’t be mad at yourself if you didn’t make it because literally they’re going to make you call the these minority pools while the white reps get proper things to call it’s insane.  There is a hand full of poc reps that got to the point where they do well. But you need to get fed new pools or be really good at closing another language and even then it’s only 1/2 comp so you need to work twice as hard literally. 

I still remember when they put all the top reps from the company together which were all white for the record and they were talking about where do you get your best accounts from all of them said the same thing new accounts. Because in local if you are on the call list for a local it did not do well or don’t think they need it currently. So new accounts are pretty much the highest growth for local sales. If they did do well they would be in customer success. So it’s really important you have new accounts in the pipeline and I had manager take new accounts and move them to white reps, it’s easy to tell but yelp like keeping reps dumb and not knowing this is happening"

41,Yelp,PLEASE BELIEVE THE REVIEWS.,2022-03-17,2.0,Account Executive,"Remote work, fun and vibrant work culture.","Pyramid scheme, unrealistic expectations, micromanaging, Yelp is a product that consumers just don’t want.

I did not even make it to a full month. It took me 2 weeks to realize the type of company and position the Account Executive role was. This role is a bottom of the barrel type of position. You’re cold calling accounts ALL day that want absolutely nothing to do with you. How do you expect sales reps to grow and receive commission if you’re giving them leads that lead to NOWHERE? We trained for one week, and then the next week we were put on the phones. Managers micromanage micromanage micromanage. It became unbearable. Constantly criticizing and setting unrealistic expectations with only a week of training. 

Yelp has all of the bells and whistles, but it took me only 2 weeks to see beyond that. You will not flourish at this company. There are better tech companies out there that will pay you MORE and require less stress.

Also the sales script that they give you to read is a JOKE. You’re forced to recite a longgggg sales script that just sounds pushy and out of touch with reality. Most times business owners would laugh at you and hang up the phone before you could even get to the second sentence.

The team managers only care about their numbers and not the over all well-being of their sales reps. It was clear as day that the managers received some sort of commission or ranking based on how much their team was able to sell out-dated Yelp ads.


Anyways, I don’t recommend anyone to work here. It’s not worth the stress. Keep
in mind, I was only here for 2 weeks. I logged in one morning and then realized that this job was not worth my sanity. The constant micromanaging, pings from managers, unnecessary 1:1s with managers and having them nitpick what you did wrong on a call (when in reality, we were not trained well at all). My stress levels were already high and I knew that this wasn’t the job for me. I’m pretty sure the other positions at Yelp are actually great, but the Account Executive role is literally the bottom of the barrel."

I told her I don’t respond to calls or emails regarding work on the weekends that’s my family time. She didn’t like my response. Personally I already knew by the way she implied some stuff on the phone I wouldn’t work out here. However I still clocked in Monday. 
The job seems great, however it’s 100% cold calling. They make it seem lead base there are no leads. What you are doing is finding qualifying business and reaching out to them, and trying to sell them on yelp premium. However you can be speaking to a non decision maker like a cashier, and still have to bore them on the phone with a script that they almost don’t care about. Personally it has potential but if I was a cashier and someone from yelp called me I’d hang up. But the job doesn’t see that. 

I don’t like the 100% cold calling , and the script is so pushy, I’ve worked sales and basically telling them “ok I understand, but go to your laptop right now and pull up yelp”

I learned a lot about Sales. What drives people to buy. Working a pipeline. Working for a huge corporation. Anyone that can last here has proven they can make the best of a difficult situation. The majority of people I knew were able to transition into another professional job, myself included.","The job itself is brutal. You are held to extremely high expectations and will be very eager at first. But once you stick around long enough you learn that everyone around you that has been in the company long enough has some weird mental complex and is denying the reality of what they really do. You realize how this company really makes money and that there is no true long term vision. In my opinion, the product feels like no better than a lottery ticket for the average consumer and a subscription fee for those who benefit from the platform. The culture is extremely strict and you will feel like an indentured servant at times. If you hate it as much as most people, you don't need to stay longer than six months."

Diversity is honestly pretty good.","Where do I start... Firstly, to be transparent, this is not a customer success position. This is a call center. Majority of your time you will be on an inbound line getting screamed at from business owners due to sales' lack of transparency when selling the product. Once you gain a bit more tenure, you will have OB cases and some chat time to split up the day, but this is not enough. Some are not even given this option. The role should be called Customer service, because clearly they do not know what Customer Success is. The salary is FAR below market value (Average CSM makes $74k, this position started at 40k, as of December starting at 50k) and they will try to sneakily ""give you a market raise"" included in your yearly comp that everyone in the org received. Basically, cheat you out of a performance raise for all of the hard work you've done. 1:1 meetings with your manager can sometimes be very uncomfortable as they try to dive into your life to form trust. You're encouraged to meet high KPI's and move to other roles with no pay increase. I actually believe in the product, but there is a huge disconnect with sales and customer success. Also Yelp needs to realize not every customer is a good fit for the program. They actually know this, but they try to make us use certain language to persuade them into keeping the program. It feels so grimey. (Huge example of this is real estate) When I first started I genuinely enjoyed my job. Until I realized this is just another call center. Honestly, sucks to say. I have found a new place of employment that pays me a fair wage and hopefully this review is considered for improvement."

182,Yelp,Decent 1st Job,2021-12-20,3.0,User Operations Associate,"Yelp is very generous with their benefits as you get them your first day of employment. The people operations team does a great job at making employees feel valued as they send at least one care package every quarter with goodies from minority-owned businesses.

The health insurance coverage is great + they match a certain % of your contributions to your 401K...would highly recommend chipping in a few bucks from your paycheck. 

Remote work also includes a wellness stipend per month that can buy you a nice gym membership. 

They start you at $40,000 which is alright considering how easy and to be honest, mundane content moderation is. They give you a VERY SMALL raise every year which isn't really a raise, just an adjustment for inflation.

Marvin is a great team leader and was ALWAYS readily available to answer any questions and concerns I had. Seriously, I would ping him and he would answer within seconds. Honestly, without Marvin, I feel like my experience as a User Ops Associate would be much worse.","There is zero incentive for associates to do well and it is quite discouraging. The higher-ups preach getting a high quality assessment score and good things will happen. Except there is little to no room for growth within the User Ops department at Yelp. While I understand that it is a small department, not rewarding your best associates isn't a good look and doesn't make them feel valued. Your only way up the ladder is by applying for Team Lead positions which open up MAYBE once or twice per year. Just not worth the wait. 

If you're looking for something easy and money to pay the bills, this will be a great job, however, don't expect much else."

199,Yelp,Truly the best work environment,2021-12-08,5.0,Franchise Account Executive,The culture at Yep is unlike any othe company. When you work at Yelp you learn to live the Yelp values and make a true positive impact in the world. Every connection here matters- from your colleagues to your clients. Every business matters and Yelp understands that its the people behind the business as well as the people they serve that make up this amazing community.,Transitioning to a remote setting challenges all to adapt. Patience is sometimes tested with technical difficulties or problems that are sometimes easier to solve in an office setting. With that being said - Yelp IT goes above and beyond to resolve any technical matters ASAP.
200,Yelp,Yikes,2021-12-08,2.0,Account Executive,"Good benefits, good company culture with lots of people in the 22-29 age group, so if that is you, you will fit right in. Sometimes they will let you leave early if you close deals. Will definitely provide good training and help you build a tough skin and mentality for sales, which is necessary. Will definitely teach you how to learn to love the word ""NO"" Pay is decent once you get promoted a couple times and benefits are very solid.","Good luck selling this product post covid. The management structure is broken. Reps are listening to managers on how to make sales even though those managers haven't picked up a phone in 1-3 years. It got to the point for me where I was hurting WAY more people than I was helping. Once you closed a deal with that account, you were basically told to ignore them if they ever needed help with anything post-sale because the manager/director didn't want to lose that deal. Definitely tons of very sketchy/unethical sales tactics (I.E Getting pushed to get a 15-year-old kid to put his ""debit card"" down on a $500 advertising spend as he is trying to start a business for himself...) Managers/directors will do legitimately whatever it takes to get anyone at the company to put a card down, whether they have the approval or not from the business owner. Definitely a very slimy business model. Also, if your territory sucks, you have no chance. Selling to people in the middle of nowhere who barely even have smartphones, nevertheless Yelp... They will try to tell you territory doesn't matter when as a matter of fact it is crucial to your success. Good luck..."

- Since this is basically a telemarketing position, be prepared to be spoken to very brutally on the phone. It will help you get a tough skin, but it is not for the faint of heart
- It is 100% focused on pushy sales tactics & high volume touch points 
- I have first hand seen some very unethical practices in the offices, some of which were applauded by management. One example would be to lie to a hostess to put their own credit card on the account because their boss told them to...just for a sale.

Yelp truly is a bizzaro world. I've seen poorest performers promoted to a manager position. People with poor work ethics held on the job for no good reason. The critical ratio is such that poor performers can team up and easily squeeze out a high performer for being too annoying. There's no pressure to get anything done on time, so expect endless procrastination covered up by endless pointless meetings. 
The organizational values fluff that you get exposed to as part of company enrollment, doesn't stand the ground in reality, or at least varies greatly by team.
Ever since the company went remote, the moral went down, the communication became toxic and the only thing that's left is politics. Very stuffy atmosphere and no-one seems to be happy anymore."

276,Yelp,Amazing Culture  and Career Opportunities with a few downsides,2021-10-19,4.0,Elite Account Executive,"-Training. Yelp trains you. If you have the grit and tenacity and buy into the ""matter of when"" approach, Yelp gives you skills that other companies want and other companies will poach for. I was a sad restaurant manager in Chicago before I was hired and Yelp's training launched my career, I'll forever be eternally grateful. 

-Culture. The culture has come a long way at Yelp and is one of the most special parts of working there. If you've experienced (or looking to escape) a toxic work environment, Yelp is a breath of fresh air. Hard work and effort are recognized and rewarded with praise and incentives. Managers now have a ton more training and are vetted more than when I joined in 2018. Back in 2018, if you hit consistent numbers (even low consistent numbers at target) and you were a decent person, upper management seemed to promote anyone with numbers and the character with most management training coming on the job. The new managers were training new hires (blind leading the blind) and not everyone was cut out for that kind of on-the-job training, leading to a lot of lost talent. The amount of work and consistency for new managers at Yelp means better Account Executives who are better trained by someone who was trained themselves, not someone winging every second of it. 

-Management. Upper management at Yelp are a special bunch of amazing individuals that I respect and admire, if you work here, get time in their calendars and learn from them. Jeremy the CEO is awesome and he cares, he really does. 

-Time off and career growth. PTO is great, 15 days is super fair and it jumps up to 18 after 2 years. Work ends at 5:30pm (or whenever you work out your schedule). When you put the phone down for the day, you are done. It's a nice feeling. Tons of career opportunities but mostly in sales. Just perform and work hard and do your best to pick out a few potential paths instead of getting complacent and staying in local sales forever. Local is where you start, but I personally feel it should never be where you stay too long

-Benefits are the beez neez. Not just a full benefits package, but nice perks that I'd need a while to list. Talkspace for mental health therapy, professional coaching with Bravely (my favorite perk ever, I need a coach again), perks for parents, etc. Yelp does everything it can to take care of you outside of work.","-Think big picture and long term with your career or you’ll lose yourself in the nature of the job. It can be grueling if you let it get to you (it will get to you). Its sales. I went from being a restaurant manager wanted a drastic change in my life and I got it to launch my career, I’m grateful I did it for 4 years but it took its tool at times. 

-Sick time off. The job is extremely demanding at times and you only get 5 sick/ mental health days total. This is one of the reasons I left. It's 2021, I worked throughout the nightmare that was 2020, 5 days to look after myself if I am sick or just need a day is not enough. It's really not. I worked in every office group expect for the Phoenix office, and in NY I felt a lack of understanding for the importance of mental health days. Many reps on my team did not take them for fear of falling behind or getting challenged by managers, leading to burnout. Taking a mental health day was definitly dependant on your manager. I feel if you’re a veteran, and you perform and hit your numbers, there should be unlimited mental health days. Yelp puts so much effort into taking care of people, give your top people time to rest. 

-Accountability is a bit much (though at the start I wanted it more than anything). As a veteran, you will constantly be checking in with your manager (this is good for hitting metrics and having someone to check on you to help you reach numbers) but sometimes I just want to work and be left alone.

-""stay in your lane"" mentality depending on who your managers and directors are. What I mean by that is that you are a salesperson 1st, your numbers matter more than anything, and then you’re everything else 2nd, 3rd. Hit your numbers (or work your butt off) if you want a voice that makes an impact. It's sales, water separates from oil, it makes sense and it’s probably one of the reasons Yelp has stayed successful but other people who don't hit their numbers are not irrelevant. I am not saying that if you do not hit numbers, you will not be valued as a person, I am saying that if you want to make a meaningful impact, lead roundups, lead, give advice, hit your numbers, otherwise you'll be told to ""stay in your lane."" Again, depends on your manager and director most of the time. This can lead to people tying identities to their numbers, so if you’re having a bad run of a few months, its going to affect your self esteem and confidence until you turn it around, its just the nature of the job.

-Salary. It’s a fun ride chasing the next salary promotion and I saw a considerable quality of life change when I jumped from Account Executive to Senior Account Exectutive. But after Elite AE, the salary hardly jumps (to be fair, by the time you hit Elite, closing is a lot easier so you will make more commission). After 5 years at yelp your salary grows by a few percentages, but not as much as jumping to another company and growing your salary by 10-20k with still commission to be earned. Thats why I suggest that you choose a direction you want to run in within your first year, DO NOT get complacent and comfortable in local sales. Although jumping into Local Client Partner and Managment, the salary does not jump at first either, which was a HUGE frustration for me. Management salary grows quickly with performance and the skills you learn on the job or 2nd to none, you just have to want it bad cause it wont pay that well when you start out. Local Client partner (the department where you upsell) is supposed to be a promotion but without a salary bump, I didn’t see the incentive to join (higher commission structure in LCP though)."

If you’re a sociopath who doesn’t care about harassing a business owner no matter how many times they beg you to stop calling until they cave in and buy the ads, you may have a fairly successful future here. If you’re young and still trying to find yourself, this is not a bad start.","You’re literally harassing business owners until they buy Yelps questionable ads. Hardly anyone in management is living in reality and you will be to blame when the business owner hangs up on you or curses you out because of the dozens of account executives who have called your territory prior and burnt all of the leads from not delivering on ad promises or just because of the straight up harassment, lack of respect and lies, they ask to be put on the do not call list, and you’ll get their lead again regardless of if you do it, and when you mention it to your manager that they’ve requested it, they’ll say to pass the lead onto someone else because maybe a new voice will make the irate business owner change their mind. If you can look past that, your success also depends on whether or not your manager likes you because if they don’t, they’ll sabotage your sales calls and try to pit your pod-mates against you. If you have any problems and are seeking out genuine advice get ready for the “you’re just not being positive enough,” until your head is spinning. If you want success here you’ll have to drink the kool-aide of fake positivity.

- You are worthless if you aren't closing deals. I mean...WORTHLESS. I would constantly have to remind myself that I'm worth so much more than this job almost on a daily basis. 

- A bit cult like. No one likes being there ,but the managers spend way too much time trying to convince employees the job doesn't suck. 

- base pay is not even livable. 

- Yelp wasn't transparent about the commission structure, so I'll put it here: you have to sell $12,000 in ads PER MONTH before you get commission. On top of that, you only make $130 off of $12,000 worth of sales. I hope this puts things in perspective."

-gas lighting: I was once told I was ""dial padding"" and ""stealing from the company"" to try and motivate me to perform better because I was in a sales slump
-they changed around the territory distribution from zip codes to regions. I did significantly worse with the regions than the zip codes.
-lots of favoritism with managers, directors, and peers: some peers of mine were given extra accounts that had a high chance of closing because the manager or director liked them. PLEASE MAKE THIS MORE FAIR!!!
-managers are EXTREMELY inexperienced and DESPERATELY need more training (I know you're reading this Yelp HR so please take note to train your managers better to actually help your sales reps).
-There is technically a contract that the business owners are in and many of them end up cancelling the product before giving it a fair shot. I think business owners need to see the longevity of Yelp. 
-Chargebacks ie commissions taken away because businesses cancelled too quickly.
-High Cost Per Click for businesses, especially in construction. You can't actually justify it, especially when you compare with other competitors like FaceBook or Google.

Salary is alright, not exactly competitive but becomes competitive if you stay there for 2 years+. The insane turnover rate was uninspiring, one day you'd walk in to a new teammate because, ""Bob quit via email last night. Here's your new teammate Tom. Let's hit the phones!"" During my tenure I witnessed people quit via text, walk out at lunch, leave notes on desks, and just not show up. The nonstop BLARING of America's Top 40 Pop Hits, I believe mentioned in several other reviews, is enough to make you never want to listen to music again. But it wasn't the next-level micromanaging, anxiety attacks, ""sick beer kegs in the office"", impractical daily metrics, or constant verbal abuse over the phone from business owners that really drove me out of there. One of my teammates and myself witnessed an incident where a teammate (who had previously had several 'incidences' that resulted in zero disciplinary action) said some incredibly vulgar things to my manager that created a very uncomfortable and hostile work environment. Once again, no disciplinary action, so the witnessing teammate and myself took the issue to HR. HR asked us to recap the entire scenario, vulgar words and all, which was uncomfortable for the two of us, but in the end it was his word against ours, and no disciplinary action was taken. My teammate quit the following day and myself not far behind her."

They micro manage every single thing you do every minute of the day. Do not care about the quality/outcome of the calls, just the metrics
-the whole company is running a scam. All of the managers/reps that did well end up being part of the pyramid scheme. They have you lie to customers on the phone just so you make a sale. Do not value the hardworking/honest reps just the ones that will do anything it takes to get a sale.

-employee experience very much based on team/org"
517,Yelp,Looks good on paper,2021-06-07,2.0,Account Executive,"-Opportunity to work at your own pace (with the right manager), basically unbothered as long as you're pacing to quota/target
-Benefits (health insurance, mental wellness, PTO, etc) is incomparable. I've never seen such great benefits with any company, ever.
-Work Remote during pandemic","-They did a really good job at selling this ""dream"" job on day one of training. ""you could make $100,000!"" but what they don't say is that it could take YEARS to finally make that much with their tiered pay scale and BONUS scale. 
-That's right, BONUS. They describe this as a commission opportunity, but that is not the case. You must sell at least $12,000 (an average of about 4 sales) before you are ""paid out"" that month. You do not get paid out on that first $12K, it is only on whatever you sell after that threshold is met. 
-The starting salary of $37,000/year is LAUGHABLE. It does not matter what level of sales experience you have, everyone starts at that amount. Then, as you hit certain dollar milestones, your title changes and base salary increases.
-Made you feel like you were ""chosen"" for this role, that it was SO SPECIAL to work for Yelp, and they only choose TOP TIER candidates, however, anyone with half a brain can do this job. Personally, coming from a previous sales role with 10+ years of experience, this is for the birds.
-80+ dials a day... because NO ONE PICKS UP THE PHONE. With today's technology, business owners KNOW it's Yelp calling, whether its a Telemarketer or Spam alert showing when we call. These people have been called to death. 
- Hard to reason with management when you explain why a biz owner says ""No"". They do not accept No for an answer from you or biz owner. When in reality, we are calling on small biz owners to buy advertising when NO ONE IS EVEN SPENDING MONEY during a pandemic. How can we ask these people to advertise when there are no viable consumers to advertise to? Felt like there was zero human compassion. It was always ""there is a solution to them saying no, keep pushing""
-The ""keep pushing"" felt fored and uncomfortable, asking people to spend money on advertising that I felt won't work
-Entire organization and process feels like a well disguised pyramid scheme. You get hired as an account executive onto someone's team. As far as I could see, there was 10-13 people on a team, plus a manager, 8-9 teams per Local Sales Director, than 3-4 Local Sales Directors per ""floor"" and what I'm assuming is another 3-4 ""floors"" within the company. They hire 50 people a month in a training class, So you do the math on this. They clearly know people don't last long in this job. You start out and once you hit a certain sales amount and time with company, you can become a manager of one of these teams, and you are no longer selling, only managing sellers. So basically, like an MLM or pyramid scheme, you are building a team under you to do the work and sell and you collect bonuses off of their sales. 
-MEETINGS - I will never understand how you are supposed to hit daily goals of 80 dials, 2 hours of talk time, 3-4 pitches and 1 sale if you are in 3-4 meetings a day. Blows my mind.
-The biggest problem for me, and the reason I left and had trouble with the job is to fold:
1. I don't believe in the product or process. If 30% of businesses on Yelp pay for advertising, how can you guarantee a certain level of exposure? At some point so many businesses will be paying for advertising, that some will get more than the others. And personally as a consumer, I NEVER select paid advertisers, I feel that paying to be seen screams that your business is subpar. Call me old school, but word of mouth speaks louder than paid advertising on a review based website.
And 2. I felt worthless while working here. My sales skills and experience were not utilized. My education and work experience was a waste here. I felt like I wasn't fulfilled and that I wasn't providing anyone with a stellar product or service. Like I said earlier, anyone with half a brain can do this job as long as you have wifi and can click buttons."

I like working with local businesses and helping them. I like how the commission structure clearly states how much money you can make. I struggled at first but after a few years I was making more money than all the people my age at a job where I could leave at 5:30 with no stress. I personally like structure and routine. I also like knowing exact metrics needed to succeed. If you are determined and work hard the sky is the limit for you. I stayed in the account executive role and was making six figures easily. I had the opportunity to be on the landing team in the Washington dc office. Personally I think the account executive role is the best job in the company..

557,Yelp,Morally Bankrupt Company,2021-05-19,1.0,Marketing Consultant,"The co-workers might make this place more tolerable, but even that is waning. We all sound as exhausted as each other when answering the phone to customers in our 'marketing consultant' aka Sales roles. 

The biggest pro about working here is learning more about small businesses and how they tick, which I get through talking to biz owners and clients on the phone. I ask them questions and get a genuine feel for how they operate. It gives me the get up and go to maybe start my own business one day. I just wouldnt want that business on Yelp.

That's about it.","How the CEO (jeremy) of this place hasn't been jailed by now for running such a morally corrupt business is beyond me. Yelp's revenue is through ad dollars from the many small businesses that use it, yet time and time again, the company takes such a high horse view point when dealing with it's customers. ""Our way, or the highway"". I get cussed out and screamed at by small businesses that have been destroyed by this company. Yelp's perspective? ""We don't want their business."" I genuinely feel for some of the horror stories that this company has inflicted on people just trying to make a living. My co-workers have had clients call in tears, I've had biz owners screaming at me because some previous sales person lied just to get a deal. 
You'll get screamed at by your manager, who usually is the epitome of a grocery store manager (i.e. sudden power trip and here comes the ego). When covid hit, things got worse. Yelp lost a ton of clients and whilst you'd think the pressure would be relieved, it got worse. Having to deal with that pressure whilst also dealing with a pandemic - well you can imagine what people were saying when I'd cold call them.

My other con is the morals of this firm. 
If a member of the public leaves a review which falsely tears into a business, in my moral opinion, the company has every right to fight to defend their livelihood. Not according to us - more recently it was announced we'd be placing stickers on biz owners pages, letting them know that they sued a customer because they wrote a false review.

Overall, I'm here until I move on to something better, like I said above, the one main pro here is that I get to learn more about business through people I talk to."

- You make 80 cold calls a day to small business owners who get called every 2 weeks by Yelp account executives.
- When the business owners say they're not interested, you need to argue and keep them on the phone 5 times before you are allowed to hang up. (Yes, this does make them very angry and yell at you).
- Territories are completely unfair and they are the #1 factor to determine how much revenue you will produce. Although management will embarrass you and say you're not pushing hard enough on the phone.
- You will feel extremely guilty signing up naive small town business owners for a product that only works in cities for certain industries.
- If the person you call says they are driving you are expected to tell them to PULL OVER to open up Yelp on their phone and speak to you. (I wish this was a joke!)
- It was the worst period of my life. Please don't let the flashy ""Yelp"" name lure you if you're a college student unless being pushy and unethical sales tactics don't bother you."

The Ad's are not that expensive and the caliber of business owner's you're calling does NOT want to sign up.

You will meet some good people over all. Everyone has their own little hustle. Yelp people always network.","Traditional sales org bs. You will have to navigate immature micromanaged leadership. You will live in a constant stress and doom of losing your job (even when you’re doing good). They give you so much “free stuff” and “perks” because the job it’s self it monotonous. You’re encouraged to harass local business owners in the name of being “tenacious” “being persistent” and “having grit”. Product does not work for majority of business unless they are spending big bucks. For me it was the lack of morality over all; management, sales tactics, essentially “motivating” you with  “perks” and “money” that cause me to leave. The stress isn’t worth it."

- Companies HATE Yelp, you will deal with lots of extremely angry business owners who won’t even let you talk because of past terrible experiences with Yelp
- Lots of unethical sales practices and those who make the most money are the ones breaking all the rules
- Compensation is pretty horrible and you don’t start making commission until after you sell a big chunk. It takes most people 2 months before they’re even eligible for commission.
- Your commission will rely heavily on which territory you get and how many new businesses you get, in which you have no say.
- Micromanagement is a real problem. Expect to be hounded every minute of every day, even if you’re doing really well."
660,Yelp,The Closest Thing to a Legal Sweatshop,2021-04-07,1.0,Customer Success Manager,"Good food, lots of food, and I was lucky that my coworkers were cool. They also said that there were opportunities for career advancement, and I was a top performer, but I never saw any opportunities.","Literally, everything else is a con. You're expected to be on the phone for 8 full hours, being harassed and slandered by Yelp's customers, without any tools that can actually help you address their situation. Not to mention your manager will probably encourage you to be super vulnerable and get very very personal and deep into your life, break you down, and give you no tools to build yourself back up. They just want you to trust them so that you will be dependent. 
Not to mention, this role is advertised as a ""marketing consultant for small business owners"" but don't let that fool you into thinking it is anything other than a call center for customer service. If you work in customer service and you like it, this would be a great role for you. HOWEVER, if you work in marketing this is NOT a job for you, even if the job description says it is. It WILL set your career back and the only thing you'll have to show for it is the word 'Yelp' on your resume. Nothing more."
661,Yelp,Get rich quick scheme and not a lot are successful,2021-04-07,3.0,Account Executive,"team oriented, flexible schedule if anything personal happens, great benefits and perks.","I-T is a joke. had to have 3 computers shipped to me because they reuse old laptops and they were all messed up. They give you bad computers for the amount of work and tech that is involved with the job. The account executive role is a glorified telemarketer- you are nothing more and your job is to just push and make a sale. It is so frustrating when your manager is ""barging"" in on your pitch making you confused on what to say while you're trying to talk to a potential client. 

I was on the local sales team meaning that i was calling very small ma and pa businesses trying to convince these business owners to spend upwards of $350 a month on an idea that's not guaranteed to work. I couldn't get behind it and it became increasingly hard to try and sell an idea that you just don't believe in. 

80+ dials a day with a minimum of 2 hours of talk time is what is expected, but that's a lot to ask for- especially for an unseasoned salesperson. The training was minimal with only 7 full days of training before getting on the phones, but the training had little to do with what to fully expect and how to handle and problem solve. Yes, there were on going trainings after the first full week, but by then most of the training class had already figured out what to do before said training even happened because we didn't have any other choice. 

idk. this is a job targeted at the desperate and newly graduated college students who want to start making money. THIS IS A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME AND NOT A LOT ARE SUCCESSFUL."

Since moving on to a more professional and autonomous sales role, the constant micromanaging of Yelp’s call center has made me a consistent top performer because I get an anxiety attack if I’m not constantly working. Take from that what you will.","Yelp wasn’t the best place to work in office but once the company went fully remote it because a dystopian nightmare. Before I left the company there was a relentless pressure for sales reps to sell ads to struggling small businesses (whether or not the needed ads) under the assumption that if no one was searching / clicking on their ad that the client would never spend their entire month’s budget. We all know what’s said about assumptions — regardless of search traffic, all budgets were fulfilled by Yelp’s magic “algorithm” by the end of the month. Once all of these at will advertisers cancelled (rightfully so), Yelp decided to start charging back their own employees to make up the difference. I know dozens of people who where told they were now thousands of dollars in the hole to Yelp due to the company’s own shady and immoral sales practices. When these concerns were raised with management, sales reps were either told to sell more to break even or outright blamed for the terrible practices enforced and encouraged by their managers and directors. Since I left, the majority of real talent in the DC office has made their exit as well - if you’re a true sales professional, take my advice and stay far away from this sham of a company."

You might have to video chat with random reps from the office if your team/floor isn’t producing. They say it’s to “bring the office culture to work from home” but it only happens when you aren’t “producing.” There are several articles written about Yelp’s culture but management brushes it under the rug and says it’s not true.

Two out of the FIVE managers I had were actually good people and good to work for.","During my time at Yelp  I reported Sexual Harassment that wasn't taken seriously because I was male. I reported direct discrimination because I was not heterosexual, no HR personel spoke to me or showed any kind of concern and I had to continue working near the aggressor.  I also had to report my final manager for being unprofessional and rude and condescending. I was spoken to in a demeaning and condescending manor and spoke directly to the issue to this manager and HR. NOTHING WAS DONE. 
The expectations are unreasonable and you are meant to submit to the brainwashing and bust your behind to get superficial things such as a bigger computer or a standing desk that other companies give you from the get go. 

 This complex pyramid scheme employment was one of the worst experiences of my professional career and I tried very hard and actually was top of my training class month one. So don't be fooled. Its a big game and if you're willing to play with peoples wallets then this is the place for you. 

Human Resources should hang a sign on their door, ""Company Resources"" they aren't there for you. They are there to get you to sign the NDA's and give you the taxed $500 check so that when they fire you it feels like they have done something for you. 

The only thing that Yelp did for me professionally was show me that company's really don't care about people at all and that they really just want to pad their pockets and make sure they LOOK good. I did not sign the NDA, I did not answer any of their intrusive questions they expect you to when you leave. Definitely not a 5 star career."

Overall, I would say the young culture is something that was very fun at the job. Yelp did a good job of having a very diverse working staff. Since I was right out of college, I fit right in. 

I think the best learning experiences were from making calls themselves, however, the training program made sure we had a solid foundation. It did not teach us everything, but I can say it made us ready. 

If your manager cares about you, then the way they structure the teams/salesfloor is great. There are different teams within different regions and this allows for more dedicated talks for managers and team members.","- Work was very routine 
- Strict work hours
- No room for leeway for anything (doctor appts, etc)
- No real opportunities to promote

They have transparent salary bands, equal pay at each level regardless of gender/gender identification, great benefits and sales incentives. While some of the new grads probably take all of this for granted, I appreciated that managers were tasked to see their teams succeed and would invest their time to coach sales people to improve their skills and find their voice. The tools provided were top notch (using Salesforce tools). IT support was great and I noticed employees in other departments were very happy and passionate about their work. This was such a diverse place to work and I've made some lifelong friends there.",Sales is incredibly demanding and high-paced. One could burn out quickly if not made for this type of job.

They get away with defacing, ruining, and overall not respecting the office. They're no consequences to behavioral shortcomings. Another concern is the HR team being incompetent. When going to HR for guidance with solving any issues that may arise, they more than often offer little to no support. I've been to every Yelp office and come to the conclusion that management is terrible and undertrained."

-Territory luck(If your territory is a major urban area where there are simply more yelp users, it will be easier to convince business owners to buy ads. Management will say that no matter where your territory is, you can make 40K in revenue monthly, but that's simply just not true, and they know it too.)

918,Yelp,"So complex a lot of good people, terrible job, and some really bad management",2021-01-15,2.0,Account Executive,There are a lot of good people who are mainly AES that work at Yelp and genuinely care about you and want to help in any way. It is nice to be in an environment and culture that is more free with no forced suit and tie attached.  Below I had to censor names and how I really feel but just know there’s a reason Yelp is so massively disliked and has such high turnover. So many employees past and present are right in their negative feedback for it and if you’ve worked at yelp as only a rep you’ll most likely agree.,God where do I start? How much time you guys have?! Well the job itself will make you unhappy. Seriously damaging to your self worth getting rejected every day trying to sell a product to a vast majority of clientele that understandably dislikes Yelp. Yelp is has lied  of being to business owners with reps who cheat to close. Plenty of top reps get praise from office head directors like  but it so fake and circumstantial. Most cheat like a guy who was fired for cheating . Of course plenty of people kissed his behind because he was closing 70k a month but CHEATING.!!! Directors would also use him as an example to stop complaining and close more. Just made her look bad once he was exposed for cheating by another rep and fired. Some managers are good but some are grossly overrated whose own reps have had to pull them into a meeting to tell them they are not managing their own team well. A managers true ability is measured by what their reps think of them. Some managers have the maturity of a toddler and too emotional to manage. They micromanages at best and just takes up space at worst. One manger I knew  is very fake nice and talks tons of crap about reps they  don’t  like. It’s funnier because most of their reps don’t like or respect them at all as a person not even a manager. I’ve witnessed plenty who also are nice to face and I have to censor my language for Glassdoor but lets say are not fond of  them behind closed doors. The culture at yelp can also be weird and cult like. They want you feel like it’s the best place in the world to work and you’re lucky to be there but it’s really just a nice crash course in sales. Unless you’re a top rep and I mean booking at least 50k a month consistently then working there is a waste of time past a few years.  An old coworker at Yelp best described it as a daycare. The job is just toxic to anyone’s mental health after George Floyd died and covid happens with massive layoff were told to just close and get over it. It’s really a company for immature kids who act like they’re in middle school and people who are trapped in a role they don’t want. Don’t get me wrong some people are great that work there and do great work and enjoy yelp and kudos god bless them. But the vast majority of employees at least 90% are waiting for the day to finally escape. Best of luck to any new people starting at yelp. Give it a year or two before you either want out  or are apart of the rare 1% that is a top producer and stays since many top producers move on to better and more professional sales roles.

When in the office you will meet great friends that will get you through the hard parts of the job.,"At times, there is almost a culture that tries to entice you to believe there are not better positions that will accommodate your skills. Monthly quotas remained the same throughout the pandemic and in April at the snap of your fingers you were either still an employee, fired, or furloughed. No prior notice.

The hours are great, the perks are good, and the fact they won’t let you do overtime except one week a month is actually a nice change for sales. The PTO is also great.","I had 6 managers in 2 years and half were terrible bullies. The management isn’t taught proper management techniques and are promoted based more on their sales acumen than their people skills, but sales skills don’t directly translate to managing a team of 6-12 people. Only in the last few months I worked there did I see any effort in transparency about how to escalate to HR, and reporting harassment to management does nothing- one of my managers told me he liked seeing me cry and when I escalated to his director I was transferred from his team but he didn’t even get a slap on the wrist.

Everyone will tell you the commission is good but as someone who has been in sales for years I can tell you it isn’t. It’s about 1% when you actually do the math.

There is zero customer discrepancy. If they have a yelp page you will call them 10+ times even if they’re a business that wouldn’t benefit from yelp advertising like a spot welder or in an area that it doesn’t make sense.

The culture pre-covid was very fratty and everyone went out drinking after work a lot which if you don’t drink is a bad atmosphere.

The base salary is actually pretty low for the commission being what it is and with the threshold it has. I’ve heard of reps in the more expensive cities struggling to pay rent month to month. That’s an issue in a lot of sales jobs but at least most of them either have a higher base and a threshold commission or a low base and you make commission on everything. One or the other."

1056,Yelp,Don’t do it!!!,2020-11-10,1.0,Junior Account Executive,There are definitely some pros to work here. I would say the biggest one are co-workers. A lot of the account executives are really cool and genuine people. I would say the benefits and health package is an also added bonus but there are caveats to this as I will explain in the cons.,"Hopefully I will have enough space her to air my grievances with this company. First off - before applying to these positions, please read the recent business insider articles which detail things that are 100% accurate. Yelp account executives are pushed to contact business owner’s to the point of border-line harassment. In addition, we ARE told to have business owner’s pull over if they’re driving. 
My second point: managers will pretend to show interest in you and your why so they can throw it back in your face when you tell them you are on the verge of quitting. My “why” was used against me plenty of times. Once you’re no longer on that team, the likelihood of hearing from them is pretty slim.
Third point: Sure, they may provide a decent benefits package but actually using any sick time or vacation time is discouraged. For example, I haven’t used any of my sick time and the one time I was hurling my guts up my manager questioned me and I felt guilty taking the day to recuperate. If you take vacation time, this doesn’t affect your quota you have to hit for the month. You still have to hit your number regardless!
My fourth point: the leads are garbage. Like I mentioned already, these connections have been burned already with a majority of business owners. If you look at all the past notes you will see when a business owner signed up in the past. I can’t blame a business owner when they’ve given yelp 1 or 2 shots and they ended up losing money. An example of this is is in their current advertisements on Facebook and Instagram. How desperate to have to advertise on a competitor’s site!!!! All of the comments are awful as well.
I think this may be my fifth point: I don’t appreciate the way Yelp layed off tons of people and then a couple months later hired for remote. I think that’s a huge slap in the face to all those people who quit their jobs at the time and gave Yelp a shot for a career. Let me get one thing straight- the likelihood of making this a “career” is slim unless you’re in the “in crowd”.
My last point: this company pretends to really “care” about your well-being but they are just a machine that grinds you up and spits you out when it’s convenient for them. It’s pitiful that I have honestly worked here this long."

It's doable with my full-time job as a mom of 4 but allows me to use my personal skills and talents.,I feel like we as CA are asked to do almost the same amount of workload as a CM market except we are asked to do it in a fraction of the time and a fraction of the pay. My market is large and sometimes I feel like we are expected to do more than we have time for and we are currently not allowed to work overtime. Makes it really difficult to be successful in our markets and feel valued.

AI driven leads vetted for you, data on the biz and marketplace, ability to see what the client sees, scripts, live streams of successful reps, commission sheets, promotion rubrics, etc. Everything is given to you. You then have to go out and use it to your advantage
- A ton of support from leadership. Whether its personal matters outside of work, you need help closing a deal, or you want to pivot to another department you will have supportive managers and directors. 
- Benefits - Great for parents, great for short term (stocks), and great for long term (401k 3% match)

1131,Yelp,An honest of my time working here -  Interesting experience,2020-09-24,2.0,Account Executive,"Meet new people, Get some experience, Training","- Clique Culture
- Tough management 
- You can’t say this on the phone (unless it closes the deal)
-When in doubt none of the higher management is wrong and it's just your bad mindset

Yelp was an interesting place to start my post college professional career. Most people that worked there were friendly so it was nice to make new connections/friends. You start in training for 2 months which is a great ramp up to your quota. As the months go on you begin to feel more pressure for hitting your number and so on (but that's natural in any sales job). The interesting part about Yelp is that in a place that preaches positive mindset (and I mean PREACHES) you’re really only allowed to have one if you're putting up numbers. 

When things get tough it “isn’t anything but a bad mindset”. If you’re going to work at Yelp just get used to the phrase “It’s just your mindset” because when things get tough no manager is going to try to really figure stuff out for you past a call listening. They will tell you that you have a negative mindset and the meeting will change from one that was about sales development to on that is about your mindset. Best of luck with those conversations because they usually leave you with a more frustrated outlook on the job then you started with. 

Management is usually around 25+ which is great for anyone interested in moving up quickly but it can cause issues when the managers themselves aren't always equipped to take on these teams. I’ve been in multiple meetings with both of my managers where they openly complained about people on our team to me (a rep on the team). The reason I bring up those kinds of conversations is because it’s a clear example of immaturity in the workplace. I won’t sit here saying I’m a management guru but management 101 probably has a part in there about not talking behind the backs of reps to other reps. It created a strange toxic environment that people were looking over their shoulder to see who was getting brought into what meeting (to know if they were a favorite or not) and so on. I remember a solid 4 month stretch (Oct. – Jan.) where my team had been struggling. Now during one of the harder times of the year to sell, my manager and all higher management decided to act like this was not an issue to our business and in fact we as reps just “had a bad mindset”. I remember sitting in meetings with my manager that brought no new sales techniques to the table but instead were meant to come down on everyone on the team. When things didn’t go well with that type of meeting (because how could anyone not love negative reinforcement) my manager then tried the old “I don’t care anymore because you guys don’t care” approach and spent time in meeting rooms on their own like a spoil kid who didn’t get the present they wanted. This carried on every month like clockwork as our team continued to fail month over month. Every month started with our manager saying “I have a whole new management style this month you guys & we are going to do great” and halfway through the month those absurdly negative meetings started to happen. Ending the month with the same “I don’t care anymore” types of actions (we can appreciate consistency).

Now I understand that you have to do some of these types of things as a manager to “rally the troops” but these were obvious indications of terrible management. I also will say that not all manager were the same because I have met some extremely great ones while working at Yelp. I just want to give a cautionary tale to anyone that starts working there that you are allowed to switch teams and if you feel like your manager isn’t a correct fit, you should weigh your options and make the best choice for yourself. 

While it may seem that all my experiences were negative here, they weren’t. I met great people and made some friendships but in the end of the day I walked away most days saying “this place cannot be a real office”. I waiting sometimes for Ashton Kutcher to walk out and say “You just got punk’d”” at how some people operated here. I learned some tools about sales but I learned more about management styles, cultures, and sleazy sales techniques that I will never use or prefer to be around. But hey there is always free goldfish so that’s a plus."

* Challenging problems to solve. The work is hard, and Yelp Engineering is constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
* Good work-life balance. There's no expectation that you work long hours or work on weekends, in fact it's actively discouraged. Management is very understanding of family needs and personal needs as well.
* Trustworthy, transparent leadership. The leaders at Yelp have to make a lot of hard decisions, but when those decisions are made it's communicated clearly and with authenticity.
* Remote-friendly. The company has been vastly expanding its resources for remote employees, and it has a good culture of communication to support remote employees.","* The stock price
* Salary is probably not competitive with some of the bigger companies in the industry
* Yelp is still going through a lot of growing pains as a company in terms of processes, structure, and scale."

If you end up with a not so great manager, you could be on your way to getting fired just as soon as you get there. Can be a clique like environment. Not enough sick days/personal days to use for an office of over 300 people. This is also a very emotionally demanding job so beware. Selling style is extremely aggressive."
1152,Yelp,Good,2020-09-14,3.0,Web Developer,Get to gain good experience,Not much pros i can think off
1153,Yelp,Basically Sales Training,2020-09-13,3.0,Account Executive,"Pros- One of the pros of this job is that they truly do have a great understanding of the sales process in training. Other reviews here will definitely make comments about how hard it is to sell the product (which is 100% accurate), but the foundational sales knowledge that you will need to succeed is found in training. Properly qualifying leads, what objections are and how to overcome them, building value both at the prospect's level and then value within your own product.

- Once covid hit, you could work from home, which was pretty okay all things considered, and they still seem to be following that model and are comfortable with it
- For what it's worth, you will bond with your team. I still communicate with some of my former team members and even recommended one of them to my new employer and continue to work with him
-Using the same approach taught and focused on by Yelp, I've become extremely and immediately successful at the next role in sales I moved on to. This is a great place to go if you're starting a job in sales. It's not anything you should stay at longer than a year, but if you can sell someone on Yelp without lying, you can literally sell anything
-Was never asked to stay late or work more (some reviews have that as the case but I personally never experienced that)
-Occasional work outings to Old Town, which wass a fun novelty, but Old Town is closed now soooooo","- The music. Oh my god switch it up every once in a while. They literally play the same edm/house playlist you would hear at Club Maya or Bottled Blonde on the weekends, and it's so annoying when you're trying to focus on what you're doing (mostly because what I'm doing isn't slamming back whiskey cokes and shooting the breeze, it's trying to make a living)
- Commission structure is very very bad. 30k in sales to qualify, 53% tax on your commission, have to at least hit 12k, and it's extremely difficult to sell the product. It's a great way for them to generate revenue for the company off of your effort. Worst part, if someone cancels their campaign within 6 months, Yelp can take back that commission.
-Full healthcare coverage and a gym allowance are great perks for people who don't have ready access to that stuff, but the compensation is honestly garbage. Expect to make no more than $35k/year in your base because the commission is non-existent. You need to do~$35-40k a period to see good returns (about double the quota for a regular rep). 
- Very ""drank the Kool-Aid"" mentality from management, but that's totally necessary given how far the product has fallen out of public favor as of late. They preach that you are saving people's businesses and livelihoods, however it's really not that hard to figure out that a paint store in nowheresville oklahoma has absolutely no budget or ability to make money from advertising, simply because no one actually uses the platform in small towns. I had a few business owners tell me that they've used Yelp in the past and that their advertisement budgets were always completely consumed (which doesn't makes sense when you look at the cost per click and traffic on almost all of your leads)
- The product is hot garbage for anyone not actually in the niche industries such as restaurants/plumbing etc.
-Everyone hates you. Unless they're completely clueless and from a small town, or are new to being a business owner, they hate you. The only saving grace is that *technically* in theory any business can benefit from advertising.
- The territories are garbage. My first two weeks were literally spent updating the DNC list/ marking businesses as out of business. Somehow salesforce was still generating these leads. Imagine having a quota and ~30% of the businesses you're calling haven't actually been in business for 2 years"

We were required to show up extremely early and stay extremely late to get things done. I would often get criticized for using PTO or sick days, even though I never went over my allotted balance. The expectations as a manager were extremely unrealistic, and the compensation definitely made it not worth it. If you have sales experience, I highly recommend that you DO NOT work here. You will be brain washed, with upper management telling you to blame everything on yourself and that everything that goes wrong is your own fault. They don't care about their people, not one bit.

-if you can't focus on your own grass, you will get annoyed seeing the greener grass from other tech companies lol. I don't even care about free meals, but I wish the pay was more up to par

While kegs and games are fun, what is way more important to employees is some degree of autonomy and respect from their managers. The rules were rigid, employees were treated like children, and everyone faced incredible stress. I was a high performer who was promoted multiple times and played by all the Yelp rules. Nonetheless, I was consistently very stressed & not supported. Finally, the lack of diversity amongst senior leadership of the office is deeply troubling. Yelp is a company that touts diversity, but in reality, is all talk. I know Yelp very well from many years there, and would never recommend it."

My team was great. I loved them very much. But management?? What a joke. Asking your manager questions and their response always being “let me get back to you” or “I’m not sure” and then having to constantly remind them you’re waiting for an answer is ridiculous. 

Having people manage that have 1. Never managed. 2. Haven’t even sold the product 3. And when they did sell never hit their number. Is a set up for failure. 

The only people that have gotten promoted are people that are super close to the director and it really shows. 

Now let’s talk about the software. We literally were telling people we didn’t know how the software worked and to just watch the 2 minute video. Where the hell is the transparency???? Pfft.

1266,Yelp,Amazing people / Awful mission statement,2020-06-09,2.0,Account Executive,"To start - I don't want this to look like a full onslaught against Yelp Inc. The company itself has clearly made a name for itself across the restaurant community and as such as been able to expand to other areas as a result. The pro's and con's that I mention in this review don't only cover my own personal experiences at Yelp (as a white male) but also those experiences of individuals that did not have as loud a voice as I.

SO PROS:

THE PEOPLE - not the managers or directors, your actual colleagues, those people that sit directly next to you. Those are the people that care about you and the only ones that ever will. I met people here that will be invited to my wedding but I think that could be said for any work experience so I don't necessarily think this is a positive reflection on Yelp or even their TA team (more on them in cons).

2 MONTH INITIAL TRAINING - there's no other sales company that I know of that provides their new hires with a 2-month long training program. While some of this training is done on the floor and on the phones, if I were to compare this to my other sales experiences, the info and prep you receive is lightyears ahead. (the problem is what happens after training, more in cons).

ORGANIZATION/CRM/PARTNERSHIPS- Yelp has a direct partnership with Salesforce and Workday as well as other pretty reputable names across HR/Sales tech so most of your internal work needs are going to be pretty accurately fulfilled and you shouldn't have much of an issue training yourself up. I was glad that the company had invested so much in other areas beyond just training.","DIVERSITY & INCLUSION - Not long after I left the company , I did some research on Yelp's Diversity & Inclusion head. I was shocked that I had literally never heard their name in my 3 years at the company. I had initially starting hearing about D&I employees right when I left college in 2015 so this isn't a new thing but I had never thought about the fact that they were extremely underrepresented as a dept head at the company.

Go back a few years now, as I began to lean into the job, get better at it and network with my colleagues, I learned that Yelp, like many other entry-level sales companies, had a diversity problem. In my 3 years at the company, there was only 1 non-white director or executive in NYC and while there was a ton of female-representative which I loved there were 0 people of color in leadership positions. This was something that I had personally expressed as a problem to those I felt that I trusted within the company but I never actually made it a point to bring it up as a real issue. To this day, I could tell you that there still isn't a POC (person of color) in a director of sales position at least in NYC (the melting pot of the United States) office. Not only that but there aren't very many in managerial positions either which just doesn't make sense to me when you have a company that's HQ'd in San Fran and literally has a pulse on the demographics of this country. The company needs to make more of a concerted effort to hire poc's. Even the TA team - super white.

HR - over the course of 3 years, I only met one HR rep for the entire NYC office 1k+ people. They didn't have the greatest reputation amongst employees and my experiences with them were basically making appointments to speak with them about very small one-off conversation type of things. In my exit interview, I did not feel as though the grievances and issues I brought up to them actually were heard and I can tell many other people feel this way. There were also rumors and instances of sexual harassment and abuse that would go around the office constantly, none which i knew to be true. I would however, expect that company to directly address rumors like that rather than letting them just subside and the people involved to quit or sue.

Managers - I had my best and worst manager of my sales career at Yelp. It's very hit or miss. There is a leadership training program that all managers must go through now but it truly just seems like a meeting that they use to see who will speak up the most and drinks the most kool aid. Most of my negative convos at Yelp surrounded around my ""why"". (why am I working at an entry level job right out of college in NYC.... like is that really a real question). the problem was I wasn't super forthcoming on my why because my why was to get further in my career and make money, I don't need someone to keep reminding me of that at 23 years old living in my first apartment in the city. Most managers DO NOT CARE about you. They only care about THEIR NUMBER. If there is a team of 12 and you each have a quota, they want to hit whatever it would be if you all hit quota. The problem is, this means that 2-4 people on each team get most of the time with their manager and that leads others to failure. And if they don't care about you, why should you care about your clients? The normal sales cycle is usually about 20 mins on the phone and then never speak with them again. Maybe this is why Yelp has such a bad reputation amongst small business owners.

Jeremy Stoppelman - It's time to stop whining about Google and actually listen to your clients needs. There were so many interesting ideas and things that I would get on the phone from clients that would never ever be considered. Yelp has spent the better part of the last decade obsessing over how Google has overtaken them. Jeremy's literally came out as saying Google wants them to tank. Maybe if you obsessed more with the people that are spending money with you, you'd be more successful in your mission.

Reviews - the whole algorithm is ambiguous and unfair - TELL PEOPLE WHY THEIR REVIEWS ARE BEING REMOVED!"
1267,Yelp,The role has potential. Just know what you're getting into,2020-06-08,3.0,Account Executive,"Industry-leading sales experience- They have been selling the product for so long that they have perfected the sales process (It would be nice if they did this with the product too). You'll become a very good salesperson if you put your head down and put effort into getting better.

Career growth opportunities (not as much of a pro as it used to be)- Used to have many avenues to grow your career (i.e. Management, Restaurants, Enterprise) but they have slowly stopped hiring for various teams (i.e. Franchise) and it's hard to say what the future holds after the massive company changes from Covid-19

Personal Growth- This could vary from person to person because this job is truly what you make of it. You can choose to be that bad employee that sits around all day avoiding work and playing on your phone (which quite frankly is a waste of time considering time is money in sales and you can probably be getting paid more to be a front-desk attendant to do the same thing), or you can actually try and grow as a salesperson and professional. There's nothing more gratifying than having a breakout month or even a good week because you focused on your work and achieved your goals. I've had some great moments like this that I hope I never forget.

Great people- The other reviews aren't lying when they say you will meet great people here. They actually hire you based on your ability to connect with people since you don't need prior experience. It's most likely the reason you'll want to stick it out and stay with the company (pro-tip: this alone is not a good reason to stay at any company. You can leave the company and still remain friends/keep in touch). 

Great office- Absolutely stunning office in NYC right on Madison that spans the whole city block (not very common). They have 3 floors in that building and a new floor in the building across the park above Eataly. There's plenty of space and great amenities such as a Barista that serves whatever type of coffee you want for free. Kitchen stocked with fruit, bagels, and snacks to take advantage of. Beer on tap for after hours... yea it's a cool office

Great benefits- solid Health, Dental, Vision. 401k matching actually got better this past year. Health used to be completely free until they started charging 50/month for it but it's still totally worth it.","*insert obligatory ""Where to begin?""

I'll preface this by saying a lot of these negative reviews are from people (most likely kids fresh out of school) who have very unrealistic expectations about what a sales job entails. ""Having a monthly quota/target"" is not a con with working for Yelp as every sales role has monthly expectations such as these. The same goes for having to cold-call businesses. These are things that were made clear by the recruiters during the interview process and you should not take the job unless you're prepared to deal with such things.

Commission/compensation: This is the primary reason why I don't see a long-term career with the company. All positions from AEs to the director level are severely underpaid compared to the competition. Average to low-performing reps are not making good money and even the top reps that are making good money could be making double at another company. Something to consider when the cost of living in NYC is what it is.

Management- This is such a gamble as your manager will have a very big impact on whether or not you succeed in the role and even get promoted. The training managers are reps that performed well (most of which did so by using misleading language) who are not actually trained on how to manage human beings. Your job as a manager is to use your reps to close deals- that's it. Once you're off their team they will pretend like you don't exist (some are really cool and won't do that but the serious ones that are top managers will do this). A lot of them (not all) will use emotions to manipulate you to work harder/ produce more revenue. I had one manager bring us into a room right before lunch and break down sobbing crying because we didn't reach our goal for the morning.. let that sink in. This is already a stressful job and doing things like this only compound that. The second problem with management is that they don't care about your growth. After a certain point, they stop caring about helping you improve as a rep. They also won't care about helping you get promoted if they already have someone on the team that has a higher potential of getting promoted (most likely from favoritism).

Now keep in mind not every manager is like this, but about 95% are. There are great managers who do a great job of promoting and managing reps but they are few and far between. You can try to request to be on their team but the chances of that actually happening are akin to winning the lottery.

Culture- As others have stated. This place can have a very fratty culture at times. It can change based on which neighborhood you're in but generally there's a large majority of people that are only interested in getting drunk after work and sleeping around. The gossip is insane and if you start seeing or dating someone it quickly becomes public knowledge. It's not uncommon to hear about managers/directors sleeping with reps and in some cases, it's not even a secret! I've met a lot of exceptionally bright people while working here but a lot of them really need to start acting their age."
1268,Yelp,Loved working at Yelp!,2020-06-03,5.0,Account Executive,"Great company culture. I loved working here, awesome snacks","It's not fo someone that wants to idle, you need to abc."
1269,Yelp,Realistically 2 star career,2020-06-01,2.0,Elite Account Executive,Incredible stepping stone for future careers in sales. You'll meet some of the best people at this job and those very relationships are what keep you at this company. The sales training I received here is considered some of the best in the industry and I would do it again for the sales experience & training. Amazing parties & happy hours.,"Where should I begin: 

Just to paint a picture I was with Yelp for 3 years and left prior to the furloughs and layoffs (willingly). Having operated at the very low end of the spectrum in the beginning of my career to someone who was a top producer month after month you have to learn how to play the game. 

Managers will leverage their relationships with you as a means of generating revenue. Once you're off the team/terminated/willingly quit/put your 2 weeks notice in you might as well be dead to them.

The product is antiquated & the short sale is glorified(your account only has to stay advertising for 50~ hours for you to receive commission). Keep in mind the product will not work for 90% of the accounts you sign up, even with proper onboarding. Top producing reps and managers know the perfect verbiage to set poor expectations and get the sale in to make sure that the managers are generating revenue. However managers are not paid on how many of the accounts retain rather % to quota/target and how many reps retain org wide (not accounts). The best managers know how to use sympathy 
( your ""why"")to increase performance. Expect a 1 on 1 with your new manager asking you why you work at yelp and who you do it for so they can use this information against you in the future.

Yelp preaches that it whole heartedly believes in diversity and inclusion.Yelp YoY also publishes a Yelp blog regarding diversity and yet the numbers reflect a disparity in African American/minority hires into management/leadership or rather the lack thereof since 2014. Something I noticed as well that Yelp will not promote top producing bilingual AE's as a means of keeping them in their chairs to produce revenue. They will however play favorites and put reps who brown nose effectively and may not necessarily have the best sales skills/ social skills & consistently look like (have similar backgrounds & literally look like) the directors and office heads across the org. Those who succeed have a strong drink the kool-aid mentality. The best brown-nosers get the best territories which then in turn yields the best revenue and the best opportunity for a promotion as long as you don't fall into the diversity curve(you'll have a harder time trust me). 

The culture which can be seen as a pro to some and a con to others. If you like drinking and blacking out often this is the place for you (perfect for college kids as Yelp is known as college 2.0). If you're even a little strange/socially awkward you will not thrive at this company. 

The Scandals include many managers and directors who were forced to leave due to sleeping with reps to help them with promotions. Sleeping with other people in the office is also frowned upon however the office head is married to the mid market head which makes sense somehow. 

The best reps coincidentally happen to be on their cell phones often to make calls (to use poor language and lie to business owners), then win the trophy and get shouted out by the office head. The following month most of the accounts don't pay and are left on collections. Some reps are very good at using poor language as well as setting good expectations with other accounts to make sure their account retention doesn't go lower than the 8% which is required to not owe money to Yelp as an AE. Some top producing managers also know that their reps are shady selling and turn the other cheek because this means a bigger check for both parties.

During my exit interview all of this was mentioned to the office HR head. She just wrote down notes and after checking in with colleagues months after no changes were ever made."

I don’t even know where to start. Some might think I’m bitter because I got laid off due to COVID. However, I’m honestly blessed because this was 100000% a blessing in disguise. This place is shady, run! You’ll be trained for about two months & I won’t lie, the training is pretty in depth but nothing in the world prepares you for cold calling leads that have been called time and time again. All of your leads are burnt out, you’ll most likely only close new businesses. On the rare occasion that you close a previous advertiser, you’re burning their money, yelp advertising sucks. The cost per click is horrible and I felt terrible selling it. They tell you it’s because it “works”... yeah right. 

The culture is pretty gross. They’ll tell you if you work hard you’ll be a manager but it’s all a favorites game. Bonus points if you sleep with a manager or people in the “cool crowd” — that’s right, there’s a cool crowd LOL. If you’re a skinny cute girl, even more bonus points for you! People here are OBSESSED and brain washed with spending time together. They live together, work together, sleep with each other, vacation together, spend every waking second together. It’s borderline a cult. You’ll hear people joke about drinking the koolaid. They sell you this corny positive story that anxiety is all in your head & not real. 

If you get a job offer, run. They’ll tell you that you have so much money to make (which can be true) but there’s so many rules making it almost impossible to make commission you can actually keep. If an advertiser turns off their ads , you’ll get money taken off your commission check or worse, owe Yelp money. These guys are crooks!

I could go on, but my fingers hurt from typing into the keyboard so aggressively because MAN does this place truly suck... take it from me, run."

- Managers that I've worked with were great at communication. I've never felt like I couldn't tell my managers anything that was on my mind.
- Opportunity to continuously learn since the mantra of ""the only constant is change"". I can easily say to other employers that I know how to successfully sell regardless of any product changes.
- Liberal PTO policy. If you had PTO, you have every right to use it (and your manager shouldn't make you feel bad for using it).
- No one talks about it, but the benefits are SO good. Probably because college grads don't think that health care coverage is super important (especially if they're on their parents' til 26).","- Over-glorified some sales reps because they were the top in booked revenue in a given month. No one talks about how many cancellations or chargebacks those reps got and it diminished the quality of the deals that some reps with integrity sold.
- Promoted reps to managers poorly. I'm sorry, but promoting a 22 year old who sold record breaking sales in 6 consecutive months (which was also their tenure) is NOT a trait that proves success in a manager role.
- You do have to sell a little bit of your soul to be successful in the sales role. There will be times that you hear a genuine ""no"" that disqualifies a business owner from buying ads, but some managers will disregard that and puppeteer you to say some aggressive things.
- Upper upper management teaches lower management to put out the fires so they don't have to deal with it. I was lucky and was able to talk to my managers and directors openly, but if I had an idea to go beyond that, they wouldn't do anything to follow up."

Great co-worker culture! Each team is truly a team.","Unfortunately, the leaders that want to truly see you succeed and grow are a needle in a haystack. Most value their few top performers, constantly highlight them and their wins, and many are left to the side to fend for themselves. A lot of sneakiness in the managerial scene -- playing favorites, sending top accounts to the favorites and really just boosting them up while others begin to fall behind. Very competitive atmosphere, which is great at times, but very discouraging for many."

1288,Yelp,Account Executive (San Francisco),2020-05-14,4.0,Account Executive,"I started at Yelp fresh out of college and was there for about two years. Despite what you hear or have heard about working here as an AE, given the stage of life I was in, I was fortunate enough to receive the best opportunity I could have ever asked for. The leadership I received was special. The managers, directors, and head of office genuinely cared about my development as a person in and out of the office. The culture is strong and unique. The friendships I developed and grown over my time at Yelp will be friends for life. 

At the same time this is a role you get what you put into. I know this sounds cliche, but truthfully, if you are consistently transparent with leadership about your growth as a sales professional, you will see yourself grow. Looking back at that first day in 55, I would have never imagined I would be where I am today. There will always be times when you hit a low in your sales month or just in life, but if you let them, the people here will always be there to pick you back up and teach you how to pull yourself up. 

I am appreciative for my time at Yelp and thankful to all those who took the time to truly invest in me as a person.","Of course with every company there are cons. Yes, the base salary is low for San Francisco especially first starting out. With that being said, by hitting your number and more, the commission can be great. Additionally, I am one of those weird people who is happy with an average pay as long as I enjoy the those around me. 

Fortunately, I did leave Yelp before the COVID 19 layoffs hit. However, my star rating went from 5 stars to 4 stars after hearing about this experience so many of my former co workers faced. A job truly becomes a challenge every single day when you can't trust who's in management.Thankfully, I was in a position where I trusted everyone in leadership. However, I don't blame those who are skeptical of working at Yelp given how leadership handled layoffs, furloughs, and so forth. I encourage to whoever is reading this, truly do your research and use your best judgment when looking into a position at this company. I hope Yelp can recover from all this and leadership can learn from their mistakes. Given my overall experience, I do believe this is something higher ups wish they had handled differently as time has gone on. We are all human, mistakes are made.  Always remember, people aren't one thing."

In the organizations where there is more management diversity, career growth does seem to flourish.

In general, everybody in product, design, and engineering are very nice and welcoming.

Everyone are true fans and users of the products, so it feels good to work with people like that.","Yelp states it prides itself on its culture, but certain organizations (NOT ALL, but a considerable percentage) have very insular cultures in which a small, but significant amount of subtle bullying of those that do not conform seems to happen. It can makes ""outsiders"" feel they have to inauthentically assimilate to their culture. The overwhelming ""promote from within"" attitude leads to more of this, especially given so many managers are figuring it out for the first time rather than bringing valuable diverse industry experience.

While Yelp values work life balance, certain organizations' cultures also have a lack of focus on having good operational process, and lack of rigor and seriousness for for building things with quality engineering. It can end up seeming more a place to go and have fun with other adult engineers (overheard derisively as ""an adult daycare"") versus a place to go and build great things and grow in your career."

Very aggressive selling strategy. You'll call business owners 3-5x a week, who have already been contacted over 100x by different reps. Some have advertised already in the past and lost money. Yelp does not care and will harass them until they sign up again.

Go look under Yelp Facebook posts and you'll see the outrage from business owners everywhere. Yelp has ruined its relationship with the public."

Some decent benefits/ pay not the greatest but not the best either. Gym reimbursement.,"Ok so I along with 2100 people were recently laid off due to the Covid-19 mess. It was coming most of yelps most searched businesses were the hardest hit and revenues are plunging. However I was there for a year exactly. I was excited to be joining a big brand name like Yelp and I thought I’d be mostly consulting on Yelp ads to business owners looking to increase their ad performance. That’s not the case as a customer success manager you’re basically in a run of the mill call center and all day long you deal with mostly angry clients. You’d be surprised how many business owners hate Yelp and view it as a bully. So here is the gist of it Yelp is basically a sales company they have a large sales department across six offices and each rep has to make 80 to 100 dials a day they hound business owners till they eventually get someone to sign up for advertising on Yelp. The problem is that the sales pitch isn’t  always transparent, and why would it be? the product isn’t that great to say the least, sales people sell dreams that are no where close to reality and the worst part is they don’t explain billing properly their  whole aim is to get a credit card on file get them to start ads and then ghost the client. This isn’t some issue of a few rouge sales people this is actually a problem at the top of the management and these practices are encouraged to dupe business owners to sign up quickly so they can nickel and dime them for whatever they can squeeze out of the person. This is where CSM comes in now you’re dealing with a angry person especially first few days of the month when the bill drops who is asking for a refund because they were misled on the sales call and now it’s your job to not only tell them in most cases there is no refund especially if they have cancelled their ads but also try and resell Yelp. The problem is yelp ads don’t really work for most industries lawyers, most doctors, real estate, pet groomers, construction etc I seldom saw any of these business be successful. A lot of it purely depends on the area the business is in and general demand but Yelp sales will try to sell everyone and their mother ads like it’s the greatest thing since sliced bread. The main package is cost per click and then they have some paid products at fixed prices for the month. I would see clients  pay for example $570 a month for a couple of months and have no business so who were all these people clicking god only knows honestly though I did hear people complain a lot about spam messages and calls. Anyways that’s a majority of what you as a customer service rep have to deal with and the management just tells you Yelp works these people have no business because people  chose their competitors and they need to spend more or improve their page which was completely untrue they didn’t get any business because these clicks are shady as hell and nobody really looks for anything beyond restaurants and nightlife on Yelp and funny thing most restaurants and bars don’t even need to advertise on yelp they do just fine with a free page. Then there is the matter of filtered reviews and bad reviews whenever a business owner received a bad review it was obviously fake (sarcasm) lol and they wanted it removed and Yelp doesn’t remove  many reviews so you’re stuck there on the phone being like I get it but sorry people are entitled to their opinion and no one likes hearing that also yelp filters reviews and that angers business owners because now most of their good reviews aren’t showing and you have to be like sorry it’s a software can’t do anything. In the end I have a lot of issues with how this place does business and I can go on but I wouldn’t recommend this place because your anxiety and depression will get triggered mine did. I do want to add I was a top performer I had 90% + rev retention for most of the months and had a great CSAT score good productivity I did my job well because I am a professional but couldn’t stand behind the product and never really had a taste for koolaid. You will meet some good people here and the positive is that the job is so unnecessarily hard  that anything afterwards will be easy. You will also meet a lot of koolaid drinking fake smile type people as well who I couldn’t stand. Management is young and their job is to just monitor KPIs they’re not leaders just supervisors who are there to resell yelp to you if they feel you aren’t sipping the kool aid. The culture is ok I mean the job is so taxing, stressful and repetitive that they can’t really do much to make it fun no matter what they do. In the end Yelp put me out of my misery and I am glad for that. Please there are better call Centers out there if that’s your thing skip this one. Hope this helps someone whenever Yelp starts hiring again."
1327,Yelp,Interesting Year. Will Miss My Friends,2020-04-11,2.0,Account Executive,"You will meet a lot of interesting people.
It's good experience for entry level sales.
Get promoted fast. Sometimes too fast as people who have been there for less than a year get management. 
Hourly so you never have to work longer hours if not needed
I met my bestest friends while working here and I will probably be friends with them till the day I die.","I worked at Yelp for a year and didn't mind the job itself. But the main issue with Yelp is management. Managers have no form of leadership training, just reps who are able to close are now just refreshing Salesforce all day to micro manage your metrics. 
If managers were picked on Leadership, it would be a different story. But they aren't. So you will more than likely get a manager who has no experience managing a team, and who doesn't have the slight idea on how to handle situations. They are just hired to refresh your metrics all day and that's it. If you want real sales training, you will have to teach yourself. I was most successful at Yelp when I stopped depending on my manager for guidance. And that's sad. 

You will be micromanaged every day. By your manager, and by your director. Expect to be underappreciated everyday, and to overproduce everyday. 

And the office is very cut throat. I was lucky enough to know how to use the Salesforce and found every report I needed to understand what was happening day to day. I was always able to see what management was doing in order to bump up numbers for their favorite reps. Whether it be switching out their regions every week, or sending all of your accounts out to top reps, or filtering your region so that you get no new leads.  I've seen managers go into reps accounts that have closed on their own, and remove the account owner from getting any credit to then place a favorite rep on their team to get full compensation. And this job is all region. Region pools are not made equally. They can control which pool new leads go into. If you notice you're not getting any, management probably wants you out. 

For culture, you will meet a lot of people you like. You will hate a lot of people as well. You will be compared to every top rep and it gets old very fast. Once you learn to shut it out, you'll be more successful.  And if you think selling with integrity will get you far, it won't. You'll notice a lot of customer reviews about the product you're selling on how they were overcharged, charged in general, or it didn't work. It's because reps and managers close deals with very misleading language that still fall into legal terms. So yes, representatives are usually scamming small business owners in order to get a deal on the board. If you look through Salesforce on all of the top reps accounts, you'll notice a lot of refund approvals, transcripts of what the rep said, and shady sales tactics. 

If you're on a performance plan, your manager is most likely trying to get rid of you. Time and time again I would see reps who were on performance plans get all of their accounts passed out to the team, or the manager will just call and close it for you. But since only revenue booked by you counts to save your job, those deals will not help you. And I just kept noticing over and over that managers and directors were purposely moving accounts out of reps who were struggling to other reps. 

I doubt Yelp will ever be the same after massive layoffs. They will probably never rehire to the same amount of reps in the future. And it will have a hard time recovering from this.  No executives took a pay cut, nor were management hit as hard as the rest of the employees. Just shows how much management only cares about themselves and not the betterment of the staff.  They let go of 2100 young adults to save their own interest.  Sad part is I wasn't shocked. I expected it to happen a lot sooner. Yelp was worth 4 billion when I joined, and has dropped to 1.2 billion in one year. If you're looking for a quick job, apply when the pandemic is over.  Looking for a serious sales role, look elsewhere."

You are left feeling icky at the end of the day for being a bully to a small business owner that could just as well be your friend or aunt. The upper management uses happy hours and alcohol to make you feel like you are part of the team. But you can tell it is an act and that you are a cog in the machine.  The turnover is ridiculously high because people catch on quick that it is a meat grinder. Some will stay since they are promised big bucks that they will not see (like working for herbalife or another MLM where they fill you with false hopes of money). Or some stay because management try to spin it that they are justified in their awful, dark, and sinister approach to making money."

Everyone bonds over their individual suffering and it makes the days more bearable. Furthermore, they also offer free coffee, snacks, a fully stocked kitchen, and the employee benefits are pretty good as well.","If you're someone who is anxious, an addict, or has an obsessive personality; this may not be the place for you. The job is VERY mentally taxing, we're essentially being paid to harass people. When business owners do decide to listen and sign up for the ad program its a great accomplishment but the issue is getting them to listen to you that long. 
-Your manager can make or break your experience.
-Panic attacks are a daily occurrence.
-Base salary is low.
-Lots of microaggressions.
-HR is quick to fire you."
1382,Yelp,Not worth it,2020-02-24,2.0,Account Executive,"Perks are great, fully stocked kitchens, health stipend, great coworkers.","Prepare to be micromanaged. Every single call expect to get talked to about, even if they went well. The product is only going to work for businesses that already get business from Yelp, or people with more than 15 5 star reviews but most of the people it'll work for won't be willing to talk to you, so prepare to have managers breathing down your neck to scam smaller businesses that you KNOW it won't work for. 

There's a really high turnover rate, partially people who aren't cut for the job, partially people who can't handle the management style. 

You have random pointless meetings ALL the time, and it's not uncommon for a manager to pull you aside and tell you you're not trying. 

Management will send out floor wide emails detailing who is behind and who is ahead (it's always the same star players and if you listen to their calls you'll learn quickly the only way to get ahead here is to do some shifty stuff). 

PTO and sick days are generous but you're shamed into not using them. There is constant talk about the difference between not feeling well and being sick. But expect to get sick often here because it's a ton of people and you have to high five everyone when they close a deal. 

Overall the expectations are a bit unrealistic if you still want to abide by a moral code. I don't really feel good about myself after working here, I know I ripped a lot of people off and management doesn't care."

Yelp has effectively turned telemarketing jobs into appeasing career traps for young adults. There are promises of career growth, marketing opportunities, bonus payments. The truth is that Yelp is a difficult job with minimal compensation. The sales structure rewards those with high sales, however, clawbacks will take the majority of your earnings back.

Free snacks  was great 
Friends you meet","Lol where to start. It’s been over a month since I left and am with a new company,  but looking back my experience at Yelp was truly the worst 11 months of my life. YOUR MANAGER MATTERS- mine happened to be an ex alcoholic, with extremely unstable moods, who was demeaning, demoralizing, loud, obnoxious,unsupportive, condescending and the most belittling person I ever met in my life . yay.
Yelp made me realize everything I do not want to seek out in a company for my next role.  They make you feel as if you’re just a number - because frankly you are. You are cattle doing the same thing day in and day out . If you’re an independent person who values autonomy this isn’t the company for you - run . The amount of micromanaging that went on triggered my anxiety to the point of panic attacks at my desk. My manager who had a whole slew of issues of her own (truly one of the most unpleasant people I ever met) made me feel like I was a child for having any emotion at all- while she screamed at us and went off on the deep end if we weren’t “green” for the day .( Hitting the daily number for the team ) looking back I’m unsure how I lasted just shy of a  year but my manager was a nightmare and if it weren’t for her I MAYBE would have enjoyed my stay (yes like prison )  but I doubt it.  The culture is so immature , the managers are so cliquey and childish . Just go anywhere else . 

Thinking about it makes me sick that’s how bad it was. my new job is SO impressed with my work ethic but I joke it’s the PTSD from the fear of getting up to use the bathroom at yelp . The job truly is a factory setting . You think I’m being sarcastic, I’m really not . Someone else referred to it as a puppy mill and I couldn’t agree more . 

Please if you’re looking, consider anywhere else but here . The 5 star reviews are so fake - please read the other reviews saying that . Yelp employees writing those reviews - please tone it down if you want to be believable lol cmon now . You sound ridiculous. It’s pathetic."
1387,Yelp,Account Executive,2020-02-20,1.0,Account Executive,Absolutely 0. To say they’re are better options out there is an understatement.,"Everything done at Yelp is to save face, including the responses from Yelp on Glassdoor. They’re scripted and made so they fulfill a legal obligation.

I know for a fact that managers will pressure sales reps to drink. Managers having intimate relationships with sales reps and then outwardly favor this person.  It’s worse than people think. It’s so real it’s costing the company actual $. 

The company is a loser. They make new reps do Glassdoor reviews during the high of training . Another move to save face. Ironically a company that is built on not fabricating reviews literally solicits reviews from its naive employees.  

Bribery from Management to sales reps is a constant. It’s a place where you will be mentally and emotionally scarred when you leave. 

It’s a dangerous place to work and no they do not offer the support the claim to- don’t let them fool you. Stay away."

Majority of the managers are Caucasian ranging from 23-27 years old and managing people from their same age group. These managers usually have little experience when it comes to race & how to overcome those challenges. It’s very high school like to an extent. Yelp isn’t ideal for someone with a family. Yes your hours are typically 9-5 with weekends & holidays off but they run incentives religiously. On any given Monday- Thursday there’s an incentive to a local bar or the kegs and god forbid you can’t attend, you are looked at as not being a team player or playing nice with others. The lengths they go to burn bridges with customers is a bad reflection on the employee who gains trust of the potential advertiser.

From day one I was told where I’d end up as a sales professional even though I was the best sales person on the floor and they had no idea what my abilities were. My managers had less sales experience then me and i could tell by the training and how they motivated the teams. Leaders are more focused on keeping top performers in their department to make them look good rather then advancing those who contribute major revenue to the company. If you go to the franchise department client partners and national enterprise sales will steal your deals that they never worked on. I spend 3 weeks on a deal that a client partner took because he owns the decision maker but the account was in my book. Your book in franchise is pitiful half of the accounts are national corporate accounts that you’re not allowed to close and if you do manage it close it the national rep with get nasty until they take the commission for it. Franchise works basically as glorified SDRs for the higher departments. You basically get the crumbs. Local gets paid more and their sale is a lot easier . They try to be secretive about it by having separate meetings but everyone in the organization is aware of it. Franchise leaders disrespect the AEs when they question their future with in the company. If you want to be a National AE or Midmarket AE regardless of how amazing you are .. you can forget it. Find a job somewhere else which most do after franchise because it’s the dead end department. The negative emails and peep talks are immature. The sales force lightening training is non existent. Corporate does a horrible job creating strong relationships with the companies you have to call which makes your job harder because you will have to fight through objections that come directly from the higher ups in the organization refusing to allow them to work with Yelp. The platform is about transparency in reviews and consumer feedback. However, it ironic because there is no transparency in the hiring and employment process within Yelp not accountability from leadership who purposefully stop great AEs from being successful. Transparency starts from with in a company and trickles down into all your processes and it doesn’t exist at Yelp.  If you like sitting and making dials with zero change or opportunities .. just collecting a paycheck then this is the job for you!"

The training is outstanding and I don’t think I am the same person I was when I started. If you can coke call 80+ businesses a day, you can do anything. After 2 months you “roll out” and most managers are extremely helpful, even after training. If you ready your quota consistently every month and live the “yelp values” you can easily move up—to management. Taking a manager eventually leads to very good money. Money is good as an AE though, too(if you are making decent commission) I work hard to hit my number and make commission, which is one of the reasons why I wouldn’t necessarily become a manager. Base salary increases with the more revenue you bring in. Getting a wireless as an AE has made my day to day routine so much more fun and relaxed. Most managers aren’t as “micro-managey” as reviews say- I have just been lucky with the two I have had.","Despite what I said  in the pros—it is pure luck of the draw with who you get as a manager.

If you don’t make a bare minimum of 80 calls a day— I have seen people get hounded by their managers. If you have anxiety-this job may  certainly heighten it.  If you want to call out sick—you will be questioned and pressured to come in. (Depending on who the manager, that is.) The biggest con is that since this is such high-stress, anxiety-provoking job, there is truly not enough PTO or sick days. You get 5 sick days a year. Five. I’m sorry but that is just not enough in this day in age. Many companies offer mental health days on top of sick days-which you think Yelp would offer due to the high stress of the job. Other sales companies also offer unlimited  PTO “upon manager approval. Would be nice. 
Also, it is also hard to leave once you are here. Want to quit? Be prepared on getting sold to stay."

You must make X amount of  dials a day and are required a certain amount of pitches/closes a day from that. It’s all a numbers game. Doesn’t sound too bad...however what they don’t tell you is: you are calling business owners who have been getting the same call since forever. In hope you can offer a different perspective. So it’s often being cursed out, which you have to answer with an “I understand, but...”, or hang ups as soon as you introduce yourself. The cold calling(borderline harassment) is what gives Yelp a bad name. Especially when you are calling a rural area for a company that just doesn’t need Yelp to prosper. On top of that you are trained to “Tone match” aka be combative too & it’s just calling a business to argue 80% of the time.

You meet a lot of people to go out with and mingle with (especially if you’re a young just-out-of-college kid)","It’s a horrible day-to-day life to live. The job itself is essentially just harassing people over the phone to buy Yelp advertising. Your manager will make you call these poor business owners every other day (even if they tell you they aren’t interested repeatedly) and will pressure you into selling advertising to people that definitely don’t need it or are not a good fit for the program. If you express completely rational feelings like “I don’t want to bother this guy that has told me he doesn’t want to use our program 10 times” or “I don’t want to pressure this old lady into signing up this knitting business she runs out of her bedroom” then you will be met with ludicrous statements like “Yelp works for everyone” and “They need Yelp, they just don’t know it.” The office (at least the New York one) is also run by a bunch of young and immature managers that treat the sales floor like a hook up scouting area and gossip about their reps and each other. Many managers make inappropriate advances toward reps and generally nothing is done about it. Overall, you just feel like you’re bothering people all day and are pressured by your manager to meet sales goals that are reachable but painful. It’s not worth it, especially since it’s a cold calling role and doesn’t use a true sales process. You’d be better off finding a real sales job at a startup or somewhere that doesn’t force you to drink the corporate koolaid. The base pay is also pretty hard to live on in NYC and the commission structure is pretty lame (the commission checks aren’t worth the amount of stress). My main advice: Just don’t do it. Find a better role somewhere far, far away."

Two SF Yelp buildings have a great location next to the SFMOMA and Yerba Buena Gardens, but the main building is better than the other

Despite the repetitive and monotonous nature of the work, the content is easy to get through, so personal browsing is definitely doable","The biggest downfall of user ops is bad management who treats associates more like sweatshop workers than people, and is unreceptive to criticism. Work is very repetitive, and if you do better and more work than the average worker, you will be told to do even more of the same work. There's zero acknowledgment of top performers, and people they do acknowledge in meetings are picked based on a popularity contest instead of actual merit or metrics. Several top performers within this department have been given more work to do, and threatened to be fired if they did not do more than the requirements for anyone else. If you take on multiple projects, roles, and teams, your pay is the same as an associate that just onboarded. Whenever there's a backlog, management simply tells everyone to do an extra half an hour of work with no compensation or reward. The personalities of people here tend to be more introverted, so people prefer to conform and be silent rather than dispute obvious oppression from upper management.

There's rampant favoritism, and the main way to advance is to brown nose your way in to a higher role. There's a specific instance of this that occurred despite mass disapproval of the floor. Shady things occurred, such as when there was excess budget, teams were given a chance to have a free meal. However, one team had their treat reduced to just a drink and the rest of the money disappeared.

Even though you'll be welcomed by many friendly faces, after the fanfare ends, everyone mostly keeps to themselves and no one likes communicating outside of short pings, if even that. Almost all associates are introverted, which makes forced social gatherings a little more awkward and stiff. Everyone likes to express their discontentment privately instead of sharing it in one voice, which could make a difference as opposed to the one or two associates willing to rise against unfair actions from management.

I've been in several startups and tech companies smaller and bigger than here, and can say that this is the most toxic environment I've ever experienced.  Low morale is rampant and consistently expressed in whispers. Managers contribute a lot to this due to their demands and two-faced attitudes. They'll say ""We care for your mental health and well-being"" but the next day, say ""We have a problem because you didn't work enough for this one hour of the day"". Yes, management keeps track of every action associates do every hour of the day, when it's clearly advertised upon the start of the job that it's a weekly quota that can more or less fluctuate each day. Guess they had to make up something to do to keep the job, but I don't think creating this inherent distrust between management and associates is a great way to foster happy and loyal employees. The micromanagement is severe here, which is unconducive to productivity.

If you're driven and intelligent, this is not your job. You will thrive if you just want to keep your head down and have a mediocre-paying job where you don't have to think about anything really. If you really love Yelp and want to go somewhere with it, this is not your job. Preference is given to external candidates for management positions, and middle-tier positions don't pay much more. If you want to improve the Yelp community, this is not your job. They hired aggressively politically correct people to ""improve"" the rules and most people on the floor were never Yelpers or foodies to begin with.

They're basically outsourcing this role now though, so my current advisal would be for SF associates to quit before the impending mass layoff!"

Co-workers","I spent five years with Yelp, which was filled with many ups and downs. I started my career as an Account Executive and quickly worked my way to the national side of the business. The company felt like it was in a slow decline throughout my tenure, which was consistently confirmed by taking a quick look at the stock price after earnings calls. The Account Executive role is challenging and continues to get harder as better advertising options (Facebook, Google, etc.) are available. You spend the majority of your day cold calling business owners who have been called HUNDREDS of times by past AE's which leads to plenty of rejection and negative days. I worked as an Account Executive for just about a year before moving to the national side of the business.  You would think to move from local to national would result in a pay increase, and at Yelp, you would be sadly mistaken. The national business is broken, which has resulted in an exodus of many top reps over the years, and to be honest, it makes sense.  Who uses Yelp to find a Subway? I was able to move out of the national business into a local client partner role where you work with business owners post-sale to upgrade their programs. This role was decent for a few years, but the management in that department became unbearable. You don't have to work somewhere where 30-year-old managers spend 6 hours instant messaging with each other.  Also, you truly learn in that role that the Yelp advertising product isn't great, but you are forced to ask your clients to upgrade regardless.   

This message is for both people considering Yelp as a career and current employees. There are MUCH better options available. I have been so happy since leaving Yelp, and you can be too! I remember reading Glassdoor reviews of Yelp while I was an employee just for confirmation that I wasn't the only one feeling so down on the company. The Glassdoor reviews speak for themselves! You are better than a company that is about to drop below three stars. You don't need to be stressing yourself out every day because business owners have been called 1,000 times and don't care about your scripted sales pitch. You don't have to work for a company where managers instant message each other all day and then yell at your team when you are behind. Life is too short to be unhappy in the workplace."

So now you know every company out there that you're screwing b/c you... what? Worked with them? Know the owners on a personal level? Some of the companies they screwed were very good companies, you learn a lot about them and the owners when selling to them. Anyway, I can do go but what good is it going to do?

With the right tenacity and grit along with the right manager + director, this job has the potential to alter the course of your life in the most brilliant direction you've not yet dreamed of. Great perks right from from day one on the job, the people (yes the business owners you talk to are important but the reason that many people stay on the job is for the amazing people in the trenches that you're grinding day to day with), management and leadership in this office is top freaking notch (wow), Merch Mart is amazing and in a prime location, so many opportunities across the company (after becoming semi good at the job you have the ability to work out of any office, you have to prove you can be independent and do the job but working out of the DC or NYC office and feeling like a big boy and getting to see the city is life changing). Sure the kitchen is great, Yelp Cafe is amazing in every office. This company rocks, and its hilarious to read the negative reviews on this place. The negative reviews come from reps who were at lunch drinking the haterade and festering on negativity instead of surrounding themselves with positive people. If you walk away from this job and didn't learn anything useful for any other part of life, well I don't know what to tell you; you might not be doing life right.","My only cons are in regard to PTO and sick time. I do my job, I'm a great rep, and yet I feel like I have to walk at the pace of the slowest walker. There have been so many reps I've met or known of who have abused the system and by abusing the system you make it not fun for the rest of us. You have 5 sick days. 5. I'm passionate about positive mental health (and so is Yelp, I love the tools we're given with formerly Ginger IO and now a new tool that is rolling out into 2020), but I sometimes need a personal day or if I'm ahead on the month and I just need a break. To get that day I need to use a sick day or PTO. Then when you're maybe out of sick days at the end of the year and you actually get really sick, you're in a pickle :) If and when I ever leave the company it'll be because  I don't get personal days and I sometimes feel like I can't take day or respite when I need it. But I do appreciate the muscle and habit of success I've built  by working consistently, but maybe adding personal day time to reps who hit the AE level would incentivize top reps to stay who might be burnt out. I'd even trade 1 or 2 commission checks or PTO if I could! Time > Money any day. The 15 days of PTO is great and standard but not being able to go negative for same reasons of people abusing system is annoying but makes sense. These 2 cons are by no means reasons to not accept an offer to work at Yelp. What you learn here can change your life. 

Avoid negative and toxic people, run your own race, ask for feedback, be open to criticism and work your butt off and I promise this job will take you to places you could never imagine."

1474,Yelp,Know what you're getting into (this is entry-level sales),2019-11-26,3.0,Account Executive,"Excellent benefits, tons of off-site hangout opportunities, free food and beverages, gym, metro accessible, safe working environment, caring leadership, great training, office layout is great, work tools are simplified, and like I said excellent benefits.","Overall office maturity is a continuation of college students looking to grow out of adolescence and needing help to do so (Broad stroke).  Though most of the management core was the mid-20s, the company is working hard to hire external, older adults with more life experience besides college and Yelp.  Helpful.

Know that you're making high-volume calls to men and women who mostly dislike your call because of the company name and have been called by reps almost every-month since their business has been on Yelp.com.  So imagine being a business owner whose first rep called in 2014, they may have had close to 100 calls from 10 different reps trying to convince them to sign up for Yelp Advertisement.   That's the job.  Your Quota and Target numbers aren't delivering the same financial benefit that you would receive at other sales jobs.  They don't mean anything except that they're a bar to hit.  What counts are several dials and how many people you can get to sign up for ads, even if they don't stay with Yelp long term. The job is exhausting and mundane.  You're ""battling it out"" with owners, ""empowering"" their employees to sign up the business in the place of the owner,  and your goal is to complete the entire sales process in 30 min. Hopefully, you get a territory that's vibrant with new business and not a region of America, where the population is dwindling and businesses are closing their doors (i.e. New England).  Your Q and T aren't based upon region, everyone's Q and T is the same based upon how long you've worked here.  My suggestion-talk with reps who have worked here for 2+ years and are still AE and ask for honest opinions about how much they enjoy their role and if they are looking for a different job.  Recruiters give you an idea of how much the average rep makes during their tenure, but they don't tell you how many people have left the company during that same period."
1475,Yelp,Great job,2019-11-23,5.0,Yelp Account Executive,Great job Really fun place to work,None. This was a great place to work
1476,Yelp,Do you even use Yelp?,2019-11-22,1.0,Account Executive,"The office is great, free food, wonderful coworkers (mostly). The training is great.","Dead platform. Seriously ask yourself, do you even use Yelp? Yes everyone knows what Yelp is but how often do you even use it? My training class was 109 people and all the people I talked to couldn't say that they had ever used it. 

This office alone has 900 salesmen on the floor, and there are 4 other offices. So lets call it around 4,000 reps nationwide. That's 4,000 people making 80 dials each to a relatively finite amount of businesses. The leads you are calling have been called to death. You will often be told to ""eff off"" or ""NO THANKS"" and hung up abruptly. Yelp is on the decline...refer back to the question, ""do you even use Yelp?"".

The management hires en masse because the turnover rate is ridiculously high. The training period of two months is great but once you're finished with that you are in sink/swim mode and that's when a vast majority of people in my training class quit. The thing about hiring en masse means you can let people go without thinking and therefore the employees are just numbers. 

You will be encouraged to skip your lunch, skip breaks, and come in/stay late. The compensation structure isn't great. You need to make 42k for Yelp before you see a nickel of commission. This company capitalizes on taking kids right out of college, working them to the point of quitting, and setting up a pay structure that ensure Yelp gets all the money. The people on the right of bell curve, i.e. the 1% earners are given the leads of people that leave the company, aka they have a way better chance of staying at the top.

Again. This boils down to one thing. People don't use Yelp. Don't let them fool you. Seriously, ask 5 people you know if they use Yelp. They don't. If they do, it's for restaurants but guess what, 90% of the businesses you call do not fall in that parameter. You're going to be calling doctors, lawyers, roofers,  cleaning services...etc. When was the last time you used Yelp to find a lawyer? Exactly, no one does. 

If you are looking to pad your resume, this is a great place holder. The 2 months of paid training is great and you will be able to find a job easily after that. I wouldn't stick around."

Teams work on things without alignment or determination of cross functional roles and responsibilities ultimately leading to failure and lack of measurability. Everyone points fingers all the time.

You will be micromanaged to death. You will be thrown to the curb at any Machiavellian moment.  Management is setup to seem like you are a friend and you are a meaningful being to the Yelp machine but the second you aren't helping them they will toss you aside. This job is a boiler room with fanfare but you can put lipstick on a pig. You are better off scamming people on the L than working for this company because ultimately they are the same. Managers don't take no for an answer. This ISN'T a sales job. This is a pressure someone until they submit job, and if that what you're into then go sell used cars, at least people who are buying cars know what they are walking into. People are going to try and go around you to get you in trouble just because it might make them look good. Unless you fall on the far right side of the bell curve you will not matter to Yelp. 

They aim for fresh college kids that don't know any better, and if you get this job, take a look around, count the people over 30

There are way better opportunities in Chicago. Avoid this. It's a dying platform. If you drink the kool aid you might think otherwise but honestly when was the last time you used Yelp to find a plumber? You haven't, no one has. Yelp rips off small businesses.

No one uses yelp for anything but food, and even then they do it subpar. GL

Also notice how most of the reviews are from ""elites"" who are obviously drinking that koolaid hard.

This IS NOT SALES. This is telemarketing. I can't say this anymore, this is NOT SALES. Do not let them fool you. If you take this job and think you aren't a salesperson because you can't do this then it probably means you are a salesperson, because this isn't sales."

Most of your day is going to be calling people that do not want to talk to you.  The hyper-aggressive contact strategy is sub optimal.

If you're paired up with the wrong manager, it can taint the entire experience.  For a time I was paired with an outlier that liked to tread on the borders of what's acceptable with HR policy, and would periodically violate that.   She had spurts of mental breakdowns in team meetings, violations of privacy, heavy usage of negative reinforcement and condescending language kind of ruined the entire experience, and I had resistance getting transferred to a more compatible manager.

Monthly team outings are great too because they're paid for.","At Yelp you get territories and you're responsible for knowing everything about them, the businesses, and you sell to them. What they fail to tell you is that your territory has already had 10+ reps from Yelp call them a million times so once you introduce yourself and where you're calling from they already hate you. Businesses in your territory are burnt out especially if you have small town areas or areas with no large cities near by or foot traffic. The only time you may get lucky with a close is when its a new business. And most of the time those businesses just don't have the funding for advertising."

Yelp does an amazing job of using your personal strengths to help you succeed and want to see you promoted through the company. I was blessed to work in multiple different departments and challenge myself with learning new sales techniques. Many people who I started with are already successful senior managers and enterprise reps only after 4-5 years. It’s incredible how fast the company grows. The perks and benefits are like no other.
Lastly, the connections I made at Yelp are priceless. I’ve met some very important people in my life at Yelp and know that the relationships will be lifelong. Its an amazing company for anyone who is passionate about people and want to make some really good money.",The job is a grind just like any other sales job. I always felt like the my hard work was worth it since Yelp is always offering cool incentives and monthly outings with your team. But be prepared to be mentally tested when the going gets tough.

1519,Yelp,"Overall, I owe a lot to this company and office specifically for where I am at in my career",2019-10-22,4.0,Sales Manager,"I'll preface this by saying this is a bona fide sales role, and if you've got the grit to make it as a salesperson I would wager there are very few offices in the city better suited to grow your skillset and make money than the Yelp office in the merchandise mart. If you don't, you will hate it, and hate sales in general, so save yourself some grief and look elsewhere. 

Also, the opportunity for upward mobility is without ceiling. There is a promotion at any point in time available for you if you earn/deserve it in this office. It is a meritocracy.

The training, both from an individual contributor level all the way up the leadership ladder, is simply world class. I spent 3 years here after school, moving from the AE role up to a mid level management role and genuinely feel as though I earned an MBA in Business, Sales, and Management/Leadership after I departed. The accountability levels are strong and direct but in most cases very genuinely postured to foster growth and development in the best interest of the report. The culture is strong and incredibly diverse ate just about every level - not just in the IC unit. I left on very good terms and am still in touch with my former reports and directors and from a sales capacity absolutely recommend giving Yelp heavy consideration. It is also worth noting the consistent and aggressive improvement model in terms of the tech and the product - the engineers are constantly innovating and rolling out improvements which says a lot about the company.","No company is perfect but there are definitely some items I feel need to be addressed. For example, after I left the company, my team was broken up (15 reps) without any consideration as to where they might want to land team wise - almost dispersed at random. Bear in mind this was a top team with experienced reps and now, in the 3 months I have left, I believe 4 have left the company and most have 1 foot out the door. 

My second point of contention with the company is the HR office. Without going into too much detail, there was a point in my career as a manager where I felt aggressively and personally attacked (and in many ways I was at fault) by the head of HR as well as the office head. There seems to be a lack of behavioral standardization from the management/rep level from HR. For example, while I was *moderately* in the wrong, I was by no means on any path to termination. As a result I was very close to quitting at that time in a less than ceremonious way - I am okay with admitting to being at fault, but the way in which I was dealt with was incredibly beyond the scope of what is acceptable. That being said, the rest of my experiences at Yelp and with the Office Head were so excellent that I am glad I did not move on and I look at the company and office with a favorable lens."

1526,Yelp,1st Full Time Job...I Hated It,2019-10-19,2.0,Account Executive,"Great co-workers, 11 kitchens with snacks and drinks, 100% paid benefits, team outings.","Where do I even begin? During my time here at Yelp, managers religilously shoved a corny sales script down our throats. They were so adamant that the script would be the key to our success. WRONG! The script did me no good when I would get cussed out by angry business owners because I am the 5th person from Yelp to call them. In training, managers will tell you that you cannot get fired for job performance. They told us that they know this job is hard but as long as we're trying and making an effort, you will be ok no matter what.  Their exact words were "" It's not a matter of IF you become a good salesperson  but WHEN."" That was a whole lie..I got fired for my performance but I'll get to that later. 

Managers are really big on metrics. Daily metrics were 75-80 COLD CALLS a day, send 15 emails, have 2.25 hours of talk time, pitch 2 times and close one deal. If you were falling short on any of your metrics, be prepared to have a micro-managing manager down your back. They'll really be on your case if you are not pitching or closing deals. Managers need to understand that sales is like a rollercoaster. You are going to have good and bad days but for some reason, they can't comprehend that logic. 

The office vibe can be fake at times. Fake success stories , fake smiles, fake energy, just FAKE! Everyone is miserable and burnt out. I've seen people cry in bathrooms because the job got tough. If you do not have thick skin going into this job, you better develop it because you are constantly being tested. 

As I mentioned earlier, managers said you can't fired for job performance. You are more likely to get fired for breaking one of Yelps CORE values rather than performance. Yelp must've had a bad Q3 because after they told us how company revenue declined, that's when upper management (Directors, Vice President , etc..) started putting employees on performance plans. If you were not hitting quota ($20K/month), then you were on the plan. They give you 2-3 months to course correct, otherwise, you're fired! They use scare tactics to motivate you to do better but it only diminishes your self esteem. You're being pulled into 3-4 one on one meetings throughout the day. How do you expect me to improve if I'm in meetings 24/7. 

Word of advice, if you like a cult like culture, micro management, and getting cussed out, then be my guest, Yelp is your oyster. I am so glad I got out of there."
1527,Yelp,Real expectations of working at yelp,2019-10-18,1.0,Senior Account Executive,"AMAZING people and culture I dont miss the job I miss the people every day. Being able to laugh and have fun with your friends and get paid to do so is ultimately why I know I stayed so long and loved working at yelp. 

Free food

If you stay for 2+ years looks amazing on your resume and opens a lot of doors for you at other major companies.","Let’s start with the pay
You have offices in major cities and you do not pay a livable wage. Although I have heard they have improved there chargeback policy’s People who would be constant producers went months with out commission because of they way chargeback were set up. Pay your employees accordingly, focus on finding an additional way to compensate based on retaining accounts since employees get penalized if they don’t and you won’t have such high turn over and people would probably produce more because they don’t have to stress about surviving.

They have remote teams and sometime last year they cut everyone’s pay. If you were a senior you took almost a 10k pay cut. What they should of done is everyone currently in remote keeps there salary and everyone who joined after follows the new compensation plan rules. 

Culture
This is a prop and con... the con of it is if you at all act like a human rather then the puppies and rainbow sales machine they want you to be you ultimately get labeled “negative” which is like having a scarlet letter on you. This is very much HS/college 2.0 everyone sleeps with eachother managers are sleeping with reps directors with managers etc... favoritism is alive and well I’ve witnessed it on many spectrums and have witnessed throughout my 4yrs on several occasions people of color getting treated unfairly and ultimately pushed out. There solution now is hiring every person of color who is mildly successful in the role and the VP of sales makes it a point to be there cheerleader which no one finds motivational or sincere.

Leadership 
Hit or miss I myself have had a manager make me feel horrible because I didn’t stay late or couldn’t participate in team offsites, a manager who treated me like a number, and managers who genuinely cared and believed in me it’s really just luck of the draw but if your lucky enough to get a quality manager your experience at yelp will be amazing. Until it’s not... my last manager was a rep who was promoted and had no idea what he was doing. I spoke up a few time constructively to my director and even HR on how this is not working out when I asked to switch teams I was met with a firm no and now I have a target on my back. The stress alone was killing me and now after 4 years and going through an up and down phase in my career (which happens in sales and after being consistent for over a year) and missing my number after 2 months I was on the other side of the table where my contributions and dedication to the company were not taken into consideration I was just a number who they rather get rid of cause once your an elite or tenured enough they don’t care really if you leave because it won’t effect managers retention bonuses if you churn at that point. So there I was no support no guidance and unforntently I was so wrapped up with trying to get off this team I sunk my own ship and after 4 years of giving my life to a company I loved just like that they let me go even tho I was still performing. Better then at least 4 other people on my team and the very next month my manager ended up getting demoted but I lose my job .... nice move yelp.


If you are a successful rep stay in local for at least 2 years... if you move prepare for a pay cut. I have no idea why but everyone I know who was a successful rep ( 30-40k consistently) and took a promotion took a pay cut for about 3-6 months if not more so which defies the purpose of a promotion. If you go into leadership or national do it cause you are passionate about the company and want to further your career not if you are in it to make money.

Lastly you are %1000000 going to hate the job anyone says they love there job really means they love who they work or for. No one wants to make 80-100 calls a day get hung up on, yelled at, cursed at, etc. if you do then yelp is the place for you. 

Do not have loyalty to this company because they are not loyal to you. Your are very much so just a number to them even when you feel like you are not, you are. If you are lucky to get a non sales role make sure you die at yelp cause it really is a great atmosphere to work in when you are surrounded by the right people."

- I have still never once been bothered outside of work.","- Management creates a terrible environment here. Extreme micromanagement of each metric. The directors that I've dealt with are awful. One in particular tries to be very Radical with what they do and it's a joke. Makes me wonder what my career opportunities are here. I try to look at what my career would be like if I were to stay at Yelp for 5+ years and become a director. It appears that my job duties would be sitting at a desk all day and hitting refresh on a report. Over and over and over again. Then I'll get up and scream something that only I think is funny. I’ll look around desperately to see if someone laughed so I know I’m getting attention. If I want to get really crazy I can high kick or walk around with an inflatable phone. Or double the fun and do both!! Then maybe I'll start making boomerangs to send to everyone and we’ll really start closing deals. Those are management skills here. 
- The sales tactics here are awful. As stated in pros above, you will have a crash course in cold calling. It's really sink or swim because every single person you talk to on the phone hates you and hates Yelp. If you have a brain, it's hard to believe in a product that every single client hates.
- Managers are a joke. They're so young and seriously have no other experience. Congrats, you've memorized a script and you're good at misleading people. They will also barge your calls and tell you what to say, but it's your fault if what they say doesn't close the deal. Kind of comical tbh. It’d be funnier if it didn’t affect my paycheck.

- If you get handed the right accounts from management there is opportunity to make decent commission.","Where to begin...

- Yelp can change your job responsibilities, salary and title at any time - something I have never seen or heard of in my 14 years in digital advertising. I had my salary changed 3 times in a period of a year and a half and was forced to moved into new business sales even though I was hired to manage existing clients. 

- With the new hybrid structure, you could be handed an account list and actually start in a deficit towards your sales goal (that you're expected to makeup despite it having nothing to do with anything you did) while your colleague next to you could be handed a large upsell that was not theirs. I still believe this has to be somehow illegal and is by far the most unethical thing I have seen to date in any sales org. 

-Management of the enterprise org all ""grew up"" at Yelp  and it's very obvious. They lack any knowledge of how the rest of the industry works and have a local sales mentality to the way they manage. They also are given total power, whether they have earned it or not, and reps are not validated or listened to. Adding to this, the manager of our region lacked professionalism, sales acumen/experience and lead from emotion. This person was petty, vindictive and reported to HR by multiple employees with no action taken. After 8 people from a small team left (many without jobs lined up) and a year+ of not hitting performance goals - not sure how this person still holds their position. 

- The product is so far behind where the rest of the industry is. Yelp does not play nicely with attribution methodology, media mix modeling or any form of advanced data analytics. Also Facebook and Google have both now created superior/competitive products.

- At the enterprise level you often lack control over your own accounts...particularly franchise accounts as local/franchise reps are calling/harassing on individual locations on almost a daily basis. 

- This is a common theme in Glassdoor reviews, but if you don't drink the Yelp kool-aid, play the game or dare to question management on decisions/choices you will be the one with consequences.  

- The majority of the enterprise org was put on performance plans in Q3...despite it mostly being due to extremely unrealistic sales goals set by management for 2019 coupled with a complete re-org this past January forcing reps into new roles and account lists. 

- The Yelp offices reminded me of the Wolf of Wall Street. Music blasting over speakers, gongs being struct all day by the local sales teams, team roundups in the hallway, employees crying in the bathroom. It was a highly disruptive and unprofessional environment."

You make 80 plus calls a day to small business owners. Doesn’t sound too bad right? Well to my surprise the business owners are just recycled accounts from passed reps that have already been called thousands of times already which was not stated in my interview. So you can only imagine how furious they’re going to be when you call them. But the managers preach to just keep calling them because persistency is key..no you’re just being a pest now. The “sales” tactics are just inhumane and they try to brain wash you like you’re doing a good thing by trying to manipulate you with these fake success stories. Calling these business owners several and I mean SEVERAL times a week.  The managers preach not to look at the notes and just call them when in the notes it says they clearly don’t want yelp. So I call them, and you know what happens...yeah they still don’t want it from when they said no back in 2013 from the last rep and many more before me that called them that left it in the notes. And to make it worse you’re getting disrespected and yelled at by them. But you can’t blame the business owners because I see where they’re coming from being called thousands of times. And you can’t put them in the do not call list unless they say those words exactly. 

I remember it was my first day of training I was super excited to start because I didn’t know what I was in for. This isn’t my first corporation job either so I know how work culture is suppose to be like. Boy was I wrong. I remember exactly, my second week on the phones you’re suppose to do 80 calls and 2 hours of talk time. I had about 50 calls wasn’t sure about my talk time but I got scolded by the sales trainee manager Paul. Asked me if I wanted to be here and was questioning me and was comparing me to other people and even went to the lengths of telling me I was stealing money from the company because I wasn’t hitting  my numbers yet WHEN IT WAS MY 2ND WEEK. During that meeting he really tried to break me and make me cry...I just laughed in his face because I knew what he was trying to do. Boy did that tick him off..but you don’t say that to someone “stealing money from the company” especially in the “professional setting” if I would even call it that. But come on it was my 2ND WEEK. He really tried to use scare tactics and things along the lines of those boundaries to get the way he wants. And I know I was not the only person he did that too. You’re suppose to develop me not try and break me already. That really brought it into perspective that they don’t care about you as a person. They see you as a dialing machine. 

They also micro manage you like you’re a baby that cannot act on its own. Constantly breathing down your neck about being the dialing machine you are. Treating you like a kid. They come up with these kid like incentives like “who ever gets the most pitches or transaction get foods, a coffee, or you get to pie me in the face, a picture of your fav celebrity on the wall etc.” like come on grow up. I saw right through all that. 

The culture there is like a high school. Super cliquey and if you’re not hitting your numbers you’re a nobody there and give them even more of a reason to micro manage you eventually putting you on a plan to leave. 

Although don’t let this scare you away from sales if that’s what you want to do.  Yelps tactics just aren’t morally right and the way they select manager is ridiculous. And this is just my experience there. If you want the job take it, but please beware."

Whenever someone on my team got on a call and went to the first live search, managers would barge in and feed us lines which, at the end of the call, they would congratulate us for fighting the business owner and defending the company even though we said the lines they fed us word for word. 

Speaking about managers, many of them; if they had worked for another company; would've been fired for acting like children or college freshman and the incentives they gave out were also childish at best (Make a 3.24 before noon and get a breakfast sandwich or be out at 2 PM? Am I in elementary school?). 

I endured plenty of stress and panic attacks, including having two of them within 24 hours, just to stay afloat in this job for a paycheck that's laughable with a commission structure that isn't all that's promised along with a business model that needs to be updated and not centered around harassing business owners every two days.

About a year or so ago, I came to him with a frustration I had. He could have easily said that he would work on it and put my concerns on the back burner. Instead, he spends a week going back and forth with multiple people regarding my concern. When they pushed back, he still fought for me. I never knew how far he went to find a solution until one of my peers told me the other day. I think it says a lot about ones character and integrity when they go the extra mile for you and not just to go the extra mile just so they can tell you how good of a person they are.

Work life balance","This was the worst company I have ever worked for. My manager was 28-29 something years old and all she talked about was how she was the president of her sorority. I would go to her for advice and help and all she would say is “figure it out”. Even at some points refusing to do reviews with me to help me get better at the job. Then when we would do a monthly round up she was accost me for not performing how she desired. She was the worst person I’ve ever met in my entire life. I caught my team talking behind my back in a group chat, it was legitimately like being back in middle school. Do yourself a favor and do not work for this company."

- Great sales training, will look good on your resume and prepare you for a more mature sales role (if that's what you want)
-  Start-up amenities (Snacks, happy hours, ping pong tables,  etc.) if you are young and new to the city, Yelp can also be your social life.
- GREAT health insurance","Oh boy, where to begin...

- Base pay is laughable for NYC, commission structure does not net most people a consistent commission (because the advertising product is shabby, but more on that later)

- The office is aggressively loud. Bad EDM music pumping 24/7 (sometimes the same playlist 3 times a day for a week straight), managers shouting to get everybody ""hyped"", every deal closed mean a huge gong is hit and everybody cheering. It's neurotic and not normal, and certainly not conducive to a healthy work environment. 

- Zero professionalism and a ton of gossip, including directors and VPs.

- You have to work hard. Always. Which is something I pride myself on doing. But, no matter how well or terrible you are doing in terms of revenue, at every turn your manager and director will say whatever they can to squeeze more work out of you. 

- From clock in to clock out, (most) managers will micro-manage and manipulate you to the point of exhaustion. The company tries to put all of the onus and responsibility on the lowly sales person, ignoring large flaws in the companies structure.

- Team meetings consisted of soulless locker room motivational speeches, relating the task of hitting your target revenue to your own life, motivations, and goals. It all was very brain-washy. It was not an option to treat Yelp like a job, it had to be your life. 

- Weeks are peppered in with ""incentives"" if you hit certain metrics. Some were cool, like PTO and lunch, some we're absolutely inane, like crabwalking races and stuffing oreos in your mouth. Felt like a summer camp for middle schoolers.

- Most business owners have an opinion on Yelp. Some love it, but most  HATE Yelp. Most of my days, towards the end of my time there, I was constantly dealing with owners who were confused/angry about how Yelp shows and hides certain reviews. Yelp's assertive review filtering, in place to discourage fake or solicited reviews, does not always do its job correctly. There is no recourse for this, and the brunt of the feelings business owners had we're lain upon the outbound sales teams.

- The ad product works okay in metropolitan areas, and mostly with a few key industries. It was pretty easy to sell to them with conviction. However, for every other business, where there is little user activity, most of the time I was forced to lie to their face, give general (misleading) fact and figures about the effect of the program, and try and get them to put a card on file that would slowly drain money out of their accounts as people would click on their ad then not buy.

- Work life balance is ""important"" to Yelp, but again, in name only. AEs were encouraged (pressured) to stay late at the end of every month. Even though I never had to check my email or work late into the night most days, the sheer anxiety that the job fosters is impossible to let go of in your free time. 

IN SUMMARY:

Yelp's ""culture"" is a wolf is sheep's clothing. Like a certain politician the USA has in office,  if Yelp is trying to convince you of something, the opposite is probably true. From day ONE, management will try and convince you how great of a company Yelp is, how  much we're changing the lives of business owners, and how lucky you should feel being at the company. 

The reality I saw, was the employees we're mostly upset or burnt out (even the successful ones),  the company has been declining since 2015, and (I can't say this enough) the stressful conditions and work environment, emotional manipulation from mgmt, and the fact that I spent my day lying to people is NOT NORMAL. 

IF YOU ARE APPLYING to Yelp, ask yourself: Do I want a career in sales? Do I not care about having autonomy at my workplace? Can I deal with constant noise, stimuli, and immature colleagues? If you answered no to any of these, I encourage you to look elsewhere."
1577,Yelp,Amazing Company. Management and Training Needs Improvement.,2019-09-10,2.0,Account Executive,"I was excited to get hired at such a big name company. The hours, benefits, wellness program, office design are all amazing. Excellent opportunities and low cost for helping small business grow, I believe in that strongly. I still recommend the advertisements to friends and family.","The training caused so much anxiety for me. I was going through my own personal issues and thought this job was a dream come true. Left personal things at home and succeed at work. However, all it did was pile on top of my anxiety. I came to work dressed professionally and clean and my coworkers were wearing short shorts with their butts showing. The training style is more of a “work first, train later”. Basically you are on the phones with real accounts, calling real people with real objections, that you cannot answer because the training session comes after the failures. If you are a perfectionist, or if you are like me and really really wanted to do well, that can be stressful. As the weeks continue you will then receive the remainder of the sales script and other training materials, and how to respond to these advertising objectives, and you still have to call back the same accounts in your pipeline, the same people who knew you had no clue what you were talking about the first few calls because you could not properly answer their questions, due to not having completed training. I would rather have the materials I need prior to working, prior to having the phone hung up on me. I starting making calls to small business owners the first week on the job. Training started after the calls started. The training was 8 weeks total. Each group of about 8 people or so were assigned a training manager for the day, and every day for about 1-2 max, we were giving the training materials little by little. However, the manager I had (Mike) took 2 weeks vacation out of the 8 weeks of training we had. So basically training for my group was only 6 weeks. The atmosphere felt like a frat house. He would come to work smelling like he went drinking last night then woke up and threw on the same smelly t-shirt. He would fraternize with the coworkers that wore short shorts and ignore the others. I would raise my hand and get completely ignored to the point I would go home and study my training material over and over afraid of messing up. He was supposed to monitor our calls and that happened for me maybe once or twice. I was left on my own. Even closed my first and second sale on my own with no proper guidance. While he was on vacation, he left us with no one to train us. He pretty much told us to call upon the other trainers who had their own new hire group when we needed his help. I noticed one of the other trainers, I believe his name was Aja, seemed to want everyone on his team to do well and always seemed professional and ready to work. I wish I was on his team. I didn’t want to say much because they hired about 5% people of color and I didn’t want to labelled as difficult.  It felt like if you weren’t down to go drinking with them, you wouldn’t get the proper monitoring and attention that you needed to succeed.  When I brought this to his attention, he stated I should’ve told him sooner, seemed genuinely concerned and seemed to genuinely want to help and I thought that was the end of it. But no way, my next call, I was completely ignored again. The short shorts wearing coworker, whom sat right next to me seemed to have all of his attention sometimes for over an hour on one call but I could not get 10 mins of his attention. After I regrettably left the company, my personal stress on top of the anxiety they gave me, short shorts and the other frat/ sorority group buddies started stalking my social media account. However, they did not follow me, which was so weird and childish. One of them posted a vulgar comment on one of my family vacation pictures. Offering to give me Vitamin D (aka his male genitals). Again I said nothing because I didn’t want to seem difficult and I wanted to come back to the company. However, I was marked as non rehirable, (I have no clue why). When I was the one treated poorly in what I thought would be my dream Job and Company.  It sucks but you live and you learn."

Biggest pro:  Working here will make you realize these pros don’t make a job worthwhile to stay at.  Makes you appreciate the next job you get much more.,"Yelp is kinda like one of those religious cults. They are great at recruiting recent college graduates (people looking for that great opportunity to give their life more security and pride in their job). And/or people who don’t know what it’s like to work for a company, full-time, doing work you actually enjoy.  That was me. Ah, young and inexperienced in the career world. 

The managers and directors need a philosophy, a “motivating cause” to keep employees holding on to the belief that this all-day cold calling and subjecting yourself to hostile phone conversations is worth it. 

To achieve that, they will tell you over and over that it takes “dedication, tenacity, belief in yourself and your potential” etc, to succeed. That yelp will “transform your business skills to lead to bigger and better opportunities.” That those who leave, give up on themselves too early. 

Okay, maybe a little cold calling experience helps with your confidence and verbal skills - but all day, every? At that point, it’s no longer about your career growth, it’s mainly about their financial business incentives - the need for businesses to buy advertising so the company can sustain. Yeah, you make money too. But you can make more elsewhere at a place with better dynamics. Even if you make a little less, it’s probably worth it over the day-to-day grinding it out at Yelp. 
 
They need you to be an efficient cog in the wheel. To make you that “cog,” they need you to believe that all the cold calling, the subjecting yourself to the anger of business owners, is for a good cause. “Not only will you grow for the better, but you’ll be helping business owners in the process.” 

Through all those daily calls, you’re attempting to “educate” business owners on how yelp advertising will help transform their business. If you’re good enough at sales (or “better than the last sales rep,” who’s called them 20 times before you) “they’ll be willing to listen.” And when they do, they’ll sign up for yelp advertising and get more business. It’s a win-win! 

But truthfully, the data Yelp uses to “prove” its advertising effectiveness is presented in a skewed, misleading way. I don’t think most research universities wouldn’t back it if it were presented as an argument in a paper. Sure, yelp advertising probably does help some businesses. But all? Most? Nah. 

You either have mostly good reviews or you don’t. Thats what really helps or hurts a business. Adversity your business page with bad reviews won’t help you. Advertising your page if you have good ones might a little. But why spend money on advertising on yelp when your good reviews are what sell themselves? 

Plus, it’s too expensive with little proof in the data that it actually helps for the cost. Despite what the data charts show on a business owners’ profile, it’s simply not backed by reliable numbers or data to make it worthwhile for these small business owners.  

There is a reason why turn over is so high at Yelp. And it’s not because people simply “give up on themselves too early.” Do your mental health a favor and work elsewhere. If you work there currently, trust your gut and leave when you know you want to. 

Those who stay a long time and actually thrive at Yelp in sales are usually people who are good at being self-centered and see the arguments with business owners as an “us against them” (Plus, they don’t want to face the fact that the job sucks). Believe it’s worth it and it will be easier, right? Grind for a few “wins.” Do it again tomorrow. 

Like most who leave, eventually you find the daily repetition simply isn’t worth it."

Leaving Yelp and gaining outside work experience has truly made me realize just how toxic that work environment was, and, from what I hear, continues to be because of the head of office and director clique. 

- Lack of diversity. This has been continuously messaged in other reviews, but, being on the inside of leadership gave me a glimpse into just how messed up this was. People were made to feel uncomfortable based on their language preference/ethnicity, and I have seen notes from directors to managers in which they've messaged with no tact or context that we need to promote POC- it was messaged with an eyeroll and an obvious feeling of obligation versus true intent to diversify the sales org.

- Bullying/harassment from leadership/management. Constant, aggressive intimidation tactics used to make sure reps were in line, but also to politicize the manager/leadership environment- myself and multiple managers would be pulled into rooms to basically try and get dirt on other managers in a way that seemed extremely out of line. HR was never present for these conversations. Additionally, in fear of retaliation (office head said in a meeting, verbatim, ""I will find you"") this was never reported.

- Unprofessionalism/frat culture. Managers and directors, some who've even gone on to be promoted to office heads/etc, would be out partying with reps- including binge drinking and recreational drug usage. Leadership would actually ask insubordinates for drugs while at happy hours, etc. Also, everyone has wildly inappropriate relationships, lines are constantly blurred and crossed, and it's all rooted in behavior from the top that trickled down.

- No leadership with respectable outside work experience. None of the directors have any experience working outside of Yelp- while initially it was encouraging that Yelp promoted mostly internally, as you move up the ranks, you realize that you do not have anyone to look up to that actually has a decent roster of experience. Other companies hire externally to embrace other perspectives and diversity in experience, but Yelp does not seem to value that. In turn, their manager attrition is awful- people do not quit companies, they quit people, and the directors here (all of whom only have Yelp as 1st job out of college) are hired mostly based on politics and numbers that are inflated from playing a good political game.  

- Micromanagement. Ditto everything in other reviews about reps not being treated like adults. This ties in the frat culture/unprofessionalism. I can respect running a tight ship, but breathing down reps/managers necks and/or constantly pinging for updates/giving threats is not how it should be done."
1595,Yelp,"Kelly Clarkson - ""Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)""",2019-08-28,2.0,Account Executive,"I apologize if my review is lengthy. I wanted to give as much detail about my experience as possible. Hopefully, my review helps someone. My review is only focused on what I experienced during my time with Yelp, things may have changed since. 

I was employed by Yelp in the Chicago office from the summer of 2018 to February 2019. I can confidently say it was one of the worst times of my life. My experiences at Yelp mirror a lot of what has already been noted by former and current employees. 

I, like so many, was grateful to get the call that I had gotten an offer. The thought of working for such a large, well-known tech company was exciting. However, there's a clear distinction, YOU don't work in tech, you work in sales. Welcome to your career. 

I did not study business or any related major that would lead me to a career in sales. I think most people who end up in sales don't grow up thinking, ""I can't wait to cold-call people when I'm older."" I had worked in another sales role at another company for about a month where the daily metrics/key performance indicators (KPIs) were 200+ cold-calls, 100+ emails, etc. So, learning that Yelp ""only"" required about 70 to 80 calls a day and 25 emails was a dream. THAT'S WHERE THEY GET YOU (But more on that later)!

In the Chicago office, the BASE is $39,000 (before taxes). Why not $40,000? No one knows. To me, a single twenty-something with no kids, this was enough to afford my modest lifestyle. You will have access to a wellness benefit that can cover your gym membership. Use it. You also receive benefits from day one, which is cool, but not super rare for tech companies and startups. ""Plus"" there's the possibility of earning commission (But more on that later).","They typically start people on the second week of the month. So that summer, I along with over 90 other people started our career with Yelp. By the time I left the company, a third of my summer group remained. I didn't necessarily see the high number of new hires as a red flag. I figured maybe they wanted to just knock out training for such a large group at once. I came to realize there is such a high turnover with resignations and firings that it's necessary to hire in such high volume. 

Training is classroom style for two months. The first two months of employment are the most decent. The first week is solely classroom learning and by week two, you're on the phones and ""ready"" to go! What they don't tell you in the interview (I asked to be sure, given my prior experience at that other company) is about recycled leads. A recycled lead is a lead that has been contacted by prior reps. In some cases, leads have been getting called since 2013. You can imagine they are super excited to hear from Yelp, AGAIN! I understand that in sales, you will have recycled leads, that's a part of the industry. Maybe the prior salesperson didn't sell the product right and this is YOUR chance to say something different to change their mind. Sure, but no, not at Yelp. 

There is a script (not unlike most sales roles). That's pretty much all the sales language you get. If you come into the role with some experience, you will have a much better time on the phone. If you're pretty much new to sales, good luck. Yelp uses the same exact script for every single business. Calling a contractor? Nail salon? Psychic? Use the script. If you ask your manager (more on that) for valuable feedback or insight on how to approach a certain lead you are not going to get it. 

Yelp places new hires on teams of about ten. These teams are given a manager who is also in training. YOUR MANAGER IS BEING TRAINED ON HOW TO BE A MANAGER WHILE YOU ARE BEING TRAINED ON HOW TO BE A SALESPERSON. While the job itself is awful, this can truly make or break your experience. If your manager has had previous managing experience, they may actually be able to assist you on your calls. That's often not the case. Most managers are extremely young, which can be a good thing. These are the people that came straight out of undergrad to Yelp, worked as a rep for 1 1/2 to 2 years and then became a manager trainee. Also, it should be noted there is no real trajectory in this role. You work as a Sales Rep for about a year and if you do well you may become a rep for the Mid-Market or National team. Which just means a different volume of cold-calling. Or you could work a year and become a manager in training to manage other people who cold-call. If you survive all of that for years, you may get to be a director. Tough luck if you're a minority though (at least in the Chicago office). 

Diversity is kind of a problem and an eyesore. There is a ""Wall of Fame"" where reps who have closed/sold a certain number get their photo (poorly) photoshopped to a European monarch portrait. This is problematic in itself but the only person of color, a Black man, has the smallest photo on this wall. His face is photoshopped onto the iconic ""Napoleon Crossing the Alps"" and you can barely make out his tiny face in the painting. There are no directors of color and there are few managers of color as well. The overall aesthetic of the office is young, white recent graduates. The environment is very much like a fraternity/sorority house. It can be very cliquey but you will most likely make friends. The people that work alongside you are generally nice, management and leadership are the people to watch out for. You will bond with your friends over how terrible the job is. However, if you leave and they are still employed with Yelp, you will likely not remain friends. Being friends with someone still employed at Yelp is like looking at your friend claim to be “happy” in an abusive relationship. 

The environment is one of the worst parts of this role. If you have ever experienced any forms of anxiety or depression, you will definitely be triggered. If you are a recovering alcoholic, your sobriety will be challenged. This office has beer kegs (very much like other tech companies). There are ""off-site"" events that your manager can plan, which basically means go to a bar and drink. You're basically shamed if you don't want to go to these events. On my particular director group, there was an incentive called ""Lunch Club."" The first six reps to get to 25k in a month get to have Rosé with the director. This office encourages alcoholism as a coping mechanism for the high stress of the job. They blast music loudly, which doesn’t have to be a bad thing. Please be prepared to hear the same songs every day, sometimes more than one time in a day. I heard Clean Bandit & Zara Larsson's ""Symphony"" three times in one day. It's a mediocre song at best, imagine being stressed and getting yelled at by business owners, and having to hear ""SYMPHONNNNYYYYYYYYYY,"" multiple times a day. They also played Kelly Clarkson's ""Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)"" daily, how fitting. I'm afraid you're wrong Ms. Clarkson, what doesn't kill you just slowly eats away at you. 

Reps are given a territory (some have geographic regions) which basically has two areas or cities. In my time there, I went from Winnipeg, Manitoba (Canada) & rural Kansas, to Mt. Rushmore, South Dakota & rural Nebraska, to Garland, Texas & Suburban Chicago. These changes happened in six months. You can imagine how frustrating it is to constantly change territories, especially to go from a decent metropolitan area to a tourist attraction that has closed for the season. All reps are treated equal in regards to their assigned territory. It doesn't matter if you have New York City or San Francisco or rural Alabama. You are expected to meet the same KPIs and quota as everyone. 

Work starts at 8:30 am sharp. If you have a territory in a different time zone as you, oh well. You're still expected to start dialing, even if businesses are closed. I have never been so micro-managed in my life. You're expected to make 80 dials in a day, get 2 pitches (a pitch is when you run through the entire script with a business owner and show them pricing), and close one deal. If you get to lunch time with no pitches, expect your manager to sit down and look at every SINGLE dial you made. Yelp uses Salesforce which gives them multiple reports which allow them to track everything you do, which of course is necessary but it is overused. My manager would sit and say, ""You called this restaurant at 10:00 am on Monday, and you called at 11:00 today, did you leave a voicemail? Are you sending an email with every call?"" If you get a voicemail when you call a business, you are expected to leave a message and send an email. Imagine calling someone about 6 to 7 times in two weeks (the sales cycle) and leaving the same message and sending poorly constructed email templates. It's harassment. We are encouraged not to use the Do Not Call (DNC) feature in Salesforce. Even if a business owner says, “Please stop calling me! I am NOT interested,” because they didn’t explicitly say “please add me to you Do Not Call list,” you must continue to call and email them. 

The product doesn't work. Maybe it did a few years ago but the advertising landscape has changed. There are much cheaper and efficient options out there, e.g. Instagram Ads, Facebook Boost Post/Ads, Google Ads. So, trying to tell a hip young nail artist that her Instagram page with 20,000 followers is not as good as a Yelp page is pointless. I have had customers call and complain to me about the product not working. Luckily, I'm a decent human-being, I didn’t over promise like some of the more successful reps do. This role will really mess with your integrity. If you're calling into a rural area, you will feel like crap for forcing a platform on someone who doesn't need it, just to get a sale. Thankfully, there are no contracts, so people can cancel anytime. This will affect your commission should you ever get over that threshold. Reps are only eligible for commission after closing 30k. After that, each month they must reach at least 12k in order to start earning commission. So, you have to close 42k for Yelp before you receive your first commission check of about $120. Commission is paid out separately from your normal salary and also taxed. Most people don’t make it long enough to see commission. Those who do well will note that their commission checks will be affected as their customers cancel their plans. 

Yelp billed out commission for six months. The highest you could close a business on was a deal worth $540 a month. Yelp assumed they would advertise for six months. $540 X 6 = $3,240 or 3.24k. You would have to close about thirteen “full-comp” deals before you get your first commission check. Of course, there were cheaper plans that would allow for smaller amounts. But reps are really encouraged to push business owners towards spending fifteen dollars a day (or more) so they can get the full-sized deal. Most people stop advertising after realizing the product doesn’t work. It’s cost-per-click (CPC) and does not guarantee any customers. If a contractor has a $23.00 CPC and someone is shopping around for a contractor getting multiple quotes and viewing multiple businesses (like most people do when shopping around). Yelp will charge that business for each click even if it did not result in a job. Because they paid for the “exposure.” 

When and if you are closing a deal, you have to tell business owners that you will stay in touch with them if they have any questions about their advertising “campaign.” However, my manager encouraged my teammates and I to not answer the phone for customers or to simply give them the inbound support number. This was common practice throughout the office. Once, I sat on a phone with a business owner for thirty minutes and listened to their complaints, they were charge over four-hundred dollars and didn’t get a single client. What are you supposed to say to a small business owner? I simply said, “I’m sorry.” I felt awful and dirty. 

There is an in-house barista but every drink they have is acidic tasting and quite frankly, they’re rude (I suppose it’s because they are only paid minimum wage). Reps are encouraged to consume copious amounts of espresso to “keep the energy up.” There is also free food in the two kitchens. However, it’s mostly prepackaged food full of preservatives and nitrates. Good luck grabbing a Walmart Ready-Pac salad or frozen hamburger because all employees take their lunch at 12:00 pm. The office has between 650 - 800 people, give or take firings/hiring/resignations. The two kitchens are like war zones. You spend your hour lunch break waiting twenty minutes to use one of the six microwaves. But while you’re waiting for your first check or you’re in-between checks, the food is helpful. Just make sure in between enjoying free coffee, food, and soft-drinks, you don’t use the bathroom too often. Your manager will constantly want to know where you are. There is the option to do overtime, it's not mandatory, but boy if it’s the last day of the month (LDOM) and you’re leaving at 5:30, expect a dirty look. 

I witnessed the top performer on my team and one of the top performers in my entire group break down in tears. Management took this happy and bright twenty-two-year-old girl and broke her. What can I, a twenty-seven-year-old who has multiple jobs, say to a young girl in her first role? Recent grads are the target demographic for hiring because they are the most vulnerable. They don’t know that a work environment isn’t supposed to be (this) toxic. Another peer on my team had a nervous breakdown (on his birthday), he was also fired a week later (not a lie or embellishment). In fact, in a week’s time, my former team lost five people, three were fired and two quit (another rep and myself). Work isn’t supposed to be “easy” but it shouldn’t be this hard. My manager and director would simply tell reps who were unhappy that they are not trying hard enough. In fact, my director sent out an email with an article about the health benefits of stress. This is an individual who would have group meetings with all the teams under his leadership just to yell at them. He would constantly walk around the floor and scream at people if they looked unhappy. You will be forced to stand up for “power-hours” and no, Yelp does not provide standing desks. 

In addition to possibly earning commission, you can earn other perks such as McDonalds breakfast sandwiches, Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts coffee, an off-site with your team to go drink, taking a picture with a musty jersey, or “bragging” rights. So basically, nothing. You will gain or lose weight, depending on how your body handles stress. You will constantly get sick; the stress will make it hard for your immune system. You will age, a year in this role and you will look older and more tired. You will lose motivation to do anything, even on weekends. It will be hard to imagine life before Yelp. Leaving the company has given me such clarity. While applying for other roles, I was given a writing assignment that took me way longer than it should have. I realized that in the months I’d been employed at Yelp, I hadn’t really used my brain for critical thinking. 

So, after all this you’re still interested in working at Yelp. Best of luck, welcome to your career."

1603,Yelp,Crash and Burn,2019-08-22,1.0,Account Executive,"Good medical insurance, but most employees are <30 years old and don't face real medical issues, so take that with a grain of salt","Well, if you're reading this, you're probably like hundreds of other AEs out there right now - going a little crazy from the micromanagement, blaring music, garbage leads, and incessant roundups. Don't worry, it's not just you. You're not bad at sales - you're probably quite talented. That time you couldn't close the deal with the metal fabricator in Mesa,  Arizona? You don't need to ""own your development"" to figure out why you can't hit quota. It was a garbage lead, who has already tried a dying product twice (because past sales reps lied to him about promotions), in an area and industry where paying $450/month to advertise on Yelp will do nothing for him except hurt his wallet. It's not your fault. 

Yelp's sales model since moving to self-serve ads has been this: load up on recent college grads who have no idea what a professional workplace looks like. Hand them a script. Teach them the script and have them pump out 80 dials/day. Eventually, they'll get some poor ignorant business owner on the phone who isn't familiar with Yelp ads. From there, the manager will ""barge"" the rep and feed them line for line what to say. These lines will be misleading, aggressive, and sometimes flat out lies to get biz owners to give up their credit cards. Some reps will have the stars align - they are kool-aid drinkers who are willing to overlook the fact that the outdated product is a waste of money for 99% of biz owners AND by the grace of god landed a territory with tons of new, ignorant business owners. These are your highest performing reps who will be promoted to sales managers. Not because they are intelligent, have soft skills, or understand how to manage people (they usually have NONE of these qualities) - but because they drink the most kool-aid and truly believe the small business owners are IDIOTS if they arent willing to cough up $500/ month for Yelp Ads. And when teams aren't hitting their numbers, you quickly see how managers (plot twist) actually are not one bit concerned about your development - they really only care about hitting that green number. 

These sales managers tell reps that they took the managerial role because they want to make reps into better versions of themselves and help them grow as people - but once you have mastered the job there's nowhere to grow. Growth is pretty much lateral - if you move to restaurants, LCP, or another sales division of Yelp, you won't receive a pay raise or bump in title. It's just a slightly different role to keep top producers engaged for a few more months before the burnout. Oh, and now that Yelp execs announced on the August 9 earnings call that they are going to keep salesforce headcount steady as they shift their focus to multilocation and enterprise accounts, get ready to watch opportunities disappear. Headcount has been held ""steady"" in San Francisco since January 2019, and in 8 months the office has decayed from 6 floors full of sales reps to a mere 2 floors as of 9/1/19. It makes sense, though. Now that businesses are aware of self-serve ads and can access them any time, there's no need for reps to call the same businesses and scam them out of cash over and over again.

Once you've realized that Yelp's local sales model is pretty broken, and you don't feel good about yourself that you're a part of it, the little things begin to add up. The loud EDM music pumping throughout the office, the 3+ daily ""roundups"" with your 25 year old manager who provides no valuable insight as to how to improve in the job role, the ""incentives"" that are downright insulting. ""Close 2 deals and leave at 3:30 on Friday!"" When you leave Yelp and get a big kid job, you'll see that a ""Summer Friday"" means that lots of people simply leave early on Fridays in the summer, because the company knows that no one is doing anything anyway. You won't have to chip in $20 of your own money to go to a COMPANY SPONSORED EVENT. You'll realize that the level of micromanagement here IS NOT NORMAL. You'll have better incentives to work than breakfast burritos (so insulting). And you'll realize you're more than a vessel for a manager to barge. You deserve better.

I could go on and on about things you already know. The review software is sketchy. Reviews DO disappear after advertisers cancel with Yelp. PTO and sick time are not nearly enough.Your office DOES feel like a cult with the constant cheering, clapping, fake-motivational stories, and gong hits."

Name recognition","Was excited to work at Yelp truly believed in the product and company until I actually saw the truth.  They actually do hire 100 people every month it’s pretty clear the job is the joke they act like it is. Commission structure is absurd you will have to sell far more than they ever tell you to ever make anything livable. In New York City it’s honestly disgusting what they pay you and doesn’t at all compete with comparable jobs/companies. No bs snacks, swings and happy hours will make up for that! You will truly feel like you are in junior high again. One of the last straws was literally taking time out of the day to go upstairs and play “Indian chief” with another team? What? I’m sure that was “CODA” managers are sleazy and inappropriate and their young age and inexperience contributes to that.

Constant games, jokes, screaming and yelling which your people on the phone will ask you about. You all go to lunch at exactly 12:00 every day like school children. People literally ride skateboards through the office. If you worked hard for a degree please do something better with it than this. 

Oh! If you ever decide you don’t want to drink their koolaid anymore and act like a child and not like you are literally working at a real job and decide to give your two weeks. Most managers will instead just tell you to leave that day instead so be ready! I saw it multiple times. Probably because they don’t want you telling the honest truth to HR in an exit interview which you won’t be given if they persuade you not to even finish.

Customers will literally tell you over and over to stop contacting them. They will beg you. You will be instructed to keep calling them and from the words of a manager “it’s not your job to decide to call them” “you just have to keep calling them”

Your sales territory is most likely awful and you will have to keep it for months on end even after you have exhausted it. I honestly feel disgusted for all the times I was made to hit the gong. 

I was 37k over quota and 14k over multiple months and was STILL constantly bothered and pressured about doing more."

Their advertising program simply does not work. I was over quota ever month I was there but nearly every client canceled within the first month.  The company only requires you have a client retention rate of 19% which is less than 1 in every 5. That's LOW.

Most of the businesses that I called have been reached out contact by email or calls over 100 times in the last year or 2. Many of those business owners are frustrated or angry with our called. I was told several times to stop harassing them. 

Managers will tell you not to put them on the do not call list unless they EXPLICITLY say the exact words. For example: a business owner told me to 'take me off your list to call and never call me again' but my manager directed me not to put them on DNC list. This happened multiple times and is the accepted practice there.

Training managers are focused on their own development and it can really be transparent if they get frustrated at you. Though I tried not to take it seriously when it happened because they were new to managing people.

You're encouraged to fight with business owners. Its really bizarre.  

The reputation of Yelp is really bad. After joining another company everyone heard from either a business owner, former employee or somewhere about their sales practices. 

Territory burnout is in full throttle and it's becoming hard to find people who having had bad experiences with Yelp or canceled once already or have been called 100 times. You will be calling the same businesses 6 times every each month or 2. Executive management is pushing the sales teams very hard to hit growth numbers.

-Essentially this job is having you call local business owners (usually in very small towns) and make them stop what they're doing in the middle of the day and get them to a computer to pitch them for around 30-45 minutes and then push them to spend around $300-$450 dollars a month on a product that *most likely* won't even work for them. 

-When you don't succeed at that, your manager is most likely going to round you up and ask you ""what happened"" and make it seem like this is your fault even though everyone is literally following the same exact script

-It is very easy to get screwed over with territories. And everyone is still expected to book 20K regardless of their territories. They tell you that all the regional territories are equal, but they're definitely not. 

-70% of the managers at Yelp do not have good sales acumen, but rather had great territories as Sales Reps themselves back when business owners still had hope that Yelp ads could work for their business and were able to close a lot of deals. 

-The demographic of people you will be calling, if you start 2019 and beyond, will be business owners who have already tried the program and canceled it and it will be your job to convince them to resign again. 

-Very tedious job, cold calling all day can definitely take a toll on your emotional health. I had a doctor once tell me that he sees so many people from Yelp in his office who usually have very high cortisol levels as a result of this job

-Very frat/sorority vibe to the office, they do try to be more diverse but it's a little hard to fit in if you're not a conventionally attractive Caucasian person 

-So many managers are flirting/sleeping with their sales reps, lines of professionalism are usually blurred with management 

-Music is so loud and so is the gong you hit when you close a deal. It's hard for the business owner to take you seriously with all that noise in the background. It's also difficult to focus as well. 

-Most people you call really hate Yelp and you will waste a lot of time explaining the review recommendation software which is also really shady. So much of my job felt like being a therapist to business owners who have gotten screwed over by Yelp. You will also feel like tech support much of the time since most of the business owners you talk to don't know how to use a computer.

I could go on and on about this job, it's brutal. You will learn life lessons like no other but you will also meet some very great people.

Minimum 80 cold calls everyday combined with the constant nagging of managers getting you to hit metrics and why you didn’t get a deal in that day. 
-by the time I left, I felt as if I was in middle school. Having to be at your desk at 8:30am, make dials at 9am, take lunch at 12pm, back at your desk at 1pm, leave at 5:30pm with NO EXCEPTIONS AT ALL. It’s like being locked in a prison, no one wants to call business owners at 5pm on a Friday nor do they want to talk to us!! Yelp is shooting themselves in the foot by having everyone on a tight leash. 
-pay is awful for the work that you put in. Commission structure is geared towards people that close 30-40k on a monthly basis, which is very very difficult. 
-Yelp kool-aid is real. Once you leave, you see how caught up in it people are and don’t realize they’re in a black hole especially with Yelp’s business outlook. 
-Yelp works to please their investors so they don’t care about us on the forefront of things. The stock sucks which means even investors are losing hope. It’s a company that will probably be bought out in 5 years."

When I say they hire anyone I mean anyone.","Unlike all these pompous reviews, I actually sucked at the job. Wasn’t very good. Took me a while to get better. Never made commission due to their shotty structure

All in all working at yelp is literally like being a part of the Mafia ran by a bunch of sociopaths.

From day one, they tell you that you are not as good as you can be. They spend every second shoving yelp down your thirst because they want you to live eat and breathe the product.

The terrible thing is that over time, this product does not work. I did a search in my county (Fairfield county) last week for comic books and received two paid advertisements. One for a mattress store and the other for a music lesson program. How is that at all targeted or a good product? It isn’t. It takes business owners money and that’s all yelp cares about. Yelp needs to restructure its business model and be more business focuses rather than trying to get people to advertise. I left the company because the product didn’t work and I felt like a slimey salesman selling to these people. Not to mention your managers discourage your interacting with clients you signed up. Also my Dog died and after taking a day to recover (which they were annoyed about) I was told to use my emotions as motivation to close deals. I’m sorry but I’m a human being and not a robot. If that doesn’t say everything about this company I don’t know what does. 

Zero opportunity for advancement. They basically carrot and a stick you into doing sales for a year and promise you all
These opportunities that never happen. 

HR is also a joke. So many managers have sexual relations with their reps. Makes sense as to why one person performs so highly on a team. They make an effort to brush stuff under the rug. They fired a director recently for doing these exact things and played it off that they were voluntarily leaving.

They also do a terrible job on boarding
You as a new hire. I asked a question regarding their tax form (yelps) and the head of
HR had the audacity to say “hire an accountant”  I’m sorry but you shouldn’t be head of HR if you cannot help new employees complete tax forms especially when you hire so many fresh grads. 
They also hire you like 4 months out and will randomly call you before and go “Hey can you actually start tomorrow” yeah real professional. All in all working at Yelp is like mean girls."

It's an opportunity to jump into a full cycle/closing role w no experience

I met a lot of great people who I will remain friends with. The people are actually awesome -- the reason most people stay is because they make friends. 

Culture is young and fun and very social. Feels like going back to college, in a good way. TBH it's kinda fratty as a whole (welcome to sales), but also diverse enough that you'll find all sorts of people from all over

It is really a great job if you are just moving to sf. you'll meet a ton of people and have an instant social network, plus you'll get experience in ""tech"" which is the only game in town atm

It's literally a job you don't have to think about after work. You'll never be asked to work overtime. As long as you can leave your crappy day at the door mentally, it's a great job to figure out what you want to do with your life or work on a side project

Benefits are great, fully paid kaiser or blue shield, gym reimbursement, 401k match (but the compensation is ridiculously low so it kinda evens out)

Before they announced the hiring freeze in sf, it used to be a great company to accelerate your career by moving into sales mgmt. do well here and you could be a mgr in 1 year. that's no longer the case though.","this job is brutal. you are interrupting small business owners in the middle of their day trying to get them to pay money to a company that the majority of them hate. you will get abused multiple times a day and either develop a thick skin or quit. 

yelp doesn't pay anywhere close to the industry standard. unless you are in the top 1% of the office you're going to be making less than any entry level sdr/bdr at any legit tech company in the bay area. i mean they literally start you at 40k no commission. in san francisco! lmao. 

the product doesn't really work most of the time. you will see most of the people you sign up cancel within a month or two. then you will get hit with huge commission chargebacks where you end up owing yelp money because your clients cancelled. never mind the fact that we are taught to sell them on the fact that it is super flexible.... yelp ads are no - term contract, no cancellation fee. which means reps do our job and make the sale, then yelp penalizes us because the product doesn't work. 

there is a complete disconnect between executive level decisions and the realities of the sales org. most of the focus goes into developing new ""products"" instead of making sure the core product (reviews and ads) actually works. 

the longer you work here the more you realize yelp doesn't care about business owners. it doesn't take very long to realize that yelp doesn't care about their employees either. 

AE at Yelp is not the same as AE at almost any other tech company. When you do leave you'll realize you are a good candidate for SDR/BDR roles, but most tech companies (and certainly almost all SaaS companies) aren't going to hire you for a closing role. Putting up big numbers at Yelp isn't going to impress them - you're not selling a technical product and its a very transnational, non-complex sales process. You're a good candidate for an sdr/bdr job after 6 months at yelp. If you're going to get that job anyway, there's not much point in sticking around more than a year."

you need to sell 15k before you can make commission. and its commission after the 15k. most people average 18k if they have a good territory.

They under pay in almost all parts of the business and overpay on director levels. There is zero onboarding process, it’s up to your manager alone to determine how you will ramp up. By this, i mean most companies will have formal training on what is yelp 101, how does yelp make money, what is the yelp product and what are the companies policies/procedures, or what does the annual reviews look like. NONE of that exists at yelp in any formal way, you will fill out surveys here and there about your experience but it goes into a black hole and nobody talks about it. I’ve also had experiences (along with others) where a manager would tell me i have for example 5% raise and when the letter comes, its 2% simply because the cfo needed to trim dollars somewhere. To add to this, we had hints of a shooter in one of the buildings, a fellow sales rep. despite this, managers encouraged sales reps to continue working disregarding their safety. Cops came to arrest the guy. Culture woman sent out an email to the company addressing what happened that following email, thanks but no thanks, because if the shooter acted any earlier we’d be dead and that evening email doesn’t help."

1689,Yelp,Continuously Improving -- People here are 5-star!,2019-06-13,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I worked at Yelp for over 2.5 years. I started out as an account executive where I struggled. Something that is so great about working here is the culture and investment the managers actually have in your life. If it weren't for my managers and the teams that they grow -- I would've quit because the day to day can be very grueling. I think the daily expectations (what sales leaders expect of you) are true and you need to figure out how to hit them so you can be successful. When I started they truly painted the picture of growing and figuring it out on your own, but sometimes I felt a lot of pressure and fear of having performance conversations. They've done a lot of training in terms of management, because when I started out -- I had some moments were feedback felt on the spot in front of everyone and sometimes people struggle with anxiety. This can cause a huge mental health issue in the workplace and throughout my time - HR started to implement 24/7 therapy. Like I mentioned, continuously growing. I learned so much about myself, sales, and cold calling. It truly is a discipline that everyone should learn BUT the people here are the best you will ever meet! I met people here that I didn't intend on becoming best friends with but even after leaving for other opportunities -- I hope I continue to know these colleagues forever. If you are looking for a challenge, but a place where you will feel supported -- this is a great out of college job. You will learn some amazing communication skills, negotiation, sales, organization, and persuasion techniques. Most of all -- YOU will become successful you just have to listen what management is telling you. The biggest highlight is also how transparent they are in kickoff office-wide meetings. I am constantly impressed with how they are able to get everyone on the same page with such a large number of people across the US. Your team will hold incentives, and managers are taught to break down numbers into attainable portions so that you feel like you can actually hit your number. You will have fun on the phones and probably overcome a lot of fears. If you get an offer here -- take it!","I really only have a few cons:
--I wish expectations of how hard the job is at first were really set in the interview (I do think they are working on this, I've seen it drastically improve over the years)
--I think they need a therapist in the office or more time to actually have a 10 minute break. Sometimes I felt nervous to get up and go to the bathroom or kitchen for a glass of water because people stare at you, your manager will ask you were you were, and it can feel pressured at times because the role is so fast-paced.

There is favoritism and it's unchecked. You can switch teams but you need a mentor in-house or you can't move up. Executive management is not transparent enough. Anyone who Googles Yelp gets more information from Yelp management than employees do. It can sometimes be frightening so you have to try and not obsess over it.

Not even close to what most tech companies will pay for a similar role. Technically commission is uncapped in the sense of how many sales you can close, but the commission is capped at a certain deal size which means i could close someone at $15/day or $30/day and still get the same commission.
2)You're essentially doing an AE job with no SDRs, just cold calling off a list of people who don't want to keep hearing back from Yelp and you're expected to talk them into it.
3) I often had people call me angry about unrecommended reviews or billing, and Yelp is super non-transparent about these processes with their sales staff. I'm not asking for the inner workings of this stuff, but it would help to be able to offer a better explanation to clients rather than just spew the same exact words off the website. 
4) While I was really happy with immediate management (most of whom were promoted salespeople), upper management is vague and doesn't tell you much about what's going on with the company- they were talking about closing down the SF sales office while I worked there and it was nebulous and nobody knew what was going on for months."

The retention of advertisers: The problem they have, is that they claw back commission without explaining the exact process or why it's being done. When you ask management, they claim they don't know how it works either. They take your commission checks, and just expect us to not make a peep. They take advantage of recent college grads.

There's also complete transparency through out the company. Yeah the pay was not great, but people were paid and promoted based on numbers.

You will learn how to face a lot of rejection","1. This is nothing more than a glorified call center. Don’t let the lovely office fool you. You strictly have 1 daily task and that is to make 80-100 dials to small businesses.

2. The office is filled with high school drama. All managers drink the kool-aid and will try to shove yelps agenda down your throat all day every day. You will know who is sleeping with who and if you don’t hang out and date strictly people from yelp, you barely have a shot in hell of moving up no matter how well you do.

2. The micromanagement is unreal. You will feel like you are in high school and managers are the teachers. They will be on you every time you go to the bathroom or go to fill your water bottle.

4. Yelp ads are a dying product. May businesses have already tried it with no success. But you will be forced to call these people and try to sell the same obselete product over and over again.

5. Sales tactics are bordering on harassment to business owners. You call the same people 3-5 times a week reguardless of if they show interest or not. About 75 of your calls will be hang ups, voicemails or getting yelled at and begged to please stop calling. You will get 5-8”call me backs” that you will probably never hear from again. And 1 yes if you are lucky.

5. This job is mostly luck of who your manager is and what territory you have. They will try to tell you in training that territories don’t matter. But that is flat out not true. If you call a major city you have a chance. But most likely you will start off calling the middle of nowhere. Good luck with that.

6. Google is flat out a better product for small businesses. And buisness owners are learning that at an exponential rate.

7. You are basically lying to small business owners for the sale. Yelp makes promises they can’t deliver. And 90% of the time, a businesses Cpc sky rockets once they sign up for ads. Leaving them with a high bill and no results.

8. Managers will pound into your head that money does not equal reviews. But the majority of businesses that have stopped working with yelp have seen their positive reviews disappear. It’s sketchy"

I respect my manager possibly more than any other person because he’s a stellar human being.,"You call business owners who have been over-prospected, for years. At some point calling with the help mentality just becomes battering a human into paying you money. It’s argumentative and frankly a schit show. One pitch cant possibly work for 25 different industries. A lot of businesses simply aren’t a good fit, but don’t stop pitching or fighting for them to put their credit card in because then “you just don’t want it enough” or “you’re not owning your own development”. 
Goodness gracious it’s an uphill battle. But hey, if you like arguing and being pushy you will truly thrive. Here’s the thing it’s easy to do the job, it’s extremely hard to make money from it. Commission checks are great if this is your first job out of college, but then you realize that closing 20K and getting around $500 a month is not going to pay the bills. There are so many chaotic moving parts and it’s impossibly hard to consistently close so they make you focus on hyper minuscule behaviors to try and account/measure for not “being successful” there. If I had to do it again I’d probably not work for Yelp, but since I am an extremely positive person I have to say I did learn a lot. Like how this job is unsustainable and they give you lots of bro culture and free food with blaring music to distract you. They all know the job sucks and people quit ASAP so they honestly try to make people stay but once you’re out they totally turn on you.But hey if another killer company recruits you because they see yelp on  your resume and they know you’re taught to sell until the other person hates you, then I’m grateful to say yes and get out and give a real sales position a go. I mean just look at how many people are in their hiring classes, they are fully prepared to lose hoards of people any given day.

Email me why didn't and what went wrong?"" Too many roundups with the SAME EXACT INFORMATION EACH TIME, gets tiresome. Energy on the pod seems low? Lets all just clap obnoxiously or stand up while we make dials - laughable, it's like we're children. If you're not performing well some days you get degrading emails from you manager or floor director. There's crappy incentives to attempt to motivate folks to crank out dials. It's a toxic, competitive environment that plays favorites because high producing reps get better territory opportunities. Low base pay and commission not entirely worth it unless you move departments or get promoted.

Some other less serious pros: 
If anyone from MTV/VH1/E! is reading this - pick this up for your next reality show idea. Yelp NYC would also make an EXCELLENT focus for a college level psychology course study.","I’ll start with the obvious red flags. First, the company is no longer growing, there are performance based layoffs, and they’re even  “relocating” San Fransisco sales (AKA dissolving). Hiring is halted in Phoenix and Chicago as well. Aside from the new DC office and the ever growing NYC office, increasing headcount is not a priority for Yelp anymore. That is a fact that was stated in a monthly kickoff meeting. Next, Yelp isn’t retaining advertising clients and investors are worried. The new no term contract model that was implemented fully about a year ago is a massive #fail and Yelp retained 0 net clients. Check it. That was published. The stock prices have flatlined/dropped and a big change has to be coming. Some people speculate a possible sale. Since there are no terms on the advertising we sell, clients have the ability to turn off their ads as they please. Reps are initially compensated on the hope that the average client stays advertising for 3 months. If the client turns off their ads before then, the rep is punished in the next commission cycle. Managers are in such a transaction/dialing mindset that they’re not teaching their teams how to maintain client relationships after the sale. Reps aren’t making money anymore because of this. Lastly, there have been 3 directors, several senior managers, and hundreds of reps leave the NYC office in the past 12 months. Yelp is resorting to hiring managers from outside companies because pickings are so slim and have been detrimental to retention internally. Perspective employees: please beware of joining a company where growth is at a standstill and opportunities are becoming more limited on the inside. 

Since the company is strapped to find quality leadership candidates they resort to hiring inexperienced, immature, and unintelligent reps internally to take on teams of 10-14 reps. They’ve created a “system” (Leadership Development Program) as an attempt to remedy the situation, but this is just where the micromanaging begins. Team culture is taught to be toxic and managers are trained to invade your life in the most unhealthy ways. Teams have group chats in and outside of the office, so you can never escape the daily anxiety when you’re trying to relax at home after work. There are multiple reports of directors and managers sleeping with reps. Some managers will aggressively micromanage you with screenshots of metrics, pings, and constant reminders that other people are working harder, and “where are you???” texts at 8:31AM. If you do decide to give Yelp 2 weeks notice, some managers will ask you to leave right on the spot. Yelp promotes a very specific type of person into their exclusive leadership squad, and the majority of those people lack emotional intelligence, empathy, and basic social skills. I was told “no” more times than I was told “yes” at Yelp. In reality what they’re looking for are leaders that they can easily brainwash into creating more little dialing machines. If you’re a genuine thinker and challenge the norm here, look at other companies that have more options for upward growth where you can actually contribute to building something.

Here are some examples of inappropriate and unprofessional behavior I’ve experienced at Yelp as a direct result of the reps that they are choosing to reward with leadership positions: I’ve seen a rep sleep with one of their clients, complain on a daily basis, have the lowest metrics on the team, and then GET PROMOTED INTO MANAGEMENT!!!! I’ve also had a manager separate our team into extremely obvious “A” and “B” squads to the point where they would round up reps that weren’t producing separately from reps that were doing well. The purposeful separation was obvious and manipulative AF.  I’ve heard managers audibly complain in the kitchen about resignations and how lazy their reps are. Managers only hang out with each other getting drunk at bars with their reps every single night. If reps are on the verge of quitting, less experienced managers will tell them they they're not trying hard enough. Come to find just a simple manager switch to someone more senior makes those same reps produce 40K+. Leadership will use encourage social media use so you can see them going on lavish vacations. You’ll think to yourself, “One day that will be me!!!! Just 6 more months until I’m promoted!” They WANT you to see how successful they are so you stay longer to make THEM more money. But don’t be fooled. That won’t be you, and that opportunity won’t come. 

One time a VP came to do a “fireside chat” and told a cute story about keeping a positive mentality. Her story involved her being pregnant while her house was being renovated. When she gave birth her house still wasn’t finished and she had to couch surf in all of her rich friend’s houses and got sick of it. So then she just “jetted off to Mexico for a month and made the best of it!!!!!” Must be nice, so glad I can definitely do that with my $50,000 base salary you silly and immature WENCH. And finally, whatever form of fake support you feel from your managers/directors when you’re working with them will immediately disappear as soon as you leave the Yelp nest. I was unfollowed by some people at Yelp on social media quicker than you can say “pull out your phone and go to yelp.com.” Thanks for ""totally being there if you ever need me."" :) This is the kind of example senior leaders at the company are setting.

Another unhealthy component at Yelp is the gossip culture. Upper management is doing very little to help the situation by not addressing the obvious manager AND rep retention problem. Personnel changes are kept secret until the very last day of the month and you’re told to just deal with the “change is a good thing and happens every 30 days at this psychotic institution!” mantra. The change is so often here with managers quitting, getting demoted, etc that some reps go through as many as 5-6 managers A YEAR. As you can imagine, this is less than ideal when trying to develop professionally and perfect your craft.

From what I experienced on the inside; The CULTure that Yelp breeds is unhealthy and unprofessional, and just plain distracting. Group think is extremely powerful especially when dealing with hundreds of Type A/borderline ADHD millennials that are fresh out of college life. Everything about the culture is built to entice and manipulate employees to stay past their limit when in reality this job isn’t designed for anything past a 1.5-2 year career path. Yelp hires people who will become your best friends, and THAT’S ALL PART OF THEIR PLAN. Everything about the culture they have built makes Yelp a breeding ground for weight gain, anxiety, depression, lack of motivation, and the stifling of creativity. Worst of all, the repetitive nature of the position will cause you to lose braincells. Sure, I can manage a pipeline like a pro and rip open calls like nobody’s business, but the amount there is to learn out there in the real advertising and sales world is astronomical compared to what you’re taught at Yelp. Title changes and “promotions” like 5-9 and franchise are literally made up and require no more skill than local. It’s all the same. You will not learn how to properly prospect and maintain client relationships at Yelp. And be prepared for that to be brought up when you’re interviewing. Go elsewhere and learn how to be a real salesperson."
1727,Yelp,Okay,2019-05-15,3.0,Sales Associate,Good experience just starting off,Not  a company i wanted to move forward with
1728,Yelp,I've worked a lot of place. Hands down best experience I've ever had,2019-05-14,5.0,Account Executive,The environment is amazing. So much energy and friendly competition. It's a big family that constantly holds me to a higher standard and pushes me to be better daily.,The job itself can be exhausting. You have to have a strong will and choose to make it fun.
1729,Yelp,Two year review,2019-05-14,4.0,Account Executive,"When you start hitting quota and above you can make good money at this company. What is frustrating are reps on the floor who say they don't care and when they don't hit quota it's because they were not trying. If you try in this job, want to make money and you care about being a better human being and better at sales to then lead you somewhere else whether it be here at Yelp or another company, you will be happy you cared. If you put in the effort, your manager, director and head of office will care and help you get there. The fact that I can also talk to my director and head of office by putting time in their calendar is absolutely amazing. This separates Yelp from a lot of companies by bringing in those connections throughout the office. You can also get to know senior reps and managers very easily as well and if you utilize them right away, you will be 1000 steps ahead of someone who does it in their 2nd month. The connections I have made at this office are absolutely incredible. Co-workers who have the same values as you, surround yourself with those people because they will make you a better person and encourage you through the tough times. This job is tough but if you can develop thick skin, have fun and genuinely want to help people grow their business then you will really enjoy yourself at Yelp.","I appreciate that Yelp gives opportunity to everyone but it is very clear from my perspective that they value the more diverse reps, managers, etc than others. It is also very clear this is a very liberal office. If I were to ever say anything that I do not agree with or not like what our office does, it would widespread throughout the office and would be seen as a horrible person to have a difference of opinion. 

When it comes to promotion with management, I believe that it shouldn't only be numbers because it feels as though that it should include numbers and what you have contributed to the company. I also understand, in this job, you need to understand your process perfectly so you can help your team know how to do so, so in turn make money for this company."

Yelp did a fantastic job explaining the job description. They were very transparent regarding the day to day tasks and objectives of the position. Everyone was very nice and supportive! Management cares about their employees and they make you feel important. You also never have to worry about breakfast or lunch with a fully stocked kitchen.","Working as an Account Executive for Yelp was the worst job I ever had. 

Here is why this job is so terrible:
 
1. 80 - 100 Cold calls per day, it sounds easy but its not. 
2. The local businesses are tired of Yelp sales calls and they just don't want to talk. 
3. You know the business owner that yelled at you two days ago and told you ever to call back? You'll be calling them in another two days. 
4.  Be prepared to be micromanaged on almost every call, these managers will make you sell their product to anyone that can breath. 
5. The work is extremely unfulfilling and at the end of the day those success stories are a small fraction of the business owners using Yelp. 
6. Yelps sales tactics are aggressive and pushy so be prepared to burn really good leads with these sales tactics. 
7. Everyone is drinking the Yelp Kool-aid and if you speak out you will be seen as negative."

Definitely a work hard play hard mentality, but you get rewarded for being a top performer and can easily make 2-3k/month in commission within 6 months in an entry level sales role. Also, If you perform well in the first 16-24 months there is a ton of opportunity to move into management, mid market, and the client partnership division. Name another company that gives you that opportunity. They have trainings and development content at every level which is great. Amazing first sales job.

I think too many entry level reps expect their first job out of college to be this amazing experience. If you give it time the job will come to you. I know Sr. Account Executives that have been there for 2+ years making 100k+/year.

Benefits are the best I’ve ever seen.","You get what you’d expect at a big company. A lot of cold calling and entry level employees which can make it seem unprofessional at times.

-I’ve met some great people and made some amazing friends working here.
- They have a lot of snacks and drinks to choose from.","Where to begin...

- Management:
Management here is a complete mess. They promote people who are in their early 20’s and have zero experience.  Every person on my team  has been yelled at, publicly shamed, and forced to stand up  at their desk to” bring energy”. 
They encourage you to guzzle Red Bull and coffee to stay wired, and will berate you for taking your LEGAL breaks, and micromanage you to no end.
I have witnessed managers on multiple occasions reading people’s google ping messages behind their back, and even once saw a manager pick up an employees phone and start reading their texts. They are all a walking HR violations. 

-Culture:
The selling tactics managers encourage are downright sleazy,  misleading, and borderline harassment. 
You are encouraged to call business owners multiple times a day for months on end, lie about who is calling to get to an owner, and sound misleading as possible when it comes to what the program offers, and pricing. There is absolutely no respect for your clients and no relationship building. You’re supposed to see them as dollar signs vs people, and never acknowledge any of their real concerns. You are a used car salesman making a lot less money.
Your manager forces lines to you over the phone, and basically bully biz owners into buying a program that usually fails them. 
The quota structure and charge backs are basically In place to make sure the company pays you as little as possible on top of a minuscule 40k base. 
PTO is minimal and you’re supposed to log every single hour.
They will consistently tell you all territories people are calling into are equal, and it’s all about “mindset”. THIS IS A LIE.  Calling into a tiny rural town, and calling into SF, are NOT equal. This will make or break your career here.
Calling in sick is looked down upon, and your manager will text you to come in half day even if you are dying of a fever. 
You are forced to make 80 dials a day, NO MATTER WHAT. Your manager will remind you of this maybe 59 times a day, minimum. 
Revenue trumps everything, even your mental well being and health.
This place is a gossip mill, managers included.
Upper management will never acknowledge any negative news or struggles the company might be facing. There is a very creepy propaganda style mentality that everything is always sunshine and rainbows despite stock plummeting, active shooter scares, the hiring freezing, the Billion Dollar Bully documentary coming out, and  other issues.  

If you’re even considering leaving the company, or ask any real questions, they will belittle it all. Do not let them convince  you that Yelp is the be all , end all.  They will try to brainwash you into thinking it’s the best place to work and you’re lucky to be there. DO.NOT.BELEIVE. THEM.
If your top performers are quitting as soon as they can, there’s a problem here."

* Yelp is not one of FAANG and generally speaking a medium sized business. Engineering department looks fairly lean. This mean it is quite unlikely board is going to dump hundreds of workers in the end of a year to improve financial reports - practice quite common in big companies.
* Can't tell about other departments but culture in engineering is nice and chill. I worked as a contractor with big companies previously and it was a breath of a fresh air since I've joined Yelp.
* Opportunities for growth - plenty of them.
* Yelp is a public company, you are not paid in promises, shares you get are convertible to real money instantly.

* No dry cleaning service.
* No gym
* No showers (critical if you're biking)
* No Uber/Lift credit to get to/out of office. You pay for your transportation/parking yourself. You can pay for Bart/Muni/parking pre-tax though.

Directors and managers only care about the top performs.   If your not good luck getting help from them.  They will make your struggle for real to help.  In training was told it’s in possible to get fired for not hitting your numbers. Well that’s a lie.  I have known so many people getting fired for not hitting their numbers.   Parking is a freaking mess. You don’t get an assigned spot until 10-11 months in.  Which your in the mercy of Scottsdale PD. 
Instead of hearing the business owners its sell sell sell.  No relationship building for them to even trust us.  God forbid if you move Off the script.  It’s like the WWIII.  

The biggest turn off, the review dump in November.  Its  clear  every  business owner and  sales reps knew something happened overnight.  I had a customer I was working with the night before that had 15 reviews on their page and the next day 2 reviews. The rest un recommended clearly something happened and   Corporate wouldn’t say anything.   We are the voice of Yelp and when we call we should be able to dig deep into customers issues but nope it’s to turn them into a sale. Push push push.  Then if it’s clearly not a good fit it’s what did you do wrong. You didn’t get their need or value. No it’s not a good fit for that business owner. You can’t win them all but it’s wrong if you don’t.  

I feel bad for some business owners cause you have several sale departments calling them all at the same time.  It’s non sense.  You should have all sales people be able to sell all the products for a one stop solution.  Not have 6 departments calling them.  They even have an up-sell department to call them and make them spend more money on ads.  

They don’t listen to their paying customers.  Listen to the business owners and figure out what the platform mean to them.  It’s an amazing tool but lacks human touch and too far gone in the politics."

The friends, but you can make friends anywhere. Don’t subject yourself to this torture just to make a few good fiends.","The definition of torture is:
the action or practice of inflicting severe pain on someone as a punishment or to force them to do or say something, or for the pleasure of the person inflicting the pain. Yelp hits every aspect of this definition. 

Do you know what Guantanamo Bay is? It’s yelp, the United States government sends terrorists to yelp to work in order to extract valuable information out of them. It’s like mental warfare. 

In all seriousness, yelp is hell. When you first start you will be amazed by the modern office and culture. As the days and weeks go on you will find yourself waking up less and less excited for work. Your happiness will be sucked from you and your only happiness will come from the freedom of Friday evenings. 

You’re expected to make 80 dials minimum a day along with 2.5 hours of talk time. If you fail to do so you will have meetings with managers and possibly directors to figure out the problem. You will find on the phones that no one wants to speak to you EVER. You must kick and scratch your way to speak to anyone about yelp and even then they are weary about signing up. You spend 8 hours of your day on the phone with minimal interaction with coworkers because of the stress to hit your numbers. 

Eventually you will consider quitting, without another job lined up because you have reached rock bottom and hate who you are as a person. I am still in this boat, but have another job lined up making double the money, just waiting out the last few weeks before I make my glorious exit and never look back. 

The mental stress from this job is not healthy. There will be days that you will be on the cusp of a mental breakdown because of the thought of speaking with a business owner who has cussed you out 7 times before for calling. 

The commission structure is a joke. Must sell 30k before commission is unlocked and then each month after must sell 12k before you even see a commission check. At 20k you get a $1000 check but after taxes it’s 600-700. They will show you the top reps in the company making 100k-200k but it’s only a select few who get lucky territories and inbound calls. Most reps in the company don’t hit their number. It’s an obvious flaw in yelps structure if so many people miss. There are so many other sales jobs that are less stressful and have more aggressive pay. 

I’m a month 7 rep and have 14 team members. 10-11 of them feel the same way I do and are seeking new employment. RUN don’t walk from this job. For the love of god, do not take this job."
1785,Yelp,Great place to start,2019-03-29,4.0,Account Executive,Great atmosphere and plenty of resources.  Great chance to gain some credibility and network.,A little too rah-rah. No matter how well you are doing personally managers are are stressed out and overwhelmed as most likely the rest of your team is not hitting there numbers.
1786,Yelp,Inbound Tech support for Restaurants leveraging premium suite of products,2019-03-27,4.0,Restaurant Support Manager,Great team environment. Excellent management. Product and engineering takes feedback seriously.,Pay is low. Opportunities aren’t clear
1787,Yelp,Happy to be gone,2019-03-27,2.0,Account Executive,"You will meet some good people. However, they will be out the door very soon. It's a tough role but you will learn how to sell which will be a lifelong skill to have in whatever industry you pursue after Yelp. PTO, Kitchen, great location.","The sales strategy they have in place is over the top. I get it from an economic standpoint to maximize profit but I am convinced it will hurt Yelp in the long run. The fact that we call the same business's over and over again until they hate Yelp so much will backfire and is represented in the stock price to an extent. Think about it, there's only a finite amount of local businesses out there. And the more bridges Yelp burns, the less opportunities there will be years from now. 

Next, is the fact that the product is mehh at best. Sometimes it can produce results, sometimes it will not produce any jobs at all. However, that is advertising in a nutshell. One of the big indicators of their success is the market they are in. But don't worry because ""every territory is the same and Yelp works for every industry out there!"" Luckily, I had okay territories over my tenure but to say they are all the same is the biggest lie. Manhattan compared to middle of Ohio is not comparable and you will see some reps having trouble hitting their numbers because of this.

One of my biggest issues with Yelp’s sales strategy is the high pressure sales tactics to force business owners to put down a credit card that day. Absolute bonkers to me. Why today? Because you don't want them to do their own research because they may stumble upon the great reviews in the Yelp For Biz Owners (1.8/5). Furthermore, Yelp blocks people from writing comments on their Youtube videos (Why Does Yelp Recommend Reviews). Pretty funny, when Yelp is known as a review site, but will censor people’s voices about Yelp when the opportunity rises.

Additionally, the pitch is very misleading, you will hear the number 92 way too often and when you actually read the results of the study it is very vague as 92% of people make a purchase ""sometimes, frequently or almost always"" after visiting the site. Raises questions as to how spread out to how many people selected sometimes compared to almost always.. would be interesting to see the full study rather than the Yelp crafted post in the Yelp blog. Also, we will have ‘X’ amount of opportunities to show your Ad which will be targeted. Then you will see how many searches have happened in that area and it will be 1/50th of the amount of opportunities. (Grant it I know a lot of these opportunities will be on competitors pages but a fair amount will be showing up in categories that is not relevant for that business at all. Yes they won’t be billed if no one clicks on it but I do find it a little shady.) Furthermore, you will hear reps lie and lie about some current advertiser and some success story, and this is all because the managers and higher ups feed you these lines to lie over and over again to make a sale. We talk about selling ethically, but then we will lie and skip over details of what the Cost per click is and so forth. 

Also, Yelp is a veryy liberal company. There has been times when the higher ups will bash Trump during the company meetings for no reason and just really push their agenda. I don’t care who you vote but it is annoying having people push their political agenda. I believe politics doesn’t need to be discussed at work unless it was actually affecting the work we are doing. Yet, Yelp thinks differently and at times make you feel out of place if you lean right.."
1788,Yelp,Learning experience,2019-03-27,3.0,Junior Account Executive,Had great manager  learned a lot about cold calling . Very nice people company.,Training intense and fast but the product extremely hard sell. I just tired begging and it didnt click for me after 4 months I was overly stressed and tired of getting hung up on by the same people over and over. It not every one out of 800 people probably 10 percent or less making great money another 10 percent decent money. The rest of is is just revolving door about 25 to 30 people every month a new class of 20- 30 come in. With all the different apps these days its flooded market.
1789,Yelp,Cold Calling..,2019-03-26,4.0,Account Manager,The people are the pros.,Not a fan of cold calling
1790,Yelp,"Run, don't walk, to your nearest exit.",2019-03-25,1.0,Account Executive,"This job is great for a recent college grad looking to get started in a sales career. The training you receive is outstanding and teaches you sales basics like handling objections, needs assessment, finding solutions where there are none, and understanding how people operate. It also teaches you how to be patient with yourself...because you'll want to lose it on a daily basis. Just wait.

Snacks. Loads of snacks. All kinds of snacks.

The wellness subsidy they give, in addition to the health insurance, is outstanding.","Oh boy. Where do I start..

1) The the job is simply boring. 

You're required to (at minimum) call 80 businesses a day (most you just called two days ago) and try and get someone on the phone. It's no wonder why businesses don't want to work with Yelp simply because we call them SO MUCH. 2.5hrs of talk time is also required of you and if you don't reach that then you're questioned as to why you're not ""extending conversations."" Well..because I have other businesses to call that might want to ACTUALLY SIGN UP rather than answer dumb questions like ""how's the weather"", that's why.

""But, did you bring value?""
""Yes""
""So why didn't they sign up?""
""If I knew why they would have signed-up, now wouldn't they?""

2) The god-awful incentives.

""Three deals and go home!""
""Get to our number and we'll have breakfast in the morning!""
""Close a deal and leave at 5 on Friday!""

STOP OFFERING INSULTING EARLY DISMISSALS. 

STOP OFFERING FOOD AS AN INCENTIVE. 
I'M NOT HUNGRY, I WANT MONEY IN MY POCKET. 

Dangle REAL money in front of people and they're more motivated to do what you want them to do. Dangle a breakfast sandwich in front of me one more time and I might karate chop you in the throat.

3) The mental stress of ""not hitting your number.""

""It's all mental!!"" Listen, it's sales I get it. People miss numbers. But, when a widespread amount of people are just not hitting the mark there's a larger issue there. I've seen people in tears because of the frustration of this position. 100+ calls made every day, in a week, to reach hardly anyone, make no money, and get no further to any type of ""commission"" (I'll get to that in a moment) will eventually get to you. If you are ANYONE with somewhat significant sales experience I would say to avoid this place like the plague. 

4) You don't get to build genuine relationships with business owners

You just don't. You get enough information and chat just enough to make sure they are ""somewhat"" comfortable to sign up with you. Then you kick 'em to customer success and you don't interact with them until they turn off the program (which can happen literally a day later) and they are back in your pipeline, usually, 90 days later. What am I supposed to do with that champ? ""Hey how's it going know you signed up with me and I know I told you it was going to work, but it didn't so hey, WANT TO DO IT AGAIN??""

No.

5) Salary

30k is the minimum you have to sell for Yelp before you even should be discussing commission with anyone.

But, wait, there's more...

EVERY MONTH you have to sell at least 12k before you even sniff a dime of commission. And even then it's pennies until you get way up the ladder.

Now remember, you're making 40k base. So not only are you making over 80+calls, talking to multiple accounts you just called two days ago who told you to shove it, eating ""yelp sandwiches"" every day (because they're free and you can't afford anything else), being fed line for line like a puppet in the hopes of making a sale, but, at the end of two weeks when you look at your bi-weekly pay check you find yourself asking ""that's it?? where's the rest??""

In conclusion, you know that guy in the movie ""Get Out"" that comes running out of the woods and hits a smooth right off the screen never to be seen again?

THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.

RUN."

You feel like there isn’t any job you can’t handle after this job","Where to begin? This is a SALES JOB. SALES. COLD CALLING. 80 DIALS A DAY. GETTING YELLED AT ALL DAY ON THE PHONE. You have to be a slight psychopath to be good at the job. You have to not care about harassing business owners because like it or not that’s what we do. Managers tell you the same things every single day because there’s really not much to change tactically once you memorize the script. Dont get me wrong. It can be extremely uncomfortable to follow word for word because asking for a business owners cell phone number 4 times can be uncomfortable! The only thing you can do is change you MINDSET. Ah, changing your mindset. Yelp loves this phrase! Honestly it means you just have to turn your emotions off! Dial down, push people, and be “assertive”. 

The turnover here is ridiculously high. From my training class of 80 people only 5 remain 1.5 years later. It is also incredibly disheartening to see terrible reviews about Yelp all over the media. Look at the Yelp For Business  Owner review section or their FB, LinkedIn, or Instagram pages."

They had a great company and I thrived working at Yelp for four years but the last year and a half they really went downhill and most people are not making any real money because there are so many chargebacks due to the aggressive sales tactics."
1796,Yelp,Local sales rep,2019-03-16,1.0,Account Executive,Food. Barista. Coworkers . Insurance. Outings.,"Okay so I wasn’t thinking about writing a review about my experience here , but I thinks it’s best if I do. I started the company back in September at the Chicago office. And right off the bat, I knew working in inside sales was gonna be a huge challenge for me . 
If you like the type of job where you gotta sit on your butt all day to make 80 dials then go for it . But here are the cons that come with it . 
- micromanaging is absolutely terrible here. And what I mean is they will constantly be on your back about how many hours you talked on the phone, how many dials you’ve made per hour, and how many people you’ve got to a computer. Etc etc. If you don’t meet their expectations then you will be put down a lot. 
Some of my friends who made big revenue would still  be put down if they didn’t meet their daily metrics. So expect to be watched at all times. One of my managers even complained about me going to the bathroom a lot. Little did she know that I’m a human being that drinks a lot of water that has needs. So expect to be treated like you’re back in middle school. 
- Favoritism: I worked with 2 managers at my time with yelp. The first manager I had always played favorites. If you created revenue , then you will be on their good side. She cared about her income more than the growth of her reps. So my advice is that if you don’t vibe well with a manager, please go to another team immediately . Cause that way you can see if you dislike the job or the manager . (Turns out I just disliked the job) But Managers do take a toll on your experience here. So take that into consideration. 
- Snitching: This goes for the second manager I got. I worked with her for 2 weeks . And I don’t have complaints about her management but I do have a complaint about her sharing my business with my whole team without my consent. I thought I left in good terms, but it came to my attention that she shared the reason I left to my whole team without my consent. I get that you have to address the situation but instead of stating MY personal reasons for leaving , you could’ve just said that I decided to part ways. Easy peasy. I’m currently working on putting a complaint about this. Cause it ain’t fair. 
People always come and go here, it’s rare when you see someone working for more than a year here. So please please think twice before coming here , it’s not the best environment."

The good - the good is the overall culture, and the supportive nature of management - at least from what I have experienced. We are well caffeinated, decently fed, with ample time off and a work life balance. And if you do well, you can make great money after your first or second year. I earned an 18,000 raise in two years , not including commission. I’m on track to make $90k if I bust my hump, $65k if I barely try . It’s extremely diverse and inclusive and we celebrate that at Yelp. I’ve also been around and recognize with benefits and the culture that I’m getting a lot for “free”  and that includes health care which is amazing and a wellness benefit of a few hundred a year. So it’s a financial win for me for sure. 

It’s a fun place to be, and a positive attitude is must .","The Bad: not everyone has great managers, and sometimes morale can suffer.  When rumors fly they go quickly and inaccuracies abound.  Some managers are super responsive to other teams and team memebers, some managers don’t smile , welcome or acknowledge you if you are not in their team even if you’re part of the same director group and they see you every day.  In my opinion all managers should appear welcoming and inviting to everyone. They are leaders ! Leaders can lead strangers too!

The Ugly: Sales is a hard job. You’re calling people on the phone selling them advertising tht many times they don’t want or don’t know that they need. You get hung up on a lot, people cuss at you, say mean things. So that is very challenging but I’ve become more thick skinned at least. I love where I work, I don’t really like my job.

1817,Yelp,mentally crippling,2019-03-06,2.0,Account Executive,"As a disclaimer, a few of the pros I’m about to mention at Yelp inevitably turn into cons, but nonetheless I will include them to show the downward sloping trajectory. It’s a fun job to enter out of college, most people are sharing the same experience: twenty-somethings freshly graduated and awkwardly transitioning into the “corporate world.” Everyone is hyped up on the promise of uncapped commission, happy hour incentives, and a lax work environment. Additionally, it looks good to have Yelp on your resume to new employers - it shows tenacity, the ability to work collaboratively, a competitive nature, and grit. All of these aforementioned qualities look great aesthetically.","I’m going to make an attempt to be as unbiased and neutral as possible here as I lay out my experience at Yelp over the past 8 months. I want to focus on the toxic culture this company breeds, as that should more or less cover the extensive list of cons I have about this company. This toxicity directly stems from the systemic lack of parallel and perpendicular transparency within Yelp. The former issue lies within the transfer of power and communication within said hierarchy: in my case, one director oversaw over one hundred account executives and about a dozen managers. I hesitate to state the obvious here, but that disproportional ratio inverts itself by looking at the larger number (in other words, the account executives) as one whole unit, instead of its proportional parts. We are quite literally treated as a number because our job is to produce numbers (quota) for the company. Now the latter issue lies across the departments of the company, and this can be summed up more succinctly. We don’t have a communications team, which leads to disjointed expectations and promises. There is little to no opportunity of upward movement within Yelp (unless you consistently hit your number and want to interview for a management position, which is half a step up from being an AE) it’s an endless cycle of dials, deals, and gong hits. 

Besides the politics, nepotism, and murky values of Yelp there is one thing that drove me mad: the invariable monotony. 80 dials and over 2 hours of talk time is what is expected of us each day, and once you start treating humans as numbers all logic goes out the window. We follow a script as if it’s bible, are trained to combat “objections” (aka instructed to never take no for an answer), and if you question if this is the right job for you, you’re told you “just need to give it time because it is.” 

For me the biggest problem didn’t lie in the lack of professionalism or respect I felt personally, it was how slowly but surely I realized I was morphing into the very thing I resented all along. I actually began to forget that the business owner’s I was calling and emailing thrice a week had actual life problems, and that these aren’t just “objections” to combat. No time? Let me just show you one thing. Driving? No problem just pull over and we can do this on your phone. No budget? I’m not asking for any money today! Death in the family? My condolences, when would be a good time for you to reschedule? I started to treat people like robots, and just like I was one of over 100 reps, each phone call and person on the other end was just one of the at least 80 other dials I had to make that day."

I like a positive mentality but there is way too much false emotion which is one thing that I can't stand. Some people prefer to sit down, don't force me to stand up.

I have left the Pros largely unchanged because the bene fits are truly amazing and that can't be overstated. I have made significant changes to the Cons, however, because working here will slowly but surely eat your soul. Without further ado, the pros:

- Excellent insurance (100% employer-paid BCBS PPO)
- Fully-stocked kitchen (free breakfast/lunch/snacks/etc)
- Free in-house barista
- $39k base salary
- Strict 8-hour days
- 2 months of training
- $60/mo wellness stipend
- Free beer some days
- Casual dress code
- If you genuinely try and are open to feedback, your job is basically guaranteed for 6 months, even if you never close a single deal","Despite the excellent benefits, working at Yelp will eventually destroy you. The entire environment is engineered to be highly stressful every moment of every day, while simultaneously gaslighting the reps and convincing them that this stressful environment is normal/standard/healthy. The atmosphere is so stressful and toxic that people regularly break down crying, throw up in the restrooms, or quit without a backup plan.

Yelp's sales strategy can be summarized as this: Lure in fresh college grads by promising them a hip young culture, then take advantage of their energy and ignorance of corporate life by working them so hard that they produce a decent bit of revenue before completely burning out and quitting.

Yelp is very quickly losing ground as the market leader because they almost entirely neglect their technology. Rather than acknowledge their shortcomings and working to improve them, Yelp just puts more pressure on its sales force. In fact, the entire sales organization is just a hierarchy of unending stress. Reps are under pressure from their managers for not doing well enough, and those managers are under pressure from their manager, who is under pressure from the head of the office, who is under pressure from HQ. 

You will not grow at Yelp, either personally or professionally. Your job is to pick up the phone 80+ times per day and read a script. You do this 8 hours per day, 5 days a week, forever. You will not learn anything new, and you will have no energy outside of work for self-improvement. You will live and breathe Yelp. 

You will be micromanaged into the ground. Managers are required to be on their feet all day long, pacing around to ensure you remain enthusiastic and stay 100% on-task. I once counted the number of times my manager paced around my desk in a day -- it was in the 90s. If you are even a minute late, your manager will pull you aside and tell you off. In addition to your 1-hour lunch, you have two 10-minute breaks per day (the legal minimum), and God help you if you are away from your desk for longer than that.

The ""team"" culture will be forced down your throat. Your team will have off-site excursions and you will be expected to attend, even though you will not be paid for this time. If your team is not performing to expectations, your manager will bring you into a room and essentially tell you that you need to do better, while providing no valuable feedback on how to do so. Whether or not your team is doing well, expect to have at least 2 team meetings per day.

Something you will learn very quickly is that due to the bad product and manipulative (and unchanging) sales tactics, Yelp is absolutely despised by nearly every small business in the US. Do not mention to any business you frequent that you work at Yelp -- it will not be a pleasant conversation for you.

In addition to all of the above, the clapping, gongs, and bad techno music blasting through the speakers will ensure that you are stressed out of your mind for 8 hours a day. This stress will grow and fester over the weeks and months until you are an empty shell of a human being. But they won't fire you. Oh no, they'll keep you around for months, subjecting you to the same monumental stress and wearing away at your psyche while making you believe this is all normal.

For the love of all that is holy, PLEASE avoid working here. Yelp will absolutely destroy you."

3. You will be unhappy every second of the working day here. Your coworkers will start to drop like flies and you'll realize that you're worthy of more. I don't wish this job upon my worst enemy. The pay is terrible and the work itself is even worse. I would rather be a Starbuck's barista.

I just do not think this job is for everyone! First off, the offer unlimited coffee, and snacks. Sometimes they have a tons of bagels sometimes they don't (go figure). In the time I was with them I saw multiple people get sick, I am not sure if it was the bulk of food they get that went bad (since half these kids think they are privileged they just leave things opened and laying around) . You can meet some amazing people by that I mean maybe a handful! Majority of these kids are nasty. Some nice views, nice offices, and tech! (trying to think what else could be a pro) ohh! they have amazing health insurance (maybe because you will end up needing it in no time)","Ok heres is the best part! I can let it allllllll out! This company is ran like an elementary school or a highschool. I feel like I should raise my hand to use the bathroom because these managers are tracking your every move! I totally understand things like being mindful of breaks and your phone, but there have been times were I took my phone out to check on the time and been given the stank eye. The culture at Yelp is shoving it down your throat that you LOVE Yelp and you are SO LUCKY to be working at Yelp. Our monthly meetings would involve bashing other companies (ex., the head of the office mocked Google's walk out against sexual harassment) and avoiding obvious issues within the company. You are HIGHLY encouraged to attend happy hours frequently and majority of the well performing teams go out multiple times a month. Most of it comes out of YOUR pocket and can fall on weekdays! oh and if you dont show up the next day (shame on you after they force you to go out). Successful managers at Yelp consider Yelp their life (date within the company, have only friends within the company, ITS LIKE A CULT!) Its as if everyone is banging each other. 
Now the job is cold calling  HOWEVER, it's how they approach cold calling. At exactly 8:30 you need to be at your desk ready to go. At exactly 12:00 everyone takes lunch (HR says you can take it anywhere between 11-2 but good luck trying to tell your manager that). They have no flex when it comes to a sales cycle. If it's the day before Christmas or the day before Memorial Day weekend they expect the same despite the obvious fact that sales globally decrease. Your managers get on your calls and feed you line for line what you should be saying. Essentially you are a puppet to your manager. They push you to say uncomfortable things and start yelling on the headsets. It takes zero skill.  No matter how much you do in a day/month/week/etc. it isn't enough and even when you do well, no one is happy there, they just can't tell you that. I know several people who have won the most esteemed awards at Yelp and all HAVE QUIT. You're forced to stand and your desk and ""bring the energy"" like we're 12 year old cheerleaders. The ""rewards"" they give you for closing deals is hilarious. Sometimes it's things like ""Pick out the cup"" or ""Bingo!"" Again, elementary school. There is also nowhere to go up. You can either cold call, manage people who cold call, do higher volume cold calling, or pray to get into Mid Market/National. The mission of your manager is to brainwash employees and use what they say against them. Why should managers stalking your emails and what is being said at work. Management known for being incredibly unprofessional, but there is NO DIVERSITY. Every single director is white. Every. Single. One. This is a company of 1200+ employees and you're telling me there isn't ONE you can promote? Managers are the same and they're all 23-25. They promote people into management extremely early and they are managers for training classes so you're forced to learn from someone who doesn't even know how to do their job. In addition, management is incredibly immature, power hungry and an overall mess. ALSO!!  keep an eye on your managers and directors because they're sleeping with reps and doing obscene amounts of Adderall. Last time someone dropped from so much drugs ! Half of the people here are jumping around like bunnies!! ITS 8AM how TF! are you so wired! 
Now the pay structure - Yelp went from contracts to non-term length commitment so the client can cancel anytime. You have no connection with your clients after you sign them up, and it's frowned upon to check in on them. Yelp pays you out as if they stayed signed on for 6 months so when they cancel (which they do because the product is outdated and doesn't actually work) you wind up owing the company back money. They tell you 20% of your sales needs to stay on for 3 months which seems easy but is not when they can stop and start at any time and you have no control.
Honestly, not the worst place to start for recent grads but check yourself and realize this is not a real job."
1857,Yelp,Work Job Ever,2019-02-09,1.0,Associate Account Executive,There truly are no pros year.. you deserve better,"overworked, underpayed, harrassement of business owners, waste of time and talent"
1858,Yelp,"Great first job, that's about it..",2019-02-08,1.0,Account Executive,"People - Throughout my time at Yelp I created relationships with some of my closest friends, most supportive mentors, and peers that I enjoyed spending my days with. When I left, I was upset that I wouldn't be spending 40+ hours a week with them. 

Perks - As a recent grad with limited income and time, a fully stocked kitchen was huge for me. Not having to worry much about groceries or buying lunch every day took stress off of me. Gym reimbursement, pre-tax commuter benefits, holiday party, etc. Pretty standard for a large corporate company.

Experience - This job is definitely a difficult one, but you will gain the necessary skills and experience to succeed in any role that follows. From my time at Yelp I learned great communication skills and how to deal with the common objections that sales professionals hear. I learned how to manage a pipeline and stay organized with hundreds of accounts at once. I learned how to interact with team members who come from different backgrounds. The job itself made my interviewing process post-Yelp very easy; I had tons of stories and examples to reference and other employers are familiar with what it takes to be an AE at Yelp.","The role - This job is 100% cold calling. Typically, I wouldn't classify this as a con, but the way Yelp's sales process is set up makes it a con. A typical day looks like this: 8:30am: in your seat ready to go. You are calling your accounts from 8:30am to 12:00pm straight through. from 12:00pm-1:00pm the entire office takes lunch (leading to crowded kitchens and shortage of food). Then from 1:00pm to 5:30pm you are calling more businesses. That is your day every single day; the job never changes. Occasionally, you'll have a 30 minute training covering topics you've heard a million times followed by everyone emphasizing the fact that you've been off the floor for 30 min so you need to step it up. The reality of this role is that you will be one rep out of 600-700 in your office, so unless you’re the top performer on your floor, no one will care about your input. When I was in this role, I truly felt what it was like to just be a “number” to an organization. AE’s at Yelp are so replaceable and they bring in at least 60 new college grads every month.

Leadership - In my opinion, this flows from the managers all the way up through the C-Suite. I used to always say that the leadership ""drank the Yelp Kool Aid"". Management will continuously set unrealistic expectations and goals and expect the reps to bust their butts to get there. Don't get me wrong, I'm 100% supportive of setting lofty goals and encouraging your team to hit them, but Yelp's leadership doesn't think logically. The reality of sales is that there are good days and there are bad days; there are also many outside factors that are not in your control. Management acts as if closing is so easy that if you ""want"" to close, you will and if you don’t close, it’s because you didn’t “want” it or had a bad mindset. I’ve had days where I pitch 3+ times and not close anything; not because I didn't do my job well, but because there were outside factors (timeline was off, didn't have the decision maker on the phone, the business just opened and they are in debt with startup costs, etc.) but your manager will ask you where you failed to show them the value of Yelp and how to fix it for the next pitch. Next, you will get e-mails throughout the day from your manager, your director, and even the head of the office, especially when the office is underperforming. Like I mentioned, days have their ups and their downs, but when your team/floor is not closing a lot, your performance will be publicly called “pathetic”, “unacceptable”, “disgusting”, etc. Again, the managers and directors think that closing is as easy as “wanting” it, when the reality is the stars need to align for a deal to come in. Managers and directors are only focused on revenue. I had times where I’d close and have questions about setting up a page, but since the revenue was already booked my manager wouldn’t spend time with me and teach me how to complete this task. Management is somewhat corrupt and there will be a story in the next section that highlights this.

Product - It’s very hard to sell a product that doesn’t work and that you do not believe in. The way advertising is set up is that Yelp charges business owners per click on their ad and clicks do not equate to revenue for these businesses. Throughout our pitch, although we never say the word “guarantee”, business owners are led to believe that paying a couple hundred dollars a month will lead to them gaining thousands of dollars in revenue. So, it’s very typical to see a client you signed up cancel within the first couple months. As an example, August 2018 was my BME (best month ever) and I closed almost $40k in revenue. Out of the 12 or so accounts I had closed that month, only one of them was still advertising in the beginning of October. I received calls, e-mails, and voicemails from these business owners stressing about how it didn’t work for them. Naturally, I couldn’t believe in the product anymore because these clients that had trusted me as an advisor didn’t find success with the program. From then on, I almost felt bad signing up the businesses that I closed. Even worse, here’s an example of the product and management not working as a whole. In the fall, Yelp gave out $300 credits to certain businesses to incentivize them into trying ads. I had account that had this promotion on the account. I called the owner, pitched him, explained how the credit works (the first $300 of your bill is covered by Yelp) and got ready to set up his page. When he logged in, the credit had disappeared so, while still on the phone with him, I asked my manager what we could do. My manager said that we can add the promotion manually through out Ops team so all I had to do was get his card on file (if he wanted to continue past the $300 period) and set up his page. We did that; we got the page set up and the ads were live. After I got off the phone I asked my manager to make sure that credit got applied to his account and my manager assured me that it would. Fast forward two months later; I check on the account in Salesforce and see that he has talked to our Customer Success team complaining that he was charged hundreds of dollars when he was supposed to have the credit. Customer Success told him that a credit was never added and there was nothing they could do. The business owner mentioned that he was going to take legal action and asked to be put on the Do Not Call list. How can I feel good about closing deals when stuff like this happens regularly?? Same thing happened to two of my teammates during my time there. On a separate note, Yelp’s review software freezes revenue right in its tracks. Because of business’s “losing” real, positive reviews I’d deal with people that refuse to pay for Yelp while this software is still in place. They’d literally say “I’d be willing to invest money into Yelp once the review software is fixed”. And to make it worse, as employees we were told nothing about how it worked. So when business owners ask or complain about it all I could say was “it’s a computer, it doesn’t have feelings. It’s out of our control, but what we can control is getting you new business” and then we just move past it as if the business owner doesn’t care about their reviews being hidden anymore. At the end of the day, Yelp ads only work well for certain industries in certain areas. 

Process - Yelp’s sales process is very simple. Call businesses every other day for two weeks at time and close them as soon as possible. Even if they say “I’m not interested, thank you” you have to call them back in two days. Sometimes, if you get hung up on, your manager will make you call them right back. You will be micromanaged, your daily dials will be noted, your talk time will be examined, your quality conversations, etc. everything is heavily analyzed. Somehow it’s your fault if you are reaching a low amount of decision makers per day even with the right amount of dials. Does that make sense? Also, the commission structure is miserable. You need to book $30k in order to just be commission eligible, then you have to do a minimum of $12k to make any commission (at $12k your commission will be $100 before taxes). If your accounts cancel before 6 months, you will owe money back to the company. Anyways, if you’re out of your seat for more than 5 minutes your manager will ask where you were. If you are talking the person you sit next to, you will be told you need to focus. I’ve had team round ups where my manager says that we can’t take anymore breaks because the director noticed people out of their seat. 15 minutes later, I asked to go to the bathroom (which I shouldn’t have had to do) and got a “no” in response. The process has a big Time=Money attitude in the sense that every minute you spend off the floor or out of the office is revenue your team, your floor, your office, the company is missing out on. I think the process is flawed when only one or two reps out of 12 per team hit quota per month. If only less than a third of the reps are hitting their number that should tell leadership that there is a wholistic problem with the way the office operates. But at the end of the day, nothing will change. Leadership won’t change, the job won’t change, the product won’t change. I’d say 80% of employees leave within a year and by hiring 60, 70, 80+ reps each month, it makes up for the people who leave. The sad part is that top performers feel the same way. I sat next to the top performing rep on my floor and he vented to me every day and we both talked about where we were headed next. He was supposed to see a huge commission check after leading our floor in revenue, but he got none of it because he owed it all back to the company with his chargebacks. It’s sad because these fresh grads see the name Yelp as an opportunity to kick off their career but the reality is that it’s a dead end. The “promotion” options for AE’s are simply just calling different types of businesses (Mid-Market/National) or managing a team of AE’s that do the same exact thing you do every day. This plays a big role in why people don’t stay more than a year."

There’s opportunities for growth- but mostly just to do a different version of the same job. If you work hard and do well, you can make solid money despite low base salary.  Benefits were also great despite pay being low for the market.","High school- yelp has tried to get rid of the college 2.0 stigma and in doing so, has made things worse. It is insanely structured and it is very clear that upper management does not trust their employees to act as responsible adults- they push this onto their managers to make sure they are on their AEs about EVERYTHING

Unhealthy environment- for managers, you’re never quite doing enough. They’ll have you breaking your back and spinning in circles if you’re not successful (aka over producing on revenue goals), whether that’s for a couple weeks or longer term, regardless of how hard you’re working.  Retention is made your problem, regardless of factors outside your control. 

Feedback- yelp prides itself in being a very open environment for giving and receiving feedback, but in reality, feedback for the company/product is not well received. Instead, you’ll be told that you’re not bought in and as a result your team isn’t. 

Growth opportunity- while there is a clear and accessible upward path, it is extremely linear- so there is little opportunity to diversify your skill set"

-Great culture
-Amazing people
-Opportunity for advancement
-Taught me to handle adversity and gave me some solid leadership skills.","Felt overworked and underpaid. Teams blew up from 10 people to 15/16 people yet managers were expected to give each person development items and individual coaching every day, while also barging their open calls, while also barging minimum 15 pitches per day, while also closing 5-7 deals every day but then also being told you are making reps too reliant on you if you barge them too much. This leads to my next; TONS OF MIXED MESSAGING. You are constantly told one thing then something completely different.

Management is not supported. There was a VERY brief initiative to do manager trainings that was quickly abandoned. After the change in leadership at the top of the office, office wide manager meetings, which had been an enjoyable constant, became few and far between and most info was dispersed through the Yelp rumor mill.


Managers are told from the COO that they are ""the most important position at Yelp"" but it certainly does not feel that way.

There is no where to really go once you are a manager. The opportunity for advancement is extremely limited.

If it had not been for a specific leader that I worked with, I don't know that I would have lasted as long as I did in this role."

Personal growth. 
The job teaches you tenacity and grit.  
They train you from zero experience.","Okay so here is my rant..

Territories are extremely overworked with multiple touch points every week for years. I feel some biz owners have ptsd or something because when you mention yelp on the phone they have an immediate gut reaction to get off the phone as fast as possible. If your not hyper assertive and go don’t around the objection triangle 3-5 times on every call to get a biz owner to yelp.com you won’t get anywhere and attempting to do this 80 times a day, 5 days out of the week, month after month, you get burnt out quick. 

Also if you have a bad territory prepare for months of not hitting quota. I had a territory where a full comp deal was as much as someone’s mortgage or I’d be calling into a small town in the Midwest an hour away from any big city. Conversely, if your manager likes you and you get lucky enough to get a territory in an affluent, highly populated area then deals come easy. I’ve witnessed this first hand. 

Commission structure is pretty much a scam. You get judged based on your retention rate and  if it falls below a certain threshold they claw back the commission. There is no term commitment with the ad program so most all biz owners stop after month because the product rarely works and you have no control over that. 90 percent of all commission I made at yelp ended up getting clawed back. Really de-motivated me to book a lot of rev and was basically working for the extremely low 40k base."
1869,Yelp,Don’t take the job so seriously,2019-02-02,5.0,AAE,"The people, the outings, the food, the free insurance. All of Yelp is awesome except the job duties itself. That’s at any job. I’ve had lot of jobs up until this one. No matter where you go you’ll get tired of the job duties. So just enjoy the perks at this one. I don’t recommend it if you are just looking for a last minute job to keep you above water before the next one. The people who do well here are patient and ready to stay with the company for at least 5 years. What’s the point if you’re going to leave? You can make so much money if you just listen, apply yourself, and don’t make everything about you. Drama queens are so obnoxious so grow up before you apply, Yelp is flexible, the managers are chill, and if you have any issues you can always change teams. It’s likely if you end up not liking the job or environment the problem is probably you. This is one of the easiest jobs I’ve ever had and the perks are awesome.",People who are negative about the job. Just quit if you’re unhappy. No one wants to hear about how you hate the job. Seriously. This job is not for you if you have a negative attitude. Some of us love it and that’s why we are successful.
1870,Yelp,Unimpressive Telemarketing Job,2019-02-01,2.0,Account Executive,"Getting 1< year of professional experience at a well-known company has opened up opportunities for other entry level roles.

Young co-workers (if that's your thing.) Most people in the office are under 30. The Senior Director/Head of Office is ~35ish.

On that note, the Chicago Head of Office is a great guy. He and the HR dept seem to care deeply about making Yelp a good work environment. Most of the other directors are great leaders and motivators as well. 

Free beer, and free food. Makes it easy to save money. 

Not a place where they fire you swiftly for missing quota a couple times. Everyone gets a pretty comfortable amount of wiggle room and support before they start talking about termination. 

Quick sales cycles - when it works out. If you're comfortable accepting low transaction sizes (and super high output) for relatively quick deals, you'll be happy to hear that one-call closes are pretty common in Yelp sales.","The worst part is the useless and obnoxious managers. Yelp sales is the blind being led by the blind. Most sales managers at Yelp have under 2 years of sales experience before they're promoted, and it really shows. These people don't know how to deal with others, and they barely know how to sell. They act like high school teachers that impose stiff (and ever-changing) rules and pull sales reps into rooms to scream at them. It's easiest for Yelp sales managers to take a condescending, bad faith, authoritarian approach but it stunts the growth of their salespeople. The inexperience in management leads to massive incompetence,  bad attitudes, frequently-moving 'goal posts', and ultimately HUGE turnover rates. 

Out of my training class of ~60 people, about 45 of them quit before their 1 year mark. Probably half of them quit within the first 6 months. Every entry level cold-calling job is going to have a pretty high turnover rate, but Yelp's is insane. 

Yelp has an unethical sales culture. You call random business owner's with Yelp pages, push them super hard to make time to talk to you, and push for a quick hard sell, all while exaggerating our product's potential, omitting facts, and in some cases straight up lying to them about the platform's effectiveness. All at the direction of your manager.

You're cold-calling to sell advertising. Don't be fooled by this being B2B sales. The conversations are reminiscent of a rando who calls you to sell insurance, ""help"" re-finance your student loans, or upgrade your cable subscription. None of these business owners want to buy ads. If they did they would have called us (or there's a way for them to easily sign up on the website). You have to 'generate a need' to coerce them to speak with you. It usually sounds like this: ""I know you're not interested and want to hang up on me, but how do you expect to pay back those loans you mentioned if you don't generate some new business? Give me 10 minutes of your time and I'll show you how...""

What makes Yelp somewhat unique is the awful standing they have in the eyes of their clients. No matter what way you look at it, it's usually better for prospective clients to advertise with other online pay-per-click or pay-per-lead websites. I won't go into details here, but most prospects who are in the market for online ads will (rightfully) look elsewhere. Also, a lot of the clients you call have been receiving weekly cold calls from Yelp for the last 5-10 years. Then they have to put up with a ""persistent"" sales rep that won't let them off the phone. We have a reputation among small business owners for being super annoying and have an ineffective product, with good reason.

And potential employers have heard of this reputation, too. I've been told ""oh you work at Yelp? Our culture isn't quite as... aggressive here."" Because of this perception, Yelp is even worse than your average cold calling job. Not many experienced salespeople would ever stoop to taking a job at Yelp, and most inexperienced hires find better jobs quickly. 

Because of this rough lot, Yelp hires just about anyone with zero sales experience whatsoever to fill desks and replenish their offices amid mass departures. Many people at Yelp are fresh out of college and have no idea what they're getting themselves into. My advice to someone in that position - like I was when I started working here - is say no to their offer. I wasted a year and a half at this bummer of a job."
1871,Yelp,Previously optimistic employee -- reached breaking point,2019-02-01,3.0,Account Executive,"1) Fun Office Environment
2) Free Food! (coffee, breakfast, lunch, snacks)
3) Great people/diverse workforce -- people generally become friends 
4) Supportive nature between employees, directors, managers
5) Invest A LOT in to teaching/training you
6) Opportunity to go from 0 or little sales experience to becoming well trained in sales techniques, learn how to handle/face objections, build more confidence in selling, etc. 
7) Helps you have some experience to show when applying for other jobs you weren't qualified for before 

*Before you apply, know that this is 100% cold calling. It's ""inbound"" sales because the businesses you call already has a Yelp page. But it feels like outbound. Yelp faces the difficulty of keeping employees long term based on that fact alone -- and they know that-- that's why they try to support you a lot professionally/emotionally and understand this isn't a place you'll likely be more than a few years, unless you're in senior roles.","1) High turn over --Many good people leave early in the job.
2) Cold calling all day
3) Fast burn out due to demands of daily metrics
4) Negative relationships between sales people and business owners
5) Most businesses hate/dislike/are very skeptical about Yelp. No matter how hard you try to be positive or help them, the negativity persists due to the nature of the Yelp platform. 
5) Don't expect to make commission within the first 6+ months on the job (or even beyond then), unless you're the small percentage that's really good at hitting your number (most people around me didn't make commission). 

***On that note, don't believe what recruiters tell you about the money reps make. Maybe some make a lot of money, but be realistic with yourself. Don't take this job if you believe the big bucks will come right away from commission. You can be extremely hard working and not even get close to it. 

Ultimately, Yelp has the potential to be a place where there is less turn over and greater job satisfaction. The perks (listed as pros above) can only sustain someone's enjoyment of the company for so long. I truly wanted to love working at Yelp, I wanted to see the career advancement I envisioned. I'll give credit to the fact that Yelp has given me experience to be more qualified for other roles going forward. However, while I wish I wanted to stay longer, I was completely unhappy with the work I had to do every day -- as you're basically throwing yourself in to a gauntlet of rejection, objections, and very unhappy opinions about yelp from business owners. 

The unhappiness comes from the fact that the majority of conversations with business owners you have are very unpleasant.  Cold calling is already hard enough. But Yelp is especially personal to businesses. Most businesses are very unhappy with the review software that Yelp has. While I understand Yelp's intention with the software, and think ultimately the intention of it is good (especially for consumers)  there is so much ambiguousness to it and misunderstanding that it's SO SO difficult to have a productive conversation with business owners about it. 

Though they try, I do not think Yelp equips their employees with enough preparation to handle these conversations well. This isn't something an employee or engineer or manager can fix. It comes from the top down."

They act like this job is amazing when they’re interviewing you but it’s all BS. They act like they give you two months of training, but you’ll be on the phones the first week so good luck. Get ready to make 80-100 phone calls each day and have 2.5 hours on the phone per day. Yes, you must keep up with these numbers each day and your manager is constantly refreshing your metrics to see how many dials your at for the day. This company is an absolute joke. Get ready to have a manager who is a year older than you who tries to be your best friend and your manager at the same time. This company is so unprofessional and so unaccommodating. They don’t care if it’s a blizzard outside, you better be at work at 8:30 on the dot. No excuses. If you come in late you’re manager will tell you to leave the house earlier tomorrow. They will make you feel guilty for using a sick day or a paid vacation day. God forbid you have a family emergency, they won’t even care- my manager would tell me to still come to work since i wasn’t at my number for the month (WTF) If i called out sick, when i returned to work my manager would ignore me for the entire day because she was mad that i didn’t come in. This is a sales job so even though you’re entitled to paid days off, you’re not allowed to take them???? Majority of their employees commute and they’re the most unaccommodating company I’ve ever worked for. You’re never allowed to work from home. You’re never allowed to take lunch outside of their lunch hours which is 12pm-1pm. They treat you like you’re in high school. Management sucks. Get ready to be micromanaged and have your manager over your shoulder all day long. They force you to go to happy hours but they don’t even pay for your drinks. They FORCE you to stay late on the last week of the month (9pm). I’ve left work at normal time on the last week of the month and my manager pulled me aside the next morning and told me that i should have stayed late. Excuse me? Nothing is never enough for them. They’re so greedy and all they care about is money. Managers make money off of us so if we hit target/quota as a team that’s the only way they’ll be happy.

Also, free food and great benefits.","Those lovely people that you meet WILL be gone. Most don’t last five months and those that do are left in the dust and treated with little respect. The sales process has become little more than dressed up telemarketing. There is no longer any courtship with clients, they are expected to put out on the first date, 20 minutes after your first time talking to them (be prepared to have several meetings if you fail to do so). The expectation is 80 dials and 2 hours of talk-time a day, which is absolutely absurd.

Having a young workforce also means that unprofessionalism runs rampant. Everything from questioning an employee’s mental health to being essentially gaslighted on what the job entails on a regular basis, there is no sense of professionalism from anyone in the office. And, no, that doesn’t mean having a dress code (within reason, of course). It means treating employees with respect and dignity and not just having yelling matches from the bottom down. In my time of employment, I had three directors (two of which were fired) and six managers (four of which were demoted). Is that setting an employee or the company up for success on any fundamental level? Of course not. And having the gall to have the office open in the face of incredibly dangerous weather conditions when the rest of the city is shut down is just a shameful, shameful thing."

Anyone ever heard of the definition of insanity? When you try to relieve the mind-numbing boredom of the job, you are told to “stay focused” and “be efficient.” Which brings me to my next point: micromanagement is oppressive to the point of insanity and misery among representatives. Having your manager (most likely someone a year older than you, with little to no actual management skills) breathe down your neck constantly is annoying at best and torture at worst. Just because someone is good at sales, doesn’t make them professional or competent enough to manage a group of young professionals. Inconsistency is key at Yelp’s Leadership Development Program! 
Base pay for NYC is impossible to live off of, with considerable commission paychecks only available to top performers. If you are considered “average,” it’s not a consistent and feasable source of income. 
It’s telling that most employees do nothing but complain behind their manager’s backs all day, and that for every 100 people that are hired, 50 quit. When speaking to recruiters and other professional individuals in the industry, it becomes evident that yelp is not respected whatsoever."

I am appalled to work for a company that has so little regard for the safety of its employees and clearly is prioritizing revenue production before we close out the month.  While I understand the company and all of its employees still have a job to get done, the messaging today has made it clear that this company does not care about us anymore.

1907,Yelp,Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere,2019-01-16,1.0,Customer Success Manager,"Fun company ""perks"" like a stocked kitchen,  coffee bar, and a decent amount of team/dept outings. However, lots of this is created to mask how tedious and unmotivating the CS job and environment are.","Hmmm... Where to start.

I could develop an INCREDIBLY lengthy list of things that I found wrong with working at this company,  but ultimately I believe that most of this negativity falls on management's shoulders. If you read through some other reviews, you'll start to notice a pattern with this.

Management at Yelp is (for the most part) young , inexperienced, and essentially brought into a ""leadership"" role to serve as the directors' minions for brainwashing and creating almost a cult-like environment. The second that you speak up against what is communicated as the ""big picture"" (We are here to help our clients change their businesses and lives! We are helping people! We are so amazing and our culture is amazing and we love how transparent and open we are!!) - even if it's just a suggestion for management to do something different or approach something from another angle - you immediately become a target. You will be scrutinized day in and day out about whether or not you truly ""want to be there"", about what ""motivates you"", etc. Management is taught to ""lead"" by creating what they think are in-the-weeds relationships with their people, when in reality it's uncomfortable and unnecessary. There is no reason for management to ask the amount of personal questions that they do.  It doesn't foster closeness, it just makes your reps uneasy. That feedback appears over and over in these reviews, and yet, as a former employee, I know that it was never taken to heart.

Additionally, what doesn't help is that the leadership and management teams absolutely refuse to acknowledge the fact that there simply will always be people in those seats that do it as a 9-5 job. And to them, that's what this is - a J O B. And that should be okay!! But at Yelp, it is not. Those are the targeted people. Those are the ones who are constantly harassed by management and leadership, being asked about what their ""real"" aspirations are, what motivates them... It isn't to build a relationship, it's to weed out everyone there that isn't spending all day drinking the Yelp koolaid. It doesn't matter if you happen to be a strong performer - if you don't make it incredibly obvious after Month 1 that you are there to grow for the rest of your life, it isn't too long before it starts going downhill for you. During my entire time at Yelp, I had a giant problem with that. It's not all that difficult to wrap your head around the fact that for some people, spending 8 hours a day talking to often-angry business owners isn't always going to spark a career path motivation for everyone. But, to management, those people are ""toxic"" and need to be replaced. You are Yelp and you will never have a problem replacing people by bringing in recent college grads - but with the way management conducts itself at Yelp, those people will keep cycling in and out every few years and if you keep going this route, you will never achieve the tight-knit, honest culture you are so badly after.

Lastly, it amazed me how closely everyone was watched. There was a point at one time where lunches were no longer taken whenever one would like, but rather assigned and you had no choice but to take it then, other than to trade with someone else. Breaks were heavily monitored. If you took a break at 11 am after making decent activity it was still almost guaranteed that you'd be spoken to about whether or not a break at that time was truly the best decision for you. Having been out of this environment for quite some time now, it really does amaze me that back at Yelp, I thought this was the norm. Then I stepped into the real world... And other mature companies DO NOT operate this way nor do they treat their employees like kindergarten children."

1919,Yelp,Account Executive,2019-01-08,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Music, free food, open desk atmostphere","Exhausting job especially with the new model that rolled out to the company last year.  You are expected to make 100 cold calls a day and managers pace around watching you at all times - honestly it makes you feel like you work in a sweat shop at times. Managers are joking around all days with fellow friends and distracting to employees, but then they get upset if their reps aren't hitting the phones at all times. For example, one time I went to the bathroom and was gone too long, and when I got back my manager asked me why I had been gone for so long and that I needed to get back on the phones. 

Besides the above, the main reason we are there is to sell advertising to small business owners. Be aware - because the sales model you are basically bullying business owners in to signing up. I once had a business owner start crying because they didn't have a lot of money and thought they were closing the doors, but my manager on my call was still forcing me to say ""just put in your credit card"" over and over again so I was unable to empathize with the business owner."
1920,Yelp,Worst Place to Work at,2019-01-08,1.0,Account Executive,Working a sales job in this company teaches you exactly what not to look for when you eventually realize what a horrible place Yelp is to work and leave. Free snacks are the only good thing about this company... and maybe the free mugs.,"All of the negative reviews here pretty much sum everything up. The work culture is highly unhealthy. Management is your typical ""boss in jeans"" where they use what you say against you but makes you feel like you guys need to be best friends and be open about your personal life. HR is a nightmare. They don't care about their employees. You are just a number in the company and easily replaceable. But, of course, all of that is shown indirectly with their ""fake smiles"" and ""super positive attitude."" If making the same calls everyday, reading the same script everyday, leaving the same voicemail everyday, having the same ""motivating and positive"" roundups at 8:30 am everyday, having the business owners curse you out everyday, maybe closing a few deals and getting cheered on with snacks and high fives everyday, putting on a mask and pretending you love what you are doing everyday are what you are looking for, then Yelp is the perfect place to work for."

In order to advance here, you have to do a lot of brown-nose in order to get promoted. If you don't have a decent territory, chances are you won't do well.

I will give Yelp the fact that they are VERY transparent in what your day to day will look like. Bordering almost scaring AE's in the interview process with how many times they tell you that you will be making 80+ calls and facing rejection all day. That is about the only thing they are transparent about though.

Fully stocked kitchen, 40 hour work week, barista on site. While this is something that used to set Yelp apart, it is now becoming more and more common and its getting harder for them to use these perks to reel people in.","Yelp has built itself around a culture of transparency, authenticity and that if you put your head down and work hard you will be rewarded. This is all not true.
When they tell you to be yourself, they mean who they want you to be. This entails kissing up to upper management, being corny and ""positive"" about the job a.k.a not batting at eyelid at anything that doesnt make sense or just plain lies or flaws in the system. By transparency, they mean you tell them everything you do wrong and everyone else does wrong but NEVER EVER doubt anything the company does because that means you are ""not being positive"" and ""not trusting the process."" 

While the company is trying to grow up, they have also embraced a new stress on ""professionalism."" This is mostly because of all the Glassdoor reviews about how unprofessional management is. Instead of actually fixing internal issues and really looking in the mirror, upper (in office) managers have decided to take it upon themselves to be the ""professionalism"" police in minor things such as dress, etiquette and communication. While I agree this is all important, it is maybe 5% of what is meant when they are called unprofessional. It is mostly the micromanaging, the inconsistency and the fake aura around the entire office. However, since this is a lot harder to fix, they have decided to mirror in on the things that they can control (and further micromanage.) They value low performing managers that dress, talk and  campaign upper management but also go flirt and hookup with their subordinates over managers who over perform but do not drink the kool aid. 

At the end of the day, company is failing, product is not advancing at all, sales techniques are outdated and the only saving grace of that company is the diamond in the rough hard workers that they manage to get to stick around.

Since Tom and CJ took over this has become a toxic sorority call center. The department has been hyper compartmentalized and your job description has become limited to essentially a few tasks. 

90-95% of your work is tell businesses essentially 3 things. 

1. No refunds and why 
2. We can't put back your reviews, our software found they were unhelpful 
3. I'll help you cancel 

The other 5%
1. Arguing with businesses to pay their outstanding balances 
2. Update Yelp listings 

It doesn't matter how long you work here, your skill sets will not advance unless you move into management or a different department completely. Someone who has been there for 6 months is essentially as good as someone with 5 years on the job. If you get lucky and get promoted into multi-loc, okay you will work on larger accounts but the overall skillset isn't different.

If you try and get a job somewhere else, the experience you learn at Yelp isn't as valuable as most people there like to think it is. Other employers will either turn you down immediately because of the reputation Yelp has with most other businesses or if you get the interview and they ask you about account management or marketing skills, you're gonna laughed out of the room. You are NOT an account manager.  They changed the title to Customer Success Manager, because 1 you can pay your employees less and two because you are essentially a call center customer service agent. It is what it is, and they've proudly announced they are the ""Call Center For The American Dream"". Try not to throw up when you hear that. 

My advice, if you take this job learn real marketing/project management/technical skills outside your work hours (project management, SEO, google analytics, excel, tableau, SFDC admin). They won't teach you... if you don't do this, and you're not part of their sorority, you'll be one of those employees just collecting a check and ultimately doing your career a disservice. At the invidable point where you realize this is huge waste of your time, and you try to get out and find a ""professional"" job, you'll need real skills, ones they don't teach you here."

I take my role very seriously but I never expected to grow my career at Yelp, I thought I was just taking a job. Little did I know I was going to grow into a mature sales professional in 2 years. 
Yelp believes in being authentic, staying positive, and most importantly a growth mindset - they will work with you as long as you are implementing feedback and managing up to improve, so fail fast, have fun and make money! Yelp has an uncapped commision. 
The best way to succeed fast is to become a self sufficient rep. Ask the good questions to your managers, be curious, prefer to not let your manager baby you and do things for you. That’s how you will get and keep clients! My best advice - never get too high or too low. 
All and all I see a future at Yelp and opportunities to go into management or a different department.",I don’t have any cons to say. Mindset is everything in this role and the more you think negative things the more it hurts your wallet!

Having a bad territory really does affect people’s ability to sell. When I did make a sale into my rural territory (biggest town had 4,000 people), I truly felt guilty because I knew that I had tricked someone into buying something that wouldn’t work. Any complaints about the product being a bad fit will be ignored. Management just drinks the Kool-Aid and makes you feel stupid for second guessing the product. It’s very clear that most people hate their job, but just smile and act like everything is perfect. It is very common to cry before/during/after work. 

Also don’t let the kegs fool you! It’s definitely looks cool, but I got called out in front my entire training class (~75 people) for having a beer after a day I didn’t close. “Kegs are for celebrating success. If you didn’t make a sale, you shouldn’t be sticking around after work”"

-Micromanagement to the extreme - if you are 1 minute (yes literally one minute) late expect to have a meeting with your manager. I guess they haven’t figured out yet that having multiple meetings with reps everyday about nonsensical things like this and leaving your desk takes up more time and is less productive.
-Another example of Micromanagement- your manager will literally make an Excel spreadsheet of all the times you’ve been 1 minute or late (including sick leave) and present it to you. Unreal.
-Pretty much like a middle school (I would say high school or college like but I actually had more freedom then than at Yelp) - examples - your bathroom breaks will be monitored, you are not allowed to leave the office and let’s say walk to Starbucks and grab a coffee (pretty much chained to desk), if you are hungry or thirsty (like a normal human) and get up to get water expect to get reprimanded like a child.
-Manager breathes down your neck every second of every day hovering over you, Yelp says this is “hands on training” but it’s so they can make sure you don’t look away from your computer for a single second (treated like a robot).
-Heavy sweatshop like vibes - forced standing for long periods during “power hours”, managers yelling (yes literally yelling) demands and saying things like “you will never make more than 40k” to degrade and humiliate you into “working harder”
-you can’t make commission until you hit $30k then another $12k a month after that. You could make $150k your first year in sales and still see $0 commission.

Free Breakfast, lunch, and coffee 
Great salary out of college
Lots of friends your age
Learn how to persevere through suffering and misery
Become extremely aware of what you say and how you say it. 
Fear of confrontation and conflict decreases over time
If you are more introverted and shy, you WILL learn how to at least sound more confident and assumptive no matter how painful that process will be
Learn how to (ADAPT{the positive view} /CONFORM{the negative view})  
You're given (Daily Feedback {the positive view} /Daily criticism{the negative view})
You start with a ""class"" similar to high school or college so it's easy to make friends, but a lot of your friends will quit so don’t get too close","Much of your day to day experience will be mediated by your manager. Some managers won’t mind if you’re a few minutes late, ease into your day with breakfast, and won’t hassle you every hour for metrics. Other managers will reprimand you for being 2 minutes late, question your competence if you look away from your computer, and take you on frequent “walks” where they give you feedback on being as productive as possible. The positive people will say Yelp has a “hands on” approach to management, and the negative ones call it “micromanagement”. Both are valid depending on your manager. I’d say the management style for me is a con overall because if you aren’t consistently closing revenue, then you are hounded for your metrics. Territories do matter. New York City is not Greensburg Pennsylvania...

The biggest con for me would be the actual work itself, which is what you are doing for a majority of the day. On top of their relentlessly aggressive approach to calling where every conflict is seen as an objection, business owners tell me all the time how they feel harassed, manipulated, ect. The company is extremely transparent from the beginning that calling 80 businesses a day is hard work, but that doesn’t change the fact that the work is dull, repetitive, and by nature uninspiring. Everyone knows this, so there is crappy pop music playing at all times to keep energy up. There are constant, creative ways of keeping said energy up at all times – games, incentives, bonuses, food, PTO ect. Critical thinking and silence are mistaken by managers as disengagement and low energy. One of my managers literally told our team to “think less and do more”. To be fair, I’m a naturally calm person, so if you consider yourself to be quiet, introverted, or of the thinking type you will be constantly criticized (I mean given feedback). Everyday looks exactly the same, which sometimes is actually a great thing. A structured daily schedule allows you to be more productive and consistent in other parts of life. Also as a side note, one of Yelp’s core values is to be UNBORING; and I swear I’m the only one bothered that UNBORING is not a word. 

All the intellectual barrenness is filled with a very UNBORING frat culture. Competition is encouraged over collaboration. In training we are told to always work harder than the person sitting next to us. Frequent happy hours. If you are historically insecure, sad, introverted, or mentally unstable in any way then I’d not recommend unless you are dedicated to self improvement."
1978,Yelp,A Company That Actually Has Values & Ethics,2018-11-10,5.0,Associate Account Executive,"- Yelp is one of the most progressive companies and I have yet to work in an office as diverse as Yelp's and has programs and groups that work on and advocate unity within diversity.

- Yelp does not neglect employee's mental and emotional wellbeing; they are transparent in the demands of the job and management is always open and willing to talk to you about how you are doing and what they can do to support you -- with zero judgment.

- The company does not have ""values"" because all companies are expected to have them. Yelp's values are not textbook, they are meaningful and pertinent and are not just for the company and employees but the community as well. What's more impressive? Yelp manages to hire employees who naturally embody them.

- The only way you will fail is if you MAKE yourself fail. The managers are paid to literally help you succeed. All day long. If you show up and are eager to learn and implement feedback, you will succeed and grow.

- On that note, the potential to grow is limitless. They encourage you from day one -- you can go wherever you want in Yelp with hard work and. If you express a desire to reach a certain position, they will help you take the steps to get there.

- When there are times of stress, the office environment is alive and electric. Everyone is at 100% and cheering each other on. You will almost always find, there are No Bad Days at Yelp.

- I think the training program prepared us pretty damn well to roll out to the floor and what we didn't take away from it our managers and fellow team members keep us afloat and help us learn and improve every day.

- 100% employer paid benefits and the health insurance plans are very good.

- Generous PTO.

- Casual dress code.

- Stocked kitchens.","- Only 4 days for sick time then you have to use PTO. Many people get sick multiple times a year and need more than 4 days to recover. I have had team members come to work incredibly ill and they can't do their job properly, get others sick, and end up going home early, biting into their PTO.

- You need a doctor's/professional's note for ergonomic tools -- lumbar support, ergonomic mouse/keyboard, standing desk, inflatable ball, footrest. Sitting all day long in a standard chair is terrible for the human body

- Honestly, that's all I have to say. Shocker, right? I promise I haven't drunk the kool-aid."

However,  your hiring practices ruined my family.  Did I deserve to lose my home, my cars, everything I own. Over a backwards hat and a tongue-in-cheek wardrobe. I don’t think so.

I shouldn't be hearing from one manager that ""I should look forward to being hung up on because it means I was pushing harder"", and then hear that's the wrong way go about this role from the company's own office head.  
Yelp needs to do a better job of holding their 24 year old sales managers accountable to how they go about being ""leaders"" for their team. Lots of management use methods that have 0 integrity when selling to clients, (like allowing reps to play the ""buy or die"" clip from the Wolf of Wall Street as motivation when they were specifically told that clip is banned in meetings) leading to the increasingly hostile and combative conversations had every day. Lots of reps are constantly feeling less and less supported and valued as employees in the company and it's only giving them higher turnover. 
Don't even get me started on the machine like output expectations that are required of employees every day: 80 cold calls MINIMUM, 40 emails 2.5 hours of talk time every day, and if all three of those are not met on the daily, its like you didn't do your job. People are mentally drained at the end of the day and are well aware that they get paid far below industry standard for those expectations 
Honestly, if  OTHER companies dislike Yelp's sales process, and are well aware of how poorly they treat their employees, I really fail to understand how they don't see any of that as an issue."

You’re literally cold calling places in the middle of nowhere that mostly hate yelp because they have been called 5,000 times over already. They wont change your terriotory so your calling the same businesses repeadelty for 6-7 months. Your life is literally cold calling 40 hours a week.  Nothing like getting hung up on and cursed out by people first thing in the morning and having to be the fool calling from Yelp. Most of the businesses that sign up cancel from not seeing results after a period of time so that makes you feel even more like a scam telemarketer. Making a dime of compensation is unrealistic for most as you have to close a ton of revenue frequently to even crack 100 extra dollars on your check.  Very high turn over rate from burnout. I would suggest anybody with any type of anxiety to stay away from this job because it is a lot of stress to call people out of the blue over and over again and pressure to perform well as your revenue numbers and pitches are posted up for everyone to see.  No work life balance because you are drained from talking all day and bring work home with you and the weekends fly by. Your manager will also hop on your calls and be extremely rude and aggressive to the business owners and try to force advertising down their throat until you have really pissed them off and hang up on you. You have to say whatever they tell you to say while the person on the other line doesnt know your being fed lines so they are basically just using your voice. Im going to leave it at that because what it comes down to is unless you are really serious about a sales role this job is a waste of time and im sure you could do better."

They don't value people with opinions and people with opinions are forced out or leave exasperated. People are unceremoniously fired and those that leave are here one day, out the next. No acknowledgement of their achievements. While sales is the backbone of revenue in the company, it is operationally driven. In other words, it’s about how they can extract as much from employees while finding ways to pay them as little as possible. While they ra-ra-ra teamwork and pretend to care about you, the reality is they just don’t. They suck you dry and then find somebody else to suck dry. Burn and churn and huge amounts of turnover even at the highest levels of sales.

A crony culture: At all levels, it's a crony and nepotistic culture where it's more about who you know and how long you've been at Yelp, than your actual skill level or sales metrics. Furthermore, unqualified people are in positions of power and people that have failed are rewarded with promotions. In my tenure, people with no management experience or a track record of success have been promoted to the highest levels. Those that are brought in by people of influence or have existing relationships are allowed to break rules and underperform. In a bout of collective cognitive dissonance, those that fail are lauded and those that succeed are downplayed. In short, it’s who you know, now what you do.

Pay: Yelp, from top to bottom in the sales organization, pay is far below market rate. In order to get your OTE, you effectively have to perform at 200% to goal. There are no annual reviews and pay raises. If you come in at your base rate, that base rate stays indefinitely. They say that they don’t want people that are here for the money; they want people that are here for the “vision and mission”. This is very easy for a well paid leadership to say but in reality it’s all about how they can suck you dry and benefit from all your hard work.

Transactional: Even at the highest levels of sales, transactions are rewarded over revenue contributions. The National org is effectively a glorified call center.

Culture: Want blasting music all day? Temperatures lowered to increase productivity? This is what they do. They treat employees like gamblers in a casino. While the upbeat culture is great for a 22 year old, if you value a professional work environment, this place is not for you. Want a crappy white bread sandwich with Frenchy’s mustard and cheap cold cuts? Plenty of that for you here. Want a clean kitchen, go elsewhere. This is effectively a college dorm. Want boogers on the bathroom walls? Mustard scattered on the counters? Loud and unprofessional behavior? Come to Yelp.

At the tipping point: 90%+ of the work force is at the tipping point of losing it. It's highly stressful and success is an exception, not the rule. It recently drove one individual to bring a gun to work and threaten himself and co-workers. This is not a normal place and not normal things happen here. 

Stay away. This place is toxic."

2020,Yelp,This Job is Worse Than You Could Ever Imagine.,2018-10-15,1.0,Account Executive,There's only one positive about Yelp: Great Health Insurance! Of course it's easy to offer health insurance at zero premium when 95% of your workforce is under 24 yrs old with a college degree. So we shouldn't give them too much credit for figuring that one out.,"Working at Yelp is literally a waking nightmare. You get to the office every single day at 8:30AM sharp. If you are there at 8:31AM you will get a phone call and a text from your manager asking where you are. If that's not the first time you were 1 minute late then you may even have a sit down with your ""director"" to go over why you were late and if everything is ok.

From there, you will sit in a chair and read the same exact script as the person next to you. Every person you can hear will be having the exact same conversation, all day long. If you get up from your seat, your manager will want to know why, where you are going, how long you are going for, etc. 

From 8:30AM to 12PM all you will do is dial down the same exact list as the day before. Every single day you will get the same voicemails. You will get the same busy signals. But you have to keep calling the same numbers because your ""manager"" refuses to give you a new territory or acknowledge the fact that your territory has been burned to the ground. 

Then 12PM hits, lunch time. Since Yelp doesn't pay ANYTHING close to a living wage in any major metropolitan city the majority of the company will pile into the cafeteria to eat wet single serving deli meats on a variety of wraps or you can choose the smallest side salad you've ever seen. There will also be snacks and sugary drinks. Whatever they could give you to distract you from the fact that this is by far the worst job in America.

Come 1PM you better be back at your desk. Every day. No excuses no exceptions. Lunch is over and you resume calling the very same 80-100 numbers you had been calling from the day before. These people already told you they aren't interested, however you have to call them, or you will get another meeting with your manager to explain why you aren't making any calls. This will continue to 5:30PM. Then you can go home.

Underneath this unbelievable sweatshop of horrors, you will see no less than 10 people crying in a given week. I've never seen so many employees crying at work. Not because the job is so challenging, but because you are told to swindle hard working business owners out of their credit card, and if you don't keep literally yelling at a business owner to give you his credit card or to pull their car over (yes your manager will actually yell at you for not telling a business owner to pull their car over) you need to have ANOTHER meeting with your manager to discuss your bad attitude, or bad body language, or who knows what else.

This nightmare will continue on 5 days a week, until Friday. Then on Sunday, you will be faced with the worst anxiety of your life, because you can't believe that you are going to have to spend the next 5 days literally chained to your desk where you will have all of the same discussions as the 5 days prior all over again. 

I remember telling my parents that I would have more pride in my work if I was a garbage man than I have working at Yelp. If you want to leave and find a new job you will need to come up with COUNTLESS ways to lie to your manager as to why you will be late. Why you will be off. They will ask you to your face if you are interviewing for other jobs. They will pressure you. And the best day of your life will be the day you QUIT and never have to go back to that sweatshop ever again."

You’ll talk to about 6-8 people put of the minimum 80 people you call. 4 of them are annoyed because they’ve already talked to someone from Yelp, the next 2 hate you and let you know and then the last 2 you have a 50/50 shot of them having the time to hear you out and theres a .10% the person who heard you out will actually believe in what you’re selling. Even if you’ve spoken to the business owner and they’ve heard the entire shpeel they make you call and follow up with them an additional 4 times.

2024,Yelp,Used to be an amazing place to work,2018-10-10,2.0,Sales Representative,"amazing benefits, full kitchen, work life balance, paid for off-sites, uncapped commission, 4 years ago it was an amazing place to work until they turned into a typical corporate job.","employees who are promoted to management after just a few months on the job, shady sales people who have no repercussions (often times rewarded/recognized instead), management / directors who sleep with and/or drink with their reps with absolutely no consequences."
2025,Yelp,Just stay far away,2018-10-09,1.0,Junior Account Executive,Free snacks but that's really it.,"I can't begin to even understand how I managed to stick it out so long. Out of all the jobs I have had in my sales career this had to be the absolute worst.

1. Commission- First and foremost the commission structure of this company is pitiful. When you start you must close $30,000k to be commission eligible. Once you are pass that point each month you must first close $12,000k, then you will receive commission. However, there are numerous upon numerous people DO NOT close that much in a month. On top on that the commission is taxed 53%. 

2. Management- I can say there is only one director who has a general concern for each and every rep in there pit. The rest of the directors are condescending and trash talk about the reps in there ""neighborhood"" but also their own managers. In the beginning it is always said that they will support you no matter where are you in the org. On the other hand, as time goes on you will notice that the managers are selective and will only boost up those who they like, are closing, or anyone who had the luck of getting a good territory but does not realize it. Moreover, managers are immature and have never worked in any other sales org besides yelp. 

3. Demographics- This has been brought up by several people at the org. Large majority of yelp is caucasian which discourages the minorities who work here. Former reps and present reps have told me about certain awkward and borderline racist interactions with others at this company. In my opinion no one should feel uncomfortable at the workplace, and it is embarrassing to know this happens all the time.

4. Territories- At the end of your training you are assigned a territory. You better hope you have a populated city or else you are indefinitely screwed. They will tell you it is randomly selected but your territory is dependent based off your interview. After training it is up to your director which territory they want to assign you. I still to this day work with people who never hit quota since they are calling into an area that simply does not use yelp. Yelp will not take no for an answer because you will be calling the same territory, depending on circumstances, for 10 months after training until you are assigned a new one. Those who are assigned good territories will tell others around them what they are doing wrong. Mind you these are people who are fresh out of college or never worked in sales(No I'm not joking). 

5. Sales Tactics- Pushy, aggressive, whatever negative adjective you can think of, that is what this company consist of. You are forced to be aggressive on the phone. The point of each call with these businesses is to play off their fear and anger, not to have a general care for there concerns. When it comes down to it you are not discussing but in fact debating. You will be arguing with people all day who do not want to hear from you.  Accounts you sign up will cancel in less than 4 months, the program that is offered is made to max out each month though we tell people it will not."
2026,Yelp,Okay entry level job,2018-10-09,2.0,Senior Account Executive,"This job did come with a lot of pros!

-Fully stocked kitchen and an in-house barista
-2 month training program. You can tell that the ASTM managers really cared about the employees and wanted to see them succeed.
-Coworkers. It was a very young culture. There was no professionalism at all but that's okay for people who still want to feel like they're in college and get paid for it too. Some of my coworkers will definitely be my life-long friends
-Work/Life balance. As mentioned, this job is very entry level and you don't need a brain to do it (just people skills). It was easy to ""turn off"" the work mindset once it hit 5:30 pm every day. I got in the best shape of my life because of this.
- The insurance options were great. 
-You WILL get promoted if you sell. It's sales. They promote based on revenue and not on merit.","There were more cons to this job than pros.
-You will be favored if you can hit quota and target consistently (duh, it's sales). Basically you can come in late with no repercussions, you can take as many breaks as you want, and you don't have to hit the dial quota every day. Oh! You will also be able to skip out on meetings.
-The ""managers"" are most likely a couple years older than you (if you're out of college). That basically means they don't actually know how to lead a team - they just know how to close deals. If you're expecting a more mature individual well..you're out of luck for this job.
-If you are not closing they will have a million meetings with you or sit next to your desk all day to micro manage
-Speaking of micro-managing, managers have access to your talk time, dials, and how many people you reached for the day. They will pull you aside or else Gchat you till you let them know it's all your fault.
-Cocky coworkers. I was lucky that my team didn't like the other people that worked at Yelp either. Many people become extremely arrogant when they do really well and are extremely condescending if you ask for advice. Please remember that we were just selling ad space on Yelp..not the cure for cancer."

- Inexperienced Management
- Boys Club Atmosphere 
- Awkward Social Pressures Around Overtime

Yelp has quite a few problems, most concerning is retention. The company seems to have it in its mind that burn and churn is the best practice for current employees and seem to not mind if you leave because they will just replace you. The highs can be fun but are usually brought back down to reality when you realize your manager is a 22 year old college grad who has no life skills or experience other than the fact that they showed up at Yelp and shook the right hands and never questioned anything in their career to get promoted. Then unfortunately those people go on to become directors and when the going gets tough a strong manager needs to question things to get the right results and get their team back on track which is all but lost in this management circle of brown nosing yes-men.  With all that said there is also the inevitability of the end of the month and maintaining your sales quota, and with this comes the awkward social pressure of repeatedly saying in meetings that all overtime must be approved by a manager first but if you leave early your not a team player so most people end up working without approval (which they rarely give) because they are pressured into it and not getting paid their worth.

2048,Yelp,Don't settle for this...you can do better trust me.,2018-10-01,1.0,Account Executive,Baristas and free snacks. Like minded people.,"Where to even start....first off the recruiters  dont highlight the fact you are calling businesses that have been called FOR YEARS by Yelp. I am a very social person and still felt super uncomfortable calling these businesses who  want nothing to do with you. The few times you do get someone willing to hear you out, your manager jumps on the call and just tells you everything to say to the point you can only hear them and you are just repeating someone elses words... for a human conversation...its not natural.  I understand this is in effort to make you learn the methods from a seasoned rep but cmon people high sales $ does not equal a good manager and the whole pitch is so aggressive I felt like I was seriously just in the process of scamming people over listening to their genuine concerns. Overall I was ready to leave this experience not loving it but respecting Yelp until I tried to formally give my two week notice (luckily got a new and better job)  and my manager literallly told me to go write a list of the pros and cons of this job and that one, so ""we could go over it together to make sure I was making the right choice""... that just took it over the edge. They really do treat you like children here...management kept telling me to stick it out and give it a fair shot like I wasn't an adult who knows their worth, they watch over your shoulder at your desk all the time and give you stern talks if you're running 10 minutes late or even had a bad day and couldnt hit 80 dials...seriously? To anyone praising them for the fact you get to actually leave at 5:30 its only because they are too cheap to pay for overtime and this isnt something you should praise .seriously people? They dont let you leave early or come in late or take lunch even at a different time...people call Yelp college 2.0 for a reason."
2049,Yelp,Account Executive,2018-10-01,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"High energy, great perks/benefits, young environment","Overselling job: stating that we are not ""cold calling"" but ""helping local small businesses"" which would be true if we were actually reaching people/areas where this program would be most effective. Continually pushing us to sell to people who 1.) have no searches going on around them 2.) they are literally the only kind of biz around for 50+ miles 3.) rush through helping them set everything up properly so they don't even see success because we were forced to call more people, resulting in them canceling the program quickly 

Fun but concerning work environment: high energy and fun place, getting too lenient with interactions of coworkers and management, lots of lines being crossed, uncomfortable relationships that are neither acknowledged or addressed

Commission issues: expectation to have quality conversations but they force you to dial 80+ people everyday which is a huge contradiction, once you sign someone up to the program you are pressured to finish the conversation and go onto the next sales call, which results in not setting up the program successfully enough so they cancel. Canceling hinders the commission you receive and can ultimately result in you OWING Yelp money later down the line due to charge backs.

2051,Yelp,5 star career,2018-09-27,5.0,Elite Account Executive,"Yelp is the definition of a well-oiled sales machine. While I had a great deal of outside sales experience when I started at Yelp, I had no real inside sales experience.  I started at Yelp Chicago towards the tail end of 2015 and had no intentions of staying long. 60 days in which is how long the Yelp Sales Training Program lasts, I knew I was going to be here for a while! 

Being a part of such a hyper growth sales company that grew from 150-800+ employees in the 2.5 yrs I was there is an unreal learning experience. I was fortunate enough to have done quite well for myself during my tenure and was given many opportunities to move into different roles and positions in the company. I also was able to experience multiple Yelp offices. 

Chicago was definitely a very different culture than the other offices, and certainly had it's times of turmoil that come with hyper-growth sales organizations; ie, lack of experience at the management level. 

When the new head of office came in, he certainly had a challenge on his hands to turn the organization around, and he, like the gentle giant grabbed the we' folk and shook the place upside down. The effort and visible leadership he displayed was something I'd never seen before.  Sitting down with him, he told me it'd take a while to get the office where he wanted it to be and sure enough overtime those changes began to take place.  

Overall, the Yelp culture is 2nd to none. The people and relationships I created were and still are amazing. If you're new to the sales world, Yelp is the best place for you to start and grow your career in Sales.","Roles are very narrowed and defined. Your day to day is repetitive. If you don't speak your mind, you will be just another rep."
2052,Yelp,Account Executive,2018-09-27,1.0,Account Executive,"Good people to work with ( same age, like minded people), good benefits (free health insurance, free food)","The job itself is really horrendous. First the assigned territories are a big problem. If you get unlucky and call into an area where yelp isn’t as popular be prepared for months of struggling to hit quota.  It is taboo to blame your territories but I’ve seen great sales people do bad when they have bad territories and very well when they have a good area. Territories aside, management expects you to be very aggressive on your phone calls, which leads to a lot of burned bridges. This normally isn’t a problem for me, but becomes a problem when you’ve burned a bridge with a business owner and are expected to call them back 2 days later. If you kick them out of your pipeline they’ll most likely come into your pipeline again 2-3 weeks later. Typical day consists of making 80 plus calls, and having about 50 unique calls which means you are constantly on the phones being pushy. Be prepared to be micromanaged as each and every call is tracked. You are judged on 3 minute calls, how many business owners you speak too, pitches, and of course how many dials you make. Management will try to make you believe that this is the best advertising product out there but every business that I have signed up has always cancelled after 2 months. On top of the terrible day to day of the job, the people you are calling are the worst. These are people who have been called non stop by yelp for years and years so I can’t really blame them for being rude on the phone. Yelp is looked as the villain of corporate America in the eyes of the business owners and unless you’re calling in Los Angeles or other popular area business owners won’t have any respect for your call. I would only reccomend this job to freshly college graduates that don’t have much office work experience. Stay for a year learn as much as you can and get out.  Also pretty low starting salary."

2054,Yelp,Think twice,2018-09-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- most employees are college graduates ( or under the age of 30) so a fun environment. Lots of happy hours and friends to be made.
- you learn how to really work hard. the more calls that you make, the more opportunities that you'll have. it's all tenacity.
- the name & the training. putting yelp on your resume really makes you stand out in a crowd because of how hard Yelp employees have to work. recruiters know that.
- great insurance","- intense and aggressive open calls and pitches to business owners really made me and my friends feel bad. management would say that the business owner would either sign up or the bridge would be completely burned. If they didn't sign up and 'the bridge was burned' you'd still end of calling them 4 weeks later. bad business practice
- it really feels like you're in school. Work starts and ends at the same time everyday, for everyone. Everyone has to take lunch at the same time (12-1pm). There's no flexibility in this sense at all. 
- in training they say there are a ton of opp. for growth but that's not true. Unless you're looking for a sales role, you're not going to get anything else here.
- needless to say, retention rate is terrible. People come and go so fast that the longer you stay, the less and less people you know and you end up feeling like there's no point in getting to know other people because they're probably going to be gone in a few months. When you tell people how long you've been here, some are baffled to hear you made it to a year, that's how bad retention is. 
- most importantly, the pay is incredibly low for the work that we do."

Your work ethic will be unmatched after working here. The friends you make here will stay with you for the rest of your life.,"Honestly not sure where to start here. I worked at Yelp for 1 total year (how I made it that far without losing my mind I have no idea). For being such a well known technology company, Yelp is borderline a scam when it comes to being employed there. They hire everyone and their mother because the turnover here is ridiculous. They can barely keep people in the role, except for that 1% that gets lucky with a great territory and gets ""promoted"" within less then a year on the job. The main reason why I finally decided to leave was because of the unethical sales tactics this company uses against business owners on the phone. I went 1 year putting my head down and ignoring it because that's exactly what they brainwash you to do. Yelp instills that they ""love local businesses"" and that all we are doing is helping local businesses grow. When in reality we are forcing an advertising program (that doesn't even work for most) down their throats because this company is as money hungry as it gets. My manager would frequently make me (and my other teammates) scream at business owners to pull over while driving and get their payment information in order to close a deal. Now that I'm finally moved on from this company I can fully appreciate how horrible it really is. I wanted to leave the job sooner but unfortunately they also make you feel incredibly awkward when trying to get time off (especially to interview). 

If you are considering a job here in Sales, PLEASE do yourself a favor and think twice. If you are someone who enjoys immaturity in the workplace, unethical sales tactics, and straight up brainwashing 24/7, then by all means this is your place. If not, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. There are so many other amazing technology companies who appreciate their employees and develop a great, healthy sales environment."

- Territory is all based on luck. You can be calling into a large city where people use Yelp all the time or in the middle of no where. Either way, you are going to be calling them every 2 days so be prepared to get yelled at on the phone and by your manager asking what went wrong and why you couldn't convince them to buy ads.
- Unrealistic expectations. You are expected to make 80+ daily dials no matter what. No exceptions. It went from 65, to 70, then 80 in the span of a few weeks. It even goes so far where management saying they will be let go if we cannot perform.
- Salary and commission. First off, the whole point of sales is to encourage people to get commission since the base pay is probably not as high, but it's almost impossible to make commission here. If you do end up making commission though then don't be surprised how low it can be when your commission check comes in due to 'chargebacks.' Be prepared to live off of the very low base salary.
- Management can be suffocating depending on who you are placed with (extreme micromanagement which has been making reps stressed and under-perform). Also, depending on your manager, they can treat you like you are little kids. You can feel totally disrespected and worthless. It even goes so far where you might feel bad to get up to use the restroom or get a cup of coffee.
- No one is happy in the office. Yes, the people and culture are great, but literally everyone hates the day-to-day. It's repetitive, monotonous, and boring.
- The turnover rate is huge. It's sad when people ask how long you have been at a company and people say months instead of years.
- Forcing people to stand up for ""power hours"" when they don't want to (I get the benefits and why it is good to stand from time to time but forcing it on people makes you feel like you are working in a sweat shop). This should be an option.
- Lack of training after your first 2 month training period.

-Upper managament highlights people who basically work themselves to death & use them as ""models"" for a good employee.

- Management is very young. If you get stuck with a bad manager its 10x worse. 
- Micromanagement
-They oversell the different career paths you can take in the company. If you start in sales, you'll most likely be stuck there.

2120,Yelp,Not bad,2018-08-08,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pretty laid back culture, easy to coast if that's your thing.

The organization is very inclusive. Above average number of non-male engineers, great support for parents, LGBT, women, etc. I really like it. This includes training for managers and people in leadership roles.

Engineers are empowered to improve systems. If you're a self starter, you'll do well here.

Tonnes of peer learning opportunities, particularly for young / inexperienced managers.

Enough scale to be interesting but enough money to force creativity :).

VPs are generally amazing human beings, especially Wing Yung and Sam Eaton, who are some of the nicest senior leadership I've had the opportunity of working with.","Yelp's benefits are okay but pretty meagre (outside of healthcare) compared to much of their competition. For example, their 401K match is $1,000 (although recently they increased it to $3,000 once you've been here over a year) - which pales in comparison to Google, Facebook and others. 

Yelp also only offers 15 days of PTO per year which increases to 18 after 2 years and 20 after 4 years. This is pretty mediocre - Facebook offers a standard 21 and many other companies offer unlimited discretionary time off which is less burdensome (particularly since you don't need to accrue it before you can spend it). 

Sick time is capped to 5 days a year. After this, if you don't have a nice manager, you start eating into your PTO. This means that people don't take sick time when they often should.

Their gym/wellness allowance is lower than many other tech companies.

No catered lunches aside from Hackathon (which happens 3 times a year). This forces you to go explore, which is fun but expensive - effectively missing a $3-5K perk that other tech companies offered. Plus, it's pretty inefficient to leave the office in search of food.

Yelp is very much a mature, stable company with a significant amount of tech debt and legacy code. This offers a lot of scope for improvement but also means that new features take longer to release than they might at a smaller, more nimble organization.

Very ""young"" engineering team. People have a lot of energy but this often results in people building new systems instead of adopting existing solutions that are standard in industry.

Related, there's no levelling structure and opportunities for career growth are pretty vague. Yes, you'll take on responsibility but short of getting the tech lead badge or becoming a manager, you'll be a software engineer forever.

A lot of the engineering tooling is fairly antiquated and you have to be on the VPN to do anything useful. It took months and months to get Slack after years of using IRC. We use ReviewBoard which just about does the job but could be replaced by many more modern alternatives. 

I'm not seeing a lot of stock price growth, which makes compensation even less great."

The company from local management all the way up to director, all genuinely care about you as a person. They are always wanting to keep your best interest in mind, and find any solution to help make work life better all around.  Another great part of working at Yelp is career growth. i have seen many friends grow into managers, Franchise sales, and many other roles. There are options for anyone, if you plane to grow your career as a sales person, yelp is the place to be! Finally, if you love helping people, and love working with people you can actually call friends, Yelp is the place!!","There are a couple things to be aware of. We face lot's of rejection everyday, we get told no a lot. You must be resilient, and bounce back from their rejection. We face lot's of emotional rollercoasters, daily, weekly, and/or monthly.

If a company has to have these things, all that means is it's a truly horrendous, high turnover job and they need this to attract prospects. This is a cold calling mill with a hard-sell mindset, though upper management loves to dance around the wording of this to make it seem like something it's not. Not until I was in a different company did I realize how toxic the Yelp office truly was.  The loud EDM music and encouragement of chugging Red Bull and espresso shots is honestly terrifying to think about. Also, you can leave all integrity and pride in yourself at the door. Yelp advertising simply does not work for MANY businesses, and management came up with the brilliant concept of #YelpWorks where they cherry-pick a handful businesses who saw success in order to brainwash employees who are on the fence about the product. The only thing management really does is give pep talks constantly because honestly, you're reading from a script and there's not really anything to learn. I'm generally a positive person and this job was really discouraging because of all the deceptions, from the training to the product."

Yelp has cultivated a rich culture for those within the engineering org, but has left the rest of the company behind in the process. I've never seen such blatant inequality at a company, and in the last 2 years it has only become worse: RSU's were revoked for all G&A new hires, annual increases were slashed by 40%, and we've watched over 20 directors and managers depart in 2018 as a result. If you don't have a CS degree, prepare to pay the price.

Policy at Yelp  lacks transparency. Can you work from home? Depends on your team.  Do you have room to grow? Depends on your manager. Flexibility in schedule?  See above.

Human Resources is a part of those suffering ( 20+ individuals departed in 2017 from this Org alone), and yet those who remain, are ruthless when questions arise. I've witnessed the retribution sought when an employee raises a concern, and it ranges from apathy to termination.

2146,Yelp,Good Intro to Sales,2018-07-23,4.0,Account Executive,"I worked at Yelp for over a year as my first true sales job in NYC. I had no idea really what to expect with the job and getting used to the city at the same time, but had a couple of friends who helped with the transition. I truly enjoyed my time there because of the people, plus it was a really cool platform that was ever evolving. As a business, Yelp has a strong training process transitioning from month 1 to 2 before rolling out to a Vet team. Even then, I appreciated that they would take time to do team trainings if we were struggling on a certain aspect of the pitch during that month or whatever the issue was. They also were pretty good about giving you props if your team was killing it.","At the end of the day, it's cool having a stocked kitchen & kegs, but similar companies are able to keep that culture and pay their employees. I get the goal is to make commission not just take home a paycheck and to get to AE you have to hit numbers. But, that being said there's no reason why similar companies don't just have better salaries but better commission / bonus structures, especially for the grind that is making 80 to 100 calls a day."

get to tell people you work at Yelp","I have been working at the NYC office for over a year now. I am one of the better reps in the company and I am still saying you should avoid Yelp if you can. (I still work here, currently looking for other work)

1.) hours 830-530 (not the best hours and you have to work late sometimes)
2.) Pay is not very good. Base is 40K however, you  dont start earning commission until you sell at least $30,000 in product. FYI commission is taxed about 50%
3.) see all those nice reviews below mine? I'm not sure who put them there but most people are looking to leave 
4.) You need to sell $120,000 in product to get your first promotion which boost your salary to 44K, $240,000 to earn 48K. What they don't tell you is they only give raises quarterly so lets say you get your promotion September 4th you will have to wait until January 1st for that 44K to be reflected on your paycheck. They do this since turnover rate is so high and figure they can save $. No other company does this
5.) Management for the most part is awful. There are a few great managers here. But most are unqualified and got the position because they preach Yelp and ""drink the koolaid"". So if you are not like that they won't promote you 
6.) Very little room for promotion
7.) Unless you get a good territory you're pretty much screwed. So at Yelp you get territories now if you are like me and call into a populated city then you will do well, but if you're like 70% of the other reps who call into places that don't use Yelp then you're essentially trying to sell a product that no one wants. 
8.) Commission structure is terrible. I sold 30K of product last month and received $1,000 in commission....  
9.) There is always so much drama.... its like high school
10.) The company is going downhill (stock wise and direction wise)
11.) There are different segments of Yelp like Yelp WiFi, eat 24 etc. so whatever territory you get they will also call into! meaning that Yelp blows businesses up calling them anywhere between 100-150 times a year! Imagine being a biz owner who already said no and then getting additional 149 calls??
12.) Charge backs. Lets say you make a sale... YAY! if they don't stay with the advertising for at least 3 months you get a charge back where you will owe Yelp money, which they will take out of your paycheck
13.) Turnover rate is really high. I would say out of the 80+ people I started with 15-20 remain, and most of them didn't do very well.
14.) Work life balance is not the best, but it's not horrible either

All in all I give this 2 stars if you don't get any other offers take it I guess but Yelp tries to fool you into thinking its great to work for them. Its not trust me. The average rep earns about 45K their first year. Its very territory dependent. I would say 70% of employees don't make it a year."
2149,Yelp,Looking to build a great sales career? We know just the place...,2018-07-19,5.0,Senior Sales Manager,"Leadership: This is Yelp's greatest strength. Not only do they groom strong leaders internally, they also bring in phenomenal leaders externally. People don't leave jobs, they leave managers, right? In my 4+ years as a manager, all three of my directors were fully engaged in their work, and very much invested in my personal growth and success. They have shown me the blueprint of what truly great leadership is, and I am forever grateful.

Mission: Connecting people with great local businesses. How can a mission be so simple, yet so exciting? Yelp is an indispensable part of my life (more than Facebook, more than Google), and I had a blast preaching this to business owners. Now that I no longer work there, I'm excited to start contributing content again, and rejoin Yelp's Elite Squad.

Career path: Yelp is exactly what an entry-level sales job should be. Work hard, kick butt at your job, and you will be recognized. Doors will open for you, either in leadership or in advanced sales. Yelp is constantly piloting exciting new roles to create new revenue streams for the company, and are looking for capable, ambitious professionals to lead the charge. Just make sure you are vocal about what you want, and don't expect handouts to fall in your lap.","Culture: Some will argue this is a positive, but it became a negative for me as I matured professionally. Yelp hires a lot of new college grads, many of whom are accepting their very first job out of college and have no idea what they want to do in life. Unless you hustle and advance yourself to the Client Partner Org or the National org, you won't exactly be surrounded by sales ""professionals."""

- You are constantly micro-managed by the managers in terms of up-keeping aggressive daily metrics expectations (minimum daily expectations of 80 dials, 3 pitches and 1 transaction) 
- Ex) Manager printed out a log of all the calls and times I called each account the previous day. Highlighting the break I took in between calls. “You called an account at 10:38, then you didn’t make your next call until 11:05. You might have been in the bathroom or taking a break but you could have made 5 extra dials during that time.” Absolutely ridiculous!!  
- Strict working hours: 8:30 am-5:30 pm. It feels like we’re all anxiously waiting for the school bell to ring to start and end our day. 
- There is no autonomy in the job. They always want us to stick to the script. 
- I have not learned anything on the job or about a real sales cycle. It is not a strategic sale, more of an emotional sale. The sales process itself is very aggressive. The only thing I have learned is how to be a pestering sales rep.

The actual day-to-day work that we do is by far the most stressful and the least gratifying of any position I have ever held. We are expected to be non-stop making furious, aggressive dials from the moment we start to the moment we stop every day. Some managers have different styles, but most will hawk over team members about daily, and even hourly call metrics. This is a very discouraging part of the job, that has caused many of the vets to jump ship in recent months. Managers have changed their focus on how to sell, how to use the script, and who we should/should not sell to on multiple occasions.  We are selling an ok product that works in some industries. In order to be successful, it's important to have the mindset that an aggressive budget will work for a contractor in rural Maine, but it's simply not true. People don't use Yelp for certain industries or in small towns. On that topic, the Chicago office is still dealing with a very bad territory problem. Territories do matter. From a manager's perspective, it makes sense to not admit this. You need your team to believe that they are set up for success or else that little excuse will be holding them back. It's worth noting that once you get out of training, you will get better territories. It's hard to listen to the unethical lies that people will tell business owners just to secure some revenue. Playing off someone's emotion to close a deal is a big part of the job, but it just does not feel right.  
-On a lighter note, I feel like the non stop generic mantras and buzz words that management shoves down our throats will haunt me for the rest of my life  (""Yelp works"", ""I hear you"", ""Let's take a step back"", etc)"

If I was aggressive I was told specifically by my manager that if I had been not as aggressive I would’ve closed. If I was a little passive I should’ve shoved Yelp down their throat. Essentially you’re told to call these business owners that don’t want to advertise 5 to 6 times within a week or two or until they just end up blocking your number. I know I’ll never have it as bad as I did at Yelp. I’m not whining because I wasn’t successful, I consistently hit numbers but that’s just what I felt like too, a number.

2193,Yelp,A career equivalent to being back in high school,2018-06-22,1.0,Account Executive,"Yelp is an amazing product for consumers. 
You will genuinely love the people. 
Good entry level sales training but do not stay more than 1 year if that.","It’s hard to know where to begin because for a place that prides themselves on culture and values Yelp is having an identity crisis, particularly in NYC. 

Everything here is not what it seems. At first glance it seems like an great place but if you look beneath the surface you will see how similar working at Yelp is to walking the halls at your high school. It all starts at the top with the poisonous NYC leadership. Everyone at the highest level takes more time off than seems humanly possible and criticizes others for not working harder. The leadership team is 100% politically driven, if you’re not playing the game and best friends with everyone you will severely stunt your ability to get promoted into management. When you look at managers and directors there is no diversity- highly discouraging. 

You will be forced to push business owners into spending money on something that does not work. Yelp will try to get you to drink the kool aid every chance they get like when you go to the bathroom with testimonials or at lunch with Yelp speakers. The product isn’t good and is seriously behind. 

You will be micro managed. Because every manager was only hired because of who they’re friends with and not based on ability you will not learn anything. You will get in trouble for going to the bathroom often, coming in a minute late or not coming to a work happy hour."
2194,Yelp,Wouldn't recommend,2018-06-21,2.0,Senior Account Executive,You will meet great friends at this job. You will kick off a sales career.,"There is no substance to this job. You are essentially harassing business owners to sign up for advertising (that rarely works) You call over and over again and the accounts are so over worked. The job truly is brutal. Occasionally you might get a taste  of the Yelp kool aid and it wont be as bad but then it goes back to reality and it truly is a brutal job.

You are treated like a child at this company and the management is absolutely ridiculous. They promote from within so you will have a manager who is in their young-mid twenties. They clearly don't know anything about management and gossip to each other and are extremely rude to their teams many times. This is not a place where you feel like a valued employee. You will get reprimanded by your manager if you do not attend a happy hour or a social event no matter how legitimate your excuse is. Management is catty. If you want at 20 year old bossing you around this is the job for you, if not stay away. It shocks me how HR does not get involved with some of these managers.

Pay is not good. For the cities that Yelp is located in (in some of the finest real estate) they do not pay their employees anywhere near enough to live in them. If you think you will make commission think again its inevitable that you will have high chargebacks and it will eat at your opportunity for commission/bonus."

A human being’s career shouldn’t be defined by how much your superiors like you or not. 

People don’t care about their jobs. Come in, collect a pay check and leave. No one cares if they do well or not.

- The job puts things into perspective. Once you get out of this role and into a new one somewhere else, you'll always understand how much worse it could be.
- Good perks (free snacks, coffee bar, casual dress code, gym stipend, medical/dental/vision insurance)","- The job itself. You're cold calling all day, every day; usually making around 80-100 dials a day. It's not an easy job, there is a lot of rejection to deal with, the majority of businesses you call do not want to talk to you, and the daily expectations are a little ridiculous.
- Being micro-managed
- Constant change and instability of personnel (switching teams, managers, director groups, people quitting or getting fired, etc.)
- This is an hourly role. You get paid for the amount of hours worked over the course of each pay period. In a traditional salary based role, your paycheck remains the same amount each pay period. For me, my paycheck was almost never the same amount.
- Territories. This one is a flip of a coin. You might get lucky or you might not.
-  In my experience, managers, and even directors, sometimes give up on you when you're struggling. It may not be their intention, but sometimes it just happens.
- The inexperience of managers. I don't think there is a single manager in the entire office over the age of 30 -- most of them being 24-25. While it's encouraging that you can get into management at such a young age, the percentage of reps that actually do is extremely small.

-Transparency with the job itself before being hired - If you are a potential new hire reading this, it is not a con to cold call. It’s quite rewarding helping small business owners grow their business at such a minimal cost. Company is very transparent from the get go that this job is tough, and literally tells you about 20 times during the interview process that it’s outbound calls everyday.

-I love our product (I think I said that 3 times now) but it really is amazing
-Managers are finally getting training because the head of offices recognizes that 90% of them were promoted to quickly
-Head of office making changes, but will not happen overnight","There’s a ton of pros at working at Yelp, but here are the real cons.

-Young immature office - this office grew the fastest and they know that was a mistake. Our office desperately needs mature people who have a true desire to better themselves, want to learn, want to make money while having fun, has mental resilience, and wants a career. If you want to use Yelp as a resume booster only, you will fail and complain here. If you want to work hard please apply. We need you bad. 
-Rewards bad behavior - while our company has strong values, management doesn’t always live their words. You will have many reps sell extremely shady and get praise. A lot of praise. It can be extremely hypocritical to fire employees who get caught doing shady practices, but not others. It needs to be consistent across the board. 
-You have to fix people’s mistakes - Business owners truly don’t hate Yelp as an actual platform, they just don’t understand it. Business owners hate Yelp because of shady reps. They feel mislead, disrespected, and have their guard up because reps say some crazy stuff to get the sale. Some do get fired, but again, a lot get praise.
Favoritism - it’s a problem. A BIG problem. You will not consistently feel like you fit in here unless you look like Ken or Barbie. I have witnessed people of color being treated differently (I do not feel it’s intentional, it’s a lack of educating management on culture), heavier set people treated differently, non-drinkers, and women. It definitely has a frat house/sorority house feel to it. I’m hoping this will change, and would love to see management hold themselves accountable by admitting it’s a problem.
-Accountability with management - it is very unfair to hold reps accountable when their manager just simply sucks. While I’ve personally never had a problem hitting my numbers consistently, I witness reps being written up when they shouldn’t be.
-Employees lack knowledge - most of them don’t understand marketing in general."
2229,Yelp,What’s Cookin in the Yelp Kitchen,2018-05-30,3.0,Senior Account Executive,"Yelp can be a very fun place to work! Beautiful people, great team culture, free beer, fridges stocked with really healthy snacks! It has been a fantastic place to start my career, and truly helped me grow as a person. My managers were some of the greatest people I met. It’s fun to go and hang out with your teams, and there’s a party culture here for sure. There are many talented people here, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the opportunities I had. The company’s switch to RASS was needed, and we made something special of it. There are tons of new product lines that are growing like crazy, and it will be great to see where the company goes. If you are passionate about food and small business, this is the place to go! Just remember to work hard, and everything else will fall in place. Trust the process, trust you team, but don’t forget to trust yourself when it truly feels right.","This job is all or nothing. Either the Kool-aid is overflowing, or the glass shattered 20 minutes ago before your first open call.  It’s tedious, with one focus and that’s to dial. There are ways to get good, use your brains, and feel proud of your work. I firmly believe it all comes down to your manager here. They will all believe in you, support you, and work hard with you given that you show you care too. But some prefer one style to press on all their reps, and will do so in ways that push for immediate results, without their reps best interest in mind. There’s a certain level of gossip, and cattiness embedded into the culture. The company has gotten more uptight as well #coda. Hours are very strict now, with a level of flexibility nobody will let you take advantage of. Client and rep retention is weak, as you sell a product that may or may not work. Don’t read between the fine lines on the ammo you have (study dates, demographics, etc.) if you want to be successful, and learn how to trick your mind when need be. You can make a lot of money here, but for the most part you won’t unless you have the ability to be 100% on your game every day."

- Incredible training: if you have no sales experience, have no fear 
- Culture: ability to work with many like-minded, driven individuals
- Support from management: managers genuinely care about your success and are invested in their teams
- Upward mobility: Yelp is hiring aggressively and turns to its current sales force to fill higher level positions","Stress is definitely a part of this role. The sooner you can learn to manage/deal with the stress the better. It can be difficult to start over each month but it’s that much more rewarding when you hit your goals. 

It can take a few months to get the hang of the job but if you’re persistent and keep your eye on the prize it will be worth it."
2239,Yelp,5 Star Company,2018-05-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Yelp has an encouraging work environment that supports and develops its employees.

It's difficult not to compare yourself to other people on the floor.
2240,Yelp,Working at Yelp was a truly miserable experience.,2018-05-25,2.0,Account Executive,"Free health insurance, 401k match, stocked kitchens, and (mostly) great people. I was new to Chicago when I started and 99% of my friends here I met through Yelp. If you’re new to a city and need a way to make friends, Yelp is good for that and only that since most people starting are fresh out of college. Work here for a few months then start looking for something better.","Something to be aware of while reading these reviews: right around the time I left, they started telling employees in monthly meetings to write positive Glassdoor reviews. Not only is this a shady practice for the obvious reason of creating an inaccurate representation of what it is like to work at Yelp, it is also extremely hypocritical as they have a very well known policy of not allowing business owners to solicit reviews for the site.

Cold calling all day every day isn’t great in a general sense, but there are so many other things wrong with this place. It is literally run on a tighter leash than a high school, and the micromanaging is absolutely out of control. Everyone has to start, eat, and end at the same time. You get no freedom whatsoever, and managers will literally sit there and stare over reps shoulders at their computer. How do you have nothing better to do? It was almost to the point of having to raise your hand to go to the bathroom. Managers and directors will glare at you if you even think about taking your two 10 minute breaks that are given to you by LAW.

The managers are primarily 23 year olds with absolutely no experience. Upper management doesn’t take any responsibility at all for anything, at least in Chicago. The whole office was doing terrible and they place every ounce of blame on the reps. Common sense would tell you that if most reps in the office (and therefore the office as a whole) are doing poorly, the problem probably has at least little bit to do with the leadership...

Upper management literally gets paid to play on their laptops and walk around intimidating reps. They tell you working at Yelp is the best job you’ll ever have (which for them it might be since they get paid to do nothing), and now that I have a different job I understand how ridiculous that statement actually is. I truly did not know what a professional environment was when I worked at Yelp. They verbally abuse reps until they quit because they don’t want to fire you, probably because turnover is already so high they can’t afford to fire anyone. I worked there for a year and out of my original team, only one person out of 14 is left.

The cherry on top is that for many businesses, the product you are selling doesn’t work. By the end, I actually felt bad making a sale because I knew the business owner was just throwing money away. Spare yourself the misery and find a different job."

- Work/life Balance - Tell me another company in NYC that actually wants you to leave at 5:30pm and take PTO to enjoy your life.
- Incredible Culture - Yelp Values are front and center which drives an amazing, positive culture. If you don't live them, you won't last long which is a good thing. Toxic coworkers suck the life out of everyone and then rant on Glassdoor because they're upset that they won't get promoted. 
- Challenging Job - Cold-calling is not a walk in the park but you need to pay your dues no matter what when starting your career. You learn a lot about yourself and come out stronger in the end. They make it fun with games and incentives. 
- Leadership - Very supportive management team starting from the top down. They actually really do care about you as a person and your success. If you're being a jerk they will call you out which is appreciated and shows they really want you to be better. 
- Diversity is a priority and has been spoken about many times in fireside meetings with the Head of Sales.

The building/office, the free snacks, the beer kegs, the cool lounge chairs, its all a sales tactic --- to get you to like cold calling--- Because you are going to HATE it.

2. Territory DOES matter, your managers will use every sale tactic to convince you otherwise. If you get a bad territory, your screwed my friend. And if you complain to a manager, they have heard it a 1000 times and are trained really well to turn it on you as being the problem.


3.

The day to day isn't easy, but like anything, if you commit to improving and look at the job as a way to master a skill-set, rather than asking yourself ""Is this my dream job"", what you'll find is that it's a lot more than just making phone calls.  It becomes a dream job when you couple the skills you learn with the culture and the growth potential the company has.

2261,Yelp,"My Nearly Two Years as an AE at Yelp: The Good, The Bad and the Ugly",2018-05-10,3.0,Account Executive,"Gosh where to begin.. After working at Yelp as an AE for almost 2 years I've decided to move on to a new gig. I realize a lot of these responses on here are emotional and I am going to try to keep mine as objective as possible so that everyone can be as informed as possible. 

Starting with the good.. The job really is what you make of it. Sounds cheesy but its true. Despite a lot of the negativity you might hear around the AE role at Yelp, it isn't a bad place to start a career in sales. Training is good. 2 Months of paid training. Most future employers know of Yelp and a lot know what a grind the job is and respect your experience.  (Though some can be turned off by it) Managers and Directors are, for the most part, supportive and genuinely want you to succeed. Very team oriented. You can easily make friends and meet people and it's nice to be around people who are going through the same grind as you (misery loves company, right?) The culture in general at Yelp is great. Very unique to a company of this size and something to be cherished because you probably wont work in a cultural environment quite like this again in your career. Benefits are decent, snacks can get old but they're not bad. Promotional opportunity isn't bad. You can actually become a manager or go to upselling current advertisers (Local Client Partner) in 12-18 months which is pretty quick - as long as your a great producer. You will also never get fired at Yelp. As long as you don't do something stupid, you're fine. I have seen reps who miss quota month after month after month. Yelp rarely fires people for poor performance. People quit so much that Yelp can't afford to fire people who do actually want to stay. Good work life balance. 40 Hours a week, weekends are yours. Transparency is pretty high too. Not a lot of politics. But to get anywhere your directer does have to know/like you. Office is in a pretty nice spot in SF, and the office itself is pretty cool. Nice rooftop!","There's no sugar coating it... This is a straight call mill. Hundreds of reps calling all day. There is no strategy, or finesse involved, you are just dialing down 70+ calls a day. Every day. Every week. Forever.... Intellectually curious and critically thinking individuals need not apply.  The monotony of the job will beat those traits out of you. Beyond that...The obvious big one is the pay. The base pay starting at 40K (It was 36K when I started at Yelp) is just not competitive in SF. No one is expecting to get rich as an entry level AE at Yelp, but Yelp should at least pay a comfortable wage that is comparable to other AE/SDR roles. Management explained this in a Q&A saying paying more ""Just doesn't work with Yelps economic model"" and assured us that ""That's not a spin."" Uhhhh, OK... Whatever that means. If you don't want to pay us more fine, but don't act like it would be impossible to do so.  Commission structure is awful.  In my opinion, even worse than the base itself. You have to close several  deals in a month before you even start earning any commission. I closed tens of thousands of dollars for the company every month but because of the way the commission is structured I'd usually never make more than a couple hundred bucks in commission, if even that. Yelp knows the majority of reps wont break the threshold in a month - or if they do they barely will - and the structure is set up that way so Yelp keeps as much $$$ as possible. Even if you hit your quota of 20K every single month for  a year - which the vast majority of reps wont - you're taking home an extra 12K BEFORE taxes. Most AE jobs averaging your quota over the course of the year means you will almost double your base salary. But nope not at Yelp. The job itself is pretty soul sucking. Every sales job has its challenges and grinds but few are as high volume and as prone to burn out as Yelp. For what it is worth this does thicken your skin and help you grow in a lot of ways, but it is a drain and sometimes you wonder why you are subjecting yourself to this day in and day out.  Most of the businesses on Yelp have been called by Yelp for years and will either get mad at you, hang up on you immediately or just straight up tell you they have absolutely no interest. Some of them can be down right rude. The approach Yelp teaches is very aggressive too. We don't take no for an answer. Keep asking them to get in front of their computer until they hang up. I'm all for being assertive but sometimes the level of persistence Yelp encourages feels over the top. The product we are selling isn't a good fit for a decent amount of businesses we call but are still expected to push for the close. Managers and leadership will rave about how amazing Yelp ads is. How its God's gift to business owners and its far and away the best advertising option available. In reality, for a lot of territories and a lot of businesses it isn't a good fit and it isn't going to work. You will see for yourself when you've been on the job for a while. There's always risk when it comes to advertising so I'm OK with there being no guarantees, but when we are knowingly signing up a business that is almost guaranteed to not see success, it doesn't feel good.  One positive though is if you can sell Yelp Ads successfully, there are few things that will be harder to sell in future sales roles.  Management... You can also feel very micromanaged. It depends on your manager to some extent but in general there's strict start and stop times for the day. Some managers will question you if you are a minute late getting in. Yes. literally 1 minute. I've seen it happen.  I've had a manager ask me where I was going when I would get up to use the bathroom., ect. This type of behavior is not normal. A lot of AEs this is their first job (as it was for me) so they don't know any different but most jobs will afford you more autonomy than this.  Another negative is the limited opportunity there is for people to explore other positions at Yelp. Your only real options are to become a manager or go LCP (local client partner - upselling current advertisers) - and you can only do those things if you are a top rep. If your just an OK or average rep who has been there for a while - even if you are well liked by management, have a good attitude, have other skills that could be of value, ect - you're pretty much stuck. It's frustrating.  In the interview process Yelp stressed how open they are to AEs exploring other positions outside of sales at Yelp. In reality these opportunities are few and far between. This is your warning. If you're considering the AE job at Yelp because you want to try to get your foot in the door then move laterally to marketing, recruiting or some other area at the company, don't take this job. You will be in for disappointment.

Overall, if you have no experience and are interested in sales Yelp is worth considering. If you graduated from college (A surprisingly decent amount of people at Yelp didn't) and you got a decent GPA and have some solid internship/work experience, you can probably do better."

- SOME of your co-workers are relatively smart and overall good people. The rest you will often wonder if they actually graduated from high school.","The product does more harm than good. I felt sincerely bad for the businesses I would sign up. Yelp has to constantly remind their employees about how “great” their product is. They would send out the same emails of “success stories”. If the product is so great, you don’t need to constantly remind us of that. It should speak for itself. 

The management treats employees like they are students in a juvenile detention program. I say “juvenile” simply because you’re not treated like an adult. You have to answer to everything. Why didn’t you set an appointment on that call? Why are you three minutes late? Why are you taking pto when it’s the last week of the month? ETC..

Commission structure is completely vague. When you calculate a certain amount of commission that you should expect, you’ll notice that there are chargebacks and your commission is a fraction of what you expected. Ultimately when a business cancels the program you signed them up for, they take it out on you. And believe me, 90% if the businesses you sign up will cancel. 

Yelp views all of their employees as disposable. It doesn’t matter that you live their values, are a champion for the company, and have tenure. Once you stop producing, they’ll find a way to get out out because they can bring in someone else with a GED that’s naive enough to believe all the BS. 

I can go on, but won’t."

2277,Yelp,A year at Yelp,2018-05-03,3.0,Junior Account Executive,"I've been at Yelp for a year now. 
The opportunity to be promoted and make commission is all within reach you just have to be open to working for it. 
Daily expectations is to make 70+ dials a day, average 2.5 hours of talk time, send 35+ emails daily, and pitch business owners 2 to 3 times a day. You have to have a solid contact strategy and follow a script to get the owners 1. logged in to their account and 2. Sell them on why Yelp is a benefit for their business. You speak to several different industries from landscapers to Doctors (office managers). 
Their is a fair amount of training for the first 2 months but after that its up to you to own your own development just like any other company. You will have monthly meetings to focus on your Key positive indicators i.e (what is holding you back from reaching your goal or what is going to help you get there.) 
In the year I have been here the environment is more structured and more of a professional work place than the ""college kids"" rap Yelp offices once had.
The kitchens are stocked and making friends is easy. 


I'm honestly indifferent to the role. I like being here but Yelp is not always a place people stay for long and can help be a great stepping stone to future roles.

Keeping a positive attitude and surrounding yourself with colleagues who want to better themselves will also be a huge factor. This is not an easy job, this will challenge you to your core but it will make you better for it. I owe a lot to this company and am incredibly proud to say I work for Yelp. 
The one thing I believe people do not prepare themselves for is that this is an environment that wants to be the best and you have to realize that and to not take things to heart so much.

A cold-calling sales job is not easy, and those willing to stick it out and persevere can sure put that determination and skill to use at other jobs. I learned the importance of grit and hard work here. Ultimately, anyone able to stick it out for over a year will have a great experience to put on their resume.  

I also met some pretty wonderful people while on the job, which is bound to happen when you employ so many young people at once. But I am grateful to have met the people I met here. Misery sure does love company.","To be fair, I began my time at Yelp knowing I did not want to be in sales. It was my first job out of school and I took it because of the name and because I had few options elsewhere. 

That being said, there was not a single day in the year and a half that I worked at Yelp that I looked forward to going into the office. Of course, the job itself was difficult and unfulfilling, but I learned the value of perseverance and determination, so that was not the most important issue.  

It was the culture that made it almost unbearable. The atmosphere here was incredibly unprofessional. As someone with little work experience at the time, even I could tell the culture was amiss. Managers clearly valued the employees who could repeat word for word what they would say into their employees ears on a sales call than those who worked hard and could think for themselves. Most managers and senior management were  concerned only about optics and appearing better than everyone else in the office, which would lead to young employees being hired over better qualified ones because they fit the mold. It was painful to witness certain employees be turned down for a well-deserved promotion all because they didn't drink the kool-aid as much as their younger colleagues.

2285,Yelp,Perspective is Everything,2018-04-30,5.0,Account Executive/Sales Manager,"If you're looking at Glassdoor to decide where to start or advanced your career - I hope you'll take the time to read about my experience at Yelp.  I believe that my perspective is different than many you'll see here.

This review is not just about the Account Executive position because if you come to work at Yelp, it's not about the job you start with or the skills you start with.  It's about the job you're willing to work for and the skills you push yourself to gain.  I recently left Yelp after 3.5 years to pursue other interests but I'm so thankful for the company and the opportunities I was given - maybe my perspective will help you find the same.


Let's start with the most important part of working at Yelp - it's hard!  I started right out of college in SF as an Account Executive in 2014.  The job was exactly as described - tons of cold calling.  In fact, the reality of sales is if you're not on the phone you're not advancing your career.  Anyway - I digress.  I was 6 months in and I hated it.  In fact, you could probably look at some of the other glass door reviews and see exactly how I felt.  But here's the thing - unlike many of the people I worked with.  I decided to take the challenge head on and see what I could make of it.

I started focusing on what I could learn and let me tell you something.  This job has more opportunities to learn pivotal skills than any entry level job I've come across.  Your communication is pushed all the time, your ability to handle rejection and persevere is so key that it becomes second nature.

For the next 9 months I focused on skill building.  I became great at building relationships.  I was pushed to constantly improve and learn and become an expert in countless fields.  I was pushed to apply for leadership programs and held to a high standard - one I became accustomed to hitting.

After 1.5 years I was promoted to management.  The opportunity of a life-time in my eyes.  I was able to grow a team of individuals I cared for deeply and we pushed each other to better ourselves all the time.  I was able to learn public speaking skills, I learned how to read data like a professional and my sales skills were pushed to grow at all times.

After about a year - another opportunity came about and I moved to Chicago where I worked with some of the best people I've meet.  The culture and the work environment are top notch.  The leaders from the top down are amazing to work with - plus the Office Head has a British Accent - always a plus!

This job is about opportunity.  Opportunity isn't easy but it's worth it.  If you want to push yourself and become the best version of yourself - come work for Yelp and see what you're capable of.

My perspective is different because I looked at the ""negatives"" as learning opportunities.  The paths towards career advancement, the compensation and benefits,  and the workplace culture made this a no brainer for me.  No job is perfect but my life is undeniably better for my time at Yelp!","This job is not for everyone.  There are a ton of calls involved and the job isn't going to change.

You need to push yourself.   You need to have a great attitude.  You need to outwork your peers.  You need  to be intrinsically motivated.  If you're all of these things - this jobs for you.

Lack of diversity is a concern but up against other Tech peers Yelp is no worse.  I would have loved to see more initiatives for diversity at the management level but from my understanding leadership acknowledges this and is working to see it improved!"

2287,Yelp,"Good for the resume, not for the soul.",2018-04-27,1.0,Elite Account Executive,The pros to working at Yelp is you do get training in sales. However there have been some changes recently that make this a hyper aggressive strong arm sale. So if you are new to sales this may be a place to gain training with no prior experience. In addition to that if you last more then a year most other companies will have a certain respect for you. So a good resume builder if you can stick it out.,"I am not going to rant and rave here, I want this review to be helpful to others rather then a place for me to air my grievances. The biggest con about Yelp is the culture. There is a serious lack of professionalism. The leadership is continuously trying to change the image of Yelp but what they seem to be blind of is the fact that the issue stems from them. People are mirroring you. When a 30+ year old woman, in a leadership role, is abbreviating her words to sound like the 20-something year old employees in office meetings and emails it is not putting forth the most professional example. My suggestion is to stop worrying about being cool or hip and focus in being business people running a multi-million dollar company and maybe your employees will follow suit. Lastly I’d like to point out the lapses in judgement when it comes to promoting managers. This does not stand for every manager, however recently the leadership seems to be promoting the same type of person. Someone who does not ask questions about anything, smiles and drinks copious amounts of the koolaid.  I have personally watched them pass up some incredibly intelligent, innovative and hard working individuals because of whatever bs reason they thought up. I’m sorry but if someone who isn’t a manager steps in when their manager is out and leads the team to a almost record breaking a week I think they have adequately proved themselves over a 22 year old with an empty skull and bright smile. Just my opinion though. Lastly, the job is boring, mind numbing really. Before recent changes it was somewhat more amusing with the ability to be more consultative but now with RASS they basically want you to read off a script, not veer from that and push people to sign up for advertising after a 20 minute conversation. 

Oh and one more thing, they say you “matter” but you don’t. You are one of 1000 other sales reps and your easily replaceable. They path they are on I am pretty sure they will be able to replace you with monkeys soon. 

One last thing, the head of the NY office recently asked the 1000 employees to leave positive reviews here on Glassdoor so if you see a lot of 5 stars that could be why. The hypocrisy and irony behind that request is overwhelming if you know anything about Yelp’s policies on “asking” for reviews or soliciting positive ones."

2299,Yelp,Great first job,2018-04-21,3.0,Customer Success Manager,"The working environment is really the underlying reason people stay. The community that has been built is diverse, accepting, and moreover energetic. It's the definition of a ""millennial job"" whereas the workspaces encourage communication and offer all of the amenities one would seek; yes, even avocado toast and barista stand. The support from management is decent for personal growth. You will learn a lot about yourself from this job, like how you prefer to be managed, how to maintain professional communication with peers and clients, and how to time manage.","It's an incredibly flat company. There is no upward mobility in this role, even though it is advertised this way. There are a lot of ""opportunities"" which means switching up your role or giving you new responsibilities, without a pay bump of course. Change is the name of the game, and no one knows what is going on, ever. There are new operating procedures and product rollouts every week, and there is no clarity between departments. The communication is laughable. Even during company-wide meetings, no one can seem to ever get the video conference to work (and they are a tech company?). Moreover, management is pretty much a joke. Advancement is directly tied to performance. Most times, individuals promoted to management have never had management experience. This makes for a challenging transition for that individual, and for their team. Lastly, the pay is the industry rock-bottom. The starting is $40k, and if you look up ANY other company the base pay starts around $50k. You'll be micromanaged until you decide enough is enough."
2300,Yelp,"Great Culture, Horrible Job",2018-04-19,1.0,Account Executive,"I worked at Yelp starting in 2017 right after college. So as you other recent college grads are looking at this, please take my review into consideration. Yelp is an amazing platform and has great company culture. Everyone is young and it's essentially college 2.0 (they are trying to move away from this). If you're okay with a 40k pay and making 85 dials a day to SMB's across North America, then this job is perfect for you. There are 800 people in the NYC office, so if you're the top 1% there, you'll thrive. If you're the other 99% you'll be in the same position for a couple of years or more.

I hit my numbers consistently, I wasn't awful at the job, but I was never going to be the top 1%. So I left.","- Low pay
- Call Center (85 calls a day)
- No Overtime, they just changed this to make sure you can only make calls form 8:30am-5:30pm.
- Small deals
- Pestering business owners after years of them saying no, but you're required to call them
- Massive training classes (sink or float situation)
- Must give two weeks notice for any time off.
- No flexibility on Lunch hours only 12-1pm
- Being conned into believing there is room for growth. Don't get me wrong there is room, but you have to be top 1% to really excel in your career. I sat next to some people who had been there for over 2+ years who were making only 5k more than me and were doing the same exact job.
- You will never get another Account Executive position anywhere else that actually sells a product into organizations, as every company knows that Yelp only sells into SMB's and you'll have to start your career as a sales development rep if you ever leave Yelp. (Moving backwards)
- Please don't pigeonhole yourself."
2301,Yelp,Soul sucking & emotionally draining,2018-04-18,2.0,Account Executive,"60 days of training, free healthcare (not really free), free food, free outings, the healthcare package is good (fitness reimbursement, travel, etc).

You'll grow to make friends which is great.","People constantly yelling (either at you) whether its a business owner mad at Yelp/ you for calling them every other day or managers that feel you are too quiet, not standing, not setting enough appointments, pitching. etc. There is never a time you won't be treating less that a person. Always calling for a ""power hour"" to make you speak better rather than actually working with you to help with realistic problems Yelp creates. If you're not glued to your desk making 80 dials you're not trying hard enough. Managers will even make it a big deal if you going to the bathroom too much because your not making dials. Seriously? You can't show any emotion other than ""Go Yelp!"" Whenever you show the slightest bit of unenthusiastic character you're being negative.
The head of office is trying to turn the office around which is great but the stress he puts on managers is clearly reflected on by how the reps are treated.

2304,Yelp,Best and worst job I ever had,2018-04-15,3.0,,You will learn in the first month about business than you will learn in your entire four years of college.,We were forced at times to stay standing until we set appointments enforced by our managers as well as denied going to the bathroom until we had set an appointment.

- Great Benefits package, Free Healthcare, Gym Reimbursement (Up to $60), Pre-Taxed Commuter Benefits, 401k, Employee Stock purchase plan
- The managers I had were great at holding reps accountable and teaching reps how to be good at the job while also being down to earth 
- Great happy hours and camaraderie (Expect to go out and drink with your team/neighborhood anywhere from 1-3 times per month)
-Fully Stocked Kitchens (Which is good because if there was not, since the pay is so low, some of the employees would probably have to get a SNAP card)
-Craft Beer Kegs on the 16th Floor
-Excellent 2 Month Training Program where you will learn how to sell (If you are good at selling Yelp Advertising you will be good in any sales role)
- I learned how to use Salesforce and made many effective vetting reports (Until AR came along of course)
-Growth Potential to Management and Mid- Market within 12-18 months is reasonable (But be sure to be in the top 5%-10% of reps)
- Good Work Life Balance  Do not expect to be working over 40 hours a week here)
- When applying for careers opportunities outside of Yelp some companies will love the hustle that you have put in at Yelp","- The job itself is very monotonous (Unlike what the recruiter and training manager will tell you, you are not making open/warm calls these are cold calls)
-If Mom and Dad are still paying for your rent and other living expenses you might be able to stomach how much you actually make here. A $40,000 starting salary is not enough to cut it. The Account Executive role is a sales role that excludes the words On Target Earning's in the job description (OTE... most sales jobs have that in the description), which makes sense because a vast majority of reps are not hitting target month-in-month-out. Also reps who are promoted do not see much of bump in pay, only a mere bump in title. In conclusion you do not have to look over the river and through the woods to find a company that is willing to pay you noticeably more
- The product is painfully ineffective for a vast majority of businesses that you sign up. If you sign up 10 businesses maybe 1 or 2 of them will actually like the product, the other 8 will probably hate it and cancel, or stop paying altogether and sign up for TrueAccord (That's Yelps outsourced collection agency by the way). Towards the end of my tenure at Yelp I was actually starting to feel sorry for the businesses owners that I signed up. At times I basically felt like a scam artist looking for someone gullible enough to give me their credit card and would pray that they would atleast pay their first bill (So I would atleast get paid). If you are a purpose driven person and not purely a money driven person you might find it hard to last here. Yelp also makes it very difficult to understand the effectiveness/ROI of the advertising program by having a heavily watered down analytics report (more watered down than the Vodka bottle I would steal from my parents in High School). The business owners account is not even willing to point out unique traffic to business owners (so the 18 Clicks a Business had to their Yelp page last month could have been from 10 unique people). Management knows that the product is questionable and has a high churn rate so they resort to sending mass emails of ""success stories"" or "" #YelpAdsWork"".  In the NYC Office you cannot even sit in a bathroom stall without seeing a ""Success Story"" to your Left, Right, and In Front of You. It's kind of sad in a way, if the product is so good you shouldn't have to spoon feed it to us, we should already know.
- Account Recommendations (AR) has severely limited the reps ability to learn the power of Salesforce and understand their territory/accounts. AR was dubbed as a silver platter serving  up the hottest leads, but in reality calling a lawyer who has been dead for the past 8 years who happens to have a Yelp page or a B2B Logistics company who has no business being on Yelp is quite the contrary.  AR has gotten so bad that managers (Who have full access to Salesforce) are resorting to emailing reps Vetting Reports or Pinging Reps potentially hot leads. Although a majority of reps have an issue with AR, upper management seems to have turned a blind eye to any concerns.
- Although some companies will LOVE your Yelp background on your resume other companies will be completely turned off by it."

This should be considered a good thing, because you have to earn what you want to achieve.

2319,Yelp,Great First Job then GTFO,2018-04-06,2.0,Senior Account Executive,"Yelp is a really fun place to go right after graduating from college. Right when you get started at Yelp you are put into a training program, which truly does teach you how to be a good salesperson that being said you are placed with 40-80 other people in your starting class and it feels just like college orientation. 

I think Yelp does understand that the environment there is not for everyone and tries to mask it with fun activities, kegs, dress up days, and other funny and fun ways to divert the fact that you are a robot that is constantly dialing down and cold calling business owners that will most of the time hang up on you or curse you out because Yelp is 'ruining' their business.","There is a ridiculous amount of favoritism and now working at a new office it truly feels like you are still in high school while there. The amount of gossip or how involved managers and directors are in their reps lives is ridiculous. There is also a lack of professionalism because many of the managers are super young and don't have enough professional experience to be managing teams of 12-14 of people their same age or a lot of the time older than them. 

It genuinely felt like you were just another number at Yelp and having been someone who did extremely well there and produced numbers and was respected amongst higher ups and peers I still felt like I had no worth and that my work didn't matter. This is a very unsettling feeling especially because they have you dialing down nonstop 8 hours in the day and then to feel like you are just there to produce revenue and your development as a person and employee is overlooked truly sucks.  

They also promote that there is a lot of room for career advancement, unfortunately that is not the case. There are 2 paths management or national sales. Mind you there is over 1,000 people in the office who all are starting as account executives and all have the same goal of going in one direction or the other - every month a new group of account executives are hired and everyone is gunning for the same spot. It can become extremely stressful and disheartening when you are overlooked because someone might be a little bit more outgoing or extroverted than you. Its definitely an unfair system - and Yelp would also make plenty of false promises about promotions that were never followed through on or were followed through on months after being promised (MIND YOU PROMOTION PROMISES SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING EITHER!!!) 

All in all Yelp was definitely a fun  place to work and I made plenty of friends and learned a lot about myself and what I knew I did not work in my next place of employment. But to go into work daily and know you and your colleagues were going to complain 7 out of the 8 hours a day (that 1 hour being lunch and people still complained) is just not ideal. Yelp really needs to figure out a better way to treat their employees with respect and make them feel more important then just another robot dialing down numbers to make Yelp another dollar."
2320,Yelp,"Great growth opportunities, hard work ahead",2018-04-05,5.0,Sales Manager,"Management really cares about your development. You have easy access to your director, managers outside of your own, and other employees to help you if you are struggling. Not every rep takes advantage of that of course, but it is there for those who ask. Not every director/manager will be the perfect fit for you. If you feel it isn't working, ask for a switch sooner rather than later. They want you to succeed, so someone else might be the right person to get you there.

There is a lot of training put into the rep role as well. You have intense month 1 & 2 training, but will continue to have trainings with your manager as well as an online training system for as long as you see fit. 

It is one of those jobs where you get out of it what you put into it. If you are willing to work really hard for the 8 hours a day that you are there and implement feedback, you will go far and learn a lot. 

You also have a lot of opportunities that you wouldn't at other big tech companies. You will have the opportunities to present to teams of 8+ on topics that you have mastered. If you implement feedback and succeed in the rep role, you could have a chance to manage a team and a quota at a young age.  If you are in the management role, you will present to a floor of 100+ reps on a quarterly basis.

It’s refreshing to be able to come into work with that consistency, because it gives the job an intrinsic value you can’t replace when you have people in your corner.","Unfortunately it’s a long list. The biggest thing that comes to mind is that management sucks the power teet and will never take the time to reasonably hear their CS (customer success) reps out with any concerns they surface. The answers they give are belittling and condescending, the only purpose being to move on rather than provide valuable feedback and wonder if the opinions of their reps actually hold any weight. 

Everything is also extremely political. They promote, interview, (and allow to interview??) based on who they like the most, not who is most qualified. Yes. They don’t even give you a chance to interview if they don’t think you drink enough of the kool-aid. If you don’t fit their cookie cutter brand you won’t be chosen, but they’ll string you along anyways, giving you some sort of dangling carrot to keep getting you to interview/try at the job because turnover is always going to be a concern at a place where higher ups don’t value their employees. 

In that same vein, they put their perception of you ahead of what reality is which manifests into a toxic work atmosphere. You may have a concern with something, and instead of seeing that as constructive feedback or a chance for growth, you’ll simply create a target on your back. Or more simply they don’t like how you use your free time and they find a way to incriminate you over it. Everything they can do to control you and power trip, they will. Management will seem pleased but they’re not. And the people above management either have no idea just how bad the culture is or they don’t care enough to try to fix it. 

What’s weird about the job is they have quotas but don’t reward you for it. They have obscure systems that, while unrealistic, are religiously adhered to. And the only way people hit those numbers, for the most part, are by cheating. And since management knows they’re unrealistic they are too afraid/simply unwilling to confront those that are non discreetly unethical because god forbid they don’t hit their frivolous quota. Instead they focus all their petty energy on whether they should or shouldn’t provide the smallest of perks as opposed to creating an environment fueled by integrity. 

They use “success stories” of employees to try to convince you this is a place where you can truly grow. But again the only way you can “grow” is playing the game and being political about whose favor you’re in."

1) The salary is appalling for San Francisco. Base of 40k comes out to about $2,300 a month after taxes, less if you don’t decline the health insurance which adds $100 a month. They mention unlimited commission in your interviews, but you first need to make the company 30k up front to be commission eligible and an additional 12k each month to be eligible for that month. In addition, for whatever cause comission you would receive you will notice a substantial amount taken away from “chargebacks”. Chargebacks are a deduction from your next paycheck based on if business owners cancel their ad program before 3 months, which most of them do because they only buy the program after Yelp reps manipulate statistics and shove fake value down their throats. 

3) Insane micromanagement. If you want to work in a professional setting, do not come here. Not only do you show up to work to find frat boy attire and braless women (I mean come on ladies, I love the free the nip movement outside of work and am a female and feminist myself, but simply not appropriate), but you are also treated as a child. Managers, who were top selling reps promoted by their manipulation techniques rather than leadership abilities, will sit desk side, harass you if you check your phone for one second, “round up” if your 10 minute break is accidentally 12 minutes, and get on your back for being away from your desk at all. It is simply not pleasant - and not the managers fault as this is coming from the top down. Advice to management: to have a happy work force, treat employees as adults. Each individual working is an adult, so show respect for eachother. 

4) The employees and business owners suffer at the expense of Yelp. Employees are forced to call back business owners 5-9 times after receiving a “please do not call me about ads again” and are reprimanded if they do not manipulate statistics to create a “need” for an individual business that has no need for Yelp ads. Business owners are lied to about yelp sales reps experience in the field and industry. Often times you will hear a manager barging (speaking into reps earpiece for rep to repeat) saying “I’ve been working here for 4 years and I personally worked with your competitor and know that this is what they did to bring in X business”. Business owners, do not believe it. Essentially, Yelp reps are paid at such a low base salary that while working you must engage in questionable sales tactics to stay afloat financially. 

5) Care. Again, I truly believe Michael Davos cares but unfortunately no changes have been made to sales style, employee benefits, employee pay, or mutual respect around the work place. Unfortunately, most managers exist on a power trip of being promoted to a manager within a year after selling the most yelp ads and are unready to manage or display real leadership ability. 

6) Retention and response to unhappy employees. Sales people at a well-known company should not be constantly mentioning depression and unliveable wages. It is not just low performing reps who complain of both of these, but also quota and target hitting reps. Most importantly, when reps express their unhappiness the response from management is “You’ll hate your job just as much anywhere else” “you’ll regret leaving because you’ll hate your job just as much anywhere else” “you have to pay your dues” “you just don’t like it because you’re not good at it”. These are unacceptable responses, and really showcase what yelp is about. Manipulation of employees and business owners to line their pockets. 

7) Be honest. Yelp, be honest and treat business owners and employees better. Allow business owners to be placed on the do not call list or delete their free listing if they don’t want it, treat employees as adults and you will see magical things occur. There is a reason that people constantly want to expose you via different media sources."

Looks good on resume.,"They have to give great benefits and have kegs in the office because the job is so bad. You're cold calling all day (and while you can make good money doing it) you will not use your brain.  Time stands still here. If you're a human and allow a business owner to give you a legitimate reason that they can't pull over their car and talk to you that VERY minute, you'll end up having to listen to your phone calls with managers and do trainings. You're a robot in this position and won't develop any skills.  Everyone sleeps with each other so there is so much ""high school"" drama. Upper management treats you like high schoolers as well, giving you grades on your work for the day. Management worships top producers, and treats everyone else like dirt. One month they love you, the next they literally don't even acknowledge you."
2336,Yelp,1 star career,2018-04-02,1.0,Account Executive,"Pros are few and far between. Paid training is easy, makes it seem like everyone is bad at first then you magically get good once you “roll out”, stocked kitchen with free food (even though the food is kind of gross), and you do learn valuable sales skills-even thought 90% of them you wont be able to apply your next sales job, you’ll learn how to handle rejection, by both the business owners you speak with and the awful upper management. Hands down best part of this job are the people-I met the best people ever, BUT only because they were all my age, so basically it was like college all over again.","Cons. Where to begin. Horrible commission structure, they make it seem easy but you have to earn 12k before you even make a dollar, which is next to impossible to get to since everyone hates Yelp, very low base salary so don’t expect to make much. Honestly, personally I didn’t mind the 80+ dials and cold calling all day. Thats what you sign up for. The true con of the Chicago Yelp office is the upper management. I have never met more immature, degrading, downright awful people in my life, let along those literally running teams and and director groups. They were constantly swearing and dropping f bombs, running around like idiots wearing ridiculous hats and sunglasses, and one even threw a pen practically at our team while yelling at us for not hitting our numbers (when he was the one training us?). I felt truly degraded while working there, like i would amount to nothing, like i was nothing, and if i ever left Yelp, I would fail in any other sales role. The favoritism was INSANE-espically with male managers and directors favoring female reps and flirting with them constantly (some of them married) which became borderline uncomfortable for the rest of us to see. Out of my 4 managers at my time at Yelp, 2/3 were female, and they were great. Maybe you need to hire more strong female leadership and this office wouldn’t be such a joke."

There is very limited information on what happens after the sale and how much you will be paid out. They do have a program called ""incent"" but it is hardly ever to up to date and is confusing to read. 

Some managers have relationships that are too close with their representatives.   It creates a very uncomfortable work environment at times."

2343,Yelp,AE,2018-03-29,2.0,Account Executive,"Great people, free food, gives you tough skin, beer, ping pong tables (don’t know what else to say but need a 20 word minimum)","Management needs a lot of work.  Just because they are good at sales doesn’t mean they are good at managing or teaching. Sales reps are talked down to for not hitting numbers but when you ask for advice they usually tell you to just make more dials and send more emails. Instead of looking to management and the people who TAUGHT us to do this job, they are pointing fingers at the reps right out of college with no sales experience.  

Territories are not to be talked about but it’s physically impossible to sell the same amount as someone in a bigger city. Being told to not make excuses when you tell your manager that all your accounts are disconnected numbers and it’s impossible to get ahold of the expected number of people everyday. Our systems are always down, our lead generator AR gives us horrible accounts to call yet we are expected to still perform as expected. 

Pay is absolutely horrible. The base pay is not sustainable to live off of and the commission structure is laughable. Reps need to make Yelp 12k for them to get about $70 in commission after they tax you 60%. 

HR violations every single day. Making you stand up for hours to bring “energy”. I understand standing may help you speak better but actually forcing you to do so and being rude to you if you don’t is ridiculous.  Making us chug Red Bull’s to also “bring energy” is also unacceptable. Yet HR has never seemed to care that this was happening. 

Telling us that positive mindset is all that matters and that differentiates good from the bad. When your manager has no other advice to give you but “have a positive mindset be happy”. The managers mean well, but I don’t think they know how to accurately train us to do better. 

Strict work schedule. You must start working on the exact second the clock strikes 830. And god forbid you get back from lunch at 1:01 instead of 1 pm or your director will start yelling to get on the phones. Good luck asking to leave a little early or coming in a little late. You’ll be asked why or be ignored by management for the rest of the day."

-impressive sales training program. You will learn important skills that you can apply to future jobs that go far beyond just Yelp.
-really great medical benefits. I had to go on medical leave while on the job, so I know what I mean when I say great benefits.","-Emotionally exhausting.  So stressful that I would lose sleep thinking about pitches and quota. 
-For my first 5 months on the job, I had 4 different managers and 4 different teams (2 of them quit). It was nearly impossible to become comfortable. When you're learning and working such a high stress job, having to adapt that often was a distraction to my ability to do my best work, especially when having to adjust to so many different manager styles. 
-VERY low base salary for SF. My rent was $1600 per month (pretty standard for SF), and I was barely getting by. 
-Multiple reps from different divisions of Yelp (yelp wifi, yelp rez ect.) would be reaching out to your leads, oftentimes contacting them after you had already started pursuing. Many businesses I called were getting an incredibly high volume of calls weekly because they would have multiple reps from each division and from other parented accounts, calling your location. Businesses owners were pissed and overwhelmed, I would be too. 
-Unprofessional environment. It's very similar to high school and like a popularity contest. I didn't come here fresh out of college, and I was clearly nieve for expecting an adult job. I once overheard my floor director speaking to another rep. He said ""Yeah, if I'm not giving you any attention or not talking to you, you can just assume your not doing well"". Yeah.........egoism and a blatantly dismissive attitude to reps who are struggling does not equate to good leadership. It's why your retention rate is abysmal. People notice more than you think. 
-I did phone sales prior to Yelp, so I did not go into this with unrealistic expectations. What caught my attention at Yelp is the lack of empathy between managers and their reps (I had one manager who was astounding with his empathy. It was my favorite manager and team, if he would have stuck around I would have stayed, THAT'S how much of a difference a good manager makes. He really believed in my ability to do well and that reflected in my output and my attitude, despite what the board said). I understand that they need to make team quota, but their strategy for helping reps who are having a difficult time is counterproductive. Most of the time, reps want nothing more than to be good at their job. Talk to them, hell, let them vent for a second, give some positive reinforcement. It goes so much farther than you would think, not just for the 
rep individually but for the team as a whole (when one struggles we all struggle). 
-Overall, I'm grateful for what I learned at the company, and I don't want my criticism to detract from that. This is just not a place you stay for long because it takes a toll on your mental health."

Constantly rounding up to discuss how to hit a quota number gets very tiring very quickly. 

Managers tend to pick favorites when helping 'barge' in on pitch calls. It helps out that managers do this; however, it is glaringly apparent that managers prefer to barge certain reps, which helps managers get to their own numbers. It would be nice to make this less apparent. 

If going into a sales role, mindset is everything; however, yelp management again chooses to bash these ideals into your head every single day. Constant urging to stand during the day to 'pep up the day' gets quite annoying quite fast"

My team was the most welcoming and immediately made me feel connected to a network of friends. I see that happen in all departments within Yelp. A lot of people grab lunch together and/or hang out outside of work.

Another benefits that I found while working at Yelp was the fact that I got to work with really great coworkers, and went through a rigorous but thorough training process. Not to mention the overstocked kitchen, and really great facilities – as well as a rec room. Another great benefit of this position was working in the heart of downtown Chicago, and at my favorite location, right on River North.","OK, the cons of this job far outweigh the pros, the entire culture and environment of yelp is extremely toxic, in my opinion at least, there is a general cult of personality around Yelp itself – which lends to the over all toxicity of the workplace. Also, management really doesn’t take concerns or career paths very seriously. A general lack of direction is very palpable everywhere at the office, and if you are having any problems with clients, or have any problems with a team or team member, the solution is always “let’s make some more dials!“ This job is good for people with no experience before or after school, and to be honest, this is a good first job out of school – but that’s pretty much it. But perhaps the thing that really irked me about this position and Yelp in general, was how this role was sold to me, I was told it was basically going to be a digital marketing position, that I would be handling their online ad campaigns, doing research on their specific industries, and even creating banner ads for their pages. There was no mention of cold calling or hard-core sales until after the fact, it was the lack of transparency is what ultimately hooked me to this position. The deal was sealed with a good benefits package, and once I had found out it was just cold calling, I had already accepted and was in my first week of training. I don’t want to discourage people from working at Yelp if you really want to, but be very wary when applying, if you’re really into hard-core sales this is the job for you – if not, then stay away!"

First of all, if you want a job more long term, the easier route at this company would be to join any office other than NYC where they treat you like robots.  (PHX and SF better options)

Everyone has to get in at the same time, everyone has to take lunch at the same time, everyone is allowed to leave at the same time, unless we are short on goals...then NYC works till 11PM.  Did you leave the office?  Expect a phone call from your hungry manager who needs some more cash.  Please help me, I am short 10K.  Do you have a deal somewhere?

The other offices think there is more talent in NYC, maybe, but it's also if we are working when they are sleeping, naturally we will generate more revenue.

So yea Kindergarten folks, permission to use the bathroom, all of that is in play here.

Also- if you like crowded elevators where it takes you 25 minutes just to get on one, (we hire 80 new people a month to keep up with the rapid turnover), then this is a good move.  

Free food?  Yes, slimy deli meats in the fridge with jars of mayo that the college kids who just joined have left out for hours on the counter from the day before because they assume they are still living in their frat house.

Managers knew less than me, and requested I be on their team so they could learn and get better in sales.  If you're talented, find a company that can get you even more talented, not a place that's hiring managers who know less than you.

Vacation is permitted if you are at your number.  Frowned upon otherwise.

If you're sick, or you have seriously injured yourself....  Good luck, they don't care. Get to work somehow.  Cold or Flu?  Manager requests doctor's note for being out 1 day and a call from you while you're sick on bed and passed out.  Yes, even from top performers. They miss you the most, you're their bloodline, AKA their pot of gold.

Whether you suck or do well, upper management will pull the best and the worst into rooms and threaten their job security just so they know who is boss.

Promotions are only in title, not in pay.  Most often the promotions result in an immediate decrease in pay.  (ex: Switch from Local to Franchise or Mid Market means less money or less commissions )

People will cry a lot, and dread coming in, because that's the environment here.  Tissues are bought in bulk.  Well at least that's nice, maybe something for the pro column.

They tell you that this is the best job you'll ever have, the people who say that must have had really bad jobs...(The Sales Directors Here) because I regretted leaving my previous employer (maybe at about the 7 month mark) after things truly hit me and I stopped sipping the Koolaid). It's harder to realize how bad this place is if you're a top performer, because they love you and bribe you as best they can to stay.

Finally when I got the courage to leave, after being talked off the ledge countless times (because who would want to lose a cash cow) I found a new home that doesn't hire robots and cares about their employees.

Don't believe me?  Join and see for yourself.  You'll quit right away, but it's more likely that you'll get fired."

I’m just trying to save you, I wish there were someone to have saved me!! Do more research or try to find someone that works there first, before you make the move!

-They have recently added access to life coaches through the Ginger.io app as part of their benefits package, which admittedly was a nice attempt to help us with stress management.","-You cannot be a kind person and succeed here. Empathetic? Understanding? Want to make a positive difference in people's lives? You will be coached out of that. All you are supposed to care about is hitting your number, regardless if you actually think this program would work for a business. To Yelp's credit, this is just the nature of sales. But since a lot of people out of college are looking at the AE position just to get into an office environment, this will serve as a warning. 
-They will tell you that after a year of working in sales and you find out that it is not your ""thing"", you can transfer to a different department like opps, HR, data analysis, whatever. You actually HAVE to have been good at sales to allow you to move anywhere, and even then those job openings are few and far between. If sales isn't your ""thing"" you'll likely just end up quitting. For the most part management isn't knowledgeable or well-equipped to help someone struggling in the role. There are some helpful sales managers but that seems to be more the exception than the rule here. 
- If sales IS your thing, you get promoted to sales management. Not strong in leadership or interpersonal communication? Don't need that to be a sales manager here. All you have to do is be able to close. Then you take a pay cut to babysit a bunch of new hires. See, Yelp hires Account Executives en-mass to do the grunt work that no one else wants to do. AEs make the 80 calls a day trying to get anyone on the phone long enough to qualify and pitch, then the manager jumps in and makes you parrot lines to closing, even if you're not comfortable with what's being said. They know most AEs will burn out and not last long, they just want to keep the good ones around to close the deals for the kids.
-You will be micromanaged to such an extent that you will get into a habit of needing an answer for everything that could happen throughout the day: why did that call not close? Why are you not reaching enough decision makers? Why only x many appointments and they didn't show? You could be on the phone with a business owner confiding in you how much of a struggle it is to make ends meet and your manager will be next to you barking lines to say.
-Base pay is low and the commission structure is a joke. 
-You did not earn a college degree to mindlessly make dials for 8 hours a day and to be treated like a child about your work, your process, when you take breaks, etc. Just look elsewhere."

The favoritism that goes on here is ridiculous. Hit quota and you can have your management team telling everyone how much of a god you are. This is a high school environment where people don't say excuse me. Management loves dating their reps. Reps get promoted for just hitting quota 3 times and have no management experience so they eventually get demoted for not having their team got their quotas.  People know everyone's business. It was a nightmare working here. The training makes you think that you're going to be so successful but no that's not how it goes.

2387,Yelp,Account Executive,2018-02-27,2.0,Account Executive,"-I absolutely loved the co-workers on my team, I made friends for life in just a few short months.
-The open floor plan setting of the office. Yelp is set up to where you are in a giant room in a sea of desks with neighbors all around you. I know this may not sound too glamorous but it's actually amazing, it creates a ""we're all in this together"" environment and it's easy to make friends, chat, and de-stress in this kind of environment. The directors of the office have the same style of desk/environment as entry level account executives.
-If Yelp is a good fit for you, there are tons of opportunities for growth within the company.
-Yelp is extremely diverse and inclusive, and Yelp solidly supports a very tolerant environment and company.
-Fully stocked kitchens and coffee shop, the kitchen has high quality food and snack items too.
-Excellent benefits, I had among the best benefits among all of my friends who graduate colleged and got entry level jobs with me
-Yelp provides lots of different clubs and organizations where you can join to meet other people, network, and get involved with the company and local community.
-The Sales Training Program is extremely thorough and useful, and you are able to learn a lot of valuable information in just two months.","Before I start with cons, I do want to preface this by saying I'm not necessarily discouraging any and every person from working at Yelp. If you have the right personality type and have a natural gift for sales, Yelp can be a great place to work and I know people who enjoy working there. However, the experiences of myself and many others is typically not very positive.

-Yelp has this attitude of ""we are perfect, we do nothing wrong, our product is perfect, our training methods are perfect, our computer software is perfect, our script is perfect, etc. etc."" Here's an example of how this is a major con: I lost many, many sales during my time at Yelp due to technical difficulties and user unfriendliness of the sales product, many of these issues can be fixed with better IT software. Anytime I lost a sell because of technical difficulties, not only did it make this job unnecessarily harder than it needed to have been, I was always at blame due to the loss of the sale because ""Yelp is perfect, and it's your fault that messed up"". Yelp needs to get over itself in this regard, it's still a young company that is wet behind the ears, and there is still lots of room for improvement. And no, the script is not perfect.
-This job is entirely performance based, you are expected to make 'x' number of calls, have 'x' number of pitches per month, have 'x' number of quality calls, 'x' number of humans to computer, 'x' number of callbacks, and 'x' number of revenue closed each month including relatively difficult quota expectations. Yelp does have a very good sales training program, and you can gradually become better by learning different sales techniques and implementing feedback. However, there are many things in sales at Yelp that is completely out of your control and can affect your metrics/performance, the territory you're assigned to plays a huge factor (even though Yelp says it doesn't), your natural personality is extremely important (and obviously something you can't change), and also simple luck and timing. If you have a rough month, you'll have a manager breathing down your neck and micromanaging you, even though most of the issues are out of your control.
-The biggest reason I decided to leave Yelp is because I don't have a natural sales personality, meaning I don't have an extroverted personality that can put people at ease quickly, and I don't have an assertive bone in my body. I kept feeling like Yelp management was trying to change my personality, which is something I could not possibly do no matter how hard I tried.
-A lot of your happiness at the job depends on what team, floor director, and manager you have. I was unlucky to be on a high stress floor with high expectations, but other floors and other managers are more laid back and caring about your job happiness. If you decide to take a job with Yelp, keep your fingers crossed that you are assigned with a good manager on a positive floor."

2391,Yelp,Cold calling until you die,2018-02-22,2.0,Account Executive,"Most of the people you meet here are very nice and friendly. I became close friends with some of my teammates and this is why I stayed as long as a did. The training program is great and one of the best in the area, also everyone knows Yelp so it looks great on a resume. There are lots of perks to the job like a free coffee shop, beers on tap after work, and great benefits. I was good at the job and was rewarded for it with cool incentives like free PTO. Team offsides we’re also a lot of fun, the whole experience felt like an extension of college, which is exactly what I wanted at the time.","At this job you have one task and one task only, which is why most people get burned out after a while and the average person stays only about 7-8 months. Once you start to figure out how to do the job it becomes very very monotonous, I felt like I was starting to go insane. You literally make dial after dial only to get hung up on, yelled at, complained to about things you can’t fix like bad reviews, etc. and on top of this you are somehow expected to remain positive 24/7 and keep up with the 65-80 dials a day. Metrics were a much bigger deal than I thought they would be, at least to my manager. All of your performance is tracked on salesforce, so it’s easy for managers to micromanage and tell you all the things you’re doing wrong. They never acknowledge how tedious the job is, and there is literally NOTHING to break up the eight hour day of cold calling. 

As far as management goes, I genuinely liked my manager, however, I think he was so stressed out because upper management puts a lot of pressure on managers to hit their teams number, and they in turn put a lot of pressure on reps to hit their quota and target. I felt like nothing I ever did was good enough for my manager, because he was under so much stress. The quotas weren’t realistic and most reps wouldn’t make quota, which is probably a sign that they were too high. I was definitely one of my managers favorites because I was able to hit my number, but the way he treated my friends who were struggling to close deals was NOT cool. It was like he focused more on the top earning reps because he thought were going to stay longer, and kinda ignored everyone else. Favoritism is very real here, all the managers seem to buy into it. They also will tell you that all territories are created equal which is the BIGGEST LIE I HAVE EVER HEARD. I had friends who got bad territories where they could barely get appointments, let alone close deals, and sometimes my manager would do something about it and sometimes he wouldn’t. I called into a small town and most of the businesses I called had blank yelp pages and there were no yelp searches happening in their industry, which made yelp a difficult product to sell. It was garbage.

I could literally go on and on about yelp but in a nutshell I would say that the bad outweighs the good and this is why I only worked here less than a year. However, I’m still glad I had the experience because it gave me a thicker skin and a sense of reality. I would say work here for six months out of college to gain experience and then get out."

You get yelled at a lot by people you call. Terrible territories you call into. When you actually do make a sale, they cancel after a month or two because the product does not work in smaller towns. They just hire as many people as they can because they know people are going to quit. Days go pretty slow because you just do the same thing over and over. It’s honestly like high school, there is so much drama that goes on there.

Guy that used to live in Compton...got Compton.... etc

Anyways, if you are white and pretty you will do well. You will get a better territory than the minorities. Bonus points if you were in a frat or sorority. 

You will be lucky to get a manager who is a rational person but that is few and far between.  Managers also have bosses which are the Directors.  All managers try to brain wash the AEs into thinking Yelp is the best and businesses should be happily and willingly paying Yelp....and it works......even though Yelp ads are total crap....the employees thinks its the best invention since sliced bread.

Like hello the sales team is the one bringing you in all the rev and yet at get the bottom of the barrel. I was better off living in my fraternity house. There is most certainly favorites and it is always obvious.

I believe strongly that Yelp helps people live and eat better, save money, and most importantly, helps build strong local economies.","I don't have a lot of cons to share. As Yelp has scaled from a startup we have experienced plenty of speed-bumps. The learning curve is steep. We've had issues with motivation, communication, and siloed teams. However any time we hit any of these bumps in the road, much effort is taken to fix it. Which really results in a positive atmosphere, in the end. Toxicity, if it exists, doesn't last.

It also allows you to leave work at work; in the AE role, the expectation is that you do absolutely zero ""work"" outside of Yelp.","Cold-calling is not for everyone and it's easy to get down on yourself when you're struggling. Similarly, Yelp focuses hard on retention, meaning it is hard to lose your job (like, incredibly hard), and while this may be a pro for a lot of people, it means that employees that are negative, or don't come to work on time, or otherwise don't contribute don't get fired or quit, which hurts the culture of the company. Granted, it's a trade-off; you don't want to have a company where anyone who is mediocre is fired right off the bat, but Yelp could do a better job of enabling employee churn where it clearly makes sense. I believe the culture of the company would improve as a result."

Fun work environment 
Engineers have a lot of freedom
No deadlines (!)
Very passionate product team
Very capable engineers
Very little process and limited meetings especially for engineers. 
Good speed of execution- Code is deployed 3 times a day for main monolith and can be deployed unlimited times on demand for backend services. Apps are released every 2 months. 
Great location- huge building and right in downtown
Great stock refresh plan
Very open culture when it comes to execs talking about roadmaps, and honest company performance. 
Very collaborative environment - you can ping any engineer on any team on irc in team chat rooms. There are on point members for every team who will respond to any questions. Even debugging code (wow)

Free lunch on fridays, free birthday cake from team on birthdays. $$ to spend on ‘productivity items’ like your favorite keyboard, book, noise cancelling headphones. 
Recently efforts being made to show gratitude and make employees feel valuable (its working) like yelpiversary cards (work anniversary)

Quarterly ‘reviews’ which aren’t really performance reviews- they are conversations with your manager to set expectations and give feedback. 

Free ASL classes, free movie nights every fortnight. 
I worked for a big company before this and though that company has a big name- I didn’t enjoy the culture, work at all. I’m blown away by this company.","Might not find challenging projects depending on team. 
Outsiders have a perception that yelp is not doing anything new/innovative.

You are essentially a telemarketer, your day consists of sitting in an office making 50-70 cold calls a day. Your base salary is 40K and it will never go higher that 56K. That's not all, the COMMISSION STRUCTURE IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. Do not let the recruiters trick you into saying it isn't. There is a reason there are 400 Account Executives at each office. You are merely a number in their system. They do not value anyone. However, they do higher anyone! Yelp hires anyone with any educational background. Most people that work here don't have a college degree. You are calling people that have been already called by reps all across the country 10-20 times in the past 5 years.

The only reason I have stayed at this job as long as I have is because of them. Some of the skills you learn can be beneficial and it looks great on a resume,"Where to begin. Lets start with the managers. They handle the day to day by micromanaging everything you do based off a metrics system that tends to be off often. There is little room for growth after training because during an appointment, you manager almost always tries to barge you call and tell you what to say.  It doesn't allow you to grow as a sales person. 
The managers of each team can be nice but they are fake. They preach positive attitude but at the first opportunity they'll tear you down even though you were doing exactly what they told you. My manager had a terrible close ratio while  barging and always found something to blame on my coworker. 
Next let me discuss the territories. They office is spread so thin with territories that in November they had to do a organizational wide territory swap. They save the good territories for favorites while the others are stuck with areas that have populations of 50-100 people. Not saying its impossible to sell but it makes it damn close. 
Often people feel neglected and bullied into working like we are in a sweatshop. Most who work at Yelp tend to start hating the product and the job itself due to the conditions we work under.

This was my first job after college and allowed me to relocate to the city I wanted to live in. The salary is SUPER low but I had saved a lot of money prior so it never bothered me like other people felt. The training was pretty good and if you can make it through a year of straight ""cold calling"",  you can learn a lot.  As a lot of people previously mentioned, there is free food, beer, coffee, which is obviously nice when you are a recent grad. I had a lot of opportunities (management, national, training opportunities, etc.) that I appreciated and took part in, however, it never really took my career in a better direction OUTSIDE of Yelp. Inside the walls, I could have been a queen and collected my paycheck for years, however, once you leave, you realize the real world doesn't value most of the ""experience"" you can accumulate here.","I hate to say it, but there are a lot of cons that span across personnel choices, leadership, culture, product, company success, etc. I'll focus on the 2 main ones that matter most if I was reading this. After over 4 years and various promotions at Yelp, I finally left and figured that with all my ""experience"" and praises (just to keep me from quitting), I would find a career that is a step up from where I left off at Yelp. This was NOT the case since 95% of the companies outside of Yelp are not going to want you. And believe me, I talked to some amazing companies who straight up told me this (Time Inc, Conde Nast, Hearst, Scripps Networks, Spotify, Pandora, WME, Amazon, Discovery Communications, 4/5 of the top Ad Agencies...) Why? Well, unless you've been living under a rock, a lot of people and companies don't like Yelp. Truth be told, I got interviews with these companies because they didn't understand how I lasted that long or because of my original way of reaching out. If you are applying to sales roles, you won't be qualified at the level you think you should be and will be looking at entry level roles.  This is beause selling a PPC ad placement and a photo slideshow isn't even close to selling media, digital, print etc. The good news is you can snap your fingers and get hired at Zocdoc, Mainstreet Hub, Yext, Yodle, etc. But, if you left Yelp, I doubt you would want to go to any of those types companies. The other main con I have is with the people in leadership positions. There are definitly some awesome folks at Yelp, however, they are shadowed by the bad ones.  I witnessed some pretty terrible behavior including rasism, bullying, rumors,  gossiping, favoritism, and ""respected"" leaders referencing doing really messed up stuff. From my experience, most of the leaders at Yelp  thrive off power over people, popularity, being a** kissed, spewing bs, and will  dismiss and avoid employee concerns about the company and product at all costs."

- They offer a few nice perks like a $60 wellness stipend and a limited kitchen, also kegs on Friday... But they're only offering these because they're desperate to hang onto people. The miserable day-to-day is absolutely not worth two cheap IPAs on Friday.","- It's CONSTANTLY a Jekyll and Hyde situation with higher-ups. It's sunshine-and-rainbows all throughout training, then someone breathing down your neck about metrics as soon as you're out. They hire you on with the promise of internal promotion and opportunities outside of sales, then later tell you they'll *maybe* consider the top-tier executives to train for a slightly-higher position sales role a year and a half to two years from now and that it's practically unheard of to move out of sales once starting as an AE. Things like that, all the time.
- The expectations are ridiculous and only getting worse as time goes on. How are you supposed to have meaningful conversations with people when you're expected to make 80+ dials a day? Or have an hour and a half of daily talk time when people literally just yell at you and hang up? Just as an example, the first territory I got was in Hawaii, which is three hours behind California. So I was expected to start calling businesses at 5:00 AM their time... It was rare that anyone ever answered and if they did, it was with ""Do you know what time it is?"" Yes, I do, and I'm so sorry. Anyways, not ideal for closing any deals.
- Really, you're just treated like a dispensable teeny-tiny cog in the machine. I never got the impression that any management cared about the growth of the new AEs because over 1/2 quit within a year. Not to sound dramatic, but it's pretty soul-crushing to work at Yelp. Listen - You didn't go to school for four years to be harassed by small business owners on the phone when you're doing something that can easily be automated. If a cold-calling sales job is what you want to do long term, go for it, I guess, but if not...

As a former professional of 10 years, I had experience but it was not in Sales.  It was in teaching.  Giving me a chance and training me into a Sales role was huge and actually helped me leverage my experience into a different, more lucrative position.  

The training program was excellent and is perfect for someone who is transitioning into a career in Sales.","Where to begin.  Inherently flawed product.  I can’t tell you how many situations I was placed in where the business owner on the other end said our product was flawed and you are working for a company that extorts small business owners.  Sometimes they were just being irrational but more times than not I was inclined to agree with them.  

Mindless hours of calling and reading from a script.  There were so many days when I wanted to walk out midway through the day and tell management that I quit.  

I guess my greatest disappointment was Yelp misrepresenting how much money you can actually make here.  Rarely did I go a month when I didn’t make money for the company, but there policy that you needed to make 12K before making any sort of commission was unfair.  Most Reps I know never really made much in commission or when they did they would chargebacks from businesses who were cancelling their ad program because it didn’t work for them."

From the surface your first impression is that Yelp is a recognizable brand and would look like resume bling to future employers, but that's not the case at least in markets Yelp operators in (SF, AZ, CHI, NY) because there are thousands of reps in the exact same role. Yelp also claims to be B2B sales, but selling to local businesses doesn't translate to selling to corporate businesses. The Yelp sales cycle is very transactional and emotional. You can pick up the phone and have an open call close, that's not uncommon. In other B2B organizations, the sales cycle is more strategic, analytical and complex. A lot more decision makers, strategy and creativity is involved and the average deal is bigger and longer. If you decide sales is for you, you want to start in a SDR/BDR role selling to corporations not mom and pop shops.

Regardless of the number of scripted responses that you are trained to say, it never got easier to get screamed at by business owners who did not want to advertise... and your managers expect you to call those people back and change their mind. Of course, not all business owners yell at you, but it is also tiring to sift through account information to find reasons that they should buy from Yelp when many were not a good fit. I don’t think the role is hard, but it is frustrating. The job itself is not intellectually stimulating because they give you a script and a map for everything, so the challenge is really to keep yourself motivated enough to call 80+people everyday who do not want to talk to you."

I worked at Yelp for a year. As my first job out of college, it was a great way to push myself and jump into the real world. As a fairly shy person who is prone to depressive episodes, I do think this position helped me learn how to manage my mental health and realize how much I can do if I put my mind into it. Management is very open to helping you, and the camaraderie within sales team is great. Can't complain about the free food, drinks, and coffee bar either.","Most of the pros I mentioned are a necessity to stop this from being a completely miserable job. I knew what I was getting myself into, but I don't think anything could prepare someone for calling people 70 times a day. When you close a deal, you will probably have no idea how you did it, which only makes it more stressful as higher expectation are placed on you. 

Management, while nice, often contradicts itself and can only do so much. Many managers are people who have only been in your shoes as an AE for one to three years which, quite frankly, isn't that long at all. If you are any bit of a skeptic, the company culture is really going to test you. Upper management will feed you stories about how great Yelp is, how much it's helpful to small businesses, and how transparent they are about your work life and business. 

Take even a glance away and you'll notice salespeople getting praised for working overtime to close a deal, managers have told me to ""not worry about"" small business owners I've closed who may have trouble with their ad programs, and supporting unhealthy habits to keep people working (like goading people to drink red bull at 10 in the morning).

2473,Yelp,"Challenging job with its own rewards, but Terrible Management",2017-10-26,2.0,Account Manager,"The job itself is interesting. You get to talk with all kinds of people, from across the country. After a year here, you get a solid sense of what concerns people and how that differs region by region. If you're into sociology and/or psychology, the conversations you have can be fascinating and rewarding, albeit at times emotionally exhausting.

Your coworkers (other account managers - rarely do you directly interact with anyone outside of your department) are by and large some of the most caring and intelligent people you'll ever meet. Yelp makes a concerted effort to be a diverse company, and has a lot of committees and clubs in which employees can participate.

The benefits are great. Free health insurance if you're single, and a monthly gym reimbursement of up to $60. You also get discounts to local bars for happy hours, etc, if you show your badge, and a discount on the annual Divvy bike membership. You can also opt to have a monthly CTA pass deducted from your paycheck, which is nice. Also, you get shares in the company and can keep them even if you leave.","You know the saying that says people don't leave their jobs - they leave their managers?  Well, nowhere is that saying more accurate than when applied to Yelp.

This is, by far, the most bewildering management style I've ever encountered. It's designed to put employees constantly on the defensive. I've had four managers at Yelp in the year+ I've been there, and only *one* of those four did not create toxic interactions on a daily basis. 

If you're having a rough day or week, be prepared for a manager to pull you aside and ask if you even want to be working there (this even happened after a colleague had an asthma attack, utterly unrelated to the job!). If you're having a killer month and leading your team in metrics, be prepared to have a manager publicly praise you in department-wide meetings, but privately deride you in 1:1's. If you do not react defensively or show emotion when you are being accused of cheating (happened to a Yelp colleague of mine who is the most honorable person I know), be prepared to be told you're too hard to read and uncooperative (also happened to multiple colleagues). Just about anything can get you a target on your back. Even the am's who appear to be management favorites have the same gripes.

Managers speak smilingly about their past interactions with their own prior managers, interactions in which they had had yelling matches, broken down and cried, and then become ""friends"" again - which, when I first started the job and heard those tales, caused me to raise an eyebrow, but whatever - I let it slide despite how unprofessional and immature that seemed to me. I had hoped that that was in the past. 

It's not, and managers will poke the bear (you) until they get a reaction. The goal appears to be to make employees feel insecure about who they are not just as Yelp employees, but as people, so the manager can tear you down, then build you back up. Because of this, Yelp seems confused about what a manager is supposed to do and to be. 

A probable cause of Yelp's past and current management issues is due to the fact that they hire high-performing account managers into management positions. 

While this is a nice effort to promote from within, apparently previous management experience is not a priority. High performers do not typically translate to the most effective managers. Based on what previous and current Yelp managers have shared with me, experience in managing people is not something that is deemed as necessary because there are templates for just about every single manager-employee interaction possible. If you don't know how to manage people, it's fine! Just follow this script and you'll eventually get it. 

Except, you don't, not really, which is why account managers typically start looking for work after about six months. 

I've stayed as long as I have because I do enjoy the job itself and truly believe in the importance of the platform to business owners and local economies - but I, as well as the majority of my colleagues, either wish the way Yelp trains management would change drastically, or we wish we worked somewhere else. It's truly a shame, because the issue with Yelp is less with the job and almost entirely with the management style and structure.

I want to go on, and be more specific and give more specific examples, but I'd like to maintain some degree of anonymity while I still work here. Because, unbelievably, I don't mind the job. I'm getting a lot out of it, personally. But it's becoming increasingly untenable. It's sad. I wish I could say I see myself here in five years, or even one, but I don't.

Which brings me to my final thoughts, the overall mantra of management at Yelp: ""Perception is everything."" You will hear this repeated. It's a terribly unfortunate  way to view the world in the first place, and an immature, unprofessional way for a manager to operate. A manager should examine every situation objectively; a good, effective manager, that is."
2474,Yelp,Account Executive,2017-10-26,2.0,Account Executive,"Music playing throughout each floor, snacks/kitchen access, contemporary environment. Team and floor offsites every couple of months.","You are disposable and a human body making cold calls. Quitting is so normalized that is quite sad and makes you wonder when you're day will come. People don't even give notice, they simply quit. Turnover rates are so high that they hire 30+ every calendar month to keep up. 

You're underpaid and expected a lot out of. No one can really live off of 40k base. Also you don't make commission unless you're really really good and can hit their commission ""threshold"" they have every calendar month. The majority of AE's miss quota and rarely make commission. 

The environment is very immature and nostalgic of college. They hire people straight out of college because they know that they are the likeliest demographic that will out up with the demands and nature of the cold calling role and pay.

Management is immature and promoted from within. Just because they were a great salesmen/women doesn't mean that they will make great sales managers/leaders. Often the managers are just worried about hitting quota and numbers and metrics, and less about the humanity and health of their team members."

2477,Yelp,The best worst job you ever had....,2017-10-23,3.0,Account Executive,"Easy points: Free fully stocked kitchen which means you don’t EVER have to think of breakfast or lunch. In house barista, frequent off-site activities with your team (which are actually fun), two months of training, open communication with management (managers often become best friends), insane amounts of booze if that’s your thing. Your coworkers are your homies. 

I was at Yelp for almost two years. I learned a lot and grew as a professional. If you don’t have a lot of job prospects after college (let’s face it, most of us don’t) then this is an EXCELLENT opportunity to gain experience. So many doors opened up for me after a year at Yelp. That said, it’s such a hard job. Your quotas are tough, morale is hard to maintain after 100 “No’s” a day. You have to be resilient and find a reason to love coming to work. Mine was my friends and the fun atmosphere. From my understanding, that atmosphere in Chicago is all but gone, however. No more beer after work unless you close a deal, less casual dress, ZERO job security, temporary promotions are INSANELY common. If you’re a manager and your team does not perform, you’re going back on the phones. 

Base pay (after recent bump) is fair for living in Chicago.","This is a really really hard job. It’s not that fun unless you really love the people you work with. You have to get rejected literally 80 times a day EVERDAY searching and begging for one “Sure, I’ll listen.” And then you hope and pray they show up for your pitch that lasts an hour long, then you’ll beg for their business and fight and fight until you hopefully get a yes. If you didn’t, prepare for your manager to ask you what went wrong *eye roll*

Oh ya! They listen to your calls while you’re on them and often tell you what to say. My favorite manger respected my preference for minimal communication while I’m on a call. When I switched managers after a year and a half, however, my new manager did not respect my tenure there, my success there, or my preferences and told me what to say on every call. It’s very annoying to have your boss tell you what to say when you feel better saying something else. But do not be afraid to communicate your issues with your manager as they are there to support you. Don’t let all this stop you from taking the job if and really only if you’re a new grad. If you’ve had a job before, you might hate this. If you haven’t, it could be the best time of your life....maybe not. My experience was different than yours will be simply due to when I started and the size of the office then."

But the actual job itself of calling the same businesses in my territory 3-4 times a week, asking to speak with the owner... I sometimes couldn't believe I was in a sales job. There are times also when Britney Spears would come on and I thought I was in an episode of Black Mirror (S1, E2). 

I'm a passive introvert with mild anxiety problems. This job is great at exposure therapy for anxiety issues. I used to freak out before each dial and spend 10 minutes before I make a call, thinking about what to say, having my heart beat a million times a minute during my first month. But when you're expected to make at least 65 calls a day, it really helped overcome my anxiety.

This job wasn't for me - you have to battle it out with the business owners and give them value on Yelp and turn their ""not interested"" into ""okay, I'll speak with you"". I'm the kind of person who, when I hear someone is clearly annoyed with me and not interested, I'm going to apologize and then hang up. You can't do that here, lol.

There are some people talking about work/life balance here. It's a M-F, 8:30-5:30pm job. Not atypical. You might be expected to stay until 10pm on the last day of the month if you haven't hit quota; but this is nothing compared to other jobs that I know that are 50+ hours a week."

The most important thing is that you get your work done, and so the hours don't really matter (as long as you're there during the core business hours of 10-4pm). Each team is different but the two teams that I've been on both operated the same way. People came in, worked hard for the 8 hrs that they were there, and went home at a reasonable hour - including taking lunch/coffee/chit chat breaks .... Timings are very flexible and management is always understanding of those times when you need to work from home.
- Incredible culture - they treat their employees so well. From free snacks/drinks on every floor, to free catered food/beer every Friday, to free and delicious coffee/cold brew daily from our talented baristas, to free deli sandwiches/bagels/pb&j sandwiches .... I could keep going but you get the idea. Being in the industry that Yelp is in, there's plenty of free and delicious food, as expected. Or just walk a few blocks away to dozens and dozens of fun and interesting restaurants because Yelp is in the middle of everything! 
- Fun events every quarter, such as hackathons, team outings, holiday events, etc. They really do a great job of making sure employees are rewarded and feel appreciated.
- Amazing co-workers - as I said, I worked on 2 different teams so far and everyone has been super helpful and accommodating. People will take the time out of their day to help and make sure you're past the hurdle - incredibly collaborative environment. 
- Relevant/cutting edge technology - getting the chance/freedom to work on interfaces using tools that are industry leading is an incredible opportunity! I'm learning so much!!
- Great compensation/Benefits - salary is very competitive and stock package is even better than I had hoped for, so not much negotiation was needed. Plus, the benefits are very solid - this includes any equipment that you might need at work -it's all covered (with manager approval). Also, full health coverage!
- For all these reasons, Yelp has been the BEST company I have ever worked for. I absolutely love coming into work every day, I look forward to it :D

PRODUCT RESULTS
The Yelp Ads program is NOT for everyone. You are forced to sell a product that may not make sense for many of these SMB's. When you do close and it does not perform well, you will not have access to backend tracking/stats that helps you understand why it did not work. You will be forced to try to resell that same person who canceled. Your commission will be negatively affected even though you did your job. Be ready to face moral issues.

If you attempt to bring new insights as to why Yelp may not work for an individual you will be told to sell anyways. This is a classic ""Drink the Koolaid"" environment. You will constantly be thrown success stories that may not be relevant to your territory. You will constantly be told this is a Career not a Job. Remember: think about why you're constantly being told these things. It is because the opposite is the majority's opinion.

UNPROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT
A manager's main job is to encourage and coach. I found they are around too much aka micromanagement. I would see and hear managers talk about teammates unprofessionally, ask why you are taking PTO or leaving early, etc. You should not have to relay too much information as to why you are taking action on what you are entitled to. The whole environment feels like high school. You are constantly feeling babysat. 

UNREAL EXPECTATIONS/ INCONSISTENCY 
I saw a high volume of people being fired for not hitting quota consistently but others being kept only because they hit big numbers in the past. 

REPETITIVE 
Once you get to a certain point there really isn't anything to change but your mindset. Managers and directors are forced to shove the same information in your throat over and over again. It becomes frustrating."

Stay away!,2017-09-08,1.0,Account Executive,The snacks are ok but this company is trash.,"The first thing I want to point out is that even though this is a well known company, when other employers see Yelp on your resume they see you as a joke. Be aware of this if you take this job. This is the most unprofessional place I have ever worked. If you have any sales or marketing talent, or can even spell your name properly, then you or over qualified for ANY role in this company. The whole organization is run like a frat house with people coming to work literally in swimming shorts, and this is the smallest problem. Yelp trains people into a cult-like way to think and sell. They will continuously tell employees that is does not matter if they don't produce as long as they follow the culture. What Yelp does is they take one manager who is okay in sales and has them feed words to every sales person on a one way line for every call they take. The reason for this is because they set almost every person up to fail in terms of revenue so they are able to market the name Yelp in rural areas (sometimes with populations in the 100s) that have never heard of the company. They do this will full knowledge you WILL NOT make money and that the product DOES NOT WORK! When they give you your territory you will maybe be the 1 in 100 that gets something manageable, but more than likely you will be calling a town of a few 100 people no one has ever heard of and be stuck calling the same businesses for over a year. This company will either suck the life out of you or actually brainwash you in to a false sense of potential hope for a distant future. I have never written a review for anything but seriously felt the need to warn anyone who cares about their professional career to stay away from yelp."
2540,Yelp,Account Executive,2017-09-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Their sales training will teach you how to be a hunter,"Where to begin....
First off, if I can give any advice, do NOT work for this company as an AE (I can't speak for other departments) for the following reasons:
-Incredibly low pay, and no potential to make solid commission. 
-In comparison to other 'tech' companies, their pay is at the very bottom 
-Will do anything they can not to pay you for what you worked/deserve - they expect you to work 40+ hours, but will only pay you for the bare minimum 
-Some individuals of upper management lack social skills and compassion. They are absolutely ruthless and have no rationality.
-Your set up for failure - the territories are so over worked, no one wants to hear from you
-They say they connect people to great local businesses...well, they completely forget what 'great local businesses are' - they expect every business to use Yelp, even if they do not fit their mission statement 
-Ultimately, you'll be over worked, stressed, and set up for failure in exchange for a non liveable income."

You work in sales teams, which definitely helps make it more enjoyable than an individual sales role. I also have felt that their sales development and training program has been much more organized and effective than any other sales role I have been a part of. 
I have found the management to be very accessible: I've only been here just over 4 months but have been on first name basis with not only my manager but also my director (and others') and office head since month one, and that isn't a unique experience to me.

At the moment there's pretty good work life balance and benefits although some departments have mandatory overtime.  Generous maternity and paternity leave.,"The culture that Yelp once had is gone, events have ceased, fun and team building during working hours gone.  Worse than that is the complete lack of growth employees have, career paths are often changed making the path more of a dead end then a path; unless you buddy up to the right people and even then it doesn't always work, moving up is impossible.  They give arbitrary feedback that is not attainable, even when you get good feedback and implement it, then accomplish your goals 3 more things pop up that you need to work on; again making it nearly impossible for people to move up within Yelp.  If you want to switch departments be prepared to start at square one again and work your way back up. Management is not like anything  I've seen in any other company - they promote people that don't want to be managers, are immature, or have no idea what management involves then coach them to be horrible.  Many managers lead by fear, it's not uncommon to hear a manager was yelling or being disrespectful, micromanaging, and are extremely inconsistent.  Everything is always in a constant state of change at Yelp too, so you have to be agile and adaptable, but don't ask questions because that's seen as push back."

And no, not like ""I use the app pretty often."" more like, you have to *love* it. Be prepared to hear things like ""Yelp Karma"" or hear silly remixes to songs that mention Yelp and its various cultural points. Prepare to be regaled by stories about how so-and-so closed deals on the last day of the month to motivate you and to tell you about HOW IT'S SUPER POSSIBLE to do it. (It's all luck.) The longer you keep up this relationship with Yelp going, the longer you'll last.

- High turnover. You'll find that your training class slowly dwindles down the closer you get to the one-year mark. There's a reason for that.

- You're assigned territories to call. You might get an up-and-coming suburb in VA, right near DC -or- you might get podunk nowhere rural Ohio. Or maybe even Canada. Don't tell us that territories don't matter.

- Yelp makes a point to talk about work-life balance. It's fine for the first three weeks, but on the last week of the month, you're kind of peer-pressured into staying a little bit later to meet your goals and the team's goals. Last day of the month, hoo-boy, god help you if you want to go home before 8PM.

- Yelp can be really cringeworthy. Know how they hyped up a bunch of people who've never made cold calls before? Have them sing to the national anthem as it blares through the speakers in training and then rush them to the phones.

- Distractions & ""professionalism"". Some managers need to rein it in, cause some of them are basically singing/yelling the songs on the sales floor (sometimes off-key) and it gets distracting. Doesn't really encourage a professional atmosphere sometimes. Your colleagues cheering over the phone as someone closes a deal don't help matters either.

- Lots of hiring. On the first day of the month, you'll find a fresh batch of new hires so eager to get on the phones. You'll see just how replaceable you are. If I looked away from my monitor and took a look around the sales floor. I'd see rows of people with a headset, on a computer making cold calls. Saying the same thing over and over."

Great training for new grads - electric culture,perople who aren't sellers naturally or want to be a seller most likely not enjoy their time there - nothing is handed to you at Yelp so don't have that expectation going in. This is not a con just reality of workin g in Sales - all must be earned
2606,Yelp,Have some dignity; save your sanity.,2017-07-10,1.0,User Operations Associate,"Snacks! Great location! Some fun people! Cool baristas! 

Being able to work from home whenever you want -- oh wait. Sorry. Can't really do that anymore.

Health care? Okay. But Yelp's health benefits aren't unique to them. In fact, many employees have begun to worry that the company is going to make us pay for it. 

If you enjoy feeling like an afterthought, you will thrive. But if you're shy, if you're kind, if you want to be judged on the integrity of the work you do and not whose boots you lick, you'll be cast aside like a forgotten first wife. 

Oh wait... these were the pros! Let's see -- you can drink overly stocked IPAs on any given day of the week and scavenge off the engineering department requisite Friday catered lunches. You, in UO, will get a free-not-free lunch every so often.","Low pay. Can't stress that enough. A cost of living raise was recently given to the entirety of the department, meaning that just the base salary was raised. Too little, too late. In turn, it made the tenure that this department so steadfastly values almost worthless. 

There are little to no incentives to go above and beyond. Have a strong work ethic? Great. They'll take advantage of that, and not in a way that actually makes you feel good or gives you the impression that they value your input or intellect. They want little more than to make you a subservient work horse. You'll never get a raise for undertaking multiple projects at once, or joining multiple teams. And hey, that's exploitative. That isn't just any regular job. Under other employment circumstances, when you ask someone to take on additional responsibilities, especially ones that carry the weight of leadership, you compensate them fairly. You don't just pay them in gratitude. 

But no -- what if I'm there long enough? What if I really prove that I care? What if I really want to plant roots here? Don't bother. Everyone that's currently in middle management has been here for years and years, so an upstart like you doesn't have a chance. Maybe things are balanced more fairly on other UO teams, but if you're on another, prepare to always be invisible. You're generally thought as less than, especially with the other UO teams. Everyone in UO is so isolated, and perhaps it's because it's a position that has been marketed towards introverts. But one team is more so -- anything you try to communicate toward other teams is of the lowest priority, and partly it's because you're considered to have the easiest job. You're considered to be the lowest on the intellectual totem pole. 

To go further, there is no upward climb. There has been some disruption in middle-management lately (meaning team leads) in User Ops, and much to the general chagrin of the department, those positions went to external candidates. Doesn't exactly inspire hope to anyone who has potentially invested years, or wants to invest, years of their life into a position like this. Nearly all of User Ops (with a few exceptions) is run by white men. The department VP is an eloquent, intelligent man -- but an out of touch man. It's been a long time since he's had to work for so little. Point is, there's little diversity, and sometimes it makes you wonder if better qualified, more reserved women are being passed up by more gregarious, sycophantic men. 

This is a high turnover role, and the reasons I outlined above only begin to scratch the surface. Everyone who decides to do this role understands the monotony of it, but the eventual personal stagnation and complete lack of support from within the company is staggering. 

There's a lot of condescension and incompetence in upper management. So if you do decide that you're desperate enough to take this job whenever it's advertised, don't say we didn't warn you. Hopefully you'll take the rampant disorganization and lack of transparency better than most."
2607,Yelp,Great for experience but that's all.,2017-07-10,2.0,Customer Support Specialist,"When I first arrived at Yelp Eat24, I would have given this place 5 stars. Morale was high and the office was filled with energetic great people. Flexible scheduling and PTO.  Able to take vacations and get shifts covered very easyily. Great kitchen with tons of snacks and drinks with a beer keg on the 8th floor. Great entry level job to gather experience .","Working for eat24 is considered lower level and working for customer support is even lower than that in the eyes  of Yelp. After working at Yelp for close to two years has really made me despise Yelp. When you first come in to interview with them, they make it sound like it's wonderful  and so easy to move up and transfer to other departments but the truth is, they only want to ship you out to  Menu department which is another lower level department. Pay is horrible... last year they started hiring some very questionables and the quality of the people started going down and there were a lot of drama and incidents which led to yelp cracking down on our department and basically ruined it for the rest of us that actually were professional and did work. They stopped hiring in the Sf office and basically all of us knew that we were basically going to lose our jobs to the Arizona office. Morale is at an all time low and we once had 200 people on our floor and now it's fallen down to less than 70."
2608,Yelp,"Great environment, especially for entry level",2017-07-08,4.0,Senior Local Account Manager,A great place for entry level positions in sales and account management. The company invests in its people and works hard to provide benefits that are great for people just starting out in their career.  Graduates with a wide array of degrees can come here and learn great sales skills right off the bat. Management is younger but great in that they are mostly always promoted from within. This company works hard but plays hard and is a great introduction to a real 9-5 job where you are held accountable for owning your own success based on how you implement the skills they teach.,some downsides are they actual daily tasks which can become repetitive if you stop working to get better in your role. Talking with business owners and being a high volume call based job can be a grind at times. This is offset with great co-workers and great upper management who understand the difficulties of the role and continually try to provide career pathing.
2609,Yelp,AE to SM,2017-07-06,4.0,Sales Manager,"- People, both above and below your, genuinely care about you and your success. 
- Taught me how to be an excellent communicator and sales person.

- Excellent benefits and perks.
- Focused on individual development. 
- Growing very fast, lots of room for career growth.
- Great LMS.

Note: For those that complain about their role, I think it's a two way street. As someone who started as an AE and became a manager, it's important to have a balance between looking out the window and looking in the mirror. You can only propel yourself through your career if you advocate for yourself and act on tangible feedback. Stay competitive with yourself and contribute in a positive way (through attitude, implementation, and drive) and you will go far.","- Lack of transparency from the top down. 
- Mixed or missed messaging on roll outs.
- Pay is a bit lower than market pay.

2610,Yelp,Don't Get Sold into Being an Account Executive,2017-07-06,2.0,Account Executive,"Great benefits. It's a very young office-so if this is a first job out of college, it's a good transition.","First of all, there is no communication and a ton of secrets in management. They won't even tell you when a new software is going to get rolled out to the sales reps until a few days before it happens let alone any law suits Yelp is involved in. 

They have a habit of promoting people in to management long before they are ready to be promoted. Some reps have difficulty taking their managers seriously because their managers have been at Yelp for hardly over a year. 

Compensation is honestly laughable for the Bay Area. They say that you can keep your head down and work hard, and you'll see it pay out. What they don't tell you is all the external factors that can keep you from being paid. You lose commission when someone cancels or you get a missed first payment,and you can actually end up OWING Yelp money due to the fact that they pay out reps before a lot of clients have even paid their first bill. 

On top of that, there is a disproportionate amount of importance put on metrics. A rep who makes 100+ dials in a day and doesn't bring in any revenue will receive more praise than a rep who actually closes a deal. You could actually close a deal, set 3 appointments and pitch twice, but if you only made 45 calls, then you didn't work hard that day according to management. 

Overall, the job is actually miserable because you're cold calling all day, taking verbal abuse from business owners who hate Yelp, and you hardly even make enough money to make ends meet."

You can find yourself in business development position at a different company selling a great product to great clientelle. That's what happened to me.","Extremely nepotistic. Managers toss leads to their friends under the table and disadvantage people who they dislike on a social level. It's a territory based sales job for a product that works exponentially better in wealthy metropolitan centers. I'm not going to elaborate on how that's a problem and how the nepotism will dictate success here because I feel like it's obvious.

Personally - I spent a lot of time going home, reading on sales, reading about Yelp good and bad, drinking the cool aid, listening to my phone calls, asking for feed back and dialing my butt off, fighting on calls, preaching the Yelp gospel. I started off high and trailed off in terms of revenue because people who were simply more social, went out to more happy hours, kissed more butt and sucked up to directors advanced further along than I could and were rewarded for earning sales based on false expectations and borderline illegal practices.

2636,Yelp,Great place to grow,2017-06-14,4.0,Senior Account Executive,"This is the place if you have a growth mindset and love being challenged. It's an amazing company with an amazing culture. Tons of opportunities to grow, learn and be challenged in the specific roles that they have. I worked as an AE for about 2.5 years and as with any company, you'll have far more doors open for you if you build good relationships with leadership. Your experience will also vary greatly depending on your manager. If you don't feel it's the right fit, you can easily transfer to a different team. This isn't the place for people looking for easy jobs. The work is typically mentally intense. The reality of the AE role is that it's a cold call sales job, which isn't for most people. Hence, there's a decent turnover rate with AE's because people don't understand the day to day reality of the job. It's a great entry level experience with tons of opportunities for promotion. Very young company. Most directors are in their 20s and 30s. Great benefits, good work life balance.  Really can't take those things for granted.","Your experience depends heavily on your manager and sometimes you get one that's on their own learning curve with how to manage effectively. You're working with small business owners who tend to have very strong feelings about Yelp. You have to be able to let things roll off of your back and not take it personally when people take out their negative feelings about the company on you. Clients tend to be very emotional. For you to be able to transfer to other departments, you have to prove your worth as a solid employee and have the right relationships with leadership. But that's probably true with most companies.
With sales, you have tons of opportunities to earn a lot of commission and get a great earning, but since the product costs are relatively low, you're not going to see the 6 figure starting salary that you'd get with companies that sell higher cost products."
2637,Yelp,Should have left earlier,2017-06-10,1.0,Elite Account Executive,"People, stocked kitchen, Consistent hours and weekends off","The culture has completely changed since I started at Yelp. Today's sales role position is not determined by how quick you can learn or how good you are at sales, but rather what territory you get. If you get stuck with a bad territory (which you most likely will if you start now) it will be a struggle to make sales. The top reps from each rookie class seem to have hit the lottery, as they are given a great territory, which they snowball into working themselves into a pilot program or receiving a second territory. Reps that struggle (which is about 95% of each rookie class) will be stuck with their territories and will only be able to switch with reps with other awful territories within their rookie class. 

Let's say you are the one lucky rep from your class. You consistently get above quota every month while averaging 80 calls a day. You might get offered a promotion to franchise account Executive around month 10, where you make LESS MONEY. I've never heard of a promotion elsewhere where you have to plan for the dip in income after accepting a promotion. Becoming a Yelp mid-market rep or sales manager is similar to being the star basketball player on your high school team and trying to eventually go pro. It's possible, but extremely unlikely. 

Within 3 months of working at Yelp, you will realize how much of a grind the job is and regret accepting the job in the first place. Most people stay to build their resume. 

If you are fresh out of college, this does look good on a resume, but try your hardest to find something else before accepting this role."

Yelp set me up for a more lucrative opportunity with a much better product. So there's that.

Sure do wish there was a Nielsen Study for that enigma; I need charts and graphs to understand. I swear they pump these kids' egos up with so much praise and kool-aid for their 3-month stint of sales success that after they've been promoted---they lose all sense of reality. I wish you could hear the moronic ways they bicker and argue with you, desperately trying to sell you on the idea that you're the problem, no matter what.  You better smile and nod, because they will can you and kick you out the door faster than Yelp's contracts cancel.  Woah! That's fast! 

My manager was so. far. up. my. butt. every second of the day, hounding and hounding me to update dumb metrics spreadsheets, push more calls out, sell to absolutely anybody that would answer the phone no matter what, update the spreadsheet again, go to the millionth ""round up"" of the day,  vet 30 selling leads in 10 minutes, stand up out of my seat to ""create energy"" for ""power hours,"" timing my breaks, write her emails with sorrowful explanations as to why I didn't set enough appointments in a day, asking me to work overtime without pay to vet leads and save work hours for calling, CONSTANTLY nagging me about my leads and ""where they're at"" and making me call them 5 times a day for a decision if they didn't buy right away on the first call. They know nothing about sales outside of Yelp and that's why they have these absurd hair brained ideas.  I'm just glad it's over."

- Pay sucks! As of Jan '17 local sales starting is 40k which is $19.23 hr. Recruiting lies your not salaried your hourly.
- You'll work overtime but won't be compensated only on the last day of the month. Some managers want employees to begin working before their shift/during lunch/after work but won't pay for hours worked...but they may reward you with a cookie or breakfast burrito for good behavior.
- Free food is top ramen, lentil chips, sandwich meat, bread and cheese that every one sticks their hand in (check out the bathrooms you'll want to pass on the sandwiches too) frozen burritos. Microwave egg whites, Cereal (good selection), yogurt, a bunch of camper snacks like nuts. Not the best selection but you'll get by.
- Coffee from Barista is just an expresso machine and the beans used taste disgusting kind of moldy. 
- The energy feels like your at Chucky Cheese winning childish prizes like a yo-yo as a work incentive...people shooting nerf guns and getting hit in the face as your on the phone with a business owner trying to close a deal to get to quota. 
-  Director walking around in a horse costume on a mega phone yelling on it while your trying to get a credit card number from a business owner who was already afraid to sign up..now you have to have them repeat the numbers over 3 times and apologize for the frustration. 
- A bunch of Bro's and Frat guys.
- Way too much emphasis on metrics and not enough on revenue. For a sales job there should be more focus on pulling in revenue not praising someone with 0 on the board but made 100 dials...such an unproductive and unsuccessful day if your not bringing in money. 
-No diversity in upper positions above local sales. Come on Yelp have your 1 or 2 token ethnic sales managers in local, but 1 token ethnic person in mid market for a company with over 1000+ employees with 4 offices...You gotta do better! 
-Directors HATE Rap music...so they've tried to ban rap music from being played but approved Eminem and Macklemore until some people complained to HR...racist..I think so! 
-Most of everyone who been there 6mo+ hates their job and wants to quit...but Yelp starts the hypnosis again to convince you there's no place that's better. Yeah Right...working at Starbucks would be better! 
-A lot of people quit! They tell you to get comfortable with change..that's code for people quitting employees and clients alike. 
-Calling businesses that's been called over 10+ yrs...still not convinced to spend money on Yelp

I was with Yelp for over a year and I am surprised I lasted that long. When you start they make it sound like you can make tons of money, which is wrong. If your clients cancel you end up owing the company. Commission is not a thing at Yelp. No wonder all their best sales reps leave, because if you want to stay in sales you can make a lot more money elsewhere.

You spend your days getting yelled at on the phone because almost every business owner hates the product. 

Everyone truly sleeps with everyone there. Over the course of my time I heard many rumors of my managers sleeping with their employees. Does that make a good work environment? NO. 

FALSE INCENTIVES!!!! I can't tell you the amount of times I had my manager tell me if I did something, or if my team won a competition, we would get a reward. Do you know how many free drinks, breakfasts, and PTO days I was promised that I never received?

Managers have a hot-cold relationship with every employee. If you're doing well one month, you're their star. If you fail, you mean nothing to them. And the top reps get treated better than everyone else. I had ""top reps"" on my team who were able to give bad attitudes, and come in an hour late every day. Because they were ""good at the job"" they never got in trouble. That's messed  up.

Don't ever  be surprised if a biz owner curses you out or calls you a foul name, you will be called every name in the book, probably a couple times a week.

Basically, a bunch of stuff to make you tolerate a job and department that are depressing, Orwellian and in-authentic. Your peers are all pretty decent but there are exceptions to that as well.","Yelp has the following core values:

Be unboring:
They want you to be a certain kind of unboring. You're expected to dress up for elementary style ""spirit weeks"", come out to their happy hours, and be buddy/buddy with management. While not doing any of the above is a death sentence, they will count against you.

Play well with others:
This translates to ""Don't talk about how bad the sales team is making deals"" For instance, there are sales executives to this very day who insinuate and promise things that aren't possible. Comment about it out loud within earshot of management, you'll be sent to a room to discuss it. In fact, make any sort of comment about a tough customer (Yelp's review policies along with aggressive sales tactics and the call center atmosphere guarantee it will happen constantly) and you'll be spoken to about it. They truly rule by fear.  Also, there is no one in the company to talk to honestly about how you feel unless you want to start the process of exiting.

Be tenacious:
Only when it comes to Yelp's interests. Advocate for yourself too much and you'll run into trouble. They want someone who will _literally_ take calls without questioning processes. The person who lays out methods and policies is so far removed from the day to day, it makes you really wonder what your goal is. It's a sales support job. You will not move to a better Account Management job after this, you will be prepped for call center work. The irony is, it's still under the sales department which may have it's place but doesn't jive with the nuances and of supporting such a product. It's quantity over quality until they are zoned in on you. Once they have it decided they want to move you out of the company, you'll start being talked to about metrics that have never been brought up before.

Authenticity:
Management at Yelp is trained to be inauthentic. If you are not doing well, they work out ways to push you out of the company. They won't be authentic in this case. This is where gaslighting and metric worship come out. You will learn there is no such thing as a private conversation with management and any talks with HR are usually followed with a meeting with the director. You will be asked if you think you need to go to training again if you question methods and goals as well. You will be put on a ""performance plan"" and just one mistake and you're gone, it's weird though because you will be told the first time ""We should have fired you"" then get several ""last chances"" where at the point your guard is down. Then they hit you with some metric and boom. You're done. There are several former employees who can corroborate this, check out former employees on that social job site we all know about and ask questions.  Have a disease or health issue that doesn't manifest itself visually when someone is looking at you. Good luck with getting paperwork from them on time and any sort of understanding when you come back and aren't feeling 100% you're on the chipping block unless you beg and plead.

Protect your source:
This basically means, don't tell anyone what you were told in these meetings. You see, they don't want employees all talking together and sharing their experiences. Things employees have been told ""Fix your face"", ""Sound more girlie on the phone"", ""Smile more"". ""I feel like you don't like me"" These are directives and quotes from a woman mind you, that is the director who all the managers run to when you ask a question they can't answer confidently and that's when you realize that this sort of behavior goes all up and down the organization. You see, all the brass in this department came here when they were fresh employees and this when it hits you. This is what they value most. A blind drinking of the crimson Yelp Kool-Aid. I implore you to reach out to former and current employees (actually....the latter might not want to talk and would probably think someone on management is trying to goad them into talking honestly) both here and at the Phonix office in Account Management. 

If you've read this far, congrats! I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone with integrity or an independent mind. If you do take it, think of it as a sort of bootcamp to prepare you for a job where you can be valued and actually grow.  When you interview ask about department turnover as in the last 6 months, people have been running from this job even a senior director. Also, they will mention growth, there is almost zero of that. Recruiters are there for a reason, to recruit, they aren't going to be very forthcoming anyways. Good luck and Godspeed."

+ The music is definitely a plus.
+ Fantastic benefits package that kick in right as you start your tenure at Yelp. 100% covered by the company for medical, dental, and vision, so take definitely take advantage of the benefits.

Yelp is really a fun place to work because of the people that make up the organization. On top of the amazing benefits, the lack of taking work home, and the relativee easiness of the job, if you are straight out of college or looking to start something new, you could see yourself being quite comfortable in your position...for now.","Implementation of goals for Account Managers increase pressure for output, basically it makes it that quantity matters far more over quality.
- The Account Management department (in Scottsdale at least) is hemorrhaging talent and culture which are bad for the long run.
- The job is easy and you don't take home physical work, but you may take home stress or negative feelings from the people you interact with. Clients are not just difficult, they can be outright hostile. 
- The direction of Account Management is headed is troublesome.

I was at Yelp for a year and it has changed considerably. There are many things that have not been positive changes in Account Management, and only the workers who are drinking the kool-aid by the pitcher while they are there, and have an IV plugged into their arms while they are at home will believe otherwise.

Yes Yelp has a fantastic benefits package, yes they play music, yes it offers an immensely friendly atmosphere, but that doesn't mean you should be blind to what is happening and the work that you do. On a daily basis, from the moment you pick up the phone, you will expect to dive into some of the toughest conversations you could have in a call center. (It is a call center, don't lie to yourself.) There will be a laundry list of names that clients will call you, and some are so offensive that South Park probably couldn't air them. You're going to have to defend procedures and policies that you truly don't know the ins and outs of. You will become talented at explaining things you don't understand in ways to (maybe 40% of the time) convince people of things they don't understand.

The client base is extremely difficult, and combined with the fact that you will have to call them constantly to stop them from cancelling and carry on in explaining things that will make them angry...well be prepared for what your about to chew. But you may not really have to worry about getting a job there because Account Managers aren't really being hired anymore, which leads to the next issue.

The culture is changing extremely fast and everyone knows it. Before I left, two dudes left to a a huge as hell applause because both of them were some of the most chill/reasonable there. But things have changed a lot since then because barely any Account Managers are being hired now. The fun people that made this place really great have pretty much left and there is no new talent to replace that. Now add this to the increasing quantity of work that other Account Managers are expected to handle, it's getting tougher and tougher. With the increase in workload and the lack of new people being brought in, you would think this was it, but there are still more issues for Account Managers.

With the lack of hiring, the options for Account Managers for advancement has dried up. Advancement? Move up? Once upon a time there was actually an idea of moving up somewhere, but that is gone. The org has been restructured to make things better for clients and that has come at great expense for Account Managers. The most you can really hope for now is to move up to a Senior AM and make a few extra bucks a year doing the exact same thing with the exact same difficult people. All of this has led to the most obvious development and directions that Account Management is headed towards.

There is nowhere to move up in careers, no more Account Managers are being hired, and the workload has increased while there is also a grading system that has increased in difficultly to achieve. People are slowly realizing it, but its obvious they are seeing how many Account Managers they can get rid of and see how many they actually need because they want more money. Yes the managers are cool, yes the higher-ups seem cool also, but you know what has won in the end? The dollar. Account Management will continue to grow increasingly small until it is completely powerless.

If you don't wanna read all this, let me sum it all up like this:

1) Thinking About Working at Yelp: Sure! Work there! Make a few friends and have fun, but get it together and right. Let this place show you that you need to work hard to get a job that is far better in compensation and will contribute to your career overall. Stay here for 6 months, and then leave to somewhere that pays more and doesn't a dish daily abuse.
2) Already Work at Yelp But Not In a Higher Role: Keep hope alive that you get senior and those yearly raises. O yeah keep compartmentalizing the abuse and keep the perception that this job ain't that bad.
3) People Who Are Managers Or Been There  A Looooong Time: Stay, this place is amazing for you. Great pay, cushy position, and pretty much most changes you are gonna be immune to. Stay as long as you like."

Managers yell at employees. It's very similar to a high school. If you come back from lunch one minute late you're having a conversation about it. Doesn't let you move around the organization. The only jobs they talk about growth is sales.  Commission sucks. Everyone rarely makes commission and if owners cancel adevertising  the accont executives  owe the company money. Business owners always cancel because customer service sucks. If someone cancels nine months into 12 month agreement it affects the AE. No diversity in  management.

While the job is very hard on the day to day, Yelp barely pays you enough to live. Employees are pitted against each other for high sales. While commission is in place, frequent chargebacks because of your territory and the product not working are common, causing the AE to have to pay Yelp back out of their commission. There is high turnover because they treat employees like high school children and monitor your every move. Rather than helping local businesses they encourage you to harass them and are mad when those tactics don't work.

By my last week, I only hit about half of the 10 but was told by a month 2 trainer I had 72 hrs to hit 10 pitches or the company would ""part ways"". Never once were my highlights mentioned for extension: Always on time, generally hitting metrics, closing SOME of the deals, etc. When I questioned why I wasn't offered the possibility of an extension for additional training when it was BEYOND obvious there were workers still in training with us who didn't reach their 10, my trainer just spoke in circles, repeating herself. They later contradicted themselves, making no mention of the 10 but wanting me to do something in order to keep my job, threatening they'll be listening to my calls all day to make sure. By then, I was 100% turned off, seeing how they took no consideration to my overall effort. When they DID over me an extension, I refused cause it felt condescending like giving a dog a pity bone.

- Free keg of beer every night, if you're into that kinda thing.","Oh boy...
This is probably going to the 15th review with the phrase ""sipping the Kool-aid"", but it is what it is. I should have known there was a problem when they hired me, a person with 0 sales experience, on the spot. Here I arrogantly believed I was just that good in the interview, but no. They were growing rapidly, with hiring classes typically ranging between 20-40 people a pop. My hiring class was in that range and only 10 of us remain. Think about that. The average job length is 6 months here. The turnover rate is insane.

Yelp is very much a quantity vs quality kinda company. When I got hired, metrics were reasonable. 1 pitch, 3 appointments, 65 dials. Then it became 70 dials. Now its 2 pitches, 5 appointments, 80 dials. But remember, guys... don't dial just to dial! Make all 80 dials count because it gives you more opportunity to make Yelp some mone--I mean, for you to grow your career! Nevermind that reps felt pressured and began to pad their dials just to keep up with the demand. At the end of the day, no matter the title they give you to help you cope, keep in mind that you're a glorified telemarketer. This ""hip office"" is a call center. Period.

The diversity is lacking severely. And they make it clear with how fast employees of color are put on plans and fired. Or if they aren't fired, they get burned out and quit. Out of an office of 600+, I can think of maybe 50 non-white employees. And they don't last long, typically. And if they do, they will not move up. All the employees, especially upper management, seem to be the same carbon-copy. Lots of frat bros and Forever 21 models here, typically the kind whose parents pay their rent so this job is more like a hobby--and those are usually the kind who perform the best.

""Sipping the kool-aid"" is a very real thing, as all the reviewers mentioned. There's this encouraged faux-positive environment where the second you have any other thoughts, you're look at as being negative. Which is funny because true feelings come out when the alcohol flows. Its really creepy and kinda cult-like. Whats even more amusing is how they harp on and on about authenticity when half the employees hate each other and smile in their faces. And seeing how office politics and favoritism runs rampant with management, its not surprising. If you brown nose enough and sell overpriced packages, you too can ""grow your career"". If not, don't expect to last long.

The job itself can be an uphill battle as well. Yelp doesn't have the best reputation as it is and it doesn't help when certain reps are pushy. Not too mention, certain features of the platforms are questionable.

Also, the music blaring is so overwhelming. There is a reason 20-somethings fresh out of college love this job. The gong hitting and screeching and top 40 pop songs played loudly on repeat is hard to explain with clients on the phone. Looks so unprofessional."

You aren't doing this at Yelp. You're saying things like ""trust me!"" to potential clients while a 23 year manager is saying inane things in your ear from a earshot away. 

Don't get me started on Yelp's:
1) Draconian hiring methodology - let's just hire a bunch of people and have 10% retention. Brilliant! No need for a diploma, come on by!
2) Conceited culture - ""the people you sit with at lunch will have the biggest impact on your success at Yelp."" Of course, because a meritocracy would be far too in vogue. 
3) Unseasoned management - where do I start?


And my god, in this day and age, Yelp's tactic is to keep cold-calling? Good luck. 

You learn terrible sales habits here, and employers specifically avoid hiring people from Yelp. My advice would be to remove Yelp from your resume, or a get a better job immediately and bury that part of your employment history deep in your paperwork (where it belongs)."

It is a very fake company with disappointing morals, and management is extremely poor and very misleading. Communication is not top notch and is so contradicting on a daily basis.

When I first started there over a year ago, metrics were  reasonable with hitting just 65 dials and 2 hrs of talk time. As time went on I started seeing things change with metrics getting raised every month. The Chicago office has 0 and I mean 0 diversity when it comes to management, I think that's why most of the minorities that were there either got burnt out and left or got fired. The managers there are all the same back rounds so when it came to promotions a lot of minorities were looked over because they wanted the same type of managers across the board. It's crazy to say but the Chicago office let some of there best reps who were minorities walk out the door, doesn't surprise me that office hasn't hit quote in almost a year! They promote a ""Greek party lifestyle"", they preach  professionalism but the ones preaching are kids who just graduated and don't really know the meaning, as there reps are working to close deals these ""managers"" are playing  loud "" unprofessional"" music as reps are calling these business owners!"

This is the most unprofessional environment I have ever worked in. This is an in between mix of a university and entry level position. Coming from a reputable company I had high expectations for Yelp. They over work the heck out of you. The pay is terrible. Literally pennies. You are not paid enough to live on your own and will probably find yourself sharing a bedroom with a room mate. The metrics are insane. You have to make a minimum of 80 dials a day or you will have to have numerous round ups with your manager, and are required to have at least 2.5 hours of talk time. So unrealistic. It does not matter how much you have sold they still want you to work you butt off. There are many things that are out of your control here and how successful you are is all dependent on what territory you are given. I hit quota every single month and was still unhappy with the job. It was not enough. The jobs requirements did not outweigh the rewards. Very little room for growth."

Less than a year ago, the head support dude change the structure of the company which was a pay increase (still impossible to live off of) and added a new Arizona location which has been the new downfall of Eat24 other than Yelp buying them out. The trainers, management, the whole AZ team SUCKSSS. The SF team is always being bash by the higher ups for not doing their job when we are doing our job AND the AZ teams jobs because they weren't properly trained on what they're doing. Loyalty here is nonexistent, you constantly have to beg your manager to train you on things. Favoritism is definitely a thing here but it also depends on your manager. AZ reps are being trained on daily assign. at a faster pace which isn't fair to SF reps who actually know how to do their job and want to learn more and progress within the company. Your shift changes are never recognized but are given to new employees in AZ :(. No one is happy including management, the higher ups are basically turning the two teams against each other. Oh and not to mention, you're dealing with customers and restaurants yelling at you all day and other internal miscommunications. They say you have to stay there a year in order to move to a different department but honestly .... who stays here that long? and even if you do, why would you want to be apart of company with no structure and false promises of moving up?

This is a sales role and the recruiters are always upfront about it, I have been here for a year now and the first thing I would say to anyone who wants to apply is to understand that you will be making a high volume of sales calls and getting rejection day to day. If you can feel confident in that and take advice from management then you should be fine. I feel lucky to be here because yelp is a powerful brand and most prospects you reach out to are recieving business from yelp, I also can appreciate that the yelp sales team talks to business owners like humans and is ready help whether or not they sign up for a product or service. I truly believe that yelp is fair to their employees by giving a base salary that was recently just raised. It is fact that reps that do extremely well can make over 100k easily but this is not every person. This is a great stepping stone and there are opportunities for growth like national teams and management roles. If you can not handle making a high volume of sales calls then this role is not for you.","This company has a young culture so often times those in management are in their early 20s in a new management role. They should be more fair about territories for reps, after being here for a year I can clearly see that some employees get an advantage and a new region means it just was worked by someone else (businesses get calls all the time but this happens in many sales roles and not just yelp). It would also be nice if there were more departments in yelp than just sales (there are other jobs but they are always hiring for AE roles) Also in shorter months you still have the same quota, even with taking PTO.

If you're considering moving out of town for this job...don't. It is not guaranteed that you will make it out of your first 2 months of training. Saw more than half of my training class get fired in first two months for not hitting quota. Many of them moved here from out of town and relied on this job to pay rent. 
Don't let all the cool perks fool you..they will wear off. You are cold calling 100% of your day. You are scolded for taking one of your 10 minute breaks, going to the bathroom, talking to a coworker, or doing anything that is not dialing dialing dialing. 

I drank the ""Yelp Kool-Aid"" for my first 6months and just really started to notice all of the bs. 
Managers and directors play favoritism, if you have a few bad months (despite having great months previously) expect to be given zero attention or help, people drop like flies and this office is just a revolving door, no diversity in management or upper management, frat-like office, extreme micromanaging, very low pay, you have to pay off your salary & then some just to take home a commission check.... I literally can go on and on. 

The product is flawed and business owners will call you out on it. Expect to have constant debates because most business owners hate Yelp. There are also days where you are just going to be leaving voicemails the entire day.

- arent many opportunities for career growth

Here's the big one:

Once I decided I was leaving, I gave the standard two weeks notice to my manager and then all of the sudden I became invisible. My manager didnt acknowledge me more than three times in my last two weeks as an employee and as a member of her team. She straight up ignored me and it made me feel AWFUL, like I wasn't worthy of her attention anymore. The three times she did acknowledge me she was complaining about how I was making her life harder by quitting because she had extra paper work to fill out and I was standing in the way of her holiday bonus. It made leaving so much easier."

Team off-sites (get together at a bar, etc paid for by the company)
Having friends that share a mutual hatred for the job","What was really upsetting was how the recruiting team portrayed the position. The description on job boards now are quite different because they were not very clear that there is a real chance you could be fired after 2 months. A lot of people, most young adults, pick up their lives to move for the job. I saw many get fired after the 2 months (of ""training""). 

There is a lot of false hope given about how much you could make because most don't. The commission structure is not the best so don't count on making a lot. There are a few people that you will be like, ""Wow, look at how much they're making! I can totally do that!"" But in reality when they do mass hirings that is what they're essentially looking for...a few people that can bring them in money that will stay longer than 8 months. 

It seems almost cult-esque with the weird positivity vibes all the time. You will likely not make it past 1 year. Most of my friends were fired/quit no matter if they were making commission or not and  absolutely hated the at least 80 dials and 2.5 hours of talk time. 

You are not special when you got hired because it takes no skills to do this job. They do mass hirings so don't waste your time here and take another position."

Social posts from current employees read like this: ""I'm so exhausted/stressed/freaked out but really this is the best job evar.""
Little to no management training upon conversion often means that management has best intentions but bad execution. Also early employees are elevated to senior-level management and that's not the best choice, specifically in the marketing realm. 
Despite its veteran status as a startup, still operating on a shoestring budget and salaries are non-commensurate with the level of work. Marketing employees are made to work with few dollars, using the ""influencer"" card instead.

-You'll make great friends at Yelp. Much more upbeat and interesting than most coworkers you could have at other jobs. 
-Casual dress code
-Benefits","-Calling over-called burned out leads. 
-Management is drinking the koolaid and won't admit that the product isn't perfect; they think they're saving small business owners' lives. Difficult to discuss concerns with management because they'll sweep your concerns under the table.
-They make you sell advertising to accounts that Yelp ads doesn't make sense for.
-You're a number, not a name. They hire so much because their average turnover is ~6 months. This is why recruiters have to talk up the perks and oversell it to you.
-TERRIBLE commission structure adds insult and injury to the below-industry-average base pay. I closed over 100% of my quota during my several months at Yelp and saw only a couple hundred dollars of commission. They manage to pull this off by making you close X amount of revenue before you become commission eligible and then make you close a certain amount worth every month in order to make a single dollar of commission that month. Expect chargebacks out of future commission checks because the product is faulty. 
-The product is not only faulty, but an uphill battle of a sale due to reviews and other details about Yelp as a platform. 
-Employees who do the polite industry-standard thing and put in their two weeks are often told to leave that day. Seems to me like a cheap power-play of an employment practice."

AEs are expected to do the entire sales process themselves (this makes sense considering the length of the sales cycle), however, the minimum expectation is 80+ calls per day while balancing many other responsibilities. You are only paid when restaurants are activated and there are many steps to be taken after you receive a contract back. If these steps are not completed, you will make very little money here considering their salary is extremely low. Micro-managing can be a really big part of your day-to-day depending on who you receive as a manager. The executives and leadership have very little concern for the amount of turnover, due to the fact that their employment model is much like a juicer.

Also The job description is a complete lie, so you really don't know what you're signing up for until day 1 - absolute worst of all, you CANNOT miss more than two days in your first two months. What if life happens and you have to? You are fired. 

This is a cutthroat environment. Good luck finding a new job once you commit to this one, you will have no time to execute an interview because every lunch is planned and you have to do things on their time. 

They also encourage you to work on the weekends, during lunch or past the 8 hours of work even though this is a non-exempt position. So unfair and makes absolutely no sense, just another reason why the 20-30 year old managers don't know how to lead - they aren't familiar with labor laws."

Don't believe me? They are a publicly traded company look up their diversity report. What minority percentage are managers and above?  
- Managers do not know what they are doing most of the time. They tell you one thing one day, and tell you another.

While most of your coworkers are new grads, they keep it up beat and exciting for those who are new to the tech scene. i met some of the greatest people in my professional career here.","While the gig seems exciting for new blood - It absolutely is not. Please to those that are seriously considering working here - Understand, you are a number, you will be trained to make 80+ dials a day, you are working in an extremely intimidating, political system that will eat you alive. 

The core goal for Yelp is to hire excessive amounts of employees to find the few diamonds in the rough. No matter what they tell you, understand that you will be given a horrible territory, and selling a product that is extremely faulty and cost a lot of money. Your morale will slowly default, and you will notice many sleepless nights, stressing to hit very unreasonable quotas. 

Your upper peers are at best some of the most condescending colleagues you will ever work with. It's their job before yours and they will beat you to the ground if they are not getting what they want. I exceeded numbers far higher than 75% of the office in Chicago and kept to myself, meaning I didn't brown nose. This is where I made a mistake, Although I had the numbers - I was coming into an office that hunted for attention and if they didn't get it you were off the list. Where I eventually ended up. 

I hate to scare you from an opportunity but I want to be very honest of what this company does and how you will be treated. There have been several cases of sexual harassment and discrimination within the Chicago Office as well as heavy drug usage within the heads that run it. While HR is very understanding of the employees that work here - they side the people that run it. You will be a lost cause."

This job is definitely not for everyone, and I am one of those people it definitely wasn't for. Some people 'drink the Yelp Kool-Aid' and are very happy there but most employees that are not in a management role are not happy. The job is very monotonous and consists of making like 200 cold calls a day. Be prepared to get yelled at and threatened on the phone and leave 150 voicemails in a day. I have minor social anxiety (granted I never should have taken this job just for that reason) and this job was horrible for my anxiety and I became depressed working there and it made my social anxiety so much worse. Walking to work I used to actually get slightly jealous of the homeless people I passed because in those moments I would literally rather have been homeless than have to go to that job. I have never struggled with depression until I worked at Yelp. Quitting was the best thing I ever did for my mental health. There isn't much opportunity for career growth except just staying in the same sales position with a different title and different salary. They give you horrible territories to start off so it's hard to be successful in a lot of those territories making it hard to get a better territory and actually do well.

2894,Yelp,Great Company. One of the Best Cultures. Learned a lot.,2016-10-27,5.0,Account Executive,"Great opportunity and first job out of college. Golden opportunity if you're looking to build a sales career, but also great if you're motivated yet undecided about what you want to do career-wise. 

First, Yelp has hands down one of the best company cultures, people, and management. 

You'll know if Yelp is a great fit for you. You'll feel welcome at Yelp as long as you 
a) do the work, and 
b) are positive, authentic, hard working, sociable, and have a sense of humor

Vibe is very West Coast, including the dress code, but still a motivated and professional environment. Dominated by millennials. 

Great people, social environment, theme days, off-sites with your team around the Bay, happy hours on the top floor after work on Fridays, people and culture make it worth it. Authenticity and being yourself is one of the company's biggest values. 

You start off with a two-month training with your class of new hires, where you're put in a team of fellow trainees and a training manager. You learn all about selling Yelp, and hit the phones on the second week. After the two months, your team either rolls out together with your manager, or you get put on an already existing team. 

From the beginning, management is very real with you - they acknowledge that ""the job can suck at first,"" and encourage you to look at it with some perspective. They're there for you when you're going through a slump, and really care about your development in the role. And communication is very direct and open, in line with the culture. 

There is little to no drama or unnecessary micromanaging, negativity, etc. Managers do vary and I may have gotten lucky since I was on a great team, but I didn't see too much deviation from this for the most part. 

Also, the company is pretty transparent with the C-suite - the VP of Sales comes down to the floor sometimes to see how everybody's doing, and there's a monthly round-up where he addresses the whole of SF Sales. Jeremy Stoppelman the CEO has addressed employees quite often. 

- 8-5 set work hours including 1-hour lunch - 40 hours per five-day work week. 
- General expectations of 65 calls a day and/or 2 hours of talk time.
- Stocked kitchen for breakfast and lunch. 
- Get to work in downtown San Francisco - great location! New sales building as well. 
- Transparent: CEO, Execs, and VPs are great.","- The biggest complaint you'll hear is about the job itself. 
The job can be taxing and is high volume. Business owners often are tough to deal with regarding Yelp, you'll get hung up on, yelled at, sassed, etc. You'll also have months where you don't perform as well or miss quota. Until you find your groove, you'll definitely have to hustle. 
But management knows this and is there for you. Be sure to ask and learn from them after training. 

- Even with commissions, bonuses, raises down the line, the 36k starting base salary is very low for the San Francisco Bay Area.  

- Lunch options are basically deli sandwiches (known as the ""Yelp-wich""), microwaveable convenience foods, and snacks. Good, but there could be more variety or hot foods as well. 

- Elevators and Bathrooms can get crowded in the new building."

So all day you sit in a room filled with about 50 people who are calling all day long and forcing business owners to sign up and spend thousands of dollars with you on the phone. They fire you if you don't sell ""enough"". Even if you sold and hit your numbers in the past and had a slow few months they fire you. Their is no stability and no room for growth. Out of 800 people that work at the NYC office I only saw about 10 people get promoted to higher sales positions."

2908,Yelp,Account Executive- Sales,2016-10-13,2.0,,"Co-workers and culture made for a great first out of college job. Met lots of great people and gained some good experience.
Would recommend, but don't plan on staying for more than a year, not much to get out of the job after that.","The whole actual job. They do tell you what you are getting into and set the right expectations, but ultimately there is so much that is out of the control of you and for the most part management too.
They preach fairness and that everyone is doing the same job, at the end of the day that is just not true... some people call into the middle of nowhere and some call into the Yelp-iest of areas, there is some luck. Highly emotional sales role, not selling to people who make purchasing decisions with logic, rather with emotions. There were many times that the program failed the client and they come back to the sales rep who has no control over the success. I found it pretty hard to sell something that I ultimately did not believe in for every client, but the way the kool-aid drinking works, you have to sell to all of you assigned clients as if it will work for them too. I found this to be very disingenuous.  
Praise is definitely handed out for all kinds of small achievements, but they treat some like gods. 
This is where it honestly can get a little catty, there are hundreds of 23 year olds who are competitive by nature and very outgoing in general- thats why they got the sales roles- and the culture sometimes can flip on itself and wear you down. Its fun and young, but its also annoyingly young and dumb. With that, it was a good place to make new friends.. 
On the young note, the management that I saw was often way too green and fresh to provide proper leadership. Some were immature, some too emotional, and others not masters of the job yet themselves. I think that this rose out of the desire to grow so quickly and expand (very revenue driven) that they were forced to promote people who were not ready to be brought into leadership. Personally experienced large disconnect between manger and director that ultimately led to being sent down the wrong path with out help for many months of frustration."

2914,Yelp,Account Executive,2016-10-10,1.0,Associate Account Executive,"Great health insurance benefits. Unlimited supply of coffee and red bull. The snacks were mediocre but decent. Also, maintenance of the offices were kept up.","The job itself is boring and unsatisfying. Every morning is the same routine: gathering leads, calling contractors, getting hung up on yada yada yada. 
One thing that made me quit was that managers would hassle you to sell to people who clearly were broke. The last straw was my manager yelling at me over the phone to push the sale to this older man who started sobbing to me on the phone because he was forced to sell his business.  (Just an FYI, managers can listen to your calls while you are talking to a potential customer, the managers can advise you what to say without the customer hearing them). It's a great tool to use during training but forcing someone to sell to someone who clearly stated they are selling their business is not the route to go. Forcing sales like that makes Yelp look desperate. Desperate sales are never good sales. 
So my advice to anyone who is potentially looking to working here, if you have a heart.. Walk away. 
This situation happened on many occasions but hearing a grandpa cry on the phone in one ear while having a manager overreact for the sale in the other ear killed the experience for me. 
There are other sales jobs who offer great benefits and actually treat their employees like adults, Yelp is not one of them."

2920,Yelp,A Year's Review,2016-10-05,4.0,,"Working at Yelp has been the best experience of my life.  Even with about 7 years of work experience, I still continue to learn something new everyday.

I have been working for years in marketing and  other fields, and they don't even come close to the Yelp experience. Yes the job can be a roller coaster, but the benefits far outweigh the cons of the job.

Yelp provides:
Free Health Care
Commuter benefits
401k
Stock
Health plans for gyms

Yes, the starting salary is low, but if you suck it up and bust your butt, and REALLY own the concept of self development then you can be on your way to 52k base salary within 6 months. The commission is pretty good as well compared to other tech companies.

Positive fun environment.","I read some of the comments here and I absolutely want to face palm myself.

Oh noooo, poor babies actually have to work? You don't like being in  an office and calling people and getting those fat paychecks? :(

People like this shouldn't be hired. I am so tired of these whiny poor kids who majored in English and are upset that they have to work when they get out of college. No honey, you're not going to get out of college and make over 6 figures without busting your butt.

However, I will agree the base starting salary should be somewhere in the high 40's since NY is expensive."

- With a younger group of employees, tends to be an extension of school environment. Very cliquey, manager/manager & manager/ rep fraternizing. 
- Common saying from management ""it's not an difficult job, but it's not an easy job"" For the effort that is required to truly be a great representative at Yelp a base of $35,000 pre-tax is not quality compensation. 
- By far the worst part, canned responses from management regarding career position & issues. Further proof to the employees that rather than an individual that is to be invested in, employees are just #'s to the company.

2927,Yelp,Veteran Opinion,2016-10-01,4.0,Client Partner,"What's kept me at Yelp for over three years is the people and culture. At the end of the day, I feel like the overwhelming majority of teammates, manager and directors truly care about my happiness and my success here and visa versa. I believe I've had the rare luxury of working with smart, honest folks here.","The work itself is just okay - often dull and not super-rewarding ... you often get ridiculed over the phone but that only makes a person stronger and, in my opinion, more prepared for jobs that much easier. Reviews and our software gets people very emotional. Selling advertising has no guarantee. Those two things can get very disheartening but our job is to change that. 

I do not believe there is much care and attention to the morale of our sales people and, when we are producing revenue for the company, it makes a lot of employees bitter and solely reinforces negative energy."

The only downside is that you can't expect that they'll be around for too long. The sales training program here is great and helped me get a better sales job. 

They will hire literally anyone that is young and enthusiastic, so it is a great first job out of college, to use as a resume piece and meet new people.","For the record, I do not regret working for Yelp at all, and I have no bitter feelings towards the company. I owe Yelp's sales training program for helping me land a better sales position making almost double my first year out of school.

On the contrary, don't kid yourself. This is a telemarketing position masked by a clever title, behind the facade of the ""hip"" tech company image that you can brag to friends about. Be prepared for a high volume of calls and voicemails under strict micromanagement.

I sold advertising part-time for 2 years during college, and Yelp is a very hard sell. They already have an extremely bad rep with business owners, and on top of that, the businesses have already been called by a rotation of rookie account executives, nonstop for years. Most calls end after you say you're from yelp.

Some people love the culture there, and I did to an extent, but there are a lot of things wrong with it.

Yelp has transitioned from tech start up to corporate sweatshop, and they try to preserve the image with free snacks, loud music, foosball, and obnoxious speeches from the directors. Once you're used to the amenities, monotony and regimented daily tasks will wear you down until you start sending out applications. It was a running joke amongst coworkers that it felt like we were still in high school with how each day was structured.

Most of the people you become friends with will be gone by the 6 month mark, readily replaced by the massive amounts of new hires pumped on to the sales floor each month.

The Yelp team is very cult like which some people enjoy, but I found it very distracting. You will not succeed at this position unless you ""drink the kool aid,"" regurgitate what your managers tell you to say, and let the company completely take over your persona.

When it's all said and done, Yelp will give you great sales experience and help you get a better job, but this is not a career if that is what you're searching for."

The managers tell you to be sneaky and to fool the workers in order to talk to owners. They hire tons of people because the turn over rate is through the roof. It made me feel dirty selling small businesses on something that may not actually help their business. It seems outdated and besides, Yelp is outdated and its days are numbered. You will be fooled by the office. Its in the merchandise mart and the office is cool (omg beer and free food?) and they the charm wears off after the first week.

The culture and work-life balance is really great and something emphasized as important on a team level and org-wide.  Managers genuinely care if you are able to work on things you want to work on and balancing writing new code versus maintaining legacy systems.

I'm surprised how well the company still feels small despite the growth; each engineer can have a strong impact to the organization.  Onboarding and mentor training is given a lot of attention to streamline newhires interns.  Interns are given really important projects, underscoring how change is largely driven from the bottom up, where good ideas win.","Nothing is perfect, but when I hear about other company's culture (and in some cases dysfunctions) my issues are small.

Often new projects require justification and planning, which are mostly necessary, but the process can slow progress.  As an engineer becomes more senior, more trust is given, and the engineer becomes more familiar with the right process to get things done."

That ""Kool-aid"" other reviewers have mentioned is very very very real, and if you question it or try and poke valid holes in it they will just pretend not to hear you. Its so frustrating.

My experience working here has been so unpleasant. I know now how firsthand just how anxious even the thought of this office gets me. Yelp's overall rating on Glassdoor has a satisfaction level of 3.6 - pretty solid for a large tech company, with a strong sales side. The other Yelp offices in NY, San Fran, Phoenix all are at about 3.5 star satisfaction rate. And Chicago? As of right now, 2.7 for satisfaction. What I also find ironic is that we're also the only office that has consistently missed quota months at a time while the other Yelp branches continue to see success. Perhaps the fact we're constantly (secretly, of course. you are looked down upon by management if you publicly express any feeling other than relentless happiness) miserable and overworked and overstressed due to poor management and poor developmental feedback. I feel like I've regressed since I rolled out of training because its difficult for me to keep my day in order because we're assigned specific tasks that we must do every day extra things to do ON TOP of making over 80-100 dials, talking for over 2.5 hours, setting 3 appointments, and pitching at least once a day.

Before standardized quotas from Yelp, sales goals were always set way above what was attainable, resulting in the team coming up short and being blamed for not meeting expectations. Favoritism also is the way anyone gets ahead there, so if you want to stay employed there, I hope you like brown nosing. They're the primary reason that the turnover rate is so high. Senior management is almost non-existent to the point that there's not a whole lot to comment on.

The sales process is the most complicated and confusing I have ever experienced, bar none. You better make friends with the Settings and Account Management team, otherwise, your accounts will never close after passing them off, and clawbacks on your commission will be inevitable. And it all falls on the AE to make it all work, it's absurd.

Pay is ridiculous, and their explanation is ""This is so easy to sell, why should you make more?"". The salary and ""commissions"" will require you to live off the free snacks, lunch meat, and bread in the kitchens. In fact, they hook you in with free food and somewhat decent perks so that you can't afford to look for another job. If the managers don't absolutely hate you, you'll at least get a week's notice to let you know they're going to fire you. To this company over all, every person in a cow to be milked until the milk runs dry, then you're thrown to the wolves."
2978,Yelp,"Awesome culture, people, and cool perks. but horrible pay",2016-08-19,2.0,Account Executive,"the managers are really down to earth and cool people to be friends with. The people working there are really cool and everyone is always hanging out outside of the office and doing fun things. free breakfast, lunch, coffee beer... which is cool. 

Benefits are good and a $60 gym membership, also casual work enviornment and unlimited food and cool office and building.","the entry level pay is 30k... in the financial district... no need to say more. Also cold calling is tough but to be expected, so people tell you to F off all the time. The rate at which AEs are leaving is quite alarming they bring in new people every month."

They try to make it fun....","cold calling, cold calling, cold calling and more cold calling....  Not me!!!  I did not go to 4 years of college to be a telemarketer"
2980,Yelp,"Learned a ton, but poor management and lack of innovation",2016-08-19,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Yelp took a chance on me. I didn't have the most experience and they tasked me with some pretty big things. I was able to learn how to do my job better, I traveled, I was promoted to manage a team, and learned how to do it pretty well. I will forever be grateful to Yelp for taking that chance. 

Benefits were great--insurance day one, good vision and dental, and their Employee Assistance Program was invaluable. I felt taken care of from a benefits point of view. 

As a manager, I felt supported by our HR Business Partner. She was phenomenal and a huge reason I lasted as long as I did at Yelp. 

A positive outcome of low management oversight and involvement (a con, below) was that rarely was my manager in my business. And when he was, it was rarely about larger items, just minor details. I largely got to do what I wanted with my team for the majority of my time there. Largely. 

Office is beautiful. 

I made some wonderful friends there.","I left Yelp because the company was no longer innovating AND my manager and I butted heads on a lot. 

Yelp has trillions of pieces of data, with which they could do so much. But...they don't. I just heard about the new Poke Gym addendum to the app...this is literally the biggest piece of innovation the company has had in the last three years (aside from allowing reviews on mobile), and it didn't even originate with Yelp--it took Nintendo to catalyze Yelp's innovation. What about keyword search? What predictive suggestions based on past behavior? What about planning a roadtrip and plotting top-rated restaurants along the way? All of this is within Yelp's power (the engineering team is, what, 500 strong?) and yet...innovation eludes them. Many of my engineering friends that left Yelp also expressed frustration with the lack of innovation. We've all had to find it elsewhere.

My manager and I struggled throughout the course of our working relationship. What I found frustrating was that feedback I provided him turned into name-calling (seriously). Projects and metrics that I viewed as integral to the success and innovation of my team were squashed. Career advancement I wanted and plotted out for him was scoffed at. My manager was a first-time manager, and having been there, I get it. It's really hard. But so few resources are provided to managers at Yelp I'm not surprised he didn't improve. However, I still expected more from a 4,000 organization. 

So, if you're looking to manage at Yelp, I wish you the best. They have instituted a new manager training, but you better be brand new, otherwise, you don't qualify. I recommend finding external mentors who don't have the Yelp lens on. 

When you do finally decide to leave, I again wish you the best. It's impossible to know before you exit, but if you wind up being at Yelp for longer than two years, you'll get it when you leave. Yelp is a club, and once you leave, you're largely dead to the current Yelpers. You have become a traitor. Career development isn't treason, but it is treated as such. Forget those after-work happy hours you used to go to. Forget keeping in touch with coworkers. It's like being excommunicated. So, enjoy your friends at Yelp while you're there, and when you're planning to leave, prepare. 
Even when I gave notice, my manager dropped any subsequent meetings with me like a hot potato."

- Career advancement is largely a politics game now, and growth isn't always judged mainly on performance.  If you want to climb the ladder, get ready to play.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.
- It's hugely a boys club.  There are very few women leaders in the directors+ levels, which really sucks and infiltrating the Yelp Boys Club is really tough for a woman who does not play golf."

3037,Yelp,Account executive for Eat24,2016-07-01,4.0,Account Executive,Great working environment and amazing team mates. The salary is low but the benefits are high. There are a lot of tools but you need to use them. Stay positive and make your calls and you will succeed,Bad lead distribution sometimes. Management doesn't always listen to complaints and concerns. Some managers are a little harder than others and they aren't understanding of bad weeks all the time.
3038,Yelp,Account Executive,2016-06-29,1.0,Account Executive,The people are fun and treat each other like family. I like the fact that managers from the Yelp side is slowly turning things around at EAT24.,"The pay is way below the tech sector, company has no transparency, a little disconnected with Yelp, and they are about quantity not quality. 

They lose about 10% of sales department every month. Higher turnover rate than retention and even with new hires it is impossible to stay for more than 3 months. 

Management team's unprofessionalism out weighs professionalism. One thing I can say is the Yelp managers are on top of it, I just think Eat24 needs to hire people with managerial qualifications. Also it is way hard to get promoted or not even promoted at all. 

The growth is dead end if you decide to grow in sales within the company."

The people are awesome and the culture is very fun, involving many social outings with your smaller sales team as well as several company-wide events. It's a great job to take as one of your first out of college to get your feet wet in the ad sales industry and you definitely learn a lot about various types of businesses through taking to business owners every day. 
Fully stocked kitchen and kegs for after work! Great location in the city as well, right on the Chicago River in the Merchandise Mart.","The base compensation is not adequate for living in Chicago and I do not believe it is a fair amount for the work we are doing there. The standards are very high and the commission structure is quite flawed. I and many others felt mislead during the interview process in terms of what kind of salary we'd be able to attain. There are very few people in the office that are reps who make much more than their base. 

There are some other things on the account management side and on boarding process of clients that are extremely inefficient. This doesn't make a rep's life much easier. 

You definitely have to like or be okay with inside phone sales if you choose to take a job here."

I did feel as though the company wanted me to succeed as much as I did. That doesn't mean they did their part to ensure that.","Obviously the biggest con is cold calling. No one likes it but that's the job. The key is numbing your soul just enough that you can get through an 8 hour work day harassing small businesses.

The product is very meh, not good not bad. I saw results all over the map, so it was hard to tell if that family-man plumber was putting his money to good use or sinking it into a pit that would tank his business. I had a lot of people cancel contracts after I'd sold them, and the ETF is easily 700 bucks so they must have really not liked it to want to get out of it. 

The main gripe I have with the company was the way they do territories. If you are given a chunk of small towns, best of luck scraping by. The product is a) dependent on searches and b) providing wide-exposure to them. When there are all of 10-20 restaurants in a highway town in the middle of New Mexico, there isn't a lot of innate competition to play to selling advertising against one another, especially when that town doesn't receive many searches to begin with."

3098,Yelp,Exploits New Grads,2016-04-20,1.0,Account Executive,"Snacks, breakfast and lunch, and beer at the end of the day. The Phoenix office has a game room and a nap room with massage chairs. All of the offices have ""employee resource groups"" for socializing and some light fundraising/event planning/organizing.","Yelp is one of many companies out there taking advantage of young, talented college grads who are just excited to be working for a big name company that people will recognize, and to collect probably their first paychecks ever. The problem is that Yelp goes to so many lengths to assure you that you're working at the best place in the world that sooner or later, if you're smart, you'll realize that they're lying to cover up how poor the working conditions are. 

I remember one morning meeting, the senior director of the Chicago office showed The entire sales staff an email from a former, and again current, employee who had left Yelp to pursue her dream of working in real estate, then came back and begged for her job again, having decided that ""the grass was greener here"" after a few months out in the world. 

It's a sad story, but what's sadder is that leaders in the organization decided to show this email to the entire staff can brainwash everyone into thinking Yelp is the best place to work. In the meantime, they say to talk to your manager if you ever have any doubts about your career. I did that, and he encouraged me to quit that same day. Not the professional development and support I would've hoped for. 

Yelp prides itself on being fun, diverse, and transparent - all big buzzwords in the tech company game right now. The truth: employees here are pretty much white twentysomethings from the middle of the country who went to state schools and his parents are paying their bills because the salary here isn't enough to live on. Most people work illegal overtime because their managers say that the best way to be successful is to never leave the office. In the meantime, the 60 days of sales training you undergo at the beginning of your career are all about teaching you that this is a ""cool company"", better than the ones your friends are working at. Sure."

Directors here are a joke. they prance and dance around the office.

The music in the office is no where near professional, lots of curses and vulgarity in almost every song played. Higher ups do play favorites, even though they say they are transparent, the managers tend to lean towards the first few reps to close and then stick with them through almost every call.

3103,Yelp,Highly underrated company and exec team,2016-04-13,5.0,Product Manager,"I've worked with some eccentric executives in a half-dozen tech companies over the years, and Yelp has one of the most even-keeled, smart, and emotionally intelligent executive teams that I've seen in a long time. It's a pleasure to work at Yelp and watch them operate the company.

Most everything flows from having a strong team in place, so it's not a surprise that the strong exec team has resulted in a great working culture, a strong tradition of promoting from within, and generally a collaborative work environment. There is a good level of communication around what is now a 3000+ employee base in the form of all-hands meetings (quarterly), short update videos (weekly), and frequent opportunities for department- and team-level communication, feedback, and Q&A.

Lastly, Yelp is a fun place to work. I thought it was BS when I first interviewed here: everyone I talked to said it was fun to work at Yelp. I thought that must be some strong corporate kool-aid they're drinking, but it's actually true. Somehow when people are well-managed, have an opportunity to make a difference, and work together, they have more fun. The company also makes fun a priority, so that helps.","It's tough to work on a product that consumers mostly love (""I use Yelp every day, it helps me find the best restaurants, shops, etc."") but that business owners mostly deride (""I can't believe that Yelpers are allowed to write whatever they want!""). Despite Yelp's best efforts to have internal controls between editorial/product and sales, despite numerous dismissed lawsuits to the contrary, we still struggle against a general perception by business owners that we're out to get them."

3109,Yelp,Here's the REAL story,2016-04-11,2.0,Account Executive,"All the nice perks of a tech company:
Free Medical, Dental, and Vision
Free Beer from the kegs after 5:30pm
Team Happy Hours where your manager will buy you at least one drink
Contests and referral bonus
Well stocked kitchens
Lots of cool 20 somethings, you will make lots of friends","So this is where it gets fun...you are a telemarketer.  They try to dress it up as warm calling because they already have a Yelp page but you know you are calling business owners, disrupting their day to try and hock expensive advertising

What they expect is 2 pitches, 3 appointments, 65-80 calls per day and 2 1/2 hours talk time.  The problem is they covet pitches SOOOO much that you end up completing pitches you know won't close so you can hit their pitch expectations.  Pitching 10 times or less can easily get you fired.  Not hitting quota enough can get you fired.  Not smiling enough, you guessed it, fired.

It's a high pressure environment filled with loud music, cheering, and screaming.  They try to overcompensate for how crappy the job really is by giving you freebies and acting like this is a dream job.

They say territory doesn't matter, but it SURE does.  Get some place in rural Michigan, let's see how long you last.  If you get that territory you will end up spending hours explaining what Yelp is, struggle to find good pitches, and if you close deals they will be low inventory so you get basically no revenue.

If you get a GOOD territory that's half the battle.  Most territories have been picked clean.  The size of the territories continues to go down because they are hiring so many people.  The ones making huge amounts of money have NYC, LA, Chicago etc.  They make it seem like you too can make 10k commission checks.  If you do get a good commission check, chances are you will struggle the next month because you worked all the good leads, now have to trudge through garbage for months until you get a territory change.

Business owners are going to hate your guts.  They get calls so often that once they hear Yelp they hang up.  Call a bit more and they will block you, forever closing off the ability to talk again.

There is a ton of hate around Yelp as well and lots of claims that they are extorting business owners.  It's not true, but tell that to the angry man on the phone screaming at you.

Until they change this mantra of pitch 800 times a month, things wont get better.  They are hiring idiot kids out of college that couldnt get a job elsewhere to man the phones to chat with business owners that have been in their professions for 80 years.  Somehow they have to act like they know what's best for them.

Managers will tell you to be super pushy to the point that the business owner will be totally turned off and never answer your call again.  They want one call closes consistently which is illogical.  The way they want you to pitch is WAY too needy.  Basically peppering them with why don't you want to get started?  What is there to think about?"

Great benefits and very livable salary. They let you make your own mistakes and never make you feel like you're going to ""get in trouble"" which is very freeing to me as I know we learn best from mistakes. Help is always available to you. The kitchen is awesome. But more than anything the recognition of efforts is wonderful and inspiring to keep being better.","While every phone conversation is different, they can be a little monotonous sometimes.

* Excellent company values, particularly ""play well with others"". Most engineers at Yelp are friendly, helpful, and pretty easy to work with. Sure, there are some employees that don't adhere to this value, but in my experience many of these folks end up leaving Yelp.
* Great benefits. In addition to the standard health/dental, Yelp provides up to $60 per month for their wellness program, that can be used for gyms or other fitness activities. Additionally, the company has 3 two-day hackathons each year, where the engineers can work on whatever project they want. And, there are 4 ""off-sites"" each year where each engineering team goes to do something fun together, and 2 company-wide events per year. 
* A very open and accepting work culture. There were people at Yelp from so many different backgrounds. E.g. during lunch a muslim engineer would silent perform one of his daily prayer in the corner of the kitchen and everybody was cool with that. In 2015 Yelp officially participated in the SF pride parade. Yelp has at least a couple engineers with noticeable impairments and does a great job helping them to be happy, successful members of the team.
* Tons of awesome events, including learning lunches on Fridays (and sometimes Mondays too) with presentations on cool eclectic topics, movie nights, trivia nights, board games nights, women engineering groups, a variety of meetup events (e.g. python, machine learning), and more!
* Management is very open to ideas and supportive of work done by engineers. If you think of a cool, challenging project that benefits the company, chances are that you'll get to work on it.

I was not looking for another job when I left Yelp, and it was a tough decision to leave this company. I've worked or interned at 5 companies now, and I have been the happiest at Yelp.","There aren't many cons to working at Yelp as an engineer. However, now that the company is fairly big (4000-5000 employees) you cannot realistically expect rapid career advancement as you would at a successful, small startup unless you work really hard (I choose to maintain a good work/life balance and was very happy with that choice) or are ridiculously brilliant.

Along the same lines, the management claims that a well-performing engineer can be just as well compensated regardless of whether s/he pursues a path in management or remains a talented software engineer. However, based on my experiences I don't believe this is 100% true. Not that differing compensation is unreasonable, I just wish that management would not make this claim (unless I'm mistaken)."

For many this is a first job post-grad and once they stop believing the hype that management forces down their throats, they jump ship. Some of the training presentations are laughable, still referring to themselves as a ""startup"" despite being a massive publicly traded company. Statistics given as sales ammo to send to clients and in training are all conveniently tailored to hide the last couple years of downward trends. The advertising product can work for some, although most sales seem to be to owners who do not fully understand what they are buying. I did not feel good about many of my sales, feeling scummy for selling expensive packages to businesses who could not afford them nor fully understood how to use the site. My biggest problem with the job is not talking down furious owners who hate yelp with a passion, but the reality that every quality lead has been called 50-100 times in the last few years and they know the snake oil you are selling the second you tell them you are from Yelp. Absolutely soul crushing. The pop music blaring on every sales floor becomes distracting and highly annoying.

3167,Yelp,RUN FAR AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!! DON'T DO IT!!!!,2016-02-26,1.0,Sales Account Executive,free snacks; meeting cool people who'll become your friends; free healthcare & benefits,"Yelp is a cool company at times. The people that they hire are friendly, outgoing & have amazing personalities, and you will make some really cool friends. Also, free healthcare. BUT......

The pay is horrendous & the actual work is awful!!
It was a shame I had to leave but I resigned before I had another opportunity lined up because the job was so awful.

First I'll speak about the pay, there isn't much to say except $35,000 a year is not enough live on in NYC. The offices are downtown - do they expect all of their employees to have less than an hour commute and live in the suburbs? I stay in the 'burbs, and let me tell you, after paying rent I had very little extra funds. They tell you that your first year you are expected to make 45-50k and that is just NOT the case and I will tell you why in a minute, but let me move on to why the job is awful.....

It is simply cold calling sales. Meaning..... YOU'RE A GLORIFIED TELEMARKETER!!! You make 90-100 dials a day and you are supposed to be speaking with small business owners but very rarely do you get in touch with them. The metrics are 2+ hours of talk time, 65-80 dials a day and 3+ appointments. Those metrics are impossible to meet because literally no one wants to talk to you. So you keep getting hung up on by hostesses, peons, auto shop workers, ESL workers, nail salon women, and maybe some business owners (in the unlikely event that you get one on the phone). 

Therefore the only metric you are able to somewhat hit is the dials. If you don't schedule any appointments to show business owners the product then you obviously will not close a deal so, you won't make commission. To make commission you have to make $30,000+ for the company every month. The whole process is completely unrealistic and I feel as if you are set up for failure as an AE.

There also isn't a lot of career opportunity or choices. Neither you're in inside sales or you're a manager - that's it.

LISTEN TO ME: Cold-calling is not for everyone. 95% of the people you call DO NOT respect you and most of the time, they won't even view you as a human being. You're just another telemarketer trying to sell them something they have no interest in buying. So be ready for that.

Oh and they shove how GREAT Yelp ads down your throat from the moment you walk in the door until the day you can't take it anymore and leave. I'll never forget my first day on the job, in training, when we were told getting this job at Yelp was harder than getting into Harvard University. No, they really said that. And it was only the beginning. You're constantly told that no other job in the world is fun and relaxed like your role at Yelp. They tell you Yelp is the greatest thing since sliced bread, even though public perception of the company continues to worsen, and look at you like you're crazy if you ever doubt the company and its capabilities. They TRY to brainwash you to believe that there is truly no other form of marketing that local businesses should ever consider. IT'S ALL A LIE!!!

Also, on the sales floor we were constantly taught that over-talking and overselling the product demonstrated doubt in the product on our end as sales people. The thought process was the product is so great that all we had to do was present it, keep it simple and we were golden. Perhaps the management at Yelp should take this into account when they're telling us several times a month how lucky we are to have this job, how great it is, etc. You begin to realize that you, along with the rest of the sales floor, is sold by upper management on a daily basis. Things are carefully crafted and worded to put them in a more positive light to keep morale up, hints of promotions are thrown around liberally to inspire motivation and they always have an explanation/spin to negative press about the company, even if it's true. (Especially on the financial front)

Please, for the love of God, stop calling yourself a startup, Yelp. The company is way, way past that phase and is anything but at this point. It's a large public company and the employees do not have the freedoms/opportunities they would at a traditional, true startup. This goes back to the ping pong tables, kegs, casual dress etc. In reality, they're hardly, if ever used. The keg is strictly off limits until after 5:30, no one uses the ping pong table unless they're staying inside the office for lunch (which I would recommend always getting outside and getting fresh air, unless it's freezing of course) or staying late after work. They're nothing more than props to A) entice desperate college graduates on the job hunt and B) give a false sense of working at a fun, laid-back startup to current employees.

Make no mistake, the sales floor is high pressure and metrics are painstakingly monitored. And depending on your manager, it can be even more stressful. Certain managers even make their reps work through lunch, which is illegal, but I guess that doesn't really matter to the company when its struggling to hit its revenue numbers like never before. I can't say it enough, Yelp is NOT a startup anymore.

Immature atmosphere. I think a lot of this goes back to the startup vibe. Most of the people on the sales floor have no idea what working at a startup is truly like, INCLUDING young supervisors who are still in their frickin 20s, but they think they have this shiny, unique job at a ""tech company"" and it almost makes them overcompensate. We share a building with Credit Suisse and I kid you not, I would hear Yelp reps crack jokes daily about the Credit Suisse employees after they got off the elevator about their professional attire, their jobs, etc. Yes, let's make fun of the people making three times as much as we are. That makes a lot of sense.

Also, the office can be extremely high school-like. Very gossipy, cliquey. All of that nonsense. Overall just lacking professionalism in that department far too often.

Territories. You're a slave to the system of territories. You will constantly be told that territories don't matter. Laugh every time you're told that. Territories absolutely matter. All of the best reps in the company have major metro areas like NYC, Boston, Chicago etc. If territories didn't matter, there wouldn't be certain managers who do shady things to get their reps the best territories possible. On top of that, because the company is under so much pressure to hit that magical billion in revenue, they are constantly hiring in large numbers. We're talking 70-80 people a class. Because of this, territories are getting smaller and accounts are being touched way too often. If you get a new territory, chances are the best accounts in it were touched no longer than 2 or 3 weeks ago.

Oh, and everyone's screwing everyone!!! Managers screwing managers. Reps screwing reps. Reps screwing managers. It's like one big orgy at this place. Then again when everyone is in their 20s and full of raging hormones, what do u expect??

It's VERY hard to sell against this company's reputation right now. The higher ups will tell you they've always had their share of obstacles, but reps who have been around since 2012 and 2013 will tell you it's noticeably more difficult than it's ever been right now. There's just too much anti-Yelp clout out there to make it all go away like they're aiming for. Most reps, like myself included, feel that if we don't close a business on the first call, we'll never close them. The reason being that they'll most likely go to Google when they're making their decision, and what they're going to see is nothing but negative. On top of that, the company as a whole is on the way down. It's not the ""next big thing"" or hot platform it was a few years ago. The stock is suffering and not going anywhere anytime soon.

I worked for Yelp for little under a year and let me just say, these reviews from people that say they love it are just flat out lies. This company preys on college grads because these young people don't know better and are easily sparkled by the flashy name and ""perks"" of Yelp. Please don't be easily blinded. This is a straight up cold calling job. You will be micro managed to a extent that will drive you into depression. Everyday is the same thing over and over, and when you go to take your lunch or even a break you have management timing and making you feel bad for running to the bathroom or being 2 minutes late from lunch. Everyone here hates it except people begging for promotions. The pay and commission structure is the worst I've seen in any sales position offered. If you want to do sales, you can find anything better I promise. Before accepting this job I beg you to look at anything else.  After 4 months you will start getting depressed, be working 45+ hours a week, and having business owners tell you how horrible a person you are. The worst is when you quit they treat you like the enemy and will make you leave that day even if you put in your two weeks. You can't say bye to anyone and you're kicked to the curb. Professional. Please just look into anything else besides this job."

3173,Yelp,Account Executive,2016-02-17,2.0,Account Executive,"Great training for entry level inside sales reps. You will learn how to approach decision makers, set appointments, qualify your leads, and attempt to sell Yelp's display ad products as a solution.","Oh, where to start.  First, let's talk about the environment. Don't let the toys fool you, no one ever has time to kick back and shoot hoops when you're expected to stay (quite literally) chained to your phone making more dials as the same loud pop playlist blares in the background of your calls. I often only see managers playing games, ironically.

Last week our director tried to leverage the free food and coffee as to why our base salaries are so low. Have to say, that was pretty weak. Cheap lunch meat with 1,200 hands in it everyday and a barista station I personally never use are not good reasons to underpay employees. Fully paid benefits are nice (way to stay competitive with literally every other tech company), still no excuse for a 35K base when most people don't see commission for a year or more (if they don't quit sooner.) I took the job to get experience, but probably wouldn't have if they didn't overpromise on the commission front.  

Which brings me to yet another con: territories. Managers will find a way to make you pay for even bringing it up, by giving you a new (but worse) territory or just giving you the cold shoulder with your concerns, but whether or not you succeed here largely depends on where you call into. Makes sense. You will close way more calling into a metropolitan American city than you will Nowheresville, Canada. But they act like everyone is given equal opportunity. Even if one area has 5x the volume of sellable businesses, they act like it's entirely your problem if you're not reaching the same numbers in your ""non-Yelpy"" territory. What's worse is that you're stack ranked solely on revenue, so all contests, promotions, shout outs and accolades are awarded to high sellers, no matter the advantages they have in the territory system. Territories can be switched without notice org-wide, which happened recently, and you will lose all of your accounts unless you can close but 15 of them in 15 days. Lastly, like I said, everything is stack ranked per revenue, so your next territory is based on how well you do with the one before it. Do I need to explain further?

Managers. Mostly 23-25 year olds with no previous experience and have only ever worked for Yelp. They will cheerlead you until the cows come home, but at the end of the day they're there to babysit your metrics and make sure you're putting out 80 dials and 2.5 hours of talk time daily. Other reps have had better luck, but no manager has ever been able to help me close a call. I have had 4 of them so far. Just goes to show you success at Yelp depends on the hand you're dealt up front in terms of territories and management. 

Meager time off. Meager sick leave. An overall very stressful job with little returns on your investment with Yelp. Now I know exactly what a boiler room is."

3176,Yelp,A True Review on the Company that was built on Reviews! Must Read!,2016-02-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,If You have no sales experience the training here is a great start to learn the basics.,"Here we go:
1. The pay is structured at 35K base salary, you will receive no commission until you earn 30k for the company, basically paying for your yearly salary. After you hit 30k you need to hit 12k per month before making 120 dollars in commission. They tell you average of first year is around 70k this is a lie. 
2. Is the free food really free??  Well trust me when I say each sales rep is paying portions of the overhead. If you understand the pay structure above then you get it. People get blinded my the music, games and free stuff because they don't get it right away. I would rather make the money than the free lunches. 
3. Territory, you better be good or be liked. That's how they base a lot of decisions. 
4.Micro Manage- they watch every detail of your day. 80 calls, talk time etc. But they say they don't micro manage....
5. Majority of management was born and bred here. They have no other outside experience everyone speaks Yelp language and are very limited in there own experience. Which I believe limits every reps potential. 
6. As far as the ""executive team/directors"" I feel like someone gave them keys to the car but they don't have a license. It's really embarrassing to watch. They're clueless. 
7. If you leave....they take it personally and have verbally attacked and insulted people. I'm surprised I haven't heard lawsuits on this. HR must hate their life. 
8. Promotion & advancement? Yep they're growing but if you are amazing and crush it in sales that doesn't mean you will get it. Again, they pick who they want. I've seen many people be promoted and weren't qualified. 
9. They try to pump you up with internal testimonials (previous reps now managers) from earlier years, Yelp didn't have the reputation years ago they have today. It's a lot harder to convince people to buy in. 
10. You have to clap and follow your team to the gong to celebrate a sale. You may think this is great in the beginning. However, most of us were just annoyed. How bad is it that you have to get that excited when someone does their job? Again, embarrassing. No one cares after a month or 2.
11. If you decide to work here, under no circumstances should you think for yourself or outside the box. My advice is to be quiet, smile and just do what they say. Be a robot, if you confront, ask questions as to why you will not be liked, promoted etc."
3177,Yelp,Don't trust the recruiter pitch,2016-02-12,1.0,Account Executive,Free food. You'll need it with what you'll get paid. Music all day. Good training as a first step into a sales career.,"They tell you during the interview that they'll never let you work 40+ hours a week. Not sure how they came to that because I've worked overtime every week I've worked here. They sell you on the money the reps make. They DON'T tell you that only a few top reps make that kind of money. I've gotten two commission checks in the time I've worked here. Most sales come from having a good territory and getting lucky. 

If you get a bad territory, you're screwed for MONTHS. They'll rarely let you change territories. If you're lucky you'll call into a major city. If you're not lucky you'll call into some remote crap stain town that has a few auto shops and a couple plumbers.

God forbid you have kids and they switch you to a territory out of your time zone. You work the same hours as the time zone you call in to.

The business owners HATE Yelp. Very rarely do I speak to business owners that are happy about my call. If the account is any good then it's been called 50+ times already.

There's a reason they hire 40-50 new sales reps a month. The turnover is very high. This place is like a sweatshop. They work young and naive new college grads to death (for little pay) for 6-8 months until they get tired of the job and quit then bring in new ones to replace them. 

You're expected to make 80+ cold calls a month and talk on the phone for 2.5 hours a day. The pressure is so high that some reps have been fired for calling their cell phones and leaving 10 minute long voicemails to hit their talk time metrics."

Good resources (Salesforce, swanky offices, offsites + happy hours, snacks etc...).","This is typically the cycle of an AE in this company. You'll LOVE it after 3 months, you'll be indifferent after 6. You will want to leave after 9 and the vast majority sadly don't make it past a year.

The role is extremely one dimensional: If at some point down the line you feel like doing something other than 80 calls per day than that's too bad. It sounds stupid to complain about that seeing as its in the job description but were only human and it's ultimately the reason behind the low retention. 

There is little or no career progression. The market is simply not growing fast enough for their to be a demand for additional managers or mid market teams. 

Retention of staff is extremely low. It's hard to stay motivated when your work pals are all leaving and telling you how much better it is working at Google and Airbnb. 

It sounds like a lot of cons, Yelp is definitely experiencing some growing pains in Europe but they're on the right track and as far as a first job out of college, I struck gold. Don't apply just because you love Yelp, don't apply because you want to work in the technology space. Only apply if you are serious about starting a career in sales and be prepared for a lot of ups and a lot of downs."

The so-called Silicon Valley culture claim is bogus - Yelp (Chicago) is nothing more than a spruced up telemarketing / sales boiler room operation. The music they play constantly at ear piercing levels is horrible, repetitive, and not a good fit for when you're trying to do business with clients over the phone.  Hope you like reading from a sales script, too, because that is all you will ever do at Yelp. Full sales cycles? - not happening! You have to turn over every account to Account Managers or Elite AEs. The managers here are all young and inexperienced; micromanagement is the name of their game. Nothing but 20-somethings at this office, which makes sense as the younger you are the more likely you are to buy in and drink the Kool-Aid. They hire a ton of kids right out of college that don't know how good they could have it at another more professional company. Very stressful job - which is not how professional sales should be.  Again this is a straight up boiler room / telemarketing operation. 80 dials and 2 1/2 hours of talk time every day, and they record every call you make. Micromanagement to the extreme!  Not a good place to work for an experienced sales professional; avoid wasting your time at Yelp. Pay is terrible, and you won't make anything worthwhile on the commission side either - your first 30K in commission goes to Yelp, then you can start collecting."

Not sure what kind of merit and and level of morality they operate on, but this is not the company that you want to work for unless you don't mind watching your back like a hawk from overly sensitive and immature employees.

Certain businesses do very well using yelp as a form of advertising.,"The most obvious is shady selling practices.  Multiple reps quote figures that are absolutely not correct and don't care as long as they get credit for the transaction.  Secondly, the overwhelming majority of business owners do not like Yelp at all.  Management mentions to ignore former notes--however very often those notes are accurate.

Amazing training and management- On the fly help.  Managers will be on your calls and are always there to help you get better. You'll learn a ton here (see below) and this will jump start a great future in sales if you work hard.
- Good snacks (although the lunch options are sub par)
- Great opportunity to grow in a sales career if you hit your numbers","- The job gets incredibly monotonous and frustrating. Yelp is an incredibly tough sell.  Business owners for the most part hate Yelp, don't know it, or love it and are already bought in. Getting a business owner to sit in front of a computer for 20 minutes is hard enough, but getting them to spend thousands of dollars on advertising with a contract is much harder.
- Unfair territory/inventory rules. You'll get less credit for the same deal if your territory is in a small, rural area than a big city.  It's also a much harder sell when these areas don't use the internet like people in big cities. Yelp is a consumer first platform, which affects sales numbers and leads to a lot of disappointed clients. 
- The culture really has taken a spiral since I've worked there. When the company was smaller, there was a fun loving culture where everyone knew everyone.  As the company grew and the office got bigger, I would constantly see faces I've never seen before. 
- Low pay and unfair commission structure that doesn't make any sense. If a client cancels before their contract ends, it comes out of your commission."

Therefore, one can hit what seems like a professional road block after a few quick promotions. It's not that the company doesn't have opportunities for people.

They say there are other outlets for growth in other departments, but it's very difficult to do and you have to be a top notch sales rep closing double - triple your quota every month in order to have that available to you. 
They also hire anywhere from 40-80 new reps per month so your value tends to get lost in the crowd and you are easily replaced if you do not produce.

Yelp is a young, energetic environment. If you are a fast learner and good at sales, you will succeed quickly. I loved my manager and team. Opportunities for advancement-- but only if you're really good at the sales role. New territories are attainable if you work yours to the best of your advantage-- but you are not guaranteed a good territory.","$30K base salary is well below industry standard. Very low retention rates-- people quit all the time. Compensation structure upon making commission is not very good. You will not make commission on anything each month until you book $12K. Cold calling is grueling and takes a toll on mental health and happiness. The product is very expensive ($300/month at the very least) and Yelp is antiquated in not offering a month-to-month ad program. This makes it hard to sell in territories where Yelp is not a big presence. 

I was only in training for one month, but the class after me was in training for two months. I'm not sure why this happened-- I would have benefited from extra time in training. I was not offered additional help when it was clear that I was struggling, even after I met with my manager multiple times about the problem of not closing.

My director was extremely awkward and frequently made people uncomfortable. He made no effort to get to know anyone and it was clear that he saw us as sales machines only. Management in general would pry into our personal lives and ask personal questions/make inappropriate comments. Some of my coworkers were involved in unscrupulous practices at work and management did nothing when it was reported.

I often felt like a robot at work. The job is uninteresting and demoralizing unless you really like sales and don't feel attached to the work emotionally in any way. Yelp hires almost anyone so there is no guarantee of success. I wish I hadn't been hired at all so I wouldn't have had to struggle for a long time at a job I am not good at."
3277,Yelp,Great first sales job out of college...,2015-10-27,4.0,Account Executive (Sales),"Ah Yelp.. what a roller coaster you are. While deciding whether or not to work here after college I relied on these Glassdoor reviews quite a bit, so I feel it is necessary to share my experience for the next graduate deciding whether or not to take the leap and hop in the sales trenches at Yelp. 

Pros: It is quite possibly the most fun work environment that you will ever experience throughout your career (provided you are not too far removed from college and are into the whole work hard play hard atmosphere). Most of your colleagues will be in their 20's and you will meet some of your best friends here in a short amount of time. Perfect if you are looking to move to a new city (We have offices in Scottsdale, SF, NYC and Chicago). 

You are recognized for your efforts/success and senior management really does care about you (unless you're a turd nugget, then you get fired/quit). 

After working for Yelp for a year (If you are successful), you will have companies practically begging you for an interview as the training program is industry leading and you are trained to wheel and deal on the phone. I have the utmost respect for the YSDP (Yelp Sales Development Program). 

You also have the ability to transfer offices after about a year on the job. Overall, the best parts of working at Yelp is the culture, the experience and the doors that open after you are successful in the role. Not to mention they do not let you work more than 40 hours a week so the work/life balance is great.","Compensation. The base salary is lower than just about any other comparable role at any other company. This is especially true for NY and SF. A 36k base salary is insulting in those cities. The ramp up is way too long as well. If you are a consistent producer you should not have to wait an entire year to receive a decent base salary increase. 

The companies growth is causing territories to shrink and many accounts are being touched too often. This results in more animosity from local business owners and people producing less revenue than in, say, 2013. 

Territory distribution is disparate between tenured vets and rooks, but that's to be expected in just about any sales role. 

Overall, great first job our of college but I would get our after a year or 2 unless you are looking to get managerial experience or have aspirations of making a career in an environment like that."

These benefits are vital to actually keeping their sales people for more than 2 months.","The sales job itself is awful. I felt like my soul was being sucked out everyday. Training isn't bad, but the actual job was not fun. Not ethical. Not ""helping people connect with local businesses."" This job is about making a sale and that is it. It's not about anything else despite what they tell you in training. 

If you're a ruthless salesperson who doesn't care if the product actually works or not, this is your dream job. But, if you genuinely want to help businesses and do what's best for them, stay away. 

Most of the people I called hated Yelp or had no interested in Yelp advertising. But, these are just excuses because every business needs Yelp and we need to sell them 24/7. No. Sorry, but rural areas in random states don't need Yelp advertising. It's pretty apparent that it only works in cities. If you do take this job, you'll be amazed how good you get at lying! Is that a pro or a con for you? Think about it. 

Metrics heavy: you need to make 70 calls and have high talk time every day. This is extremely stressful but it can be done. I did it almost every day. 

Managers: this is actually a joke. The managers are all 22 or 23 and seem to have never been in a leadership role before. Getting that manager position depends on how good you are at selling...their job consists of monitoring their team and listening to what you're saying on the phone. To be honest, it looks like the easiest job in the world. Just listening into calls and making fun team events. And firing people. 

Attitude: if you don't have a ""I drank the Yelp kool-aid"" attitude 24/7, they will can you. You're expected to be close with your team, which is absolutely ridiculous. Work is work and if people get along at work, that's good enough. This is supposed to be a career, not high school where you have to be BFFs with everyone. You have to be smiling - they watch you. You have to bleed yelp from your glowing face every single day. 

Cursing: I don't know if it's just me, but having your boss or your boss' boss curse at employees is just super unprofessional. It happens a lot. 

These people are nuts about money and you should know that whatever they fill your head with during training better stick. When it falls apart, like with me, you start to realize you physically and mentally cannot and will not do this job anymore. 

The benefits are great, but at what cost? This isn't the part where you decide if sales is for you. This is the part where you decide is Yelp Sales is for you."

Many people there are all like-minded, fun, talkative, sometimes intelligent, and generally like to party. People who work there usually make close friends they'll have for life. Gym reimbursement, free food, alcohol, lots of social connections. 

As a sales rep, you'll learn the basic principals of selling, advertising technology, and how small businesses operate. The job is truly a grind which I consider to be a pro rather than a con. You will work really hard and have frustrating days, but will have a great time if you're a social person and are willing to hit the pavement day in and day out.","Yelp's advertising product. It's great in theory and does work for some businesses, but Yelp is very behind when it comes to cutting edge Silicon Valley advertising. I worked at Yelp for years and there were still only 2 ad placements on the site (what about retargeting? What about targeted banners?) also got on the CPC bandwagon late.
Separation of Sales Reps vs. other departments. The engineers get a clear upperhand at the company and that's very obvious. Also very very difficult to move to any department other than Sales."

Yelp! privacy settings allow only your friends to view your full profile, while a limited profile is still accessible to other YELP! members. You can see the last 100 people who have viewed your profile and, if necessary, you can block individual members. You can also limit the continents that can see your profile. For example, if you want your profile to remain public but don't want unsolicited comments from people in other countries, you can set your profile so that only people from North America can view your profile.

Firstly, ""Account Executive""=Telemarketer. This job consists of cold calling small business owners who do not want speak with you at all, and trying to convince them to spend thousands of dollars on advertising that usually does not work for these businesses. That is the only responsibility you have. All you do is cold call businesses that have bad stigmas of Yelp already. What makes matters worse is that these business owners have already been rejected the many Yelp sales reps before you (which most probably quit), making these business owners even more upset. The lack of honesty in this company is outstanding as well. You are told that territories ""do not matter"" and to"" trust the process,"" when in fact whatever territory you are assigned absolutely determines your success as an ""Account Executive."" The quota for a rep whose territory was in NYC is the exact same quota for a rap who calls into a small town in Pennsylvania with a population of 5,000 people. CRAZY. What makes matters worse is that I did not feel ethically selling a product to someone who I knew it would not work for. But no one at Yelp cares about this, it is all about revenue. The amount of people canceling advertiser service is laughable, and this company will soon breakdown in itself. Beware young, naive college grads: these people will lie to you about growing a long term ""career"" here but the chances of you being fired in your first 2 months for not hitting unattainable quotas is extremely high. This company is like a revolving door, people coming in and leaving just as quickly as they showed up. I would also like to add that if you are not a frat boy you will be looked over. ""drink the kool aid"" and maybe, just maybe you won't be fired. Would also like to add that managers are constantly talking behind you back (very obviously) and you are monitored in everything that you do, like a young child. Managers are chosen by popularity, so you are highly likely to be managed by someone who i completely unqualified. Also, 36K in NYC? That is insulting. These people are like a sweat shop. They prey on recent grads who live at home who do not know any better and work them to misery, and then just fire them. I really hope that this review prevents someone from making a mistake and accepting an offer here"
3307,Yelp,Account Executive,2015-09-23,3.0,Account Executive,"Oh, Yelp. What a rollercoaster you are. Let's get to it.

- Overall, a lot of great people. It's a very young company, so if you're like most of the employees on the sales floor and not too far removed from college, you're going to make a lot of friends. It's a very social environment.

- Great benefits. 401k, full health/medical, gym subsidy, etc.

- Nice office. In one of the better areas of Manhattan to work (flatiron). Plenty of stuff to do around the office during lunch and after work.

- Kegs, ping pong tables and fully-stocked kitchen. However, don't get too excited about these things yet. I'll address them more in the cons list. 

- Great place to get your feet wet, learn how to sell and a big name to put on your resume. Regardless of the public opinion of the company, you will be a hot commodity to other companies looking for sales people if you stick it out long enough.","First off, notice how I didn't really say anything about the actual job itself in the pros. That's because it sucks, but then again, it is what it is and in reality you know what you're signing up for when you take the position. Cold-calling is not for everyone. 90% of the people you call will never respect you and most of the time, they won't even view you as a human being. You're just another telemarketer trying to sell them something they have no interest in buying. So be ready for that feeling. 

- The infamous Yelp koolaid. Man, they shove it down your throat from the moment you walk in the door until the day you can't take it anymore and leave. I'll never forget my first day on the job, in training, when we were told getting this job at Yelp was harder than getting into Harvard University. No, they really said that. And it was only the beginning. You're constantly told that no other job in the world is fun and relaxed like your role at Yelp. They tell you Yelp is the greatest thing since sliced bread, even though public perception of the company continues to worsen, and look at you like you're crazy if you ever doubt the company and its capabilities. They brainwash you to believe that there is truly no other form of marketing that local businesses should ever consider. And hey, man, I get it - I'm sure sales roles everywhere are like this because you ultimately have to believe in the product, but Yelp goes way over the top here to the point where it turns a lot of employees, like myself, off. 

Also, on the sales floor we were constantly taught that over-talking and overselling the product demonstrated doubt in the product on our end as sales people. The thought process was the product is so great that all we had to do was present it, keep it simple and we were golden. Perhaps the management at Yelp should take this into account when they're telling us several times a month how lucky we are to have this job, how great it is, etc. You begin to realize that you, along with the rest of the sales floor, is sold by upper management on a daily basis. Things are carefully crafted and worded to put them in a more positive light to keep morale up, hints of promotions are thrown around liberally to inspire motivation and they always have an explanation/spin to negative press about the company, even if it's true. (Especially on the financial front)

- Please, for the love of God, stop calling yourself a startup, Yelp. The company is way, way past that phase and is anything but at this point. It's a large public company and the employees do not have the freedoms/opportunities they would at a traditional, true startup. This goes back to the ping pong tables, kegs, casual dress etc. In reality, they're hardly, if ever used. The keg is strictly off limits until after 5:30, no one uses the ping pong table unless they're staying inside the office for lunch (which I would recommend always getting outside and getting fresh air, unless it's freezing of course) or staying late after work. They're nothing more than props to A) entice desperate college graduates on the job hunt and B) give a false sense of working at a fun, laid-back startup to current employees.

Make no mistake, the sales floor is high pressure and metrics are painstakingly monitored. And depending on your manager, it can be even more stressful. Certain managers even make their reps work through lunch, which is illegal, but I guess that doesn't really matter to the company when its struggling to hit its revenue numbers like never before. I can't say it enough, Yelp is NOT a startup anymore.

- Immature atmosphere. I think a lot of this goes back to the startup vibe. Most of the people on the sales floor have no idea what working at a startup is truly like, but they think they have this shiny, unique job at a ""tech company"" and it almost makes them overcompensate. We share a building with Credit Suisse and I kid you not, I would hear Yelp reps crack jokes daily about the Credit Suisse employees after they got off the elevator about their professional attire, their jobs, etc. Yes, let's make fun of the people making three times as much as we are. That makes a lot of sense. 

Also, the office can be extremely high school-like. Very gossipy, cliquey. All of that nonsense. Overall just lacking professionalism in that department far too often.

- Territories. You're a slave to the system of territories. You will constantly be told that territories don't matter. Laugh every time you're told that. Territories absolutely matter. All of the best reps in the company have major metro areas like NYC, Boston, Chicago etc. If territories didn't matter, there wouldn't be certain managers who do shady things to get their reps the best territories possible. On top of that, because the company is under so much pressure to hit that magical billion in revenue, they are constantly hiring in large numbers. We're talking 70-80 people a class. Because of this, territories are getting smaller and accounts are being touched way too often. If you get a new territory, chances are the best accounts in it were touched no longer than 2 or 3 weeks ago.

- It's very hard to sell against this company's reputation right now. The higher ups will tell you they've always had their share of obstacles, but reps who have been around since 2012 and 2013 will tell you it's noticeably more difficult than it's ever been right now. There's just too much anti-Yelp clout out there to make it all go away like they're aiming for. Most reps, like myself included, feel that if we don't close a business on the first call, we'll never close them. The reason being that they'll most likely go to Google when they're making their decision, and what they're going to see is nothing but negative. On top of that, the company as a whole is on the way down. It's not the ""next big thing"" or hot platform it was a few years ago. The stock is suffering and not going anywhere anytime soon."

Although you can help make their Yelp page look strong, it is frustrating to come across so many business owners who are saying they don't know if their ads are working and trying to prove it to them. At the end of the day, there is no 100 % guarantee on the effectiveness of advertising although yelp does have data and graphs to show how the ads change interaction on the business page.  You also have to placate a lot of business owners upset about reviews, which we do not have the power to change because that would undermine Yelp's trustworthiness with the General public."

If you can do that you can do pretty much anything.","At the recent all hands meeting (with all staff/workers) there was some mention of the ""unicorn bubble"" of startups offering sales reps double the salary causing them to jump- and it's true, the base pay is godawful, this is even joked about during training. They spew constant BS about you ""being your own CEO"" and ""managing your own leads"", etc. but once you leave here and go to a job where you're not being monitored 24/7 and treated like an adult you'll see how bad it actually was. If you're not making enough calls to your manager's liking you will receive friendly gchats ""45 calls??!"" which is always appreciated. Furthermore there are no inbound leads at all. You are cold calling straight up all day. A lot of sales jobs once you rack up the Yelp experience will pay you 15k more, give you inbound leads, and treat you like a human being rather than a calling robot. 

The ad program works in NYC and California and some other highly populated markets. It does not work in small towns and it does not work for many categories. Cost per click is a much better program than CPM, we have the stats to prove it, but especially if you're in a bad area they still make you push this antiquated awful program to 95% of your clients. I've had problems sleeping at night selling the lowest level CPM but have to do it because the client won't do anything else. And then it doesn't work and they get mad. -.-

There are also asinine comp battles you may have to fight due to an account deciding they want to sign up for ""self serve"" advertising after you send a contract for full service advertising, or when two people own different locations of the same account, or other really dumb things. So sometimes you will get denied compensation for a deal you rightfully closed. Yay!

The free beer was a nice perk, too.","There is very little room for growth, and opportunities are few and far between. While I enjoyed the culture, it felt very cliquey. If you are over 22, Yelp is not the right place for you. I felt tethered to my desk by my headset, and being told off (I use this term euphemistically) by auto shop owners or bakery owners was demoralizing. The on-target earnings (or ""average salary after year one"") is *not* realistic. The base is abysmal and the threshold for commission takes far longer than advertised.

To start, this is an entry level job and I would not recommend this job to anyone who thinks otherwise. Like to refer to this job as a call center dressed up as a Tech Sales job... The managers here are pretty chill but they treat it almost like a summer camp in some ways and they continually demand an unhealthy workload in terms of daily dials. You will find that retention at this job is very low and more than half of your training class will be gone by month 4 on the job. 

I think the hardest part for me was to see that Yelp doesn't invest anything into their sales force. The compensation is poor, you are tethered to your desk by a wired headset (wireless headsets should be a standard, but Yelp rather make you earn that through revenue booked). It's just sad that a company with so much negative publicity is just as ugly on the inside. I think they'd be best served to take some action."

The day-to-day job pretty much sucks but it sucks a whole lot less when you have a relaxed and fun atmosphere around you. Management here really cares about your advancement - your success is their success and their success mean Yelp succeed so they devote time to Manager Office Hours with different managers on the floor, weekly one-on-ones with your managers and the directors are extremely accessible if you ever need advice or help.","Yelp is fun, it's fast-growing and it's at the best in the industry for local business directories. Advertising on Yelp makes more logical sense then it does advertising in newspapers/magazines/mailers. The problem is it's hard to move past all of the negativity in the press and the situations that come up with reviews that business owner's can't move past. At the end of the day, I can only control who I call and what I say/show. If they google ""Yelp Advertising"" and see blogs and documentaries that say bad things and then never answer the phone to me I can't really control that. I hope they become bigger and better but they can't keep ignoring what people and business owners are saying - especially when business growth depends on it! They need to start looking into other revenue streams. Plus it just makes your job that much more difficult and sales is already the hardest job.

The day-to-day is miserable and you have to motivate yourself to move past all of the frustration and rudeness from business owners.

Super high pressure sale gig with a script to make cold calls to sell a BS product. If you were off script, or attempted to change it in any way to make it your own, management would come down pretty hard, after listening to your calls without your knowledge of course. It was a bummer to be the 2nd, 3rd even 5th person to call on an account within a quarter, a bigger bummer when you realized you were the only one still employed there. The MO is to hire kids straight out of college that don't know any better and mold them into phone calling little drones. There is also zero tolerance for mistakes, no matter how trivial, and when you're making 80-120 phone calls a day, you're going to make mistakes. There were a couple of girls in my class that broke down crying a few times, not exactly a positive work environment. 

The main point of the pitch seems to be to just ware someone down until they give in. I love the idea of helping small businesses market themselves better and communicate more effectively with their customers, but the service provided just wasn't worth the cost. Maybe that's changed now, but I find that hard to believe. If a small business is doing a good job and provided good service, there are built in benefits to Yelp that are worth every penny of free. What Yelp charges to go that little extra step just isn't worth it. 

Also, it was weird how everyone idolized Stoppelman. This was my only job in tech sales, or any part of the tech industry, but from an outside perspective, that seems to be normal. Really drives me mad to think about all the egotistical jerks chipping away at the rich culture of SF in the vain hope to one day be like this guy. He hasn't actually done anything that makes a positive contribution to society, why do people treat him like he cured cancer? 

I've since moved on to sales in a different industry and have fared pretty well. Some of the positions I've held have equaled the pressure, some have been a little easier, but nothing ever gave me cold sweats like working at Yelp."

Always challenged - Your day to day looks pretty much the same but its always a challenge. I mean cold calling is already a difficult thing to get people to do, but if you can master that, few things in the world will feel as challenging.",Its not easy - Cold calling is probably one of the least fun things you can ever do. At least in my opinion. Chances are most of these people are receiving dozens of sales calls every day and do not want to hear from you. The challenge is learning what makes you different from other sales people and being confident enough in the product that it comes across to the business owner in the first 10 seconds of a conversation.

Ask anyone with a business and they'll tell you the same thing--Yelp salespeople are a nightmare to deal with. The product? It doesn't work, folks. I felt guilty taking credit cards knowing that business owners were literally throwing their money away. Contests, competitions, all-hands meetings, beer on the 8th floor, this is all panem et circenses.

3423,Yelp,Beginning of the end for Yelp,2015-05-24,1.0,Account Executive,"- I have met some amazing people working there.  
- Yelp trained me to be an excellent sales person although I need to lose my ""scrappy"" sales technique.
-  The benefits were great, able to take time off if you produce.  
- 2014 was a great year for Yelp.","-The higher ups have no idea how to grow revenue in markets that aren't urban.  Its almost impossible to sell if outside a city and the chances of the ad program actually working are slim to none.
-  The higher ups tried splitting territories and accounts up and it was an udder disaster that probably destroyed the company.  The switched things back after only a couple of months but the damage has been done.  
-  Unless you are a top rep, you will make absolutely no money.  If you are in San Francisco or New York, new reps will actually take food from Yelp so they can eat on the weekends.  That is how horrible the pay is to the reps who are stuck in horrible territories.
-  Account Managers are completely overworked.  The turn over is huge and business owners are constantly nervous once they signed up because their point of contact ends all the time.  If you are a decent human being, you will be the Account Manager for the businesses you sign up.  This gets in the way for you to actually do your job as an AE.
-  If you are good, you have two options- manager or mid market.  I would have been a manager however the pay for new managers is embarrassing low.  Managers complain all the time that they can't afford to live in the city anymore.  They expect you to take more than a 50% pay cut to become a manager.  If you go into Mid-market, you get paid pretty much the same as local.  There is no incentive to move up as you will get paid less for doing more work.  
-  The stock is horrible and this is something they use to offset how horrible they pay their employees."

A lot of people leave at a year because it wears you down. The base salary is low, but if you are good and consistently bring in 30k+ in revenue every month for the company then the commission is good.

• The people that they hire are friendly, outgoing & have amazing personalities 
• My manager was wonderful and seemed to really care about my success with the company 
• healthcare is paid for by the company 
• Yelp Cafe (frappucino's, coffee, hot chocolate etc.) made by a barista all for free 
• Yelp kitchen - fully stocked kitchen 
• Employee outings - team building within office & activities planned outside of office 
• Met & spoke with the CEO, he's a great guy that obviously cares about the company, however there is room for reform","The pay is horrendous & the actual work is awful!!
It was a shame I had to leave but I resigned before I had another opportunity lined up because the job was so awful. 
First I'll speak about the pay, there isn't much to say except $35,000 a year is not enough live on in Chicago. The offices are downtown - do they expect all of their employees to have an hour commute and live in the suburbs. I stay downtown but let me tell you after paying rent I had very little extra funds. They tell you that your first year you are expected to make 45-50k and that is just NOT the case and I will tell you why. Now, let me move on to why the job is awful.
It is simply cold calling sales. You make 90-100 dials a day and you are supposed to be speaking with small business owners but very rarely do you get in touch with them. The metrics are 2 hours of talk time, 65+ dials a day and 3 appointments. Those metrics are impossible to meet because no one wants to talk to you, you keep getting hung up on by hostesses and business owners (in the unlikely event that you get one on the phone). Therefore the only metric you are able to easily hit is the dials. If you don't not schedule any appointments to show business owners the product then you obviously will not close a deal so, you won't make commission. To make commission you have to make $30,000+ for the company every month. The whole process is completely unrealistic and I feel as if you are set up for failure as an AE. 
•There also isn't a lot of career opportunity or choices. Neither you're in inside sales or you're a manager - that's it."
3435,Yelp,Account Executive at Yelp Dublin - (Uncensored),2015-05-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Survive long enough and you will be ready to sell sand in the desert, sales are tough to get, pressure is high but this will help you become a much better sales professional. Probably one of the best places to be if you want to become a sales wolf!

- Cool young party environment, Erasmus style office with nice people from all around the world. Happy hours, ping pong and music always on.

- The food!! Its awesome and there is plenty!!!","- No career opportunities, no matter how veteran. Most veterans and top sellers left because of that, so basically, if you are good enough to survive and become a veteran you will end up leaving due to lack of growth opportunities (both vertical and horizontal).

- If you are not good selling you will not become a veteran... Here's a fun fact: People get fired from one day to another and are not even allowed to say goodbye to their colleagues. You come in the morning, eating your cereal, manager taps you in the shoulder and tells you to pack up your stuff and leave quietly. On the bright side, thats what sales is all about, you sell well, you will make money and be save, if you don't find something else

- (The Pro about the food was actually sarcasm... sorry!)

- Don't dare to arrive 5 minutes late in the morning even if you were working until late in the night  yesterday. After all its a sales job and hours count much more than final revenue results... ein? By the way, if you want to hit your targets better get confortable as you will quite likely be making extra hours.

Management does not seem to be adequately trained - very much a 'boss' environment where you are told what to do, rather than coached/developed/given credit.

They have an upbeat culture to distract you from that fact. The culture is a little distracting sometimes. It's hard to hear the advertiser yelling at you on the phone while hip-hop music is blaring and your manager hula hoops by on a razor scooter (seriously). Yelp talks about how it's growing - which is true. But it's all lateral growth. They are adding more sales and AMs, NOT more managers and other fun roles. The wait list to even transfer to another office, same role, is years long. The people that are in the non-call center jobs have been there 7+ years and are not leaving (and why would they? With paid trips to Mexico, telecommuting opportunities, and bonuses?!). 

Yelp used to have much more integrity than it does now. It caters too much to the needs (complaints) of the paid advertisers than the reviewers, which is sad and part of the reason I left.

3486,Yelp,Fun while it lasted (engineering position),2015-02-20,4.0,Front End Engineer,"I worked at Yelp for several years, and will always miss the people. Yelp felt very family-like: friendly and open-minded folks, good communication throughout. These are folks you would want to hang out with on the weekends like BFFs. In fact, I might be spoiled by them; I now expect the same kind of warmth and friendliness from future employers and colleagues.

Good supply of snacks and drinks. The current office (140 New Montgomery) is beautifully done, though might be a little too spread-out for some areas.

Average compensation, though the benefits (401k, health insurance) are pretty average.

From the engineering side, the codebase is so old and badly written in many places, that, depending on what team you're on and the kind of challenges you fancy, this can be a godsend (you love fixing things), or a curse (you love new stuff).

I might have a long list of cons below, but I still would recommend Yelp.","I feel like Yelp may be over-reaching on their core values. They have a vision, for sure, but it's a very broad vision, and not very focused. The higher-ups tend to wear rose-colored glasses when discussing company statistics. I wish they were a little more humble and frank.

Also, at times the company seems risk-averse. Expanding to other countries: no problem. Delivering a better user experience: jump through bureaucratic hurdles. Certain projects can takes years of planning and back-and-forth because they really don't want to lose users or revenue, however small that may be, and/or managers keep leaving. Innovation takes a back-seat.

Previously, I mentioned the codebase. It's... so ugly that implementing innovative features is an absolute chore. Deploying code is done serially through a person rather than an automated parallel system, which became a HUGE bottleneck when the engineering department grew astronomically in the past couple of years.

Lastly, growth. The company is growing fast, and not really in a good way. I can only speak for the engineering department, and it grew a LOT during my time there. Unfortunately, the industry-experts:new-grads ratio is very low. As a result, you'll get one-year Yelp employees mentoring new hires, and sometimes, a one-year employee ends up as manager. Not that that employee doesn't deserve it, but there are still two- and three-year folks around, and they get passed over."

Household name may look good on resume.
Great training program for cold-call sales.
Promote from within.
Transparency.
Fun young environment.

Management is young and inexperienced.
Starting salary is horrible.

Insanely high turnover.
You're only as good as your last sale.
Glorified telemarketing job.

So, this place is amazing if you truly have a passion for cold-call sales. But if not, stay away (unless you need a good name on the resume for leverage). The job entails finding leads on SalesForce and literally calling them out of the blue, setting appointments with the business owners, and pitching them on why they should give your their money to advertise on Yelp. Expectations per day are about 80 calls, 2 hours of talk time, and 1-2 pitches. The ""pitching"" part is honestly pretty fun but getting there is hard and 90% of the job will always be making open cold-calls, which in my opinion is too monotonous for me. Promotions are given when you reach a certain amount of sales, however despite pay raises the actual job never really changes nor do you assume any more responsibility. You just receive a different title to put on your resume. Although, you can decide to go into management over time and manage a team or move into selling mid-market and national brands, but like I said it still all involves cold-calling for the majority of the job. This reason for me is a deal breaker because if I'm not planning to stay here forever (or work as a cold-calling salesman forever, which I'm not) the only thing I can really say I've gotten good at is cold-call sales which really isn't that valuable of a skill to me. However, If you do really like this type of sales than the opportunity to make a lot of money is great if you become really good, and by really good I mean within top 10% of your hire-class. The other 90% either quit or get fired within the 1st year so enter at your own risk. Starting salary is 36K. The average employee becomes available to earn commission on top of that after about 6 months. Commission is uncapped and the top performers (about 10% of the people who are left) are making 6 figures within their 2nd - 3rd year on the job. Extremely rare but people do it."

What yelp stands for is what's wrong in the world. I'm sorry but a review from years ago should not be relevant, and the fact they can't upgrade the ""algorithm"" is BS.

Even when I close a deal I cant get excited because i am too busy wondering when they will call me back to cancel. Dont believe any of the reviews recently posted. They are fake. The New York office has is a miserable place. The managers don't care because even the worst managers never get fired anyway. Its the perfect position to come to die. A girl on my team quit already and i know three others who want to find another job by mid January. They are afraid that it will get to a point where Yelp is poison on a resume. I feel the same way.

Fun team offsite events and happy hours.","Base salaries are shockingly low for San Francisco - with the rent prices in the area it really is an unrealistic starting point. However, with different promotions and incremental base salary increases it gets better over time. Commission is great but with territory swaps etc, sales can be very up and down and unpredictable. I still feel like I work harder and am more stressed out than the majority of my friends with a similar education and background - but make about 20k less. For me it's not worth it. There is extremely high turn over and you will see some great people go. It is super easy to get burnt out. It doesn't seem to matter what you do for the company one month you can overproduce by 400% but the next month if you don't hit quota it's as if they forget everything right you have ever done. The product is pricey and sales tactics that are encouraged are pretty intense. They claim to be transparent but when it comes down to hard facts they give you vague answers with a healthy dose of kool aid. It is very hard to sell impression based ad programs in a cost per click ad world, which I did for over a year and did not believe in the product.  However, we did recently release a cost per click ad program that is a huge stride forward, but still has some big flaws. You will get yelled at, and you will get hung up on. If you want to survive here you need to be ready to make 60 - 80 cold calls a day, talk to people who absolutely hate Yelp and therefore take it out on you,  and have a completely resilient personality. The reality is that people wait to hit their year mark so they can put it on their resume and then they run like a bat out of hell. I was there for a year and a half. Out of my starting class of 45 people, I think only 6 or so of us were left. With a 13% retention rate, I think you get the idea.

It was like a coed fraternity that took themselves far too seriously. They try to brainwash you into thinking working there was the best thing that every happened to you."

3534,Yelp,Best Part - Amazing Benefits,2014-11-16,3.0,Account Manager,"100% employer paid health benefits, snacks and drinks in kitchens. Quarterly company off-sites as well as team off-sites.  Co-workers become your close friends.",Young and inexperienced management.  Lots of politics and games.  Must drink the 'kool-aid' to be approved of by the higher ups and to advance.
3535,Yelp,Account Executive Job Sucked,2014-11-12,1.0,Junior Account Executive,Having a kitchen with cliff bars and coffee is nice Benefits are paid for. Young work force that can be fun to hang out with,"The office feels like a giant call center filled with hundreds of people dialing the same leads over and over again and constantly being told by businesses to stop calling. The job can get old fast because there is only one task. Managers are promoted from the AE positions which helps reward top sellers, but the managers aren't qualified to be managers. The pay structure is designed to begin rewarding you about the same time you are burned out. Not much care is given to individuals because of the high volume of employees and new hires. I relocated for the position and immediately regretted it"
3536,Yelp,Best entry-level Job you can ask for,2014-11-06,4.0,Account Executive,"From edgy start-up to one of the coolest companies in tech, Yelp is owning the local search scene around the world making the job WAY easier as time went on - the product/company had a lot more name recognition by the time I left compared to when I started.  Culture is awesome, people are awesome, beers are on tap, kitchens stocked with food (not just snacks, you can literally eat breakfast and lunch there), and everyone generally wants to succeed and have a good time.  It's hard not to get into it, especially considering you're selling an app that's actually pretty fun and was originally geared toward interesting people who go out a lot.  The difference is that people (biz owners and consumers) have a real need for this kinda stuff, so I always felt great about selling it.","The company is growing aggressively - from just a couple floors when I started to 4 additional floors and a brand new office waiting to get moved into by the time I left, the place definitely churns people in and out.  Not necessarily a bad thing but they may want to slow the growth down a bit and concentrate on hiring stellar reps who retain the company culture instead of a bunch of mass hires and clueless drones walking around."
3537,Yelp,Great environment! Positivity makes the job!,2014-10-30,4.0,Account Executive,Amazing onboarding training! Almost like youre back in college.  They really make it so you can not fail.  This is definitely worth the risk of hating a desk job.  The positive energy helps you everyday.  trust the process!,"It is a cold calling job.  So you will get down almost everyday, but you gotta pick yourself back up, dont let the negative energy hit you through the phone.  keep going, and trust the process"
3538,Yelp,Glorified aggressive telemarketing and harassment of small business owners,2014-10-24,3.0,Account Executive,"Benefits are great, cafe and loaded kitchen on site, great parties and perks.","The territory distribution system, racists, and frat boy mentality among managers. On a floor of 70+ sales people only two were African American until one was fired during training although he was selling well. Favoritism and being very flirty will get you a good territory. Unfortunately, the territories you get have all been worked to death and the business owners will be so annoyed they will literally threaten you. You will be harassing the same people over and over despite them not being able to buy due to economic reason- for example, a few businesses I was calling went out of business and I was still forced to call them up until they closed their doors and in the meantime I lost on other good leads- well actually, their inventory is no organized and they bought many fake listings that show up on your pipeline. You will literally call everyone who has ever has a yelp page and harass them until they buy. My territories were very strange- one was a total loss, a very very poor area (well known through out, actually a skid row) and the other was a bit better, and I made large sales there. It really doesn't take much talent as they would have you think to make sales- IF you get a healthy territory with inventory then you'll make sales easily. The problem is inventory is NOT always available and combined with a horrible territory and 60+ closed/fake businesses in your pipeline you are doomed. You will burn out quickly unless you are making target every month. Sounds like a great job and it can be, but it is in no way creative and you literally do the same thing every day. Every day. One of the WORST jobs I've had to endure. The HR lady Taylor really sold me on the job. I am very grateful to have gone through their training which WAS fantastic but has since changed to cycle through sales reps more quickly."
3539,Yelp,Really enjoyed my experience,2014-10-21,4.0,Account Executive,"There was a lot of good work- life balance. I really enjoyed my team and manager. The benefits were amazing. Becoming a manager is a good way to go here at Yelp. The managers get a good work life balance. The role itself kinda sucks, but the people and the company itself is going to be just fine.","Compensation, The ramp up plan sometimes takes a long time. The recruiters should set better expectations instead of telling everyone how easy it is to make 100k. It is possible but highly unlikely in your first year which is what they tell us."
3540,Yelp,Love it if you're a competitive sales beast,2014-10-14,4.0,Elite Account Executive,"Working at Yelp is amazing for the culture and the people. You are selling a product that is (for the most part) nationally recognized in a highly competitive sales atmosphere. If you thrive in a fast paced, high volume cold calling, commission heavy sales structure, Yelp is for you!","Mid level management can sometimes be inexperienced, need to work on a more efficient commission structure, big business culture encroaching what used to be a 'start-up' feel office environment. If you are not a top performer (at least 150% of quota monthly) you will not make a lot of money."

The company has a fun culture and the office is a place that you wouldn't mind being in everyday.",If you think you will be doing anything but making cold calls all day then you have been misinformed about this position. You're success doesn't depend on how great of a sales person you are but it depends on your territory.

3543,Yelp,Difficult but rewarding.,2014-10-08,4.0,,"Really great training. Amazing people, and getting a sale is absolutely exhilerating. This job teaches you how to speak with a wide variety of people from very different walks of life. It also helps you build a thicker skin. I came in being a pretty sensitive person, I often took things personally if people were angry or upset. Now I feel so much more confident in myself and my ability to find the root of a problem and build from there.","It is a lot of cold calling, you get hung up on a lot and people are not always happy to hear from you. It can be a little daunting some days but that goes back to what I said about learning how to let little things go. The business owners aren't mad at you, they get hundreds of calls a day, and are usually passionate about what they do. So yeah, you get people who might say something mean, or harsh, but it is what it is. You can't please everyone."

Very easy to meet people and actually have fun when you aren't talking to angry business owners","it's ultimately a glorified call center, you are making calls ALL day every day to set appointments with decision makers to pitch the advertising program. It's not a bad thing if you don't mind making cold calls and can stay motivated day after day of the same thing. No overtime even though sometimes your manager expects you to be working thru lunch/after hours if you aren't at your quota

Business owners and the public at large consider Yelp a ""bully"" who forces the businesses on the site to advertise.  Can make sales difficult.

The fun environment is lipstick on a pig. Repetitive cold calling on a small number of businesses wears heavily on the employees. Dress it up all you like, the job is mundane and the pay is low. 

 AE's are given a finite number of workable leads. Regions to call on are small and to start are handed out randomly.

Starting base is low-38k.

Management is young and inexperienced. Has a ""lord of the flies"" feel.

Sales team is mostly young and keen on office gossip. High school in an office setting."

Few people came from the same previous company-- or even the same industry, college, or major. This brings a lot of perspectives to the worktable and makes your water cooler conversations all the more interesting. The flat hierarchy of our work culture means everyone's ideas are heard and valued, and the team spirit of the organization is unrivaled. I also really respect the mission-driven aspects of the business-- our mission drives every business decision, and that's clear from the choices our facilities makes about being located in the middle of downtown SF (near tons of local businesses) to the engineering org's feature rollouts. The lean business model (in terms of perks and comp) can be a pro and a con, but I appreciate seeing that no dollar is wasted here (at least in the perks part).","Compensation for some roles isn't top of market, but is still fair and they hired a comp analyst to make adjustments moving forward (benefits of a growing company). Time off policy is lean but fair, though I wish for applicable teams there was more flexibility to work from home for those days when you're sick enough not to want to spread it around but not so sick you can't work at all. It's also unfortunate that the company hires a lot of immature people (particularly in sales, where they just need an army on the phone) who make mistakes that impact the whole company's perks and regulations (like beer privileges being limited after several people got drunk at work...Get it together, people!)."

-Digital Plantation. Managers walk around and make sure you're always on the phone. Unrealistic metrics expectations- 80+ calls, 2.5 hours on the phone, 5 appts and 3 pitches per day.
- Selling product that doesn't work for lots of businesses- loses people money.
-You're constantly being sold on how awesome your job is and how lucky you are by management when in reality everyone there is miserable. Feels like brainwashing. Something is just really off about this place.
-Crazy turnover. 50 people are being brought in and leaving every month. They take recent grads who have to move into expensive New York City and rent apartments when they know the chances are most won't even last a year.

Calling system should be vertical based not territory based. 

Territory distribution is not fair and allows some people to achieve success substantially easier than others.

The Job becomes a grind when the ""new job shine"" wears off and you are stuck making 70+ calls a day to many people who hate Yelp because it ruined their business in some way."

3600,Yelp,Fun atmosphere- grind of a job.,2014-05-06,5.0,Account Executive,"Team atmosphere. Support for closing, pushing from front or behind. If you're lucky, a good manager, who is more so at your level rather than looking down on you. Their training program is great.. They teach you what you need to do to succeed... That being said you need to be a person fit for sales to succeed at what they teach you. But their training is great, and helped prepare me for my next job in sales. The sf office is beautiful, uniquely designed with a touch of soma and modern feel. They have lots of free food, beer, and team offsites which are a plus. It's a great place to party... Not a great place to grow your career.","The job. Please read this before you work there. You are selling advertising to small business owners. Can I say that again... Small business owners. Advertising. They don't mix. 350-2000/month is very expensive for some of these businesses, and you will feel guilty sometimes at the time of close. There are constant emotions coming from both sides. On top of that, a lot of business owners think yelp extorts them and tries to tamper their page if they don't advertise (even though they don't).. So you can call someone and they will literally scream at you for 20 minutes calling you an extortionist and yelling profanities. All I have to say is.. I didn't go to college for that, and I can't deal with that everyday. They also pay a sad base salary (36k) and their commission structure is not really that profitable compared to other entry level or close to sales jobs. I also didn't like that if there was bad press or a genuinely frustrated customer or prospect, we had to act as though we knew nothing. We should be trusted advisors, not sales people. 

Last- they use this new word of the decade 'transparent'... Well, they aren't. All meetings happen behind closed doors, you see someone go in with their manager and director, something is up and everyone knows it. I lived in fear for months."

We would play catchphrase in the afternoons to get pumped up for getting back on the phones. Managers really seem to care about your success and work hard to help you improve. The starting salary and full benefits are great for recent grads.

Stocked kitchen - but expect to gain a lot of weight from the food too.
Nice employees - while you're new to the game. Don't get me wrong I have made some great friends that will be with me for some time. But majority of the employees are between the age of 21 and 28. 
Parties/kegs in the office - Although they try to create fun events for holidays and to keep employees happy you will shortly realize it's because roughly 90 percent of their employees are stressed every day and miserable more often than happy at the job.","You have a 20,000 quota every month and the turn over rate is insane. They hire around 30 employees each month and after my first year there it was down to 8. They fire and have people quit. 
Poor management. I will say that occasionally there are some very kind authority figures.. but some of the main ones that have ultimate power over who stays and who goes are hypocrits.  I feel bad saying it but at the same time I want to be honest to future job lookers, and just understand that if you are able to deal with some messed up managers then go ahead and good luck. Some managers party and secretly date their employees.  There is so much that goes on behind closed doors and at times you will feel like you are back in college. The last thing I want to say is that as much as it doesn't sound like it I love yelp. The job itself and the lack of professional management is twisted and down right wrong.  I understand they like to promote within but for authority and managerial roles they should look to hire unbiased and more respected figures."

Can wear whatever you want. Free Red Bull (and a bunch of other refreshments.",Barging. Some managers try to have a full on conversation with you through your headset while you are trying to talk to a customer. It's very distracting and confusing. I get the benefits of a manger being able to give you pointers during a call but it should be kept short so that whatever they're telling you is still relevant once they've finished talking. I put a customer on mute to tell my manager that I wasn't able to hear what the customer was saying and I got fired an hour later.

There are a lot of rewards and perks to working here, some of which may have changed over the years, but they definitely reward you for putting in the work. The amount of money you can make here with sales can be ridiculous.","But sales is the hard part. In my experience, this is where things were tricky and not the same for everyone. Yes, there are all different types of people, selling styles and techniques - but what i found to be the hardest was the luck-of-the-draw there was with territories in which you sold into. Over my two-year career, this was the major up-and-down factor in my success or failure. This is where some people make it big, or get fired. Sometimes, you don't have to even be a good sales person, just have to get a good territory. 

Another small con, in my eyes, it is a very young and relaxed crowd and there aren't too many rules. With that, it seemed a lot of rules were bent or broken making it unfair or even uncomfortable to others."

I was an Account manager prior to working here for a well known media company. I was under the impression I was going to be doing the SAME EXACT THING but just at Yelp with more opportunity. I came in on the first day to a ""class"" of about 50 kids under 25 years old, fresh out of college. Some were even given incentives to relocate. Since I quit, only about 5 of those kids are still currently employed by Yelp. All the others either gave up or were fired. 

The benefits are good, zero career opportunity, absolutely NO work/life balance (I was calling into another time zone.. I had to stay late almost every night!) and the only culture 7 values of yelp is being a hipster. Worst place ever."

I guess it's the least they can do for the minimum wage salaries.,"From the very first day I started I kept my resume posted online and actively networked with recruiters for any opportunities that came alone.  Every single one of them told me to remove every reference to Yelp from my resume.  Every recruiter had been told by the HR teams they worked with to never forward any resume from anyone who had ever worked for Yelp because of their lack or real business experience, lack of professionalism, and lack of legitimate skills.

Yelp only hires people with very limited or no experience so they have nothing to compare it to.  The company has an extremely bad reputation with businesses both big and small. You will not make your goals. It's a mill that just uses people for sub par wages.  It eats them up and spits them out.  Ask yourself why they have such massive and perpetual turnover and that says it all.  It's just a bad company.  The people that think it's great are clueless hipsters who are so blindly ignorant that they cannot see for themselves they are working for a failed company.

-Cool company
-Fun to be part of a startup
-Free food & beer
-Stock options made me some $ when I quit, but I don't know if they still give options given they are public now","*This is just for Acct Executive position, I'm sure it'd be awesome to be NOT in sales in this company*

-Your success depends on what territory you are randomly assigned in training, though they will try to convince you otherwise. When it comes time to switch territories, only those who succeeded in their first territories (i.e, southern cali) will get the even better territories, justified by ""We want to give our best territories to our best reps"" and you will be stuck in a countless cycle of shitty territories and constant fear of not hitting quota. I saw reps who were taken out of their golden territories for whatever reason and failed once in a normal territory. Someone who won ""the bleeder"" - top rep in the office for a month - got changed into a different territory and they were fired 2 months later for low performance - HA! 

-Cold calling sucks, you will get yelled at, cursed at, hung up on, etc. Either that or business owners will use you as customer service and string you along and then you'll end up never hearing from them again/chasing them. 

-Feeling of guilt after selling business owners advertising they do not really need

-If you sell a ton of packages and get commission for them, if that client cancels you get ""chargebacks"" and will end up owing the company money

-No variety in what you sell, it's the same pitch, same phone call, over and over and over again...hard selling and not consultative selling, so you feel like you are just out to get people's money no matter if you really believe the ad product will help their product or not. 

-Have the same exact quota no matter where your territory is geographically - 20k quota for San Francisco, CA territory and 20k quota for a random county in Arkansas - fair? No. 

- If you miss quota you will get put on a ""performance plan"" with 1-2 weeks notice that if you do not hit a certain number within that period of time you are fired. 

-New classes of 30+ people are  hired each month, and around that same amount are fired or quit. 

- they say that they pay you salary, but that is a lie. They make you fill out a sheet each week that says how manY HOURS you worked for that week. If it says you worked more than 40 hours you will get in a lot of trouble as legally they will need to pay you overtime, so you either have to ""ask for permission"" from your manager to work more than 40 hours (which they will never agree to) or you have to lie on your worksheet, which every single person I knew did, because everyone works at least 45-50 hrs a week. Which means you are not getting paid for the hours you put in and forced to lie. PS if you think I am making this part up, just wait! :) On your paycheck it actually even has your ""hourly rate. ""

-VERY hard to move your career forward. You will always be a salesperson if you start in sales. Their ""promotions"" (Associate Acct Exec, Junior AE, AE, Senior AE, Elite) are all the exact same job, just your base salary increases a bit each time and at junior AE you start to be able to make commission. It is VERY hard to move into a different department. You can possibly be a manager at some point after hitting AE but that is very hard to do/competitive and you are still in sales. 

- you will have to watch inexperienced, younger, less talented people you started orientation with or a rookie make tons of money right next to you if they are assigned a good territory, while you are stuck not even making commission on a 33k ""salary"". Not motivating at all, just makes you search for a new job.

3677,Yelp,Working at Yelp UK,2013-06-04,1.0,Account Executive,"I worked at Yelp for about 7 months. It was incredibly exciting in the beginning. Yelp was just starting out in the UK and the atmosphere was great. 
You got:
- excellent training.
- fun, young colleagues
- free food, the beer keg!","However, all the free bagels and hummus could not make me work there again.
What initially started out as an exciting and rewarding experience soon turned into a bit off a nightmare.

It is essentially a telephone sales role. How you do depends on the territory you get so if you luck out on this it all goes down hill.

You work with great people who tend to disappear one by one. Initially they were fired for not meeting expectations (at this point quite unrealistic sales expectation as Yelp was a new product in the UK that no one had heard of) but eventually we started leaving in droves. Some of my friends left without even having another job to go to they were so desperate. It became taboo to talk about those who had left so many a lunchtime conversation was spoken in hushed tones.

The reason: THE PRESSURE! so much pressure, the managers would walk up and down the office making announcements about how if we didn't make a deal in the next hour we should just pack up and leave. Constant threats of being fired means that there's this atmosphere of panic and just downright depression."

Engineers are self-directed and management is horizontal.  Engineers are friendly, have a strong sense of humor, and are happy.  The company thoroughly has faith in that you're self-driven and will get your stuff done.  This is a big gamble since some engineers may take advantage of this, but from my experience most engineers still work hard and are dedicated to the success of the company.  They're liberal in terms of working from home and coming in whenever you want to.  

There are unique opportunities available in specific areas as this company continues to grow rapidly, especially for engineers interested in search, spam detecting, machine learning, and data mining.","The awkward division between sales and engineering which is obvious by reading other reviews.  The culture and goals of each are completely different.  They might as well be two companies.  None of this gets explained to you.

Yelp is a sad place for designers or design-minded folk, at least for the time being.  Yelp hires very few real designers and leaves most design work to product managers, who typically only have a technical background.  

Being a public company forces product to give priority to short term revenue over building a great products.  For example, banner ads are all over the site, and many of these ads are not only ugly but directly contradict Yelp's mission of connecting people with local businesses (e.g. Taco Bell).

In many ways Yelp is very corporate, as much as they would hate to admit it.  Terribly inefficient workflows and outdated internal tools are maintained despite constant griping.  Important decisions often go unquestioned.  Quality is not job one.  The politics of priority or ""MVP"" prevent good ideas from even seeing the light of day."

They are very strict with you having to be on the phones 3+ hours and making a certain number of appointments and pitches. It's ridiculous. They have a program that monitors how long you have been on the phones so even if its noon and you think you've been on the phones awhile, it could only turn out to be 40 mins in reality.

The nonstop cold calling, getting hung up on by rude people, being yelled at for not being on the phones more than 2 hours daily, is what ultimately made me quit. I haven't looked back and I'm much happier!"

- Great people. I honestly look forward to coming to work to see my colleagues. 
- Great good training. 
- Fun perks like a snack kitchen, a gym subsidy, and team offsites. (AT&T Park?!)
- You can make a ton of money on commission if you are good at the job. 
- All promotions are 100% merit based. If you do will, you will be promoted, if you don't, you won't. Simple and fair. 
- You are not expected or encouraged to work crazy hours. Everyone works hard all day from 8-5 but this job does not involve crazy hours. 
- Casual dress.",- It's a sales job that you have to try at to be good at. This is not a job you can just show up for and succeed with. You have to put in 100% every day. Cold calling isn't easy and it isn't for everyone.

Free food and fun work environment. Casual dress is a huge plus. Flexibility in schedule and you don't feel like your micro-managed.",You also work with a lot of people who think they're still in HS or college. There are a ton of cliques. Don't get brainwashed and drink out of the Yelp kool-aid. I worked 60 hour work weeks without being compensated for it. They discourage working over-time but will look the other way because they know you have to. Work here for a year and get out.

-Good benefits","*This is a  telemarketing position, not an Account Executive position. You are making 80+ phone calls, talking for 3.5-4 hours of actual talk time, setting 5+ appointments, and pitching 2-4 businesses a day. You're not doing anything else. This classifies as a telemarketer, I'm sorry! When someone leaves their job for this ""opportunity"" it should be made very clear. If you don't do the previously mentioned metrics then you are made to feel like a failure. Sometimes you just may be on the phone with a really good lead who might take longer to talk then others! It happens! Although there are some good managers here, most are poorly trained and this is their ONLY experience with ad sales for the most part. You read straight from a script and management doesn't like when you ask why you are being told to say something. They barge your calls and will tell you what to say even if it's not how you prefer to talk to someone. You feel like your job is very fragile here and fear you may be fired if you're having a bad week/month. In few months of employment here, I've witnessed about 5-10 people get fired or quit. 

*Another thing that was bothersome was the lack of diversity here. With a New York office employing a lot of people, this shouldn't be an issue. They talk about the ""culture"" of Yelp all the time. This culture is a mixture if mostly white, young, hipsters. HR even made a few comments how we are a company of mostly young people so that's why the benefits are so good. Being in my mid to late 20s I should NOT feel like an old soul here! Why not add some diversity into this mix? It would only benefit the company to have different people with different life experiences."

Someone in BFE North Dakota is supposed to hit the same quota as someone with LA?! Makes no sense. Feels like management tells one person one thing and another person another thing for feedback. Not consistent. It's all a political game run by people who may never have worked in sales before. Young company that needs to grow up.

- No technical skills are developed in this job
- Once you are in sales, you pretty much stay here
- Lack of job security (they are hiring so many people, because so many others are being fired)
- Extremely low salary (in NYC you can barely make it by with this salary), which is why I said do NOT take this as a first job out of college
- Culture can be too hype sometimes

There are only 5 conversations that you really have with the advertisers and it can get old explaining the same thing seven different ways to the 700 accounts that you are responsible for. People can be petty and immature at times so that can lead to frustrations.

You must sell a certain amount in your first territory to get a new (better) one.

-One week you could do great, then the next you could do awfull, and the awfull week still completley over shadows the great one and that can be stressful

-Since it's cold calling, the work hard and get rewarded statement doesn't always even out. It's a guessing game of who wants to talk to you and when. Also some people can be really rude

-You basically sit at a big desk with your co workers, so everyone around you can hear you at all times. That in itself isn't bad because everyone is helpful and encouraging, but when you DO want privacy (or shelter from the loud office) you can't find it

+","- Cold calling...it has its ups and downs. It's cold calling. It can be a grind. 
- If you start in sales it's pretty impossible to move laterally...so you'll always be in sales 
- You're supposed to work 40 hours, but your managers and directors have a way of expecting you to work more than that and not get OT, some could equate this to just working hard but it is stressful and makes it harder to have a work/life balance 
- Your quota isn't adjusted for time off...it's hard to get your manager to approve PTO or feel job security when you take time off and aren't at your quota 
- Yelp is a quickly growing company so that means things are constantly changing...this can be good, but it means perks can be taken away even after you already earned them like laptops, jackets, wireless technology....nothing done to compensate for this 
- A lot of your success can be contingent upon the territory you are assigned at random of your first day. A very talented rep can call into a podunk city in the midwest and barely hit their quota, while a very shoddy rep can call into LA and hit their targets, continue to advance and be assigned additional and better territories. Vicious cycle. Easily worst flaw with the AE job. 
- Benefits do not include a matching 401k...why? 
- You can have loyalty to the company with 3 years on your belt and be put on a performance plan to be fired after 1 or 2 months of missing your quota...that's just bad for morale. 
- Job security, not so much. A very common theme among AEs is being terrified of losing their jobs for missing quota
- New training classes with incredibly aggressive hiring plans for 50 new AEs every single month in the office...doesn't boost morale or make AEs feel valued.


OVERALL, Yelp is a great company to work for and even if you only last a couple months doing sales calls, it's worth it for the experience. There is earning potential and whether you just graduated or have a seasoned sales background I'd recommend giving it a shot as long as you're comfortable with 8 hours in front of a computer and on the phone."

- Very basic introduction to online advertising

- Lack of transparency about product updates. Yelp gave employees sneak peeks into new products while simultaneously releasing new ones without telling the sales org, making it very unprofessional when a client brings up these new products and we have no idea what they're talking about
- Even though the company is expanding, opportunities for advancement are limited - most people will have to relocate to Phoenix office if they want a promotion.

I was told when I interviewed that turnover rate was very low and I was a little disappointed when I saw what the truth was.

They have great ""inside"" numbers and stats that could be told to potential customers but because legal hasn't approved them you can't use them. They could make the selling process a lot easier if they focused on being able to give tangible numbers to potential clients rather than abstract facts and careful wording. 

Long hours to get ready for the upcoming day (I think this has changed because right when I left they implemented a strict 40 hour week maximum... don't know how it will be possible for future classes because my classmates and I were in the office from 8 AM to 9PM several times in the first few weeks).

I don't care if my friends or peers are swearing around me, but trying to talk to potential clients with songs some would find degrading/demeaning/inappropriate just wasn't professional in my opinion.

Loud office in general. Every time someone makes a sale you get to ring the ""gong"" and everyone claps and cheers. Clients on the phone don't know what the heck just happened and it makes you seem less professional.

Management has no problem with swearing. Again, I know I am a more conservative guy when it comes to this but it just goes back to professionalism. When you hear the CEO saying ""F*** yeah""  it just makes him seem immature in my opinion. I just felt like I was at another frat party when I was working there and I wish it was slightly more professional. Not a huge deal, but it did rub me the wrong way.

Overall the big disappointment was that I was dissatisfied with the lack of emphasis on customer service. I was ultimately fired because during the training period I did not bring in a sale (fired just a few days before training ended). This was not a surprise and my manager and I had been talking a lot throughout the whole process so things ended well. In my defense, I wish they gave me a few more days because I had 3 clients who were practically on board (again, I have no hard feelings). Ultimately it just wasn't a good fit for me and both my manager and I saw this. They offered a mild severance package which I thought was extremely generous given the nature of the position. 

Would I recommend working here? Well, I think if you have the personality for it then go for it. This company is going to be on the map in a HUGE way 5 years from now so if you have 2 years of this company on your resume, I think it is going to be powerful. But for me, just a little too unprofessional and they wanted me to change who I was... I like who I am, and the company I am working for now likes who I am too :)."
