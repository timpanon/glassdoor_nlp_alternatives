14,Yext,No transparency whatsoever!,2022-03-21,1.0,Platform Manager,"The office was pretty nice. Very laid-back and chill people. Depends on the role, but this specific role made by WLB so much better.","Where to begin? There is a huge gap between how this role is marketed vs. the reality of the role. The interviewers did a really good job not mentioning words such as tickets, support, and escalations. I, just like many people, I found out a few days into the role that we were somewhat ""lied to"" and found ourselves upset. This is why this role has a huge retention problem. They will say anything to gain quality talents (ex. former Big 4, IB, S&T), but all of them end up leaving for obvious reasons. If you think this role is a good stepping stone towards product or solutions, do not bother applying here. 

Lastly, there is also a huge inconsistency and lack of transparency in pay and promotion cycle as well. Those who fit into the ""vibe"" def see more benefit than all the others. It felt pretty toxic and cliquey, and goes to show that having a title of manager or above do not really mean anything here since anyone who is ""cool"" will get promoted.

Lastly, I do not have much hope for the future of the company as the CEO and the CFO resigned unexpectedly a few weeks ago - pretty clear that they were pushed out."

The company operates like a startup, but is way too large. systemic disorganization is the number one thing holding Yext back from being hugely successful. processes around decision making, data and information, and forward planning need work. Meetings always run late or don’t happen half of the time. Group-wide priorities change by the hour. a very meeting heavy culture.

Their NYC HQ is sick if you are up for fully working from an office","The territories make or break you. The company is pivoting fairly unsuccessfully towards a new product that could be really cool, but the GTM strategy isn't great yet. I assume most of the bigger clients in tech are friends of the CEO doing him a favor by signing up. You need the old products to hit number and only 2-3 of 50 reps in MM hit in 2020 (all based on 1 or 2 big lucky deals). Now in 2021, attrition is higher than ever since no one can make any money.

Huge thing to note as you interview is that everyone in sales is required to come back into the office full time, no real exceptions. 

I think right now is a bit of a bumpy road for Yext sellers, as your amount of effort or skill will not determine your success at Yext. It's all about favoritism (as you'll get extra territory if someone leaves) and playing into the bureaucracy of a metric/appearance-focused org"

- Workplace culture (later hours, mainly stock-based comp, many manual processes that were labor intensive, stocked booze cart and seamless benefits) created a place that people had issues checking out from, and the ""unlimited flex"" PTO for employees meant that employees with a book of business were pressured to not take time off. it was very unhealthy

-Technology is genuinely very cutting edge - Answers is fantastic and poised to take over an untapped section of the marketplace, especially in the wake of digitization brought on by the pandemic
-Upper management initially seems to be very understanding of the implications of the pandemic from a sales perspective (notice I said UPPER. Middle management doesn't give a care to what's going on in the world - even if there's an actual coup at the Capitol, you'd better be making your 30 dials!)
-Compensation is decent and benefits are standard","Yext, I wanted to like you so badly. They do a fantastic job during the interview process of getting people completely bought into the vision, dangle the promise of a shiny new NYC headquarters, stock options, etc....which of course depends that you stay with the company once the pandemic is over. However, once you're in seat, the sales culture rears its ugly head. 

Like other reviews have said, the CBU is a nonstop firehose of belittlement, fear management, unattainable quotas (that keep going up even though the vast majority of reps are nowhere close to hitting them) measured by months...nay, WEEKS, to the end effect that if you don't have something to speak about closing within the next 5 business days, the sheer thought of joining a forecast meeting is anxiety inducing. Sure, some people thrive in this environment. But the end result is then that those who get ""promoted"" to managerial roles only continue to perpetuate this cycle of dialing for the sake of dialing with no formal training on things like articulating the Yext value prop, logging activity again for the sake of looking busy, and needless meetings in the early morning and late evening for....no reason other than again, to ""look busy."" The only reason CBU hits their numbers is a few large deals that slip in due to luck. And I'd be curious what the turnover rate is...it must be high. But Yext does not CARE.

Yext claims to not have let anyone go during the pandemic. This may be true (I honestly don't know) - but what I will say is that with the massive re-orgs within the sales organization over the last couple months, they have essentially forced a large number of people to quit by slotting them into jobs they did not interview or sign up for. Think enterprise sellers used to year long sales cycles suddenly being held to weekly/monthly quotas and constant cold calling. I knew a few people hired into the enterprise team and then moved to CBU (dramatically different culture) after only 2-3 months on the job - that's essentially how long it takes to go through onboarding with no chance to actually prove themselves before being essentially transferred ""down."" One can only assume how much poor planning had to go into the process of HIRING for a team that presumably was being dissolved in the weeks ahead.

If you're considering a role in sales here, ASK THE HARD QUESTIONS. Not just around the team you're interviewing for, but ask about dissolution of teams, turnover, etc. It sounds psychologically secure that they haven't let anyone go during the pandemic until you realize it's just so they can force people into roles that will essentially force them to quit."

There are large deals that come in and that is the only way to hit your number - people who have been there for a while know how to game the system and favoritism plays a massive role.","CBU: A very small portion of AE's actually hit their number.
- Expect to be in a position where you are consistently missing and there is limited to no help from management.

3) The people are great. Everyone on the team is willing to help you. The team works hard and wants to see each other succeed. However, this extends past your immediate team as well. The designers and developers are trusted resources who won't hesitate to help you understand (which is especially useful when you are new to the role or not really technical). 
4) There's a lot of room to grow (communication skills, project management, leadership, technical understanding). 
5) Client facing","1) Communication can sometimes be.. lacking. There have been times when changes happened on the team and it's unclear why or how the changes will go into effect
2) Everything is subject to change at a whim's notice depending on what the CSuite wants, Consulting leadership thinks is important, and company goals. For some people, this is probably fine. But if you are not a fan of constant change.... this is your warning. 
3) The TEM career ladder lacks substance. Some people get promoted rapidly while others are left to question why they weren't promoted (even when they meet the criteria outlined in the existing career ladder).
4) It feels like the rest of the Yext org forgets how hard the consulting team works sometimes... the Consulting team puts in a lot of work (sometimes resulting in a lot of hours for TEMs) to hit company targets, but it feels like there's a lack of recognition for that work in company meetings (where other arms of the company are championed)."

169,Yext,Consistent and personable interview process,2020-12-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are nice perks and benefits, and the people are friendly and inclusive.",I just started working so I'm not sure.
170,Yext,Where to begin...,2020-12-19,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- A lot of the people I've had the pleasure of working with here are incredibly intelligent and an absolute pleasure to be around. I genuinely feel the people I'm closest to are like family and not seeing some of them regularly is definitely the biggest downside of having to work remotely.

- I'll also give it to Yext that when it comes to working arrangements even prior to covid they were pretty flexible.

- Some of the benefits and perks such as free meals, snacks, happy hours are cool, though the pandemic has put a halt to that for now.","- We've struggled to maintain the culture that made this an appealing place to work 3-4 years ago. Some of this is to be expected as we scale and lose some of that start-up charm, however, I think a lot of this tied to how we hire. It seems as if the last few years hiring managers have not taken team chemistry into account when hiring especially at the managerial level and it's led to some huge misses.

- Speaking of hiring, let's talk about diversity! Did you go to Princeton, Cornell, UVA, or Duke? Did you previously work at Salesforce or do consulting at Deloitte? Is your idea of small-talk discussing your vacation homes, luxury cars, and boats? Are you a middle-aged white dude from a waspy background with a total lack of self-awareness? Great! No need to apply, the job is yours! Seriously I would say a good chunk of Yexters (especially senior leadership and sales) fit at LEAST one of those criteria, if not most.

- While we're on diversity; or lack thereof, if you're a POC, think carefully and ask the right questions before choosing to work here. If you’re Black and insist on working here do yourself a favor and have a timeline and exit strategy in mind. Despite the extraordinary performances put on by our CEO and CHRO this past June in response to the recent uprisings and civil unrest; to quote Kanye West: YEXT DOES NOT CARE ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE! Like so many other companies this was all talk and virtue signaling. Six months later nothing substantive has been done. We still haven't hired someone for the Diversity and Inclusion role, which allegedly is because we're taking time to find the right person...sure okay. About a year and a half ago our CRO decided he wanted to hire a former colleague as an EVP after running into each other at an event. Just to make room for him several teams worked together to restructure our revenue teams, reset targets, and a ton of other operational labor. We did all this to accommodate this man in less than a month. It's been almost seven since initially having these conversations. When leadership wants something done they don't drag their feet, Diversity and Inclusion is clearly not a priority for them.

 - Back on track! Yext's philosophy for their Black employees seems to be to hire them in junior positions, help them develop, and promote them upward. It's been alluded to that this is because finding qualified black candidates for senior roles in the tech space is difficult. I'm not going to get into how lazy that mindset is, or the fact that hiring the same profile for all your management roles ensures you'll just continue hiring more of the same, but okay, developing talent internally seems like a sound philosophy! Except that's not how it works in practice. On top of there being a general lack of diversity, people of color; but especially black folk, are generally promoted with less frequency than their white counterparts. Just as an example in a global company of ~1400 employees there is ONE black people manager. We're not talking exec level, not even VP or Director level, but just first-line managers. There are already so few black people at Yext, but the lack of upward mobility makes it even less likely to find a black person with over 2-3 years of tenure. Most eventually realize they can't grow here and end up searching for greener pastures.

- While inequity is most apparent for POC, don't worry as long as you're not on the Sales or Engineering teams you can probably hop on the undervalued bandwagon as well! This company LOVES to dump money into Sales; which to be fair makes complete sense, they generate revenue. However, our Sales org has continued to scale, but we haven't really scaled all the other teams that support their efforts. Operations, Strategy, Enablement, Support, HR Business Partners, these teams have stayed roughly the same over the years and in some cases even downsized. So if you are in a position that works adjacent to our Sales org you're usually going to be overworked and probably not compensated for your extra effort. Any budget that may have been used for a raise or promotion is likely being funneled to the Sales org.

- Speaking of Sales there's definitely some dead weight in that org, particularly in the higher rungs and more ill-defined ""sales'' teams (e.g. Strategic Alliances). Everyone can see it, but unfortunately, they're usually a referral from someone in senior leadership. So fortunately for them, but unfortunately for their direct reports and everyone who has the misfortune of working with them, they get to squeeze this meal ticket for all it's worth. That's not to say we don't have excellent sellers who are great at their jobs. Just that there's a decent amount of unproductive people, who aren't necessarily a great fit skills-wise, just eating up resources that could be going elsewhere. 

- Yext’s refusal to scale and invest in anything that isn’t Sales or Engineering also means most other orgs get shafted when it comes to career advancement. At other places, you might expect as the company grows, different arms of the company scale to meet their demands, which leads to opportunities for promotions popping up organically. However, this is not the case at Yext, most promotions happen as a result of someone leaving. This is not to say these promotions aren’t deserved, in fact in most cases they’re long overdue, but the thing is a lot of people don’t want to play the waiting game with their careers. So usually after being stagnant or being passed by once or twice; whether it be the position going to a colleague or more commonly being backfilled by an external candidate, folks end up leaving. I remember earlier in my tenure during our weekly townhall an Exec was running through our plans of scaling and explained to make this happen he would need every single one of us in the room to eventually take on roles as Directors and VPs. At the time I lapped up all the Kool-Aid, but my time at Yext these last few years has made me less naive and more skeptical of grandiose Exec speak.

-Finally, let's talk execs. I actually think our Exec team is a pretty bright bunch. However, that doesn't mean they always make the brightest decisions. I feel like we are constantly pivoting to something new or changing our strategy. Change isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it seems like Execs just want their direct reports to be ""yes-men"", rather than consulting them on the viability and potential ramification of changes. Instead, they decide they want to do something, and we worker bees are expected to do it ASAP. On a bit of a tangent, the vast majority of the exec team often lacks self-awareness. In a recent meeting to discuss, our low employee satisfaction survey results; of which Yext foregoing raises this year was one of the biggest pain points, some Execs decided to make small talk; the topic being about boats none of us could ever hope to afford. Faux pas like this are not an uncommon occurrence, it's actually almost routine for a leader to say something thoughtless during an All-hands or company-wide town hall."

172,Yext,"Learning, teaming, presenting",2020-12-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Yext is incredibly dynamic - the company is rapidly growing in terms of the type of products / experiences its platform can deliver, which makes the SE role exciting and challenging. The role involves constant learning and engaging with all parts of the organization from the product team to the delivery teams to the sales teams. It also requires you to be able to speak to the in-depth technical details of all aspects of the platform on prospect calls.","My primary con is one that no one can prevent given its 2020 - starting fully remotely at a new company is really hard for a number of reasons. Its hard to develop relationships (both the ones you need to have to get stuff done, and the ones you'd like to have because work is always better once you have work friends) and learn organizational context when the only ways you're connecting with people are Zoom / Slack / Email."

I have been at Yext for close to 2 years and I am still at the same salary I started at on day 1. 

Also, if you're looking to move up or get a promotion get in line. The way people are considered for upward mobility is laughable as they basically will promote someone who just has been at the company the longest with no consideration if they even deserve the role.

There is a ton of turnover as the only way to get a raise or a promotion is to leave the company."

176,Yext,Frustration Outweighs Everything Else,2020-11-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,The people. You work with amazing people and form incredible friendships.,"CEO, Diversity, Pay, Pay Discrepancies, Pay, Pay, CEO. 

Ahhh, Yext. Where does one begin. The Yext that I experienced when started 3-4 years ago has been completely gutted and abandoned. Yext is no longer a fun, cool, start-upy Tech company with amazing culture and benefits. 

Our culture has been gutted, as have the benefits. Right now is the lowest point I have ever seen Yext. Employees from the top/most prestigious teams are leaving in literal droves. The reason: pay. 

Yext does this thing. They love to give entry-level employees entry-level salaries with the promise of career opportunities. And they are right. There is a ton of opportunity for advancement. The problem? You never get salary equalized against external hires that come in to do the same role that you have advanced to. The situation plays out like this: Employee who has been at Yext for 3 years moves their way into a high paying position at a prestigious team. They are proud and excited. A month later, someone with more or less the same work experience, comes into that exact same role making 20k more than you. You are disadvantaged in personal wealth and salary accumulation for being a loyal employee. It is mind boggling. 

Let's talk about diversity. Actually, we don't need to talk about it. Just look at our Exec team or take a walk through our office. CEO, in an effort that was most likely an opportunity to just hear himself speak, committed to D & I efforts in the wake of social unrest this past summer. Literally nothing has changed. We hire from UVA, Duke, Princeton, and other Ivys. If you are white and come from consulting or finance, you are guaranteed a job. Even if you didn't pass your interviews, but are a referral of someone important, you will get the job. That is not an exaggeration. 

Our CEO loves to position himself with the big boys (google, FB, Salesforce, etc.). He likes to walk around in clothes that 99% of employees at the company can't afford, and post his Lamborghini to his Instagram. He is not a man of the people, let's just say.

Yext is foregoing raises for the next 18 months, but we are still hiring like crazy in Sales, and of course, the darling UPWARD program is being hired for, and current UPWARD analysts are still getting raises. 

CEO changes his strategy and vision every week and those decisions negatively impact employees who end up doing all the work that said vision change requires. No one seems to care, and the fact that our strategy/vision changes every week signals desperation. 

In a nutshell: Yext provides good career opportunities, and you'll make incredible friendships. Just don't expect to get compensated for those career opportunities. Diversity here is a joke. Yext is like a bad relationship that for some reason you can't walk away from.

178,Yext,The Pros > The Cons,2020-11-17,5.0,Position Within the Marketing Department,"Having been employed since our IPO I can say that even though we're a public company, our start-up vibe has carried into our culture throughout our growth. No company is perfect, but for me, the benefits outweigh the areas for improvement. 

I have been overly impressed with how our leadership team, specifically our CEO, has handled the COVID-19 pandemic. He has been nothing but transparent over the past few months and made it known that no one was going to get laid off. Did that come with consequences like having to push our annual review cycle back a year? Absolutely…but at the end of the day, every employee received job security and peace of mind, which is more than hundreds of thousands of people can say right now. 

Contrary to some of the reviews below, none of our benefits have been quote slashed or cut by the day. At least in the US, we’ve just upped our dental and vision plans with higher allowances, and they reactivated our Class Pass memberships. If by benefits people mean Seamless, unlimited coffee/espresso, and snacks, well yeah, those are gone because per government mandates, our offices must be closed.","My biggest issue with the company is compensation. I don’t think everyone is underpaid, but a majority of the employees on the non-tech side are. I’d love to see Yext invest more in their current employees, especially those who have been with the company for 4+ years. It’s a huge slap in the face to hire people who have less experience or in a more junior role, and pay them more than longstanding employees."

Similarly, the perks were great before they were all taken away. If they’re ever reinstated (doubtful), it’ll be a small win to counterbalance the fact that we’re paid about 30% under market value.","I don’t know where to begin. I can only describe working at Yext as screaming into a void. Management is grossly incompetent and we greatly need outside hires in manager roles, yet Yext continues to promote the wrong people...promote for no pay raise I might add (did I mention none of us have gotten a salary increase in 18 months?).

There is zero top-down leadership. Management somehow spends months on projects that unbelievably make our processes worse. 

Yext does not care about its people, point blank. That is the underlying cause of all of this. The CEO, slurring his words in a nonsensical all hands, will lie to your face and tell you otherwise, and later that same afternoon will announce that pay raises have been postponed again. 

Like your job role at Yext? Don’t count on it staying the same for more than a week. Our responsibilities change nonstop, meaning that the job you sign up to do will not be the job you end up with. Yext asks it’s people to take on the responsibilities of two levels upward and then refuses to give you the title or pay to match.

Speaking of Upward, what an absolute joke. Think your salary is insulting? Well, Yext will hire a whole class of fresh-faced rotational analysts making more than you just to really rub salt in the wound. Oh, they’re compensated that way because they don’t get a salary increase for 18 months you say? Couldn’t imagine what that’s like..."

Base pay is well under industry standard, and yearly compensation adjustments  hardly make a difference.

Managers and lower-level employees alike are leaving in droves, creating a culture of uncertainty and toxicity where some have had 4-5 managers in a span of just a few months.

Support staff are told that they are part of a larger account team, which can seem pretty ingenuine when you consider the fact that Support does the bulk of the day-to-day work only to be paid half as much as CSMs or AEs.

244,Yext,Amazing company!!,2019-10-09,5.0,N/A,"I began my journey at Yext in the NY office about 4 years ago, and now am based in London. My experience has been and continues to be tremendous. I have held 3 different roles, all of which have been quite different. 

One of my favourite things about Yext is the company truly cares about its employees. Whenever I am interested in learning something new, or switching roles my managers have always/continue to been supportive and help me get there. I think that is invaluable, especially since my time with Yext began right after university. 
Yext really does want you to be successful here. 

The leaders here in London are top class. They are extremely intelligent, motivating, and ALWAYS have a smile on their faces!!",Honestly can't think of any...

251,Yext,A great place to work,2019-09-30,5.0,Customer Support Specialist,The people who work there are amazing people and resources for information.,In a company growing so large so quickly information can get lost.
252,Yext,Incredible place to have a career!,2019-09-26,5.0,Senior Client Success Manager,"Incredible/intelligent community, exciting products, and fast paced environment where you are able to really have an impact.",My role has to travel quite a bit so that can be very intense/exhausting.
253,Yext,Great if you love micromanagement and being underpaid,2019-09-25,1.0,Account Executive,No pros at this time.,"Yext used to be the happiest and best place to work. Management cared about you on a personal and professional level took time to get to know you, your strengths and weaknesses, talk about long term career growth, and properly train you. There was upward mobility, transparency, and work life balance. I genuinely wanted to come to work every day and looked forward to it.

Yext is still a great place to work if you love micro management, unqualified and unhelpful new sales leadership who never meets 1:1, and huge pay gaps between team members (up to 40k difference in OTE salary because of personal ties). When you start you will receive no training because both enablement and sales leadership do not know the job or how to sell. At Yext, you are a number and you are disposable no matter how long you have been here or how well you perform. It seems like everyone in revenue is interviewing elsewhere, even AEs who have been here less than a year. No one is happy, no one is successful.

Yext is a fundamentally different company than it used to be. There are better software companies to work for with a better product, better marketing, enablement, and leadership, work life balance, where you are not a number and will get paid way more."

256,Yext,Great Company to Work For!,2019-09-18,5.0,Senior Client Success Manager,Company is a fantastic place to work and is growing 30-40% YoY.  Executive team is extremely engaged and hands-on and seeking new ways to expand the product offering. The product really works and clients are very happy to see great results.  Company culture is very much a meritocracy.  If you work hard you will get promoted and do well.  Fantastic snacks and free pizza and beer on fridays plus the food stipend for lunch and dinner make this place hard to beat!,Company is growing 30-40% YoY so a lot of the current processes that worked well in the past are needing to be re-tooled.
257,Yext,Yext is an outstanding organization,2019-09-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Get to work with knowledgeable and bright individuals
- My professional development has grown tremendously since I have joined Yext. 
- Our solution is so advanced and fascinating. We are fueling AI search and providing Answers to your questions. Company's like Google, Amazon, FB, FourSquare, Uber, Yelp, and over 160 other intelligent services are partners of Yext. 
- Our executive leadership team (Steve Cakebread, Jim Steele, David Rudnitsky, Patrick Blair, Marc Ferrentino, and Mary Fratto Rowe to name a few ) have previously worked together to build Salesforce.com to where it is today.  Why would they leave to join Yext? Because they believe in our solution and they Yext as the next big thing in AI Search. 
- Another recent joiner to the org is Andy Cunningham who worked under Steve Jobs, helped launch the Macintosh and worked with him at NeXT and Pixar. 
- I mention these leaders names because they are all very approachable and will have a down to earth conversation with you. 
- I love leaving work and having a feeling of accomplishment. 
- Everyone in the company is extremely friendly, when you walk by someone in the hallways, they will smile and greet you, instead of walking by looking at the ground awkwardly.
- Senior leadership is very transparent, we have a company-wide meeting on Tuesdays called Manifesto,  it's typically hosted by our founder Howard. In this meeting, he shares company-wide announcements, recently deals that were signed, new product rollouts, and any updates. I really appreciate these meetings because the employees are not in the dark of what is happening. 
- Yext does a great job promoting ERG's and a diverse workforce. We want every Yexter to feel they are part of a team. 
- Moving into a new state-of-the-art building next year 
- Outstanding medical benefits, every 3rd Wednesday we have a medical doctor onsite from Edan Healthcare to give check-ups, prescribe meds, take blood pressure, check your skin for unusual molds, etc. 
- Free healthy snack, drinks, Nespresso (3 different types of coffee machines)",I really don't have any cons. My commute but that's my choice.
258,Yext,Started from the bottom...,2019-09-16,5.0,Director,"Yext is all about valuing employees who want to make an impact - an impact on our clients, in our industry, and within our company.  I've grown my career here over the past 6 years by doing just that.  I've had opportunities to take on new and more challenging responsibilities in every role I've had here.  That is the thing I have loved most about working here.  I was given the opportunity to fill the whitespace that I saw.  We, as a company, invest in the best people because they have the best ideas and can execute on those ideas.  We promote finding, filling, and executing on that whitespace. There's a ton of freedom to make an impact and that is respected so much more than just clocking in and out.  

I've also had the privilege to work with some amazing and talented people over the years.  To me, they are esteemed colleagues, teammates, mentors, and friends.  I look forward to my time in the office and can often be found hanging out around the office after hours.  Can't wait to hang out on the rooftop of our new NYC HQ next year!",Current NYC HQ is pretty crowded.  Looking forward to new HQ in Meatpacking/Chelsea where we'll hopefully have more space for growing teams and more collaborative working spaces for meetings.
259,Yext,Yext has been a great company to start and grow my career and is full of awesome people.,2019-09-06,5.0,Anonymous,"Yext has been incredibly supportive of me as my career interests have evolved over the past several years, allowing me to be a member of multiple different teams. Yext also values new employees and their opinions, and for the most part has been a very collaborative environment.","When I first started the starting salaries were low, but there have been strides to rectify that, as well as any benefits gaps (i.e. there used to be no 401K matching.)"
260,Yext,"Great Company, Good Benefits and Even Better People!",2019-09-02,5.0,Operations Analyst,"Yext is by far the greatest company that I have ever worked for and I plan to stay with them for several more years! As cliche as it sounds, when you work for a company and a product you believe in, it makes coming to work every day easy. 

Just like most tech companies, we have great perks like: health and wellness benefits through Cigna insurance, unlimited PTO if you are a salaried employee (I think it's 10-15 if you aren't), Seamless x2 a day when you are working in the office , snack on snacks on snacks, Employee Resource Groups that foster a community across departments, lots of internal mobility opportunities, involved executive team - for example: we still have company wide meetings every week hosted by our executive team and usually our CEO Howard, and a new Yext HQ opening in NYC in 2020. 

It's a great time to join Yext...maybe even better of an opportunity now vs. when we IPO'd.","As many of the reviews below mention, it's not the same Yext as it's always been and there is A LOT shifting in the company, including the product. Have we lost a majority of our start-up vibes? Yes, but, that's what comes with the territory of being a publicly funded company. 

My biggest gripe with the company is that if you started at an entry level salary, it is difficult to increase just through annual performance reviews.  The best way to get a significant pay boost is by switching departments or if you are on the sales team."
261,Yext,Fast growing company,2019-08-12,5.0,Analyst,"- exciting to work at such a fast growing company

Great culture.
Promote internally and willing to help people move within Yext across departments.
Many perks and team events.",Number of opportunities (a growing company in Europe so will be available in the future)
268,Yext,"Good Product, Poor Execution & Culture",2019-06-17,2.0,Senior Analyst,Product is good/unique  and definitely has a chance to succeed if this company gets its crap together.   CEO generally has good product vision.,"Culture has completely changed for the worse over the last couple years, meritocracy is gone, big egos are in and rewarded heavily.  Used to be a great place to work, but times have changed since.  Compensation is also below market, only way people get paid fair is to come in externally."
269,Yext,TLDR: I wouldn't work here if I were you,2019-06-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The product. It makes sense, and there's definitely a market for it.
- You'll own 10 Yext shirts within your first month. Marketing loves giving out swag.
- The people - so many wonderful humans work here.","- I feel very confident the majority of this company is underpaid. Like, actually underpaid. And under-promoted. It's so unhealthy. Makes you feel even worse when they announce a $1M/month new lease, but you can't argue for a raise or promotion.
- There is more internal bureaucracy nonsense here than at the Trump White House. The top-down decision making often feels as erratic as well. 
- Management does not seem to care that people are leaving in droves, or are making no concerted effort to intervene. 
- The CEO is actually in love with himself. It's honestly amazing to see him get up on stage and talk. Especially when he wears that adorable small leather jacket and his bedazzled Louboutin sneakers. Think: Gilderoy Lockhart.
- The culture people loved (that Yext still tries to pretend exists) is very quickly unraveling. Unless you think a state school fraternity has a thoughtful and empowering culture. Then maybe this is the company for you!
- If you want to transfer internally, you're better off transferring out. It rarely pays off.
- Did I mention the terrible lack of diversity? It's like the Vineyard Vines casting call over here.
- They restructured the entire company following a number of high-profile departures. They didn't hire anyone to backfill - they just merged whole teams under existing leadership. It is a huge, hot mess.
- There's a prevalent culture of people being stand-offish unless you have seniority, equal tenure, or went to Duke and/or Princeton. Honestly if you're reading this and you went to either of these schools, you probably could get hired to the exec team with 0 years of experience. Or, if you worked at Salesforce. If you went to Princeton AND worked at Salesforce... game over you win. They even used to require a degree from a ""prestigious university"" in their job postings to really make it obvious.

If you’re considering, just be smart - talk to a current employee. Ask about things like career growth, diversity, compensation and culture. You’ll be better off if you do."

Everyone seems so cool and fun during the interview process, but it's all a facad. You have this whack training for one week after accepting job, then 3 months of nonsense spending your entire time like a call center making 100+ calls and not even being able to attend staff meetings, go to the bathroom, or enjoy the free Seamless lunch. The job is PURE burnout, for the lowest pay and false promises of increases as well as promotions to higher levels. There is no skill learned here that is worth it to carry forward to another job. Do yourself a favor and save the headache and exhaustion for a legit job where people are professional.

1. The team environment is real - everyone is working towards the team's success, not their own personal advancement. My coworkers are friendly and nice and encouraging and helpful. Management looks favorably on people who legitimately improve the team, rather than people who work towards showing themselves off.
2.  Management is pretty transparent about what's going on at the company. I feel like there is good visibility into what the executives are thinking and doing.
3. People are encourage to get out of their comfort zone and solve problems in new and interesting ways. For example, I have never coded before, but I am learning python in order to create scripts that can improve efficiency on my team.","Yext also suffers to a degree from some of the classic cons of a tech company: while diversity and inclusion seems to be a top management priority, there is a lot of work left to do. The hours can be long, but at the same time, there is no culture of ""face time"" - you don't have to stay late just for the sake of staying late. Overall, there aren't a lot of  cons."

There is so much opportunity for those who want to learn - we're always changing something and thinking of the best way to get things done.","There are some growing pains as the company shifts from a small startup culture to a public company, and that means that there are new processes and often times, higher expectations for performance, which doesn't always sit well with some of the employees.

The product we sell is the best in the industry and I love explaining the benefits of this software to business owners.  The training and sales managers put you in the best possible position to succeed In SMB, there are daily, weekly, and monthly contests with prizes ranging from iPads, Flat Screen TV's, and team dinners.

344,Yext,Sales Division,2017-04-27,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The younger culture is attractive if you’re a young person looking for friends and a job. Entry level employees can learn basics here while the senior employees are left to survive on the whims of their boss. If you are primarily money driven, enjoy farm style sales ( ABC all day), you could be a fit.","The sales org chart is scatterbrained and management has been frazzled from pre-IPO to post IPO. The immediate challenges that plague employees and the company are: 1) a lack of career path. Many of the employees that have outperformed their numbers consistently failed to receive promotions after more than a year. 2) Books are unjust in multiple departments. Some people live like kings while others are starving. If you rub shoulders with the right people or have certain genetic commonalities, this has historically gone a long way for employees—regardless of their performance. 3) Micromanagement. Executive team frequently is too involved with day-to-day operations and procedure.  4) Lack of professionalism: There is a person in a management role known for attempting to lead out of title rather than by leading with the respect of their employees—often sending emails in all caps, inappropriate fonts, and colors—generally lacking a sincere demeanor and grasp of social cues. One of the sales divisions has bro culture—comparable to HubSpot. If you are a woman, be prepared for scenarios that might challenge you emotionally."

346,Yext,Client Training Specialist,2017-03-22,5.0,Client Success Specialist,"I have been a Client Training SPeciailist for the last year and a half at Yext and it has been one of the most fulfilling experiences. Mostly because of the management that supports the team and teammates you are surrounded by. Being on a team where your managers and teammates challenge you, but also give you the lead way to creative and come up with your own projects and practices, it promotes a prime environment for both personal and professional development.  

The role itself is also enticing. Being in the position to make a direct impact on not only the initial adoption of the product but also the longevity of the relationship of the client makes us the perfect balance of value to both the company and our clients. 

They don't call Yext one of the greatest places to work for no reason. It is the product that makes us great, but even more so, its' the people!",Something to keep in mind is that the role requires you to be hyper-focused as you will be on the phone the majority of the day talking and training clients so you have to be the talker and teaching type to excel in this role.

Great product (one that employees can really stand behind), amazing leadership and vision.  Fun environment full of really intelligent people all working together towards a common goal.

Increase this and change how your sellers are borderline committing fraud and expecting SMB support to keep clients who did not understand how the software works. The job you are requiring reps to do by overturning cancels at such a high daily volume is unfair. Middle management could use some work.  A lot of very young Supervisor/Managers so very blatantly feeling their way around procedural development hoping to land on some golden policy and process. Yext tries very hard to emulate Google/CEO tries to emulate Larry, that they overshoot the mark and land somewhere way behind.  The general air is very passive aggressive and it's not conducive to startup environments of speed, openness for improvement. development.  There's a lot of meetings about things that can simply be emailed.  The supervisor knows the product better than anyone but in my humble opinion needs to discover how to lead and collaborate with his team.

The sheer brain power housed on the 5th floor of Madison Avenue is outstanding. Our co-founders are visionary, our engineers are unrivaled, our client facing teams are smart and trustworthy (not alway so in sales!). The culture embraces and is fueled by nerdy, eccentric, and energetic personalities. If you want to be apart of something great, you will find it at Yext.","We are going through some serious growing pains right now. This is inevitable for fast growing startups and the changes happening (to business process, management, job roles, etc) will be good in the long run for employees and the company. However that doesn't make it any less painful or burdensome to the team here now. There is light at the end of the tunnel, I can see it."

This does not feel like an organization where every seller is working towards a number on his or her own. Every single seller goes out of his or her way to help teammates so that the entire team can achieve its goal. The Enterprise Sales team is extremely lucky to have the best Client Services and Operations team in the business. Also, the product is miles ahead of the closest ""competitor.""","Some people see change as a problem. They are hired in a specific capacity, but due to the company growing at an extremely fast pace, that role changes slightly after 6 months and might not fit the initial job description. Yext is a fast-paced environment that is a fun place to work. If you want to do the same thing every week, this is not the place for you. If you want to step slightly out of your comfort zone to help grow an amazing business and find new strengths, Yext is a great place to be."

This industry is still in its infancy and know that Yext has the best products, engineers, technology, product team etc. We think 3 steps ahead of the competition. All of our clients love us, many will champion us to prospects because we do not oversell our technology and we have earned their trust.  

They could take away my Seamless and my opinions of the organization would stay highly positive. Yext has always invested in my career development, and rewarded me very well for the business I brought in.","If you cannot adapt to change this organization is not for you. Sales cycles can be longer then you anticipate but as long as you are honest with yourself, keep a healthy pipeline and do everything you can to close new deals you will hit your numbers."

Leadership can be somewhat inaccessible at times. Revolving door."

Enterprise sales has all the engineering, product, marketing, and executive resources necessary to be successful. Great client services and operations, you can trust what you sell your clients gets executed. 

Great lifestyle. Managers don't ask where you are, what you're doing, as long as you are getting your job done and updating salesforce. 

Everybody has the same goal in mind. Work hard, get the job done, and have fun environment.","The enterprise competition. Although we don't lost often, we have some pesky, annoying competition.  You don't sell against real software companies, this is not like Salesforce vs Siebel, or Oracle vs IBM. Yext enterprise competitors are small companies somewhere between 5-30 employees. Because they do not have a real product/platform, they simply lie about their capabilities and undercut, undercut, undercut. The positive here is if clients do choose a competitor, the truth quickly comes out, and we usually get the chance to work with them. 

Growing Pains - When at a company that grows from 200 to 400 employees and needs to scale to well over 1000 globally in the next 12-18 months, changes tend to happen often. There are times it will go your way, and times it wont."

The two leaders of this team rule by fear, insult employees in a group setting, in private, via email, even in front of clients, etc. They have created an environment of fear where nobody sticks their neck out or even is comfortable giving an opinion. They hire regularly and fire regularly, it is a revolving door. The talks of humility and team work are empty, this team is managed by egos that take credit for their team's work. People see the potential of the company, love their colleagues, believe in the product. But nobody was happy with Enterprise management.

You are ""hired"" but you have to undergo a training but actually an ""auditioning"" process where you need to make 40 sales in 40 days or else you are fired.

I was lucky that I didn't leave a job to work at Yext, but a good amount of co-workers who were let go, had left stable positions they were in before. 

150-250 Dials a day-Minimum of 4 hours of talk time. It can be a bit of a grueling 11 hours, as you are required to be there from 8:15AM-7PM. That being said, those who can do it, I have no doubt will be very successful people."

This a fun and happy place to work with young and motivated people. Plus, you get free lunch and snack kitchens! Sales incentives make you work harder and it makes your job more enjoyable.","There seemed to be a lack of organization, when I first started, but that has really changed. Since this company is still growing and changing there isn't a direct path for upward mobility, that being said, hard work is rewarded and although there isn't a direct path, there are plenty of ways to grow within the company."

456,Yext,Looking for a career? Yext is NOT your place!!!!,2013-10-25,1.0,Sales Associate,People in the office are nice. The new office looks great and is an ideal work location. Food allowance is decent.,"You will be a telemarketer doing non-stop cold calls from 8:30am-7pm (YES! Including your lunch hour). They will say that it is not cold calling because people come to the site, but nobody will know what the product is when you call them. They encourage lying to people to make a sale because after you get their credit card you will never contact that person again. 

The staff is very unprofessional and untraditional when it comes to an office setting. The managers are on Facebook or other sites 85% of the time and screaming derogatory statements at them teams for ""motivation"" the other 15%.

Upward mobility? What is that? Does that exist at Yext? NO! That will explain why people use this as an ""in between"" jobs type of place. The director has said on multiple occasions that he is always surprised to see people make it to 12 months in the sales associate position if they make it past the first 3 months.

The pay is $35,000 until you make 40 sales then you will be dropped to $30,000 + commission unless you resign before you make 40 sales."
457,Yext,"Maybe sales isn't for me, but this place just seems downright foul.",2013-10-18,1.0,Yext Sales Associate,"- talks from Howard are inspiring and get the company excited about new developments.
- Daily free lunch, regular happy hours, and beautiful new office space
- Training manager is very supportive for the most part, and since there is no competition for leads, most of the sales associates are very supportive of each other as well.
- The product is actually a great tool if people understand what it is.","- Sales associates are fired or leave at least once a week - not including the trainees who get cut.
- They don't want you to learn too much about the product, just say as little as possible and get that CC, then hang up. Hope they don't call back.
- The sales floor is often very loud, especially in the late afternoon - people throwing footballs, yelling and laughing. It can be very hard to hear the client, and I can't image what kind of zoo it sounds like on the other end.
- You are encouraged to keep calling old leads until you basically get a death threat. Sales associates can get extremely rude on the phone and are driving the reputation of the company into the ground.
- Sales associate are expected to make at least 150 calls/day and have 4 hours of talk time. And you are basically repeating the same sales script all day, over and over and over again. 
- Managers encourage you to lie about what the product will do if it will get you the sale.
- Zero chance of promotion or career development within the company."

Free Lunch and Dinner",Everything that goes on at this company not listed above is a Con. Grueling job with a culture that is cut throat. High rate of turnover and employee dissatisfaction. Concerned with company goals and not employee satisfaction or growth.  Condescending sales methods and approaches towards getting business' to buy their product. Could care less about anything but their bottom line. Misleads during the interview and training process.
467,Yext,"Definitely not my scene, perfect for people who just want to sell.",2012-09-08,2.0,YSA,"Easy to get into! If you seriously want to be hired, just channel your inner Ke$ha and you're good to go. Most of the people are pretty nice, nobody is really ""out to get you"" as long as you don't end up with duplicate leads. They provide lunch, pay for happy hour (even though I would rather get more money than cheap booze and salty food, but hey, to each his own). The health benefit seemed good enough.","There seems to be no professional development, which leads to poor communication from lower management (mid level management was perfectly fine, possible too good for such a small operation and upper management was not really an issue for me) I am specifically talking about the team leads who clearly never opened a communications book and never learned about organizational behavior. 

To the person who thinks benefits are for 50 year olds: you're in the perfect place. Stay at Yext, you'd never make anywhere else. I think it is also important to point out that $50k is an unreasonably low salary when you're spending over 50 hours per week at work (which isn't even guaranteed, that's only if you consistently make sales and always hit above average numbers)."
468,Yext,Good company. Cold Calling Sales Job,2012-09-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Fun place. Free lunch. Good people. The CEO is a good guy and the company is going in a solid direction. Product is undeniably helpful.,All cold calling. Says leads are generated but all that means is they went to the website. You are talking to small business owners all day who have no idea what you are talking about when you call them. kind of a tough sell. no room for promotion out of the sales pit.

473,Yext,"Tough job, great people, good money.",2012-02-21,4.0,Sales Associate,"Since most of these reviews have gone the bullet-point-style way, I'll just write out my honest opinion of the company, the job, and everything in between. It's been almost a year, so I've got a good handle on it. 

The job is what most people would call a ""telemarketer"" - your job is to call businesses all day, every day, in the quest for the almighty sale. 

Most people in this position are either straight out of college or graduated within the past year or so. Long story short, if you told me I'd make 50K in my first job and live in New York City, I would take that and ask where to sign. When you factor in that the people you work with - all in their 20's, even some of management - are young, fun, and like-minded, it makes the job a winner. For each person writing a negative review here, theres two that have been with the company for 6+ months. 

All the other stuff - happy hours, benefits (what are you, 55?), etc - is irrelevant. The people are good, the job itself is rough, and the pay is good.","The downsides are well-chronicled here. You make over a hundred calls, day in, day out, 9 AM to 6 PM. 

The ""opportunity for career advancement"" is probably not the best out there. Then again, would you rather put on your resume that you brought $200K in real revenue to your company, or that you completed an internship? Also, if you're thinking about taking the job, you're probably under 25. Let's be honest, you care more about beer money than your 401K at this point. 

I also will say that maybe 6-12 months ago management was NOT very forthcoming as far as what the job entails; I will tell you that they have greatly improved in that regard. If you are applying nowadays, you know what you're getting into. It's funny to say, but the only thing about the company and the job that isn't great is the job itself. Then again, how many people do you know that wake up thrilled to go to work? You're really going to complain because you have to make some phone calls on your rear all day? 

I know almost everyone that's left a review on here. I can tell who they are, either by their lack of grammatical sense or their flamboyant word choices. They are diverse in every way imaginable; background, education, major. As a whole, they only have one thing in common: 

They can't sell. 

If you can talk, push, pitch, sell, hustle; if you don't mind earning your money; if you are competitive, you'll find a home for a while, make some money, have some fun, and meet some great friends. 

If you can't sell; if you get nervous talking to people; if you wilt and point the finger instead of fight when under pressure; if you are entitled in your young age and feel the right to complain when making $45,000+ in your early 20's while 10% of the country is unemployed? Save yourself the energy and look elsewhere."
