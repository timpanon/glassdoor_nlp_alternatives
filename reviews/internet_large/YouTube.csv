In the same position I had more than 1 manager per year; some colleagues had several managers per year. Result of management flux: VERY difficult to get promoted. New managers don't know your past achievements and aren't supportive enough during promotion process. Also YouTube has much lower-level SWEs on average than Google in general, so it's hard to find higher-level people to support your promotion case.
  Size and complexity of organization kills innovation. Extremely hard to launch new features. Despite what management says, launches are still required for promotion. 
  I consider my tenure at YouTube a colossal waste of time; I plan to transfer to Google to start over and have a chance at career progression. 
  Also: YouTube doesn't do enough to support non-superstar content creators. YouTube search seems to recommend high-ad-revenue videos to people to watch next; in contrast, Google search recommends the most appropriate results for the user. Thus YouTube's search/recommendation system isn't consistent with my values or Google's mission to organize the world's information."

421,YouTube,"Amazing, but Chaotic and beware the Middle Management",2016-01-07,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Highly influential product with global reach. Is  a big business but retains smaller business dynamism.  Compensation, Benefits and working environment (including colleagues) are best in class. High levels of autonomy and responsibility. Excellent internal mobility.","Always too much to do and never enough resources to do it. Increasingly favouring individual achievement and those who are the best at shouting the loudest and being the most visible, and under acknowledging quiet achievers and team players. Managers are either under appreciated and under resourced, or of questionable competence, particularly middle management. Career options are limited outside of California. Increasing levels of internal politics."

423,YouTube,Software Engineer,2015-12-07,5.0,Software Engineer,I loved my time at you tube. they have a great community of experts and the company is very big and i feel that i make more money than i do work. I love that the company has interactive measures with its employers.,The company is too big to do anything. I didn't feel that my work helped anything in the company. Only the smartest of smartest can join this and I felt that the interview was insanely hard.
424,YouTube,Awesome,2015-11-14,5.0,,"Completely up to you to make your own schedule, decide what content to post, and you get to connect with lots of people.","No automatic success, if that's what you're looking for. Pay depends on network which can make it difficult to decide what to do."

428,YouTube,Exciting place to work,2015-08-13,4.0,Partnerships Manager,YouTube moves fast. The competitive landscape makes it really exciting and there's so much to be done that you won't get bored in a routine schedule.,I had bad experiences when it comes to performance evaluations and haven't received actionable feedback when needed. I guess it depends on your manager but the system has flaws and needs improvement.
429,YouTube,working for the biggest and the bestest,2015-08-01,4.0,,"You're working for one of the greatest companies on the planet! I learned so much during my time here. The skills that you acquire will stick with you for a lifetime, YT is comparable to a job bootcamp, if you're seeking that big push to take your career to the next level this is it. It has lead to so many incredible job offers within the realm of high tech. Your entire way of thinking will be changed for the better. 

Working with the biggest and the brightest means that you're surrounded by innovative thinkers who are highly intelligent. Everyone here is incredibly motivated and determined, which is contagious. Overall upper management seems happy and genuinely want you to succeed. Everyone is very approachable here. The company has a vibe that is comparable to a startup, but without the frat mentality and shabby esthetics. 

Despite working long hours the perks do soften the blow of stress that does arise (it is high tech afterall). There is food everywhere, awesome mini events, a state of the art fitness center, a pool, a gorgeous courtyard, and so much more. Everyone works hard and they make sure to play hard too.","As a contractor you are technically not a 'real' employee. You cannot attend certain meetings or participate in offsites which is a bummer. The process of becoming an FTE is not guaranteed unfortunately. Just going in with that mindset is probably best, so you aren't set up for disapppointment if a perm position doesn't present itself to you."

432,YouTube,Great workplace–but full-time work without full-time status,2015-05-12,5.0,,YouTube is a great place to work–not only for its perks–but also for the work you do. Management is very transparent and really tries to make sure that you are achieving your own personal goals while hitting all the company's goals.,Teams that are split between FTE's and Vendors might experience morale issues–especially if the temporary employees are dipping into full-time work. Some FTE's look-down at temporary employees.

443,YouTube,"Great job, great people, but this place is no longer in a start-up mentality",2014-08-25,4.0,Content Partnerships,"Google infrastructure underpins YouTube, which means all the great things you hear about Google mostly apply to YouTube as well. Work Life / Balance, Perks, etc are all awesome, and it's great to work for the big-dog in the online video space!",Being tied to Google (and being one of its main revenue centers) has caused YouTube to be bogged down by red-tape and bureacracy. It is getting harder and harder to get things done / make improvements without tons of approval processes and executive review panels.
444,YouTube,"Pretty good, except for the copyright ID system.",2014-08-07,4.0,Producer,"Getting paid to do something that is usually a hobby is great. Most, if not everybody, can become a partner. Also there is a good amount of royalty free music that can be used in your videos.","If you don't use the royalty free music, you will get a copyright strike and the money from the video will be sent to the company that claimed it, even if it is a fake or imitation of a company."

This is a very unstable form of income."

458,YouTube,Positive experience as a partner,2012-09-14,4.0,Content Creator,Compensation for creating content for YouTube. What more can you ask than to be paid to do something you love to do? Definitely worth it if you'd like to take a hobby such as filmography and making some extra cash from it.,Less-than-stellar communication from YouTube on occasions for partners. AdSense does have it's quirks occasionally; would much rather use PayPal or other alternative for payment.
459,YouTube,Fair payments and easy,2012-09-11,3.0,Youtube Partner,easy job. Fast Payments. Simple to use. Almost anyone could do it,sometimes does not let you put ads on your own content due to little problems such as music that is your own.
