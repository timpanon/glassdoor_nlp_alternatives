The IAM team is incredibly professional and does an excellent job, top-notch engineers. The non-InfoSec folks tend to be excellent engineers and great people to work with, e.g. the data teams, SRE, developer productivity, etc. Lots to learn from these non-InfoSec teams.","InfoSec is an utter mess, out of 60 people in InfoSec, except for IAM, only 1-2 know how to do security, compliance, or risk management. You will be surrounded by people who have no idea what they are doing, and why.

The ex-CISO didn't know what a VPN was -- never used one, didn't know what it did. He hired most of the people, so buckle your seatbelt Dorothy, 'cause Kansas is going bye-bye! All your dreams of becoming a security architect will be buried in this dump.

Team leads are fighting purely over what utter nonsense they will do next that sounds good but does nothing in terms of risk reduction. The compliance team barely understands compliance, the SOC hasn't written a single meaningful incident report in the 3+ years. It's a complete and utter mess. If you know how to open a Linux shell, you will be the brightest mind among them all. If you know what risk management means, you will be a shining star. But if you know these things, don't worry, they won't recognize your work, because all they care about is internal politics.

Stay away from InfoSec at Zalando. Join a company that you can grow in.

PS:
* Compensation is terrible
* InfoSec culture is one of infighting, greed, and nonsense
* Diversity&inclusion was so bad, someone was promoted AFTER they left the company, otherwise the company was afraid it will face legal action.
* HR and Internal Compliance is only there to protect executive management."

It is very hard for a student to imagine a path outside of their existing team, unless their team lead is particularly invested in their development. The overall system doesn't really allow for personal development on the lower levels."

I have never regretted my decision to work at Zalando. I have learned many things during this time, more than in the 20 years before in other jobs. 

The following are things I really appreciate about Zalando.
- There are a lot of opportunities to develop and also to change into other roles.
- The company has not stopped redefining itself and setting ambitious goals.
- Teams have the opportunity to test new things and learn from the mistakes what better solutions are.
- Discussions are (mostly) open and fact-based.","As in all companies, there are lights and shadows, and that's why I see myself continuing to serve on Zalando's works council in the coming years. 

I would like to see more transparency in some areas.
- A transparent salary structure would resolve many discussions about fairness and create more trust.
- The processes and decisions on whether and how colleagues are promoted also need to be improved.
- Zalando's feedback culture is already at a high level. However, there is still a lack of transparency in the feedbacks. I would like to see us all become more courageous in the coming years and move away from anonymous feedback to personal and open feedback."

Getting a promotion from within the company is also difficult, you have to wait for promotion rounds , even if a role that you fully qualify for opens up - you may apply and get that role but you will move at your current job band and salary until the next salary review round.

107,Zalando,Dead end in legacy-land,2021-11-12,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,They used to offer some sport activities,"Oceans of legacy code, and toxic atmosphere due to lack of growth opportunities. Legacy, legacy and LEEEEGAAAACYYYYY.

In the three teams where I have worked so far, 90% of the job we do is dealing with legacy code and maintaining old application with a huge operational overhead. There are very few new projects, and nowadays those are done by external developers. Zalando rents engineers from Thoughtworks, gives the new projects to this developers with a very tight time deadline (so not good quality job is done), and then these guys leave. Then the internal employees maintain these applications.

When the evaluation comes, they tell you that your work wasn't ""impactful"", and when afterwards you ask to work on new projects that are more impactful, you get the same old maintenance of legacy ""because it needs to be done"". So many people focus on competing to show off whatever they do, always thinking about the next evaluation."
108,Zalando,Simply no,2021-11-10,1.0,Data Analyst,Work from home policy is quite flexible. That's valuable for many people.,"Where to start?! First, accessing and consuming data is extremely poorly managed and chaotic. You won't know where to find information that you need, who can/will give you access to the data, is it going to be anywhere close to well maintained, etc. You will not have a BI tool! So imagine you are a data analyst, people expect from you to deliver reports, but you don't have a working data visualisation tool. Officially, there is MicroStrategy but it doesn't work more than it does. Also, not well suited for handling large datasets.
Often, you will have to act as a data engineer, create your own pipelines and data sources. You will have struggles to collaborate with the engineers because they don't understand, don't care, or are too busy. In all this you will be alone as none of your coworkers (let alone managers) will have time or technical expertise to help you out."

- A lot of potential and encouragement from the company to grow professionaly","My experience with the company has been very positive so far, so it's hard to come up with an unbiased opinion for the shortcomings

I guess one thing that I'd like to see improve is:

- Some of the tech teams are left to do their own thing. Which means that people with different backgrounds and proficiency will end up creating output (code, services, applications) with various levels of quality. Since these are not on the critical path, they don't get that much attention with regards to best practices, code quality, architecture etc. So when you're joining a team, it might be a bit of a hit-or-a-miss situation. Always query the team during your interviews for the things that are important to you.

In my personal experience, this situation is getting better in time."

- Talented colleagues
- 40% discount voucher on Zalando","Your experience is as good as your management. Someone wrote in another review that, unfortunately, your experience depends highly on who management is, and this is my experience as well. 
- Depending on management, you may not see some of the benefits announced company wide. Some of these benefits might get blocked from management without any good reason (e.g. not allowing remote work due a lack of trust rather than the requirements of the role). 
- Depending on management, you may see a lot of policies announced and never live them. For example, Zalando supposedly stands for diversity and inclusion. In fact, diversity is one of Zalando's core values. Again, even if diversity and inclusion are a priority company-wide, you may not see anything of that translated into concrete actions and attitudes within your team because this depends on whether your management believes in its importance or not. As an example: you may hear a lot about being inclusive and respecting different backgrounds, but you might repeatedly be asked to mould yourself to traits that management deems valuable without any small consideration to trying to respect your values and background. 
- Performance evaluations and promotions ultimately depend on whether management likes you. You may consistently receive positive feedback from different colleagues and stakeholders about your performance and the skills critical to your role, but even then, you might not receive a promotion because upper management that has never worked directly with you and has not seen your work, has the ultimate decision-making power on whether you get promoted or not. If you were not engaged in shameless self-promotion and flattery every opportunity you see them, you can say good bye to career advancement. 
- Depending on management, there might be work-life balance and there might be some importance given to mental health. While there are mental health days at company-level, the importance given to mental health in your team depends on management. You may hear a lot of talk about promoting mental health and work-life balance, but then be given incredibly tight deadlines that cannot be met without working overtime / see management work at 6 am and 11 pm.
- Having a positive feedback culture depends on management. You may have them encourage you to give feedback but consistently dismiss it / react defensively / label you as problematic even if the feedback provided is constructive. If you then decide not to give as much feedback because, what for when it is being consistently dismissed?, then you may be labeled as not outspoken enough.
- Feedback is received from stakeholders and peers, but you never get to evaluate upper levels of management. There is a quarterly survey that is supposed to be for that but this either mostly reflects on your team lead and does not go much beyond that, or it is discussed in one meeting and then no actions are taken to address negative results."
259,Zalando,Zalando Lounge,2021-05-13,3.0,Customer Service Representative,"Fast and efficient recruitment process with no bullshit questions and a relevant test (manage a case).

A great entry-level job with complete paid training. 

In some teams, the direct management is great (Team Lead and seniors) and do its best to help newbes and reduce the attrition.

Possibilities to transfer to a totally different position after a while if you are a good match.

The company has a very inclusive policy. You won't be rejected because of who you are by anyone.","High turnover depending on the team, the Christmas period is very tense in some teams since there is not enough people for the job.

Sometimes the hierarchy takes irrational decisions and messes with the customers, but they don't care because you are here to take the shots when angry customers strike back. While I agree that this is your job as a customer manager, I don't think it's a good strategy in the long run as both employees and customer tend to lose their trust.

Big problems tend to be silenced and dealt with once it's too late (harassment, sexual or not)."

265,Zalando,"Ego first, gaslighting second, employees last.",2021-05-07,1.0,Employer Branding,"- International work environment with lots of ambitious, fun and talented colleagues.
- 40% discount voucher on Zalando (30% for Zalando Lounge) but doesn’t apply to Partner brands and has a discount threshold of 1080€ per calendar year.
- Development opportunities such as options to take courses on an internal training platform, mentorship program (although very hard to get a mentor), development budget and language classes (were cut as non-essential business expenses in 2020 due to COVID-19).","Without a question, there are many talented people and fantastic teams doing meaningful work at Zalando. But as the unofficial saying between employees goes: “Your experience at Zalando depends on your lead”. Unfortunately, my department turned out to be the living proof that “a fish rots from the head down”.

What happens when you have leads who validate their intelligence by making others feel inferior and scared by using their hierarchical position and performance evaluation (formerly known as ZONAR) as a retaliation technique? They push people to leave even if they love what they’re doing. When leadership turns a blind eye towards people being treated unfairly rather than punishing such actions, it sends a message to everyone that this is acceptable, and becomes part of the company culture. When employees are labeled as “toxic, negative and problematic” for speaking up against misconduct or micro-aggression, it’s creating a fear-based workplace. Even worse, attempts to hold somebody accountable for their behavior are treated with gaslighting, telling you that your perception of what happened is wrong. 

Forget psychological safety to be yourself, voicing your opinion or asking questions that might differ from your lead’s perspective if you ever dream about being promoted or get recognised for your contributions in the performance cycle. Unless you’re a master manipulator, shameless self-promoter or do everything to “be your LEAD’S biggest fan”, you might be disappointed with the outcome. Feedback is highly encouraged, but it’s actually effective only one way. Even if you try to provide your manager constructive feedback, it will either be forgotten, used against you later, or dismissed altogether (this applies to both, one-on-one feedback, as well as facilitated and documented with an external team). 

Ironically, leads also love talking about the importance of mental health, but some think it’s about smiling more, being positive and just being grateful that you still have a job. Teams were even told in a public forum to write positive and grateful comments, and not what they actually think, in the internal survey tool that is designed to provide an honest picture about team health. Every constructive comment was therefore automatically labeled as “toxic” - leadership just wanted to hear happy thoughts and words of gratitude. And if you do take up the courage and share about your struggles, you run a high chance of being gaslighted, psychologically invalidated, or being blamed for it - Everything that makes your managers uncomfortable needs to be silenced and covered up with toxic positivity. 

Also, if you have a choice to be anything for Zalando - Be a consultant, not an employee. External consultants are brought in on high rates and even if you just end up recycling existing ideas from the team and presenting them back to the lead - You will be praised and celebrated more than the employees who provided all the groundwork and expertise.

My advice to everyone before applying or accepting a job at Zalando: Don’t trust the interview process alone, do your own research. If your future team members are not included in the interview process (always a major red flag!), reach out to current or past team members on LinkedIn and ask about their experience. If you see several job ads for the same team popping one after the other, ask what has caused all the positions to become open out of a sudden. If you notice the same job ad circulating for months or being constantly changed, ask why and don’t accept dismissive or surface-level answers. This is your career and you deserve to make an informed decision whether or not this is the place for you. It’s in your own best interest to do proper due diligence to be aware if you will join a supportive and friendly work environment, or an ego-centric political minefield that will end up leaving you worse off than when you joined."

- There are good initiatives in the company when it comes to responsible stuff, such as diversity and inclusion, sustainability, data privacy, etc.
- There is a works council now (Betriebsrat) which is holding the corp accountable.","- They live in the past century, and think people still need to go to the office to do tech.
- The company is moving towards a corporate style kind of work, where tech is not important and only the final product matters. Most developers are now disengaged. All exciting tech is the leftover from previous times, now it's all about using whatever makes it fastest to deliver a product.
- In the all hands, the senior management almost never answers any questions in a clear and satisfactory way.
- The CEO who was the diversity and inclusion champion has resigned, so that aspect is now in the hands of people who don't really care.
- The company uses its active members in the diversity and inclusion scene as tokens w/o wanting diverse opinions.
- There is almost no internal transparency when it comes to sensitive subjects. They keep talking about transparency, but nothing sensitive ever gets discussed or properly investigated.
- There is an evaluation for all employees twice a year, where they collect a ton of data about employees w/o giving them that data, and for most of the year people are under the stress of the two evaluation rounds. Add that to the fact that it's easier to leave the company and join at a more senior level than moving up the ladder internally."

Management. - Depending on what team ofcourse but my manager is good.

International environment.

Not too high pressured.

They care about employee mental health (although should do better and make allowances for mental health leave).","HR is quite trash and not helpful. Especially if you’re just starting at the company good luck...you’re on your own.

Depending what team but for us promotions are very slow. Makes me not see myself at the company for very long because of how many years it takes for people to be promoted.

Generally, they don’t do enough for sustainability and that bothers me.

It’s all quite political (as most companies), but not as bad as some companies. It’s just that logical strategic moves for the company take forever to be done and it’s a shame."

Beyond the great employee discount, they have also taken care of employees mental health and provided great transparency.

303,Zalando,The biggest benefit: keeping your job during struggling times,2021-04-12,4.0,Internal Communications Manager,"The company does well, and they communicate results to the employees. 
They allow employees to take home their work chairs, sometimes the desks (you need a note from the doctor justifying this) and hardware (extra monitor).
You can get company shares.","There are no tangible benefits other than the company shares and 40 euros we receive per month to cover some expenses of working from home. 
Workload is impossible to manage within the 8 hours we should work per day, so it's very common to have meetings scheduled out of the working hours.
The feedback system is still the same as 2 years, reporting on colleagues' behaviour every 6 months, without triggering any real action if the person is middle management or above. Whenever there is a feedback round, people usually end up working on the weekends to cover the time spent on evaluations or meetings. 
Salary increases are based on these reviews, but also on the budget each particular team has. So you can never expect to have a real salary increase over 3% unless you were really very low already."

323,Zalando,"Poor leadership, disposable employees",2021-03-23,1.0,Employer Branding Specialist,40% discount voucher (though not applicable to partner shops on the platform),"As many other reviews have mentioned, the leadership at Zalando is unfortunately subpar as there are no proper trainings for (new) leads or repercussions for bad leadership. The internal survey used for measuring team health does not result in any consequences when scores are alarmingly low. Instead, toxic positivity is promoted and teams are told by leadership to only leave positive survey comments as negative ones are not welcome. Concerns and issues get ignored and the people sharing them are labeled ""problematic"" and ""toxic"". Discrimination cases get solved by changing team structures as, according to Zalando logic, the things a person did to you go away when they are no longer your lead. As the 360° feedback is directly linked to promotions and salary increases, unless you shamelessly self-promote at any chance and your lead likes you, you will not move forward with your career. The collected peer feedback gets strongly filtered through your lead and is therefore highly subjective and not transparent. There are some great teams at Zalando with amazing leads but the general stance seems to be that people are seen as disposable as the name ""Zalando"" is still bringing enough people in who are willing to accept conditions seriously affecting their mental health and well-being for a year or two in order to being able to add the experience as a milestone to their CV..."

Leads to rewarding political maneuvering rather than those who are deserving.

Be careful what level you accept - saw people accept levels lower than their experience level with the expectation they would get a foot in the door to prove themselves and move up, when in reality it is very difficult to move up salary bands.

No onboarding for new hires - you are just thrown into a team that is understaffed and underskilled and I had very little guidance from my manager. No feedback was given. None of this was discussed at my interview
Some of the male colleagues were inappropriate - came too close to you and put arms around you without permission, cracking inappropriate jokes.
Also very low salaries for Berlin standards. It was only after I left that I realized how underpaid I was."

529,Zalando,An honest reflection on working in category management,2020-09-23,2.0,Team Lead Buying,"Exposure to many parts of ecom businesses, from
Performance marketing, content & creation, marketing campaigning, Human Resources,  finance controlling, business development, category management and market place to name but a few 
Flexible working hours
Honesty and transparency from the board and management in cascading information and its reflection in its wins and mistakes
It’s pioneering mentality for example the great strides made in sustainability which only 2 years ago was a small side project.
Tolerance and international community 
Pay, salary and perks for Berlin are very good.
In house training and development courses are excellent if you have time to attend, the leadership courses were excellent.","The absolute unmanageable workload and constant lack of investment into headcount in category management.  Certainly at teamlead level and above in category management, you are married to your job which is why turnover is so high.  A work/life balance is not possible. It’s not a sustainable way to live for long term health and it needs more than ever in a COVID world to be addressed.
The race mentality and speed at which the business develops and changes which does not stop to properly address the people it affects at different levels of the business.  
In most businesses pressure is top down. At category management you feel it from the top, from
The brands but most frustratingly from all the link departments be it, finance controlling, logistics, Zms or partner program . The business is so big it is it not
aligned on internal strategy goals with different priorities. It is hard to yeld support and truly get your goals achieved.
Zalando Calls itself a fashion platform but truly they are tech first foremost and forever.  People that join the business with a genuine passion for fashion would miss working in a true fashion led business. 
There is a distinct lack of onboarding and on job training support for basic daily functions, clear job descriptions for category management at different levels
The Political game that has been developed by the personal performance review process “zonar”that is so complex and open to manipulation that creates mistrust and lack of openness from employees to address true support where it’s needed to help people develop.
Many people in category management have left due to stress and burnout in the roles this has never been properly addressed to avoid going forward.   It gives the impression Zalando does not genuinely care about its employees.  When people are rated underperforming the focus is primarily on the individual not the environment or the lead or the team around them.  
Zalando has a set of principles called the founding mindset.. how they conduct themselves in the business and how they work.. it’s a great initiative for a large business. But it only works if everyone lives  and believes in them, especially people at director and Senior management who set the culture and atmosphere. I have seen many examples in category management where this is definitely not the case."

If you want to feel some personal satisfaction with your job, this is the wrong place. Most of the people here just work for the money and will drag you to that feeling over time. Young people wanting to find a meaningful job end up leaving this company.

Its a company on its way to become 100% corporated. So that's what you can expect to find.

So many people say bad things about this site, many of them left very early. I discovered myself why: incompetence at so many levels. I met brilliant people along the way though, many left and others were lucky and found a proper team with a proper manager and project,

There’s a project which I’m not going to mention that’s probably the closest to a hellhole. It always has many positions open because people leave very fast due to dumb managers and people who pretend to have knowledge about stuff. This project gets most of the site budget yet they don’t take action about the elephants in the room. It’s really sad.

I witnessed firsthand employees whom were oppressed by either their own lead or lead from another unit. People are being yelled at and everyone is meant to say nothing about it. During my first week, I witnessed two employees have an exploded argument and it felt toxic. Word of advise: before taking a job with any employer read the comments on glassdoor. Do not ignore these comments, every negative comment i read before joining was true. Zalando proudly says over 90% of their hires are from outside Germany which translates into diversity hire--- well, this is because of your poor reputation in Germany. The only locals who accept your job offers only accept it as a survival job! They have a suck-up culture. If you don't suck-up to your lead, forget promotion, salary increment etc. Some of the business units are amazing but some are toxic!! There is barely a proper work-life balance .... work overload is one of the reasons why most of the employees are unnecessarily agitated and paranoid. Workplace gossip and talks behind your back?

Extremely international company, very diverse and inclusive. A lot of career development opportunities with the option to move horizontally or into a different field if you don’t feel you’re on the right path. As a merchandiser I find the systems and data are extremely advanced - with tech being such a huge part of the company.","Whilst I have huge respect and high confidence in the leadership of the management board including the SVPs, the leadership and transparency of the VP / head of / team lead levels is inconsistent and sometimes lacking and often a lot of big egos competing with each other which goes against the company culture.

- high fluctuation

Nothing changes. I tried to flag all the flaws that I could objectively see and HR would just nod and do nothing. “Hey there’s this big issue with favoritism and here’s the proof” “Hmm yeah I agree, yep” [six months later manager’s friend and the manager himself gets promoted].

- Spree river near the office. Location is good and many tourists are often around.

- People in Europe have heard of Zalando.","- The company (Zalando) acts as an investor for teams. You aren't hired by the company but by your team. You don't have any rights, at least while you are on the mandatory probation.  They can let you go anytime for any arbitrary reason, like cultural misfit, or due to change in their requirements. There's no law to protect you. You're just walking in to their trap by yourselves and it's all at your own will.

- They won't tell you any rules or policies but may directly punish you for leaving early in the evening than expected by someone from your team. There's no attendance or record system but your co-workers may be tracking or monitoring you and feeding in to your manager like covert spies.

- One of the worst employers I have ever worked for and they attract some of the worst lot of people. Salaries aren't any great either and it's perhaps hard for them too, to get rid of toxic full time permanent employees, because of the pathetic German laws.

- They are so poor that they can't offer to bring you on-site for a face to face interaction before making you an offer and hence, all the onus is on you to take that risk and gamble with your career. For them, it's all a matter of two weeks salary or a couple of thousand of relocation assistance.

- Your Eastern European co-workers may dislike you for being a non-European and still getting a job. Beware of talking to them, they might be feeding it all, against you to your manager. If you can't trust your co-workers, you shouldn't be here at all.

- Getting promoted is a game and not a matter of merit or some achievement. Good for nothings make it well in the company just by being liked by the right people.

- Don't go by any positive Glassdoor reviews, as they may again be manipulated and fabricated. They have it written on their glass doors in the building that writing good reviews on Glassdoor helps them attract talent. They perhaps even have special sessions for people to write good or better reviews on Glassdoor. Don't go by any positive review of this company. They are cheap and manipulative as hell. Don't be convinced even if a manager or HR from Zalando attempts to cover up my review through some sugar coated justification or explanation here. They're all liars.

- They hire people in bulk and skilled employees leave them all the time. You're nothing special if you get a call or offer from them. Don't think you can perform well and progress here. They hire new people all the time to make up for the deficiencies of incompetent management.

- They won't even offer you the hardware of your choice unless it serves a business purpose for them. Your comfort or convenience, isn't one of them. If you're having second thoughts about joining them and checking reviews to make the right decision, my advice would be to not come here for anything other than being in Berlin. That's all to it."

The work life balance is great and I have never been pressured to work out of hours or weekends in my time here. They provide way more than average holiday days, and are flexible with both working hours and locations.

The VP on my team refuses to speak to people who cannot speak German, unless you dress well and go on smoking breaks, then she'll respect you.
Huge staff turnover across the business, specifically at the lead level.
The responsibility of VPs does not match their experience, as Zalando are more likley to hire 'yes' people than people who are strong in their roles. This helps them to set unrealistic targets. Hence the strategy for 2023 is unachieveable and will cause a huge loss of the portfolio next year.

- Groupthink

- Low pay and they love to lowball people on salaries

- No bonus structure or equity

- No loyalty: they will fire people 6 months after they moved across the world for this job, leaving them stranded in a foreign country with no job


Zalando tries to mimic the surface-level behaviors of Silicon Valley tech companies, like having daylong job interviews, nice looking offices, and the basic hierarchical structures.

But the people working here are no Silicon Valley leaders: They don’t try hard to push the limits of what’s possible, they don’t spend their money in the right places and they don’t value innovation and dissent. The so-called “team leads” at Zalando would not be team leads in Silicon Valley. 

They also don't try to mimic some of the better perks of Silicon Valley companies like unlimited PTO, free food, stock options and transportation.

This is a standard closed-minded German company trying to imitate what they think Silicon Valley culture is, from the few blog posts they've read about what it's like.

This is a second-league sports team pretending to be in the champions league."

It also understands its customers very good and invests a lot in this topic. The internal and external resources to learn are really great. Usually, you have the freedom to choose your tech stack, which keeps your knowledge and experience state-of-the-art.","The department I’m part of is the B2B branch of Zalando and has really ambitious growth goals. This comes with a compromise between quality and speed, where the priority shifts towards speed. A tendency I really have trouble with as quality is one of the main USPs of Zalando. Once raising your voice and defining yourself as outside of the strategy it’s hard to have unbiased discussions as other opinions are not always welcome. The really great company culture is only followed to a minimum in that department and it will still take some time, maybe even other people in the crucial positions, before the shift from managing to leading will take place. I hope the department recognizes the path they have been chosen to take and is aware of the implications."

Beware of what you see from the outside. A lot of big words and branding, but it comes with no real content - this employer does not deliver what it promises. I have seen so much disappointment from my colleagues that I would never recommend any of my acquaintances to work here.  

So many of my colleagues were giving their best to this company and time after time they were not rewarded, they were not recognized, they were not retained.

- Lack of flexibility in decision making, everything needs to be agreed. Progressive change is frowned up, everything needs to have a process, jumping a step in the process is a reason to start a hot discussion.
- High personal rotation, related to first points. Also most of the person in probation period do not pass. After relocating a person and firing it for not filling a high standard, is just disheartened. This has happened 3 times in my close environment.

Also, the quality of your work-life will be completely dependent on the team you are assigned too. Have a bad lead or toxic colleagues? Your life will be miserable and they won't be fired.

She applied for the job, but wasn't called to an interview. I accidentally found out one day that the HR team had booked an interview with her, but had forgotten to write or call her to notify her. She obviously couldn't make it on time as the interview was 30 mins later, but managed to reschedule the interview.

After the interview she was told the HR department thought she suited the job, only to find out a couple of days later that the company now had a hiring freeze. She eventually found another job and started working there.

Four months later the HR department contacted her again, and said that the freeze was over, and that she was on the top of the list of candidates. They asked her if she could start working April 1st, and she agreed. She then went on to resign from the other job she had managed to secure, and waited for April 1st to arrive.

A few days later HR got in touch, only to explain the start date had to be pushed 6 weeks into the future. She was now forced to go unemployed for a month, all because of the HR department.

Eventually she started working at the office, only to find that her team had a highly toxic working environment where colleagues went behind each others' backs and trash talked each other to the team leads, resulting in people being fired for dreamed-up reasons.

My girlfriend unfortunately got sick a lot during her first months, and was eventually fired. It's illegal in Germany to fire someone because their sick leave ratio is too high, so instead she was told that she didn't comply with company processes and was to slow at work. Just a week earlier she had received praise from a superior for her skills, which proves she was fired on false grounds. Additionally to this, they told her that her skills were insufficient for someone who had worked there for 6 months, when she had in fact only been with the company for 5 months (remember the HR department postponing her entry-date?). 

A horror show of management. And I haven't even started to talk about how different teams were given different treatment by management. I'll let someone else tell that story."

-Super low level technical discussions (should we use the same code style/format for the whole team ? or should we waste our life putting reviews for pull requests only based on personal code styles preferences ? does a frontend framework (like angular) have the capability to edit a text field ? does it have the capability to create a pop up ? should we create a simple authorization module for a micro service ? should we use an existing one ? or should we just hard code one admin account ?

Zalando was high growth for nearly the whole time I was there and that's an exciting, fun, dynamic, fast paced place mixed with chaos. 

Zalando is a company that has faults but its also one that recognises its shortcomings and looks to fix them. I love that spirit and honesty. 

Personally, I've had great leaders in my time here who've supported my passions and helped me to better myself and adapt to new situations.

The thing I will miss the most is the people. Working in teams was awesome there. I got to learn from so many talents. Wow. Everyone was so helpful all the way throughout the company and it kind of feels bittersweet to leave as it was like a home from home.

Communication a the company is not great sometimes

I had 9 leads, and whilst I can personally take lessons from each one of them, I think 9 was too disruptive. (this was over a 4 year period with high growth in the business so some of it was inevitable.)

- no consideration given that you left your country to join this company. Fired without warning or reason

846,Zalando,Would to as first job or a backup option,2018-12-08,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Free muesli, milk, coffee, soda. One can order personal parcels to the office. Conference allowances (although burdened with bureaucracy so I never used them). Possibilities to learn something. If you are a sociable type you will likely find your way around the organization, otherwise - no luck. Relocation support is substantial and I did appreciate that. The company has been profitable, so there are no repercussions caused by money shortage. 3 months notice period - will get in the way if you decide to change the job, and hedge you against surprises if Zalando fires you.  Technology-wise, you can get some marketable keywords into your CV, so this could be a good option as a first job.","The place is not for introverts. A fun fact: HR department is called ""Employee Experience"". They will harass you with people leads, happiness surveys, feedback talks, development talks, but despite all that you would be the only person who cares about and can solve your problems. Creepy manager peeking over your shoulder to find another thing to report on you today so he would have an excuse to fire you is not an ""employee experience"" you want (I certainly do not).  As in any big company YMMV depending on team. So if you are being interviewed for a position then ask to have a lunch with the team and see whether you feel comfortable or not. There are departments with consistently high attrition so proceed with caution. If you have an impression that Zalando will give you sort of startupey feeling - it won't. After last year's CEO changes, more layers in management hierarchy, and primary focus on protecting what Zalando already has - it is different place now. In my impression this is a common sentiment inside the company. These changes are not necessarily a bad thing, just do not go there with wrong expectations."

Friendly colleagues (the few ones who stay)
Work/life balance","Very high turnover rate, the only action point regarding this being stopping to report the people who are leaving in quarterly updates so employees don’t know.
There are some managers (and I’m terribly sorry for the ones that actually do stuff) that do nothing or worse than nothing: forget about team autonomy, company’s “core values” will be laughed at.
There is favoritism everywhere. Ask anyone about the performance review process and how fair it is. You will find junior people getting promoted to senior without prior experience, just because the manager likes him/her.
Some people just sit and do nothing to help business continuity - they may play with shiny new tech and make presentations about the findings every couple weeks while the rest of the people do the tasks that actually make the team stay alive. I don’t blame them completely as company supports this behavior, but leaves me wondering how shareholders would feel if they knew.
Internal technologies are all about reinventing what already exists - most of the time a terrible alternative which almost nobody wants to use but it’s forced to anyway.
I could continue forever, it’s just soul-draining and you should avoid joining if you’re a bit experienced."

I have nearly a decade of experience in software industry with 3 years in a Big-N american corporation. Before joining zalando, my salary in my home country was 10% lower than what zalando was giving me. But cost of living in Germany is 80% higher than in my home country. If I am from a developing country, it doesn't mean that I will accept low salary. It was very easy for me to find a job within germany with higher salary than what zalando was giving me. 
The relocation bonus provided by a good software company in my home country is nearly 2000 Euros + flight tickets for the whole family and that too for the relocation within county. But zalando provided me 1000 euros relocation bonus, flight tickets included and that too for transcontinental relocation - its almost laughable.

- Ethnicity based Salaries. Salaried are based on ethnicity rather than experience. People from certain ethnicities with 2-3 years of experience (with no experience from Big-N corporations) were getting paid as much as I was.

- Certain coworkers used to constantly bad mouth my county right in front of me, during lunch. One particularly belligerent german coworker even scolded me once (without provocation and in a rather loud voice) to not to replicate the bad behaviour of my countrymen. I pointed out to him that a famous german car company cheated in US and got punished by the US justice department but I don't assume that every german is a cheater."

Great people on board, tech infrastructure teams are helping.  Challenging projects and constant strive for improvement.  Interesting enough is a shared leadership model, where there is a dedicated lead to take care about you career.  Vp seems to give enough push for innovation.  Stock shares as perks for employees.  Good vacation policy, 27 days and each year one spends in the company gives another +1 day. There is a way to take sabbatical leave.  Huge nice infrastructure in tech buildings, ping pong, cosy chairs,  some game stations and for young parents there is a day care. The team is relatively young,many young families.  One can find a perfect life work ballance. No push to work extra hours, office time us quite liberal.  Hack week event every year ( very fancy and fun).  Team change is not a problem.  
If one wants to try out himself in a slightly different field,  one can figure  out it quite easily.  Huge intercultural team!!! Extensive training programme for hard skills.","Company is still on it's way to find the right balance of processess and in transition from a start up to a corporation.   This means too many changes: in your working space, in management,  in product,  in strategies.  
Understaffed first line management.  Team autonomy and mastery pillars quite often hijacked or given without explanations. Many activities from the top management do not reach the actual teams. Poor support for sys ops topics, especially for Unix systems.  
Poor project management enterprise solutions.  Changes are coming so fast one after another that there is no way to actually implement one change properly.  Communication has improved a lot for the last year and it is still far from being optimal. Quite little number of female developers ( tech management).  Poor soft skills trainings ( fast and dirty solutions).  Very understaffed HR."

- some monetary development as well as flexibility in switching roles (when trained)
- great team management and very consequent  
- they value your performance and match it with your missing rate - if you did really well you won't have a lot of problems -> so keep focusing on great work. If you're ill, you're ill, don't worry and try to put zalando on your priority list because it's your fulltime employment

Performance Reviews are too heavily based on peer reviews so you can easily be torpedoed by a peer or someone unqualified can easily be pushed into a better position

- Decent pay, good equipment, opportunities to speak at conferences
- Nice office locations (Berlin)
- Tons of own Open Source projects, contribution to others is encouraged
- Interesting problems, high-scale environments","- Everything is chaotic. There is not one process that works flawlessly, on any level.
- Technology equality is preached, but some technologies are more equal than others. If you want to become a star, you have to use Scala / React.js. Java devs are belittled, even though 90% of the code in production is Java
- Chaotic hiring process. Be prepared to get the same trivial coding exercise from 3 different interviewers.
- Protectionism. If you want to make a career, find someone in upper management who likes you and suck up to them. Also, start smoking, it will help.
- Constructive criticism is not appreciated, developers are often not listened to (outside their team). A manager is better than a dev, by definition (not unusual in a German company).
- No transparency. People aren't even told what their job levels are.
- Career planning is good in theory, but cumbersome in practice. Promotions can take years longer than promised."

- Probably the golden age of Zalando: startup feeling but a lot of cash that brings stability and room for innovation.
- Amazing Culture: a lot of energy, passion and fun, but also trust, responsibility and ""share and learn from your failures""-mindset
- Radical Agility: Purpose, Autonomy and Mastery. They really are values that we breath daily. So much more than just a good ""theory"". ...just google it ;)
- Startup feeling: we work in small, agile, autonomous, cross-functional teams, highly motivated from a strong company/department/team purpose and vision.
- Transparency: bi-weekly talk from the founders, where is possible to make open questions. I've never had the feeling I could not ask for something. Moreover, I'm still amazed on how much leads make a good example, sharing big fuck-ups (and... learnings ;) )
- Fun: football and ping-pong tables, games consoles, gaming guild, meetups, team-events, and... the famous open-bar Zalando parties!
- International environment: 1st language is English. Stop. People from all the word, from Australia to Canada, USA, Brasil, etc
- Good life/wok balance: forget Rocket. My boss push me to go out if I stay to late!
- Strive for innovation: Innovation Lab, Hackweek, the Shuttle (an internal incubator), etc. You have a new idea? You'll have the occasion to validate it and, if it good, time and people to bring it to live!
- Management and leads listen to us. In the last years, I do not remember one thing we asked that was not done. From cereals and yoga-classes, to better salaries transparency and adjustment to market-expectations.","- Lack of a clear career path, and terms to go the the next seniority level. At least for product.
- Sometimes I have the feeling they prefer to hire external senior position, instead of bringing the current internal top talent to the next step.
- Zalando is a dynamic company. Change is a constant. As a result, sometimes roles or process, are unclear. A bit of mess and uncertainty is a constant. if you cannot handle it, don't apply. Go to Deutsche Bank.

I'm a clean coder and radical agility seemed to blend with my own professional goals perfectly: Purpose, Autonomy and Mastery. Autonomy to create well crafted software aligned with business goals (the purpose component) with passion for the work you do and improving your craft (the mastery component) in the process.

I put my own personal time into learning the skills necessary to deliver the best product I can and I have no problems with that. I love to code. I don't need the company's endorsement to do that, but feeling that you work for a company that appreciates such efforts would be nice.

Unfortunately, RA fell really short from their initial promises. I'm going to be emphatic that I worked at the Dublin office and everything I write therefore applies to Dublin, even though, it seems like there are some controversy about radical agility in their other offices including in Berlin (people claiming is not working).

I understand that they are a business, not a charity. A symbiotic relationship where I put my own personal time into mastering my craft and the company benefit from it by getting a great product is fine, but putting my own personal time into hacking things together as quickly as possible for the sake of achieving business goals is a parasitic relationship and that's not ok. I'm not a slave.

I was never given any purpose. As a matter of fact I didn't have much idea about what my team was trying to achieve until a high profile person from Berlin came to Dublin and my team presented their goals. I was given little bits and pieces from talking to people, but everyone was just too busy with their own problems. I understand that, but I just don't understand why management couldn't do that. Do they actually understand the purpose of my team? I did get a lot induction (radical agility from the creator himself, company's policies, HR, some tech intros like a STUPS one and even fast track to Scala). Also delivery and other management people would talk about what are their responsibilities, but they seem to have quite a shallow understanding of what are the team's goals. ""The purpose of the team is to deliver."" doesn't help me much. What I need as an Engineer is ""The purpose of the team is delivering A so we accomplish B"".

Either that or they just didn't fell like letting me know. Also, in practice, their actual role in the projects differ from what they told me about. Delivery lead is described as a ""coach"", but in practice my delivery lead ended up wanting to tell me how to do my job. As one other engineer yelled at me once ""Nobody cares about unit tests!"". Whatever technique I'm going to follow to deliver what they asked me to deliver is my choice. It's my choice if I decided to do TDD.

I was in Berlin for on-boarding and things seem different (at least on the surface). They have something called ""product circus"", where different teams show the projects they work on. As a matter of fact, in Berlin employees have a one month on-boarding and they get to choose which team they want to join. Not the case in Ireland. I felt a little depressed when I came back from Berlin, as I got to see that I was getting an inferior deal. I was not given a choice regarding the team I wanted to join in Dublin or even given the team's history, objectives, etc, before I joined.

In terms of software development processes, my team is quite poor. Nobody using continuous integration (I took this as my own task and setup a whole AWS Jenkins), not  strong also on unit testing (some modules have no unit testing at all). Test Coverage for others are low, under 46% (line). Exceptions being modules I worked on.

They didn't spend much time setting up processes that actually give practical value, but they spent a lot of time setting up things that have visibility throughout the company (Google Slide presentations, Kanban boards, etc).Things more down to earth, like deployment automation, testing, CI/CD or simply ""the master branch is failing tests on Jenkins"" have no importance to the team.

The team works under great pressure from delivery to ship, so they often work around issues rather than fixing them and take short-cuts that end-up being ten times more costly than following the proper procedure. They have been developing Spark Jobs without working logs for months from day one... I have no idea how they were debugging it... They would deploy the full stack every time only as a work around for being incapable to deploying modules separately (because they didn't want to stop to try to fix the problem)... That cost the team several hours spent in deployments weekly...

Even though my team, as far as I can see, have been cutting corners from day one to deliver something as quick as possible (as instructed by management), somehow management in Dublin decided that their lack of productivity is due to a struggle between ""Engineering Excellence"" and ""Creativity"". Excellence is hurting productivity according to them... My team has no corners left to cut. The only person left trying to add some ""engineering excellence"" was myself and I was over and over ""encouraged"" to cut corners. No writing of ""great software you are proud of"" over there. At a given point I pretty much gave up saying anything. Nobody in my team or my lead ever took anything I had to say seriously (unless it would fix their immediate problems).

I complained repeatedly about these issues and was repeatedly ignored. My engineering team was frequently burned-out, stressed-out, yelling at me and other people. Zalando has a policy of ""be excellent to each other"" and works well, most people in the office were very nice, but in a way is artificial (it's a rule after all) and under proper stress people will break and ""be excellent to each other"" goes down the tubes really quickly.

I openly criticized radical agility (or more specifically the lack of) and that caused me problems. Leads came to talk to me. I was honest (maybe brutally honest), but I sensed that they actually got annoyed and didn't listen to me (""we know what we are doing"" and after all my refutes against their arguments  ""these circumstances in your team are temporary"", that's how the talk ended).

I asked to move to another team so maybe I could find that ""radical agility"" that eluded me. I even tried to apply to the Berlin office. I did believe in Radical Agility and I wanted to experience it.

Suddenly after I asked to move to another team (they also knew that I applied internally to a role in Berlin, which management found out and didn't seem very happy about it) they setup a ""probation meeting"" where they wanted to give me feedback about my performance. It turns out that:

- My technical skills are excellent.
- I work hard (sometimes weekends)
- My work is high quality (high test coverage, proper documentation, I take these seriously).

But they came also with some negative feedback that ""I'm picky about the work I want to do"", which I refuted. My problem was not the work itself, but the way they wanted me to do it, without following proper engineering practices (no tests, no automation, sweatshop code). What happened to ""write great software you are proud of""? So there it goes Mastery flying out of the window...

Still, during my induction by my lead, I was told that I was supposed to tour the different projects within my team and choose one that I would be happy to work with. The tour never happened by the way. I tried my best to get involved into what they were doing without much response (people are busy, they have their own problems). In practice I never had any choice. They would just throw at me whatever was a priority at the moment. Sometimes when I would notice people having issues, I would try to help out, but they would pretty much push me away as soon as I fix their issues (they were pretty busy). I could not learn much about what they were doing. I would know about what they were doing with the rest of the company during presentations.

 When I finished refuting their negative feedback, the strongest con left was ""I don't engage in meetings"" and the lead uttered this in a tone of voice that was reprehensible, like it nullifies all my other positives.

I am an introverted person. I don't like to be the center of attention, but I do provide honest feedback if I'm asked for.  If Zalando has a problem with introverted people that's just fine with me, but it seems to me that they were just trying to inflate my negatives just to retaliate against my criticism.

I was told in an austere tone of voice by my lead (like I was on trial) that ""my request to change teams had been denied"" (without a explanation other than ""we don't think that's the best for you"" like I'm seven years old). I was then told at the end of the meeting that I was to report to my delivery lead, who was going to tell me what was going to be my next task. According with RA, this shouldn't happen. That's up to the team. There it goes the Autonomy down the tubes again.

That's was strike three... No purpose. No autonomy. No mastery. I decided to resign then. When I said I was resigning my lead looked at me like someone poured a bucket of ice water on his head. Their intimidation plan backfired.

I wonder what he was expecting after this. I busted my back, worked evenings and weekends, endured people yelling at me and got myself sick. I'm burned-out and still they kept scheduling these meetings to address my criticism (they seem frightened that anyone will find out that they are a fraud). They chose about the worst possible moment for this ""probation meeting"", which had only the purpose of intimidating into silence.

Radical Agility isn't real. Surely not in my former team, very likely not in the others in Dublin. Feels like Sasquatch to me even in Berlin.

The management in Dublin is dishonest and has no real faith in Radical Agility. They are only interested in keeping up appearances.

I'm a little ashamed to say that I would have just settled down for a non-yelling team (and a shopping mall's Santa kind of radical agility), but I was denied this request and I wasn't even asking this to happen overnight.

In the manner they bluntly refused it, not even allowing negotiation, and tried to intimidate me, just killed any hope I had to improve my situation.

I would like to finish by saying that I do think radical agility is a great idea. It's just that the people in charge in Dublin don't actually believe it and they are too afraid to let the big boss know. They are violating every single one of its core principles in hope that it will get the job done, so the big boss will not get disappointed. A bit like the ""emperor's new clothes"", but in this real live story the magic garments actually work."
