283,Zalora,Used to be a trailblazer,2020-08-01,3.0,Designer,"Probably one of the pioneers who lead the e-commerce wave in south east Asia. Great place to learn and grow. Many of it's early employees have their own successful startups now, which says alot!","Culture was great and very start-up oriented in the beginning.

Foreigners are highly valued.",2020-07-29,1.0,Designer,"Able to expand my passion, creating products for the brand.","In light of pending retrenchments due to covid19, many companies are on a layoff spree. TO ZALORA, I HOPE THIS WON'T BE TARGETED AT LOCALS ONLY. I was laidoff by Zalora a few years back, due to redundancy of the role. As many others did, I accept the abrupt decision, only to look back and realised how the foreign employees who are new, some inexperienced, were saved from retrenchment. Yet they learned from the locals, as obviously, the platform is selling to asians in this region. So what is the value for retaining jobs for foreigners, who treated working in Singapore like a holiday job, while locals who work hard, who have families here, are being axed off without a blink. This is not xenophobia, but if you see reviews that say the same things, there is truth in this. The upper management were friends from their countries, past companies, personal life. So there is a system in place that saved themselves in this company, sometimes quite blatant. On the contrary, locals who thinks this is a good place to work, are dispensable yet milked off their regional knowledge just like colonization. HR who claimed there is no tolerance for racism, is not applying such tripartite laws when it comes to facing management there. So, only work here if you're okay to be dispensable and have a lesser existence than non-locals. I only stayed 4 years because it was my passion designing. When I look back, it wasn't a job to stay at."

- Internal communications has improved since Gunjan joined as CEO
- Generous with annual leave days
- Vibrant and open work culture (more westernized as compared to Lazada, Shopee etc)","- The industry itself is very fast-paced, and Zalora is still a relatively young company that is still going through many changes internally and externally. Being adaptable to the constant changes and finding your own structure in a less structured environment is key to survive in Zalora
- Remuneration isn't high as compared to other e-comm companies (have to manage expectations since retail/fashion is still Zalora's main business)
- Buying team wears many multiple hats and can be overwhelmed with too many roles to play (limited resources and manpower to help buyers in admin and operational tasks - such as buying assistants/buying admin)

- promotions to higher level and/or career development opportunities are hard to come-by. even if there are any, they usually prefer or are more favourable towards expats (sometimes undeservingly so)
- very little employee benefits provided
- office space could be better (offices in other countries are much much nicer)

The interview with the Hiring Manager went well, and after a few days, I was interviewed by the Head of HR.

- Company with Values
As an employee, I must say that I see and feel ZALORA's core values being embodied by the employees. This makes my stay at ZALORA very meaningful.

- Growth Opportunities 
I have been to different training sessions provided by ZALORA, which I believe allow me to grow in my role.

- Openness to Change
I love how the company is very open to changes, especially to suggestions on improvement ideas and concerns. Unlike traditional companies, ZALORA allows its employees to be ingenious and creative into their work.

- Fun work environment 
It's been really fun working with such friendly, approachable, not to mention fashionable employees. There's never a dull day in the office.

- Customer Focused and the value of Malasakit
I have seen firsthand how ZALORA tries its best to put customers first. ""Malasakit"", as one of the core values of the company, is seen as to how the company handles both employees and customers","- Employee Benefits
I believe that ZALORA could look into improving it's current employee benefits to make it more competitive.

- Employee Engagement Activities
I believe that ZALORA lacks established employee engagement activities. More initiatives should be looked into by the management and teams.

- Tough Workload on Some Functions 
Some functions are double hatting, and this could greatly affect the employees' morale and output."

One thing I like is that there’s not much politics within the company. People knows the company goals and how each and everyone can contribute to that goal, so everyone knows they are equally important within the company. 

Another thing is that ZALORA is quite careful when it comes to prioritising what they want to do. Instead of doing everything for the sake of doing, I like how they only prioritise a few impactful initiatives, and go laser-focussed on it. 

Work processes are quite structured and mature, lots of automation are in place, so you get more time to do other higher-value tasks. Work-life-balance is a major plus!

Very diverse employee mix, with people from different nationalities and race, a great place to learn more about other people’s culture too!","Synergy between departments could be further strengthened given that the resources split has became a little more extreme recent years, where marketing mainly sits in KL office whereas other functions such as legal, tech sits in SG office.

- You can make an impact on the company and its strategy, or get your voice heard at the least, thereby making your work worthwhile.
- There are some highly talented and hardworking individuals especially in the tech teams from which you can learn a lot about systems and how the business process affects these systems.
- It is the best place to learn and watch how a company scales and the problems that come with it. You will be exposed to tech, business and operations no matter what role you end up in.
- Within a limited budget, you get to dabble with a range of tech tools, build important and cool stuff and help it in getting adopted throughout the company
- You also get to hone your fusbol or TT Skills as there are plenty of millennial talent available.
- The multicultural enviornment allows anyone to reach to the top provided the hard work and effort is put in. A Zalorians would have a wealth of experience and learnings from his time there","- The company suffers from severe attrition and as a result, the business process keeps getting passed on, knowledge gaps occur and projects are stalled and improperly done.
- The Hiring practices need a total overhaul. Interviews have to be structured with multiple rounds with behavioural and technical assessment in place. the practice is getting crippled with limited budgets and high attrition.
- Have plenty of corporate freeloaders (primarily due to poor hiring practices) which puts a lot of stress on hard-working individuals. 
- Some of the positions in the higher and senior management have less experience in running the business and as a result, poor quality of decisions are taken and management assertiveness is low. Management does not follow up on things and see through to get things implemented until the last mile.
- Management is in disarray and lacks clear vision as to what is needed to catalyze the now sleeping company and rally the employees behind a common cause.
- The attrition makes business process weak and leads to faulty data and erroneous systems in place which takes a lot of time and energy to rectify and develop a new program. Project management of these process requires communicating heavily with data teams which are severely understaffed which delays any new development.
- The company has a limited budget and as a result, the compensations/benefits/bonus is poor and submarket levels which leads again to attrition and hiring of poor talent."

531,Zalora,Zalora Philippines Intern,2016-08-16,5.0,Human Resources Intern,"My internship experience with Zalora was fun, hip, and worthwhile. 

Fun - It was fun because we handled different tasks everyday. There's no way for you to get bored because tasks can range from doing the intern allowance up to interviewing applicants on your own. Did I mention that part of being an intern is access to company related events? Company-related events = party and socializing!

Hip - It was really cool to have no dress code. You can enter the office feeling like the most fashionable woman/man on earth one day or be the ultimate #comfychic the next day. Everyone is free to dress up what they want. This shows the company's given importance to the employees' individuality. Furthermore, the office is very open so you can freely approach a person from the other department. Employees in Zalora are fun and dynamic - just like the company itself. One of the fears of being an intern is to receive a stare from an employee, which makes one feel his low status(intern as compared to an employee). However, in Zalora, interns are very welcome. In fact, sometimes employees invite the interns for lunch.

Worthwhile - I learned a lot of things about HR tasks during my internship. I could say that I was able to maximize my internship compared to my classmates. Not only did I receive mentorship from my supervisor alone but also gained knowledge from the advises and support from the WHOLE HR team. They are concerned with the intern's growth which is a good thing!","Since there are a lot of things to do, one could easily be overwhelmed. Don't fret! Employees in Zalora are willing to help :)"

If they put it in nice ways or provide constructive criticism, I'm more than willing to take it. But the boss I am under uses foul language and vulgarity - if this is your idea of ""encouraging"" employees, it is terrible.

""Data driven"" is an understatement - Zalora is obsessed with numbers, everything has to be backed up with data and this is what has driven the company forward since day1. Customers are number 1 and want to always improve customer experience.","A little confusing environment as it's mix of local and international mindset - for example, the managing director you can call by his first name but for some departments you are to call them by ""Miss/Ma'am/Sir"".

- learn by doing and through exposure rather than through classroom sessions or lectures

- people really listen to your input 

- exposure to all aspects of setting up and scaling the business

- opportunities to move up, laterally, or regionally depending on your interests and skills

- full autonomy as manager of my own department 

- full support from upper management to the CEOs and regional teams 

- flat heirarchy.

- CEOs work down in the trenches with you picking and packing orders as necessary to get orders out on time 

- you can see that the CEOs really care for their employees","- hands are tied when it comes to system improvements as all management systems are centralized regionally

- work environment not for everyone; if you're the type who likes things to be organized, everything already mostly in place, time in at 9 and clock out at 6, then a company like Zalora PH is not for you. 

- co-workers can be clueless sometimes but you can't blame them since ecommerce in the Philippines was only starting at the time so everyone was really feeling their way through what they were doing. Everyone was learning by doing just as I was
