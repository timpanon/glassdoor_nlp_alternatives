7,Zeta Suite,Loving the Unlearning and Relearning Experience,2022-03-31,5.0,Engineering Director,"Zeta gives you a platform to unlearn and relearn by embracing your vulnerabilities and giving large-scale problems to work on. You get an opportunity to work with some smartest brains in the industry who are self-motivated, resilient, and always ready for self-transformation. The work environment is infectious and always pushes you to strive for operations and engineering excellence.","Internally, we are like a marketplace with so many clusters and squads working towards a common vision. The biggest challenge is to maintain active collaboration, empathy, and proactiveness all the time. These are the teething problems of any start-up that is in a hyper-growth mode. I am sure we will soon overcome this. 

The next challenge that we all face is the steep learning curve with so many functional and technology concepts which sometimes become challenging to retain and recall but, that’s what unlearning and relearning is all about and we all really enjoy this experience every day though sometimes it becomes frustrating:-)"

10,Zeta Suite,Average company with lots of hype,2022-03-28,2.0,Software Development Engineer (SDE) II,"1. Good products
2. Paying customers
3. Good funding","The recent 4 and 5 star rating stating no cons are really suspicious. As soon as there are a few negative reviews, people rush to give their glowing 5 star reviews. The negative reviews tell the true story of what's happening inside the company.

Zeta is an average company with above-average hype. The caliber of work is about normal and nothing that you would not find in other companies.

Management at Zeta is below average. Top management especially lacks experience and think engineers and middle managers are the problem. Their experiment with Nova failed badly due to inept top management and wrong strategy. 

There's rampant nepotism where relatives of VPs get roles beyond their competence levels and experienced people get blamed for any delays and failures. No wonder then that people leave for better environments.

People who have been in the company for more than 3-4 years get away for their mistakes with nothing more than a mild reproach from the CTO. Many of them try to hide their mistakes and blame the new people for not understanding the functionalities. How can they understand if the documentation is misleading and the old timers don't respond to questions?

Stay away from this company."

121,Zeta Suite,Pathetic,2021-07-14,1.0,Sales Representative,Just a posh office building and fancy Publicity on social media,Worst managers of all time. Pre sales manager at Zeta seepz comes to office once in a week. Being in good terms with the HR has kept him safe in the company. His team is left off without any guidance and anybody raising a voice is termed as being a trouble maker and fired off. One of the former directors here has hit and sexually harassed most of the female employees. He starts his day by commenting on shapes and sizes of men as well as women. HR inspite of all the information didn’t take any stand and instead supported him. Anyone speaking against this was removed without any remorse by giving silly reasons. Head HR and CEO have no visibility of this things happening at the ground level.

Work-Life Balance: Everyone seems to be working overtime and the company is doing little to focus on the work-life balance. It's not like they don't care about you. But over working is the norm here. You are not forced to, but you end up doing it.

2. Diversity in my team and in the platform team is really bad. We are like 99% guys."

The recruiter and Hiring Manager told really cool stuff about how things are at zeta and especially their team. I value quality work over everything else. I did my research aswell. But fell prey to it. From the inside, it's nothing like what is promised. The interviews were harder than Flipkart and Nutanix. But the stuff done is bad. They don't even follow best practices. Easy trade off for deliverables. It's either we assemble existing things or fix what is broken. Feels like DevOps work for any designation. Startups should focus of delivery, no doubt. But trading of best practices for delivering is unacceptable."

This is one of the most horrible places to be at if you are in Sales. The people who helped Zeta grow from scratch were all laid off without any compensation package and no assistance whatsoever to get any other role. Being a growing company, they had plenty of roles where we could have been transitioned into. The inside sales calling team was kicked off like a bag of sour grapes. HR team is good only on paper and hasn’t addressed a single issue  brought to their notice in the past 4 years. One of the directors moved on his own while his hard working and extra punctual subordinate (please get the sarcasm here) was somehow retained in the company while the rest of the team was shown the door. During my long stint at Zeta, I have seen sexual abuse, body shaming, favouritism, gender discrimination, verbal diarrhoea and what not. People who dared to question these atrocities were fired by the great pairing of Director and the talented HR."

Free snacks
Subsidized meals","This was a cool company before, but recently joined managers have ruined it. Teams are not trusting managers as a mentor. 

Casual attitude towards shift allowances & other benefits.

Health insurance - worst one. Even if you are paying premiums, you will not get health insurance confirmation & details unless you ask. No portal details nothing.

Casual HR's - whatever they say in induction, they dont support for it after induction. They will point out you to someone else everytime you try to get help over some query.

Some people here are since years & have made lot of dependencies due to which new joiners are left with documentation work only. Even if you are able, you will not be able to show your worth as cream layer work will not reach to you in the first place. 

Zero mentoring - people are not sharing their knowledge within their team."

I know this sounds quite motherhood, but every bit of it is true. You will seldom find a workplace that stays true to its principles come what may. We put employees first and prioritize growth. It is no wonder that Zeta's growth and success story is full of home-grown leadership that took on challenges and converted them to growth opportunities. 

You chart your own story at Zeta, and you define your own pace. That's the beauty of it. 

Everything at Zeta is optimized to ensure employees are productive - Be it dual monitors, or a fully stocked snack bar, or butlers who ensure you don't need to get up from your seat for a snack. At Zeta, you get to do what you want to do without having to worry about less important things.","Zeta is an acquired taste - The opportunity space and the freedom to solve it without barrier will either spoil you for keeps, or will hassle you.
