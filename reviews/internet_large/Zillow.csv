Unfortunately, Zillow Offers was buying high, and selling low. That’s not a way to make money in the housing market.

Unfortunately in the recruiting org, there are not enough resources or strong leaders in place to help make the changes needed.
What you read on Blind is true- there is toxic leadership in place that are destroying the team and culture that attracted many of us here in the first place. Many of us are passionate about the Core Values, Doing the Right Thing and interviewing representative slates to bring new people on board. But over the past 3 months- I have had Director level leadership ask me to bend the rule, hire people without interviews and ignore pay levels to bring people on board. When the issues were raised to HR and leadership- nothing was done expect to remove the whistleblower from the roles in question.

95,Zillow,Lacks transparency and humility,2022-01-29,2.0,Recruiter,"When I started it was an awesome job with a dream company at which I earned opportunities that significantly shifted the trajectory of my career. I worked with some of the most talented people in the industry, who truly cared about the mission of the company and believed in what we were doing. Great health benefits, unlimited PTO, 11 holidays, some nice reimbursements, more diversity in leadership than other companies I’ve worked for (though still lacking).","A culture of arrogance and invincibility within leadership, and very little transparency. Lack of cohesion between the company’s compensation philosophy and execution. Recruiting constantly got push back from leaders on offering fair and equitable pay for external employees as internal employees continued to be extremely underpaid, despite the recommended pay scales Zillow’s own compensation team created. Ignoring these pay gaps, inefficient systems and processes, and loss of trust in the company led to a mass exodus of not only Recruiters, but across the company (on top of the mass layoffs).

Zillow’s culture and benefits are strong, but there are a lot of companies that do this well. People stay because they love Zillow, and that affection has been taken advantage of by allowing employees to deplete their work/life balance and knowingly underpaying employees despite red flags raised by Recruiting. In the last year I saw Individual Contributorss to upper Management across various teams worked into the ground, many of whom were then let go due to the shut down of the Zillow Offers business.

All of 2021 was focused on hyper ZO growth and the top-down messaging was consistent that the business was doing incredibly well and growing. Though Recruiting exceeded all hiring expectations the business collapsed due to mismanagement and poor decision making from the top despite warning signs from folks on the ground. The leaders who made those poor decisions, however, were not affected by layoffs. For a company that preaches “turn on the lights” as its founding core value, lying to its employees for over a year and then letting thousands of them go is the opposite of transparency."

Everything was chaotic and just kind of missed the mark always because it wasn't fully thought out or executed well. 

 CULT-like adoration for the company and co-workers when there wasn't a great team environment at all. I heard people TALK about how great it was but when you needed someone, they were not there. Asking for guidance or how to do something was a lot of deflection (I suspect no one really knows the answers because this happened on all levels and all the time) that people don't have time, always in meetings, it's online just check the help articles out. But that brings it back to the technology. Their internal help articles are a great idea if they are well-thought-out and detailed. If not, it's just something that sounds good but doesn't really help or provide a good resource. 

Overall it just seemed like a big failed experiment in offering a feel-good workplace that's going to tell you how awesome they are because they sent out a free sweatshirt but don't actually do great work or support their employees where it counts. No work-life balance, at all."

In addition, promotions are granted to those that do not question top VP levels and Rentals Sales has seen almost 100% churn in women leaders since VP joined. Gaslighting is rampant and the business has continuously failed to understand how to structure quotas and incentivize sales teams.

I have so many friends and connections I've made at ZG I am truly thankful for that. I thought I was going to be a lifer, I truly loved ZG and the culture spencer created. Sadly it's gone now, 2019 it really changed.","They constantly make Glassdoors top companies to work for list. Ironically, Rich Barton the CEO is one of the Glassdoor founders and sits on Board of Directors. If that's not a conflict of interest I don't know what is. This will probably get deleted because Zillow doesn't allow anything negative to be shown or seen. Which I guess is also a positive if you like to blindly follow. 

Absolutely appalled by the lack of transparency during ""The Wind Down"" especially during the holidays. The entire process was poorly handled from the HR rep to the end result. 

- The HR rep was hostile and angry during the initial meetings after the announcement where we were supposed to get questions answered. Questions and confusion lasted the entire week and still to this day. For a company to cut you off the way Zillow did right before Christmas is appalling. I'll never forget the ZO HR rep and how rude she was, it seriously is like once you are out of the cult they don't care. And the fact that the majority of us found out by a press release sent out an hour before the email, because it was leaked- is a slap in the face

- They restricted our access to slack, email, and anything internal so even if we wanted to we couldn't apply internally. And to add insult to injury, they set me up with a recruiter to ""help me transition either internally or externally"" and then laid her off the week after thanksgiving and I never heard from her again. The heartless way things transpired really opened my eyes and made me realize I wasted 3 years at a company that doesn't care about me or my well being. 

- The dates on when we would receive our last check and severance were beyond mixed up. They cut us off in the middle of a pay period, leaving people thinking they were getting 5 more days on their last check that they weren't.

- in their paperwork that Ms. HR kept heartlessly telling us to refer to when asking questions stated we would get our severance within a few days of our end date ( January 4th) and then the severance paperwork told us it was now within 30 days. So, I have spent the majority of the last two months not knowing how to properly spend and save because I was given mixed information. 
This could have been avoided if upper management learned how to listen to their employees. I thought I worked for a company that valued their workers, and listened to them. But it seems that culture left when Spencer did."

Senior leaders meet frequently to figure out pathways forward, ask the worker bees to implement, then quickly pivot to the next thing, at times leaving the work from the original thing abandoned for the newest shiny object.  

Also, there is never enough staff at the bottom to accomplish all the important things, yet new senior strategy based positions are always added. The result is there is a bunch of senior leaders constantly trying to justify their value by pushing new things that there isn’t capacity for. It can feel dizzying.

Sometimes it feels like we barely do any actual work. We sure do talk about it a lot. Of course, this is a view point from someone who may not truly get the big picture."

In less than 48 hours, the message changed dramatically. >80% of the technical talent would be laid off.

We had an opportunity to truly make an impact in our role as we saw fit and were always given the support needed to expand from within our role. For such an established organization it truly felt like a start-up environment.

While the workload was there, I can confidently state there was never an instance of feeling overwhelmed. Work/life balance was/is still an important concept to them.

With the recent announcement of the layoffs the supervisors, managers, and even senior management have been very transparent with the process and I can feel the depth of their disappointment, frustration, and confusion as to the decision of the c-levels, but that's where it ends for me.","The news of the layoff was truly heartbreaking to me. As a working professional that has gone through the ringer with employment the last couple of years because of Covid, I truly felt like I finally found ""home"" with Zillow. I was promised many things that they truly did deliver on, but after working for a while and understanding their business model I couldn't help but feel it was too good to be true. ""How are they paying above market prices for homes, renovating, and STILL trying to make a profit?"" I thought, but just brushed it off. Then the Tik-tok's started rolling through with many industry professionals expressing their disdain for Zillow's approach to ""market manipulation"" pumping up home prices in some hot areas with other reports of them selling homes for LESS than what they bought them for. Then came the sudden news of our halting of purchasing to ""catch up on our books"" as they said but at that point I knew the damage was done. losing millions trying to squeeze markets and it blew up in their face, blaming it on some bogus algorithm when in reality they did not understand the core concept of flipping real estate to buy low and sell high, not the other way around. From the outside in I feel there might have been a lot of pride with their algorithm as they have relied on it for so long, no one wanted to admit when it was going wild. But hey it's just one expensive business lesson for them and hardship for 2000 people who have to pay the real price. It's just such an insult to the real estate industry that such a well established company like Zillow allowed for these things to happen when it was blatantly clear that what they were doing was not working by any means.

It's hard to say I would never work for them again given my team and work were simply amazing, but given the right opportunity I will do my due-diligence in questioning every decision and speak up when I don't feel something is right."

first and foremost, when being recruited they will lie to you. They mentioned to me that you get $150 towards your monthly expenses such as cell phone. Once I started that was a lie. You get nothing towards it. They also mentioned this being a salary position. It is a hourly position. 

Quotas are rising although the company faces a availability issue. Everything is sold out. 

Quota rises but you have nothing to sell. 

The company moves shady, so everyone you attempt to sell to absolutely hates zillow. Agents do not like the company because although the company has said they want to help agents, every single company move made seems like they are trying to get rid of agents. 

There is no such thing as a easy sale. You can hop on the phone with someone who is very interested, once you look at the area they are interested in, 99% of the time it is sold out and you get nothing. 

Churn and burn type of role. 100+ cold calls a day. Call center vibe. 

Mediocre training, 2 weeks of training then you are thrown to the wolves and expected to sell. 

THIS IS NOT A ROLE I WOULD TAKE AGAIN. This company is moving shady, lying to employees, laying large amounts of people off. It will be a mistake working here. Trust me. Weigh out all of your options."

I'm extremely lucky that didn't happen to me.","All of them. Zillow claims to pride itself on being a modern, caring, woke workplace where all are welcome. And while they do make a nice little show of that, in reality, this is a place where any criticism is met with a termination warning and a plan by upper management to work you out of the company one way or another, even if they have to start firing your direct reports out from under you and blocking you from meeting with the head of HR and gaslighting you by claiming that you were the problem all along. While there, I was ordered to tell my direct reports never to share their bonus totals with one another, nor to share their raises or salaries after promotion, because it would be seen as ""unprofessional."" I was outvoted on many hiring decisions because a person seemed like they would not be a ""culture fit"" because they were a woman whose bra strap showed during her interview or because she had dyed hair. Or that we couldn't hire a candidate of color because English wasn't their ""first language"" and that they might not know enough real estate terms, while we hired white people who said ""Relator"" instead of them. I had peers confide in me that they were told that they could never be as successful as male peers or male managers if they had dyed hair or showed any skin at all, even while many of the female upper managers did precisely that every day, much to their career's benefit. Often, managers would make up new rules for calling in sick because they were mad that one of their employees had done so, including asking about the details about their illnesses and asking when, as in when during that same day, they expected they would get over their illness and would be able to make it in to the office. And just in case you think they were mad because they thought people were calling in for hangovers, drinking was encouraged while on the job at times, as there were bar carts all over the HQ office and alcohol was provided at many times at other offices, although I will say that this was a little more under control as the company grew and they realized it would be a bad look if anything became public because of that. Nothing, and I cannot stress this enough, NOTHING, would ever lead me to recommend someone working here again."

ZO really put thought and effort into who they hired and created a really amazing team full of diverse backgrounds. But at the same time it was like a well-oiled machine.
-The health benefits are amazing. The other benefits are amazing. They give you a lot of freedom to work a schedule that is best for you.
-There is high value on mental health, employee happiness, and understanding. It felt like whoever spoke to you was really listening.
-Everyone wants to teach and help others to learn.
-Their core values, properly practiced, are certainly pillars of a great company.
-It really was the greatest company I ever worked for.","The transparency is more foggy than transparent. I found out that there would be layoffs from someone else who is not and has never been a Zillow employee. It was embarrassing that we were the last to know when it was our livelihood. Prior to the layoffs, between the announcement to pause home buying and the layoff announcement, everyone had questions. Everyone asked if there was a possibility of layoffs. Everyone was asking the right questions to decide what was going to happen next. No one ever said “no there will not be layoffs” but the implication to me and to everyone else is that there weren’t going to be layoffs. Higher-ups used different tactics to pull the “wool” over our eyes so to speak. There were analysts hired within a month prior to the layoff announcement. They claimed ti have created 5 entirely new positions to the ZO division implying that it was expanding so much that they needed to create new positions. These positions were annoyed about 2 weeks before the layoffs were announced. The decision to layoff 25% of the company is not a split second decision. This had to have been at least a conversation for several weeks, if not months. The “new positions”, the busy work during the paused time, the encouraging pricing meetings and “plans” for 2022 all feel like lies and tactic to keep people from seeking other employment and leaving before ZO was ready. I get that layoffs happen. I understand that business is business and this iBuyer model was not done properly and the division had to be dissolved. It’s business. But when you’re a company that preaches inclusivity, transparency, and employee appreciation, taking all of these ridiculous steps to keep the hood over our eyes was too much. Hiring people so close to the layoffs, creating “new positions”, answering our questions about job security with positivity and assurance is just dirty. I can’t speak for anyone else but I know that if someone came to me and said “hey there may be a chance of layoffs”, it would give people a chance to restructure their lives and secure their future."

Lead of our org had generally no direction. So many people were terrible when it came to resolving issues. Seattle freeze but in the workplace. Say one thing to you, and another thing to someone else. The business acts like they are inclusive but don't really understand how that extends beyond being race and LGBTQ friendly. Congrats - but how do you actually treat your people in the day to day? 

It is completely unsurprising to see the ZO business collapse given how this company is run. No centralized planning. No processes. No infrastructure. No thinking about downstream effects, or long term planning. Nobody takes responsibility for their own part in situations. Zero people complete tasks on time. People who commit to doing something will often not do it, or do the opposite, without communication to the team. It felt like chaos all the time, and constantly putting out fires. Got hired to do one job, then my role turned out to be something different, got shifted around no less than 3 times, a couple re-orgs, management change and then was surprised at how difficult it was to navigate remotely - all the first year. Senior leaders verbally attack people, have unrealistic expectations, name call, refuse to work as a team - and are allowed to stay on board. Pretend to be on your side, then twist what you say and use it against you later. The most toxic organization I've ever been a part of. My mental health seriously deteriorated over the course of my time here. I've never been treated that poorly in a job, ever.

282,Zillow,good work/life balance,2021-08-12,3.0,Senior Engineering Manager,"good work life balance, right business direction, and good benefits.","lots of politics issue, company not quite focused on technology and operational excellence."
283,Zillow,Meets Great Place to Work expectations,2021-08-12,5.0,Software Engineer,"1. Competitive pay, excellent benefits (no cap for SDEs on PTO, health coverage, signing bonus + annual ""merit"" increase raise)

2. Great culture. I would say people in engineering (or around it) are generally nice and/or helpful and motivated. You know you're working with smart people but you'll still almost always able to find someone who's willing to help, or something to get involved in to network with or meet nice people with common interests. Stuff like getting involved in affinity networks feels encouraged, although sometimes there's a struggle to balance time and work like anything.

3. Excellent work/life balance. This depends on your team and manager, but executive leadership encourages it and in all my time at the company, this has generally been met. I feel able to take advantage of this and sign off when I need to. Generally my coworkers will respect that.

4. Almost every time a major event occurs, ZG will address it from leadership. Whether it's the ""Racism has no home here"" callouts and actions in response to BLM protests, natural disasters occurring in the states, or handling the pandemic with an early full-time WFH response, it feels good to work at a company where leadership seems to push for true transparency, instead of sweeping major political issues under the rug or treating employees like disposable workers. Leadership is aware and acknowledges the importance of personal lives outside of work which was HUGE during the pandemic. I'm not a parent, but there was a struggle across the company with the work/life balance - which we know because they took polls and showed results at meetings. It felt acknowledged and that even when the company isn't solving something, they're actively working on things where employees are taken care of. It took a long time to finalize when we'd be back in the office and what that meant, but the decision to move full-time remote for most workers felt like it took employee feedback into account. They care about retention and consistently get culture awards and I think those things are true.","Depending on what team you're on (like any company), you might get a bad manager and/or team that doesn't fit you. This heavily impacts how your team does things because although there's a bigger push to standardize things, there's a lot of fragmentation on how to do things - whether it's process or implementation. That comes with pros and cons, especially as the company continues to grow. I've had both bad and good experiences with teams, although I felt mostly supported when it came to moving teams. 

Some legacy work, though again it depends on your team. Some teams are working on all cool, brand new stuff. Some are stuck in legacy work that's no fun.

More work still needs to be done across equity and diversity at the company. It feels like the company is a few steps along in this area - gathering data, discussing importance and establishing it in core values for culture, having paid positions in leadership to address equity and belonging, etc. But there's still so much work to be done across gender, race, LGBTQ+ and other underrepresented groups. It's talked about and ""valued"" but despite the awards we've gotten for diversity, it feels like a low bar. Like we've hired some people (more than the tiny average at other companies), but how much has been done beyond that and talking? For instance, how much is career leveling and guides catered towards a certain demographic?

I've been through a lot of reorgs. Not that people are getting fired, but so much is changing in the company over the years. I'm curious to see how full-time remote and all this hiring impacts our overall culture."

All the perks you can expect from a tech company as well as colleagues who were great in so many ways. It's the people you work with that is a big standout in what makes Zillow great.","I have been in the Rentals org (Multi-Family Rentals) for almost 3 years. Over this time, the org has really changed in so many different ways. I've personally had 4 different direct managers at this time as well as 4 different team leads.

When I was first hired, it was communicated that career progression is a focus; promotions happen frequently; and that you can expect to move up so long as you consistently achieve your quota. Despite continuously hitting quota, overachieving, and doing more for the greater org, this has not been the case for myself or a majority of AE's in the rentals org . Promotions are only given to the top 10% of the org across all regions (about 40-50 reps) which tends to come out of one of the regions. Despite this, management has received a disproportionate amount of promotions over this time.

The role used to have a focus on more methodical/strategic strategies of engaging the industry and our clients but over time it's created a blatant focus on activity inputs. These inputs are forced via micromanagement of leaderships and various tools that record your calls so management can listen to your conversations and track your talk time.

If you're looking for a place for career progression and autonomy to do your work, this is not the place for you."

344,Zillow,Lack of career development and earning potential,2021-06-05,1.0,Software Engineer,Coworkers and team are incredibly talented and smart,"The company has a policy where if you make an internal transfer to a different team or department with a more lucrative field they're not going to increase your salary. Let's say you make a move from senior customer service to a software engineering role and have to take a small step down in job leveling. Even entry level software engineers make on average more than a customer service advocate, but HR will reason that due to your ""lack of experience"" you won't get a salary increase. If you make a lateral move, it is the same thing. The company will push back as hard as they can to under pay you while they spend over hundreds of thousands of dollars to bring in external candidates. I believed HR when they gave me this reasoning and was underpaid by over 50k a year because I trusted them. This didn't just happen to me but to other teammates as well. It's company policy.

During an internal mobility workshop, someone asked if ZG will atleast compensate successful transfers with salaries that match with their roles market value. The response was ""we try to make the best offer right off the bat and maybe will negotiate depending on the case."" This essentially is a big fat no."

If you miss more than 2 months of quota during a rolling 5 month period then you’re immediately fired, even during your ramp up as a new hire. 

There’s no real additional training/performance program to help you grow and get better. You’re constantly under the stress of wondering if you’re going to get fired each month. You only get 2 weeks of quota relief in a year, so if you take time off, then you better make sure you’re hitting quota otherwise you’re penalized. You’re also not allowed to work weekends to try to make up for the missed sales to hit quota, and they limit what times you can process sales.

Zillow is spending a ton of money on a churn and burn sales force. Rather than training their existing sales execs, they replace them."

- The HQ was a premium work space for all employees, not just bigwigs.
- If you're an individual contributor, it is relatively easy to do your job and succeed if you stay out of the politics.
- The stock has performed well in the past few years.
- Great place to coast when you have non-professional priorities like starting a family. I was young and hungry, but many of my peers just talked the talk, without walking the walk at that was good enough at Zillow.","- As my headline suggests, the success of Zillow is not based on the quality of leadership or execution. Ultimately there is a need for a real estate portal like Zillow, and the company had such a huge headstart due to wise early strategic decisions, that it's success is almost guaranteed until the next great technology shake up (i.e. whatever replaces websites). 
- Zillow bills itself as a competitive employer to the big tech giants. It is not. The pay is atleast 20% less. I took a lesser role at one of the giants down the street and received a 55% compensation increase.
- It is full of second rate talent (good but not great) or semi-retired folks. That is to say Zillow hires a lot of people that can't get through the more stringent interview process of better companies. Additionally, talented employees who have paid their dues at better, but more challenging, companies will look to join Zillow when they have decided to ease up on the professional challenges but aren't ready to retire. The net effect is a bunch of experienced employees/managers that are teaching/leading less talented employees without full committment."

The company cares about its employees deeply and this really shined through during the COVID pandemic.

* The scope of responsibility has given me career growth opportunities
* Products we work on are generally user centric & making real estate better for consumers","* Politics, politics everywhere! A day doesn't go by where some political statement is made by senior leadership or an event being held that's political in nature. Our all hands meetings are either entirely political, or mostly political. I'm burned out by it in my personal life, I don't need it in my professional life where it doesn't belong in the first place
* The technology is insanely bad. One would think that a nationally recognized brand that is top of class would have good technology, or at least not bad technology.
* Does not have good technical leadership, talent. There are certainly pockets of grade A engineers, but they seem few and far between. In addition, there doesn't ever seem to be technological advancements across the company. Status quo is perfectly acceptable at Zillow. It also seems that they push talented engineers out the door via their comp package, slow movement
* 4 year signing bonus cliff is a killer of top talent & tribal knowledge. Review grants come nowhere near replacing signing bonus compensation, and most take a huge pay cut at the 4 year mark, or devalue their promotions/reviews of the past"

I have never experienced anything like this before. When I was first hired, the excitement to work for such an amazing brand was overwhelming and I can honestly say, they have lived up to their brand. Perfection. With everything going on in the world and Covid-19, no one was laid off. That was HUGE. When our division stopped buying homes, they found work for us in other departments and on other projects to keep us employed. The people are amazing. The benefits are amazing. I am truly happy here and would recommend Zillow to everyone!",I do not have any cons. I love it there. Zillow... is the best!

I love that we are the clear leader in our space but act like the underdog!","I wish that my particular org was larger and/or had a more clear path for advancement with in this team.

Leadership truly care about transparency
Career progression occurs by you taking initiative to learn and do new things.",Moving and growing quickly can mean that prioritization (and especially changing priorities) across teams is not always communicated well.
531,Zillow,Offers more than just a (steady) paycheck to it's employees!,2020-09-03,5.0,Real Estate Transaction Manager,"Zillow truly lives by it's core values and encourages all employees to keep those top of mind in everything we do.
It is a very inclusive environment with many committees to join and get involved even outside of the workspace.
Personal and professional growth is encouraged with numerous courses and trainings available for all (at any level).
Management works hard to improve and support their teams and encourages feedback.
Great benefits.
It feels like the company really cares about the well-being and health of it's people by offering additional days off to recharge and free resources for mental health.
Even though it's a large company, we hear from the C-level execs and CEO on a regular basis.
In being forced to have the majority of the company transition to WFH, they provided a lot of extra resources for employees to get comfortable and stay connected.","It is hard to know what your next steps could be in career development, with there being so many different orgs and opportunities.
It's a very large company and if you don't work directly with certain teams or departments, you don't know what a lot of your fellow co-workers do."
532,Zillow,"Joined for the Culture, Stayed for the Culture",2020-09-03,5.0,Software Development Engineer,"- Lots of internal growth of employee resource groups in the past couple of years, giving minority groups the ability to build a community and push for a more diverse and inclusive environment

- Great work-life balance with many in management setting the example
- Lots of great mentorship opportunities, either as a mentor or a mentee
- Benefits are excellent, especially in terms of health insurance
- Company handled quarantine awesomely, business looks strong for the foreseeable future
- Work-from-home for nearly all employees through the end of 2020, with moves to allow for teams to be more flexible on WFH in 2021
- Volunteering and charity donations are encouraged, and can be matched by the company (up to $100/yr per employee)","- Like most companies, your direct manager determines how much of the company culture is applied to your day-to-day. Many are great, however, there are certain teams which may be run a bit differently, so work-life balance may not be enforced or modeled by leadership there.
- Lots of ""happy hours"" and drinking alcohol during celebrations. There have been some moves made in the past year to address this, by offering non-alcoholic drinks at functions, and covid has reduced the rest of the events, so there may be changes in the future.
- Work-from-home is not work-from-remote, as your compensation is based on where you live. So moving out of CA or WA to the midwest would invoke a salary reduction
- Not much diversity in the exec team, even after several years of ""addressing it""
- Humongous gap in terms of compensation between lowest paid employees and C-suite"
533,Zillow,Supportive Work Environment,2020-09-03,5.0,Event Manager,"The company overall is very supportive of it's employees, especially during Covid times.

They address the tricky, uncomfortable topics head on, striving to do better, do good in the world.

-Company recognition of the importance of a sensible work-life balance
-Sense of community within the company, even while working remotely
-Indefinite work-from-home option
-Company-wide efforts to improve WFH flexibility outside of typical 9-5 hours, especially for parents
-The majority of the individuals that you work with are great people, inside and out of work. There is certainly a Zillow-factor for the type of people that are hired here.
-Transparency from senior leadership 
-Diversity & Inclusion is highly valued and practiced","-Business roles do not receive the same degree of competitiveness as tech roles when it comes to compensation
-As the company grows, most All Company meetings are beginning to feel more and more like stakeholder presentations compared to the exciting and inclusive update meetings held in the prior years
-Upper management is largely dialing down on employee events like Holiday/Summer parties and ZG conferences to cut down on expenses, leaving company-wide morale noticeably lower than previous years
-The amount of diversity seen in the workforce at Zillow does not match the amount of diversity seen in executive leadership"

Not only connections specialist but buyers specialist and agent consultants all those jobs are too specialized, you will get pigeonholed.

-COVID response has been nothing short of phenomenal because our leaders know how to run a business while balancing people, profit and purpose.
-Leaders are willing to change their minds, be wrong and stay open to new possibilities. Remote work is one example. Now that it's in our future indefinitely there's an excitement in the air about defining the new rules of work for ourselves and other companies who look to us for these trends.
-Industry leader, household name, big growth trajectory means we will need future talent to bring enterprise operations experience, rigor and discipline.","-Complicated industries to learn as an outsider.
-The amount of opportunities can feel overwhelming so it requires a lot of focus and prioritization.
-Our culture is undergoing big transformation as offices take on a new role and most day to day connections will be virtual in the future.
-There's a we/they disconnect between leadership and employees vs other places. As we grow, transform and share our successes I hope it will start to feel like ""our company"" whereby everyone is expected to act like leaders and lean in to change things rather than wait for someone with a bigger title to fix it."

The desire to go deep and into the weeds indicates room for management to develop stronger communication or trust and results in a lack of autonomy and team thrash. There's an overwhelming sense of project management instead of product management with PMs executing a vision and strategy they have little control over. Product groups reflect the lack of confidence within leadership and are territorial, often jumping to defend their surfaces and constituencies at the cost of Zillow 2.0."
574,Zillow,Racism in the Denver Office,2020-06-17,1.0,Sales,The benefits and work/life balance,"Given the recent coverage of racial injustices across the nation, I think that it is imperative for me to share a story of when I worked in the Zillow office in Denver last year. Zillow Group is a company that heavily promotes its level of diversity and inclusion; however, it is also the first company where I witnessed racism firsthand that was ignored by upper management and also the first company I worked at where several racial incidences were known to have occurred amongst its employees. As a person of color, I was followed from inside of the company office to my friend’s car by a Caucasian employee. As I began to drive away, this employee physically stopped the car and began to question me about who I was and why I was in the office. They wouldn’t let me leave until I answered them claiming that they didn’t recognize me which is hardly surprising given that there are several hundred employees working in the office with tens of new employees starting each week due to turnover. I was extremely shaken by this event and informed HR of the incident. Having spoken to 2 people in HR, both said that they didn’t believe it was racially motivated but was likely triggered by previous security issues. Firstly, I had never heard of this happening to my white counterparts nor should a company allow for its employees to police others and follow them to their vehicles. I did not pursue the issue further as I felt that my concerns were being ignored and that , as a person of color, I was made to feel as though I had just “misinterpreted the events” or at least, that’s what I was told. This is exactly why people of color don’t report these incidences and feel like their concerns aren’t heard. Towards the end of my time there, I had heard numerous stories of racism being rampant among its staff in Denver. I do know specifics; however, these are not my experiences to tell. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with how these issues were addressed and hopefully the Denver Office will make changes to provide a safe environment for its employees where you are not accosted by coworkers, minority or not, and for it to be blamed on “prior security issues”. I mentioned this during my exit interview, but based on my experiences, I have no doubt it was never addressed."
575,Zillow,Zillow is the best company to work for!,2020-06-17,5.0,Product Manager,"I want to emphasize on the companys' culture here because innovation and technology at Zillow is already known to the world and that they are the best in the country in home buying business. 

Since day 1, I felt a sense of belonging at this Company. Zillow listens, empathizes cares about their employees. Amidst of COVID and all the things going on in the world, everyone in the company stood up for each other, and made sure things are taken care of. Our CEO is in constant communication with the employees on the company's financial position and assured employees that everything is going to be ok, especially during these unpredictable times. They constantly take employees feedback and make sure appropriate changes/improvements are kept in place based on the feedback.

582,Zillow,Best Company I Have Ever Worked For!,2020-05-14,5.0,Strategic Sourcing Recruiter,"I continue to marvel at the way Zillow has handled balancing profitability to humanity and this has never been so evident as the way the Leadership team led by our CEO Rich Barton have dealt with communication and support during Covid-19. When I came here almost 2 years ago, I had zero interest in real estate but was mainly drawn to the culture. And this has been the best culture fit for me by far. The commitment ZG gives to Diversity and inclusion as well is inspiring to me. If I could retire here, I would.","The downsides at ZG are really just hiccups rather than deal breakers for me.

583,Zillow,Chaotic and very limiting. . . You need to be optimistic to enjoy the role,2020-05-08,3.0,Advisor,"Great benefits and when culture is good, it’s very good. You will meet some of the best individuals you have ever met when working at Zillow with diverse experience. There is a lot to learn from all of these individuals and I wish management would take that into consideration more. There are some good engaging activities that take place, some better than others. Zillow has handled COVID19 well for us all. The recent announcement about being able to work from home until the end of 2020 took a lot of stress off of a lot of employees. Would be great if Zillow would honor WFH indefinitely. I enjoy my position more working from home because productivity has increased and I am able to focus on the important things such as... my work. You are given metrics for the work that you do which can be rewarding.","Be sure before taking the position as a Zillow Offers Advisor that you throughly understand the position. The position itself can feel entirely draining at times because it will never be explained to you that it’s essentially a call center. Day to day rules can change in an instant with your workflow. Things you were told the day before do not matter. That comes with working at a start up, but understand they will not honor their word and everything is changing at a constant. One day you will be told that something doesn’t matter and the next day it does. I sometimes think it depends on your mangers attitude towards you that day. There is a lot of playing “favorites” in the office. I also think great intentions have been set for culture, but everyone has to play along or it will never work well. It’s a very big tattletale culture. Growth is not encouraged in the advisor role. Your manager will stunt your growth if it means benefiting them with your numbers. I have heard from multiple advisors that they feel their concern for growth isn’t taken into consideration. It is very disheartening when you work incredibly hard day in and day out and you will never be considered for more than the advisor role. Promotions to management or lead positions are few and far between. I know they are working on this, but you will be told false info to try to keep you in the role.  A lot of whispering amongst management in the office. . .WFH has alleviated that stress a lot. I also wish the compensation plan would be geared more towards the individual and pay them as such. Sometimes you will hear what management has said about you, but they will never address their concern with you."
584,Zillow,"not a real tech company, PM/sales/banking/MBA culture dominates with lots of politics",2020-05-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"My decision to join Zillow was heavily influenced by ratings/reviews here, months after joining I realized its internal environment is not always same as the public image Zillow maintains on media or this platform, may of my colleagues expressed similar opinions. I gave it one star simply because I am a tech person disappointed by Zillow. But certainly there are people with other preferences enjoying Zillow. So my review is not to complain but trying to list some pros & cons from an internal view for job seeking candidates, so hopefully if you do decide to join Zillow, you have a realistic expectation about what you are getting into. It's just my two cents and I try to be objective here: 

(1)for most org, work life balance is awesome, considering the salary. I have seen some few teams with high pressure/work loads, if there is politics or you need to deliver important projects, but for most teams work load is not heavy
(2)the salary could be very competitive if you have previous big tech companies working experience or elite university degree on your resume. 
(3)For most teams, the hiring standards it very high, I have observed a strong favor towards ivy-league & top universities 
(4)Zillow is a MBA/sales& marketing/PM culture dominating company instead of technology & start-up spirit dominating company. If you are coming from banking/consulting/sales/finance background, but want enjoy the salary & work-life balance of tech company, Zillow could be the best choice for you in Seattle. Actually I also found people from above background tend to stay at Zillow longer than people in engineers/tech/science, probably because other big four consulting companies/banking/sales positions in Seattle couldn't offer a better package. This eventually could cause some disadvantage for people in engineers/tech/science, as I will mention in the Cons part.
(5)Work life balance make it perfect to raise family if you have kids or are planning to have. Lots of ex-employees from other big tech companies choose Zillow due to this, at the same time they can get a better pay. I never seen so many pregnant people in other companies, the maternity leave is also very generous. 
(6)Good for young people. If you are fresh graduate just starting your career, Zillow is a decent choice to put on your resume. Many social events, snacks, candy wall, game room, parties. It's like a fraternity with many elites from elite schools. 
(7)Location in Seattle is perfect, the building has awesome view. 

In summary these are following type of people I found successful & enjoy working at Zillow: 
- elite schools
- Project management/banking/consulting/sales/marketing
- stay here for family, kids, work life balance
- fresh graduate starting career","- Company's major revenue sources are driven by sales/platform traffic instead of technology innovation, mostly coming from agent advertisement and potentially instant offer. 10+ years after started, Zillow was still lacking of core innovations/engineering products that generate stable revenue. Google has PageRank, maps, chrome, Android and many others, Microsoft has windows/office/cloud/Bing, Amazon started with platform but later has AWS and Alexa. Zillow is still like Expedia mostly relies on sales & business strategies, and maybe acquiring more companies. 


- Engineering spirit & tech innovations are below industry standard. There is not enough innovative/engineering/research products that supporting revenue generation. Mostly innovations are just auxiliary parts added to Zillow website/platform, make it more user friendly. This make the situation ridiculous sometimes, on one side this company claim it's tech company, many hack-week initiatives, but most projects/research/engineering product delivered are just adding icing on the cake. I have seen many projects not delivered on time, but there is no consequences simply because they don't matter that much. Politics of ownership happens all the time, simply because capable/talented people are not essential to keep the ball rolling. On the other side, sales & business strategy orgs could be stressed out to meet KPI. In reality when a start-up pass the organic grow period, it will get saturated after a while. 


- Many leaders are not tech-driven or young, but they joined Zillow at a good time when it was small. Later on as Zillow expanded, they got promoted due to seniority, not because their ability/merits. For security purpose, to keep their positions, they also hire even younger managers or employees and adding layers and layers beneath them. Then soon you found for such a small/mid size start-up company, the number of leaders are overwhelmingly high. You are either in a meeting/social events or on the way to a meeting/social events. 

- Not so diverse here. Zillow is dominated by elite and aristocracy. To make up for it, there are also lots of diversity hires or promotions due to diversity consideration. 

- You have to know the right leaders, and fit in their styles to climb up. Again deliver results doesn't always get rewarded, it really depends on whether your leaders are confident and competent, or your leaders are insecure. 

- Your credits of hard working could be easily taken by some slackers. If you are not happy with that, 


- Turnover for tech talent is high. When I was at Zillow, there were a chart showing percentage of employees joined the company after you. I found many Zillow employees left the company in 1.5 - 2.5 years. In around 2 years or so, I was ahead of >50% of company employees(partially due to expanding), due to several reasons mentioned above. 


- Zillow could FIRE PEOPLE WITHOUT WARNING, IMMEDIATELY. Under the shining surface of vivid, young, vibrant, caring, tech-start up image of this company, you will see a culture very different if you stay long enough. During my not so long tenure with Zillow, I saw 4 of my colleagues terminated all of a sudden, additional 2 terminated but they were not colleagues I had direct working relationship with. The politics here could be scary sometimes, leaders were in a hurry to mute the disagreements & conflicts. Please consider this carefully if you rely on the salary here for a stable income or for visa sponsorships. There is no PIP or similar plan which provides you several months of cushion time."

There was a lot going on, various learning and training opportunities, that were always offered. The snacks and drinks were top notch.",It often felt like management made weird rules or policies that made no sense and did not take the rest of the employees into consideration.

They are keeping employees updated and informed.,"First and foremost management doesn't trust employees while they are working from home. The constant check ins, daily reports and hours of meetings a day make it impossible to get your job completed. Second of all, there is obviously a fear that we are not going to hit our revenue for the quarter and the pressure is intense. They want us in meetings all day but also to push as hard as possible to be doing our most. This is causing a horrible work from home experience. I feel like management is forgetting that we are having to work in uncharted territory and are expecting business as usual. I don't have time to eat let alone to get up and stretch. I'm so stressed I can't function when I'm not working and I'm having burnout. We are working our hardest and doing the best we can."

We consistently receive messaging from our CEO and leaders to prioritize our families and mental health. We are provided with resources to support a work from home setup.

I could list hundreds of other fantastic things about Zillow, but that would take forever!","Open office spaces aren't for everyone.

-Great opportunities to learn and grow with Linkedin classes, manager trainings, conference budgets etc. 
- Direct manager is great and supportive when needed
- Collaborators are skilled and eager to work together to get the work done","There are a lot of typical tech company problems and some that are unique to Zillow. 
- Hours: expect to work 50-60 hours, not 40
- Not family friendly
- Turnover is high even for tech
- Firings are common
- Fast turnarounds with lots of churn on work
- Teams are overextended and sometimes, unhappy
- Lots of production, not a lot of creative work
- 4-6 hours of meetings a day leaving little time to design
- Too many meetings. This is a big one. Here is the typical approval process: A project will need to be approved by your manager (very typical and necessary), then in a separate meeting, pitched to your mgr's mgr (no problem), and in a separate meeting, pitched to your mgr's mgr's mgr (am I in the movie Office Space? Why can't this be in the same meeting?), then pitched to stakeholders all in the span of 2 days and incorporating all mgr feedback along the way. This happens about 3 rounds a project and never happens in the same meeting. After that, it's simple math. You must schedule 4 separate meetings for each of the 3 rounds of feedback, that's 12 meetings for a month long project.  Let's say you are assigned to 6-10 projects. That's conservatively, 72 meetings for 6 projects a month divided by 20 working days which equals 3-4 mgr meetings a day plus all the normal manager 1 on 1s, team meetings and company meetings. That's why you're in 4-6 hours of meetings a day leaving 2-4 hours for design."

The people I was surrounded by at work, as well as my manager, made each day fun and energizing. There are many opportunities to move around the company, and they encourage you to do so.

597,Zillow,Partner success manager,2020-02-10,5.0,,First of all I would say that if you are able to get into the rentals organization you will love it. Since I have transitioned from premier agent to rentals I have been enjoying work again. They rental organization is looking to split off and create its own revenue stream separate from premier agent and the vibe down there is completely different! Best move I have made in my Zillow career is moving down to the rentals organization!,Premier agent side of the business is where I started at Zillow. It was fun for a time but now has just grown to more of a grind. Up there you are a number and how your day goes really depends on your manager. If you have a good manager who doesn’t micro manager you will be great. The worst part of my experience at Zillow is there is never a straight answer given in premier agent. It varies wildly from manager to manger and how much they like you. Plus there is pettiness that goes on in within the teams and it can lead to toxic environments. Since I have been working at Zillow the quotas have almost doubled and the payout has remained the same which just breeds resentment from the workforce.
598,Zillow,Sinking ship,2020-02-10,1.0,Sales Executive,They do have free water and snacks,"CEO, Spencer Rascoff left, President, Greg Schwartz left, Top strategic executive, Carey Armstrong  left.

599,Zillow,Great Company But Be Wary Of Your Expectations,2020-02-09,3.0,Advisor,"There are plenty of amazing teammates that support each other, take care of each other and help each other succeed- very much that family feel.  There are office perks that help you make it through your day.  Work is quite steady and there are some managers who exemplify the meaning of managers and are there to help when issues arise and do what they can to help you succeed in your role.  The affinity groups are AMAZING to help you feel like you belong, no matter where you are in your life.","Unfortunately, the cons started at the interview stage, but only later felt. In making a drastic career move as all advisors did, most (including myself) were very specific, vocal and very concerned about certain questions regarding our licenses as real estate agents.  The questions were asked and answered and put to ease so that we could move forward in accepting the positions as advisors.  A few short months later after vesting our time and our knowledge into Zillow Offers, we found that the questions we had answered were flipped and contradicted to what we were told.  As months went by, many of the important items that brought us into the role (such as pay, performance and movement in the company) were changed.  As Zillow Offers grew, we were proud to tell customers that Zillow is not a “Bait and Switch” company- which amazingly, they uphold that high standard, but unfortunately, I feel it did not apply to the treatment of advisors themselves. The growing of the company with constant changes made me feel like we were being set up for failure.  When going through your interview process for this position, be wary of the answers given.  If there is something that is a deal breaker for you taking the position, know that there is a chance what was told will be changed under the question asked: “Are you able to work in a fast moving, ever changing company.”"

The rest of the company seems to abide by core values
The company (not team) has exciting potential for growth","I have been on this team a long time and have seen it go nowhere but downhill. Just in the past months 4 people have announced their departure just within the Assessment team of Data Services. And it is no secret that more will soon follow suit. If anyone in the C-Level  reads this it is 100% a rejection of the teams senior management. Any other explanation is simply false. It began with these 4, and many more are now looking to get out. 

The teams senior managers are nothing but a clique of old school business people who's values are opposite to those of Zillows. They work to protect themselves and not those under them. If you are not one of their chosen 'favorites' you will go nowhere. This was 100% apparent in the latest promotions on the team. Everyone saw through the process and everyone knew who was going to be promoted before the process even started. The hiring process was biased and unfair from the start. People do not want to work for shady, dishonest people and your continued toleration of this team's leadership is jeopardizing the whole project.

Survey after survey comes and nothing changes. Low scores across the board. The managers want to point fingers but cannot point it at themselves. They are the problem. They pretend that no other people can do this job or understand the data but them, but the reality is that assessment data is messy but ultimately uncomplicated. Any person versed in data could lead this team to be better both in terms of morale and the data itself. None of the managers are technical and only slow the process down and interject themselves in processes to seem like they are important. 

Morale is at an all time low on the team and people are burned out. If you are thinking of applying to this team because of the prospect of working for Zillow you should think again and look elsewhere. The novelty of working here soon wears off as this team is not in line with Zillow. You will see and talk to other people who love Zillow, their teams, and their managers.

There is a tangible change at the company toward tighter budgets, which has resulted in significantly more workload per person without wanting the spend on appropriate staffing levels. (While the equity and belonging team is doing great) I also feel more expendable as Zillow 2.0 moves forward. Despite transparency being a core value, management in my org makes major personnel decisions without opening positions to the whole org, causing employees at other sites to be left behind and the whole process to become very political and unfair. Transparency is only valued on a technical level, not a people level in my org.

We were not told of this change. After being a successful sales rep for 3 years I came to terms that I would not be able to be successful with the current state of the company and the tools that were available to me. Because of the limited opportunity, the culture on sales floor went from a ""One Team"" environment to a ""do whatever it takes"", even at the expense of the people sitting next to you. Increasing drama and paranoia among reps, even what I would equate to stealing from each other. The reasons I joined the team were no longer apparent so I made the sad decision to leave."

629,Zillow,Learn sales and then get out,2019-11-07,2.0,Sales Executive,"I was an inside sales executive at Zillow and first and foremost - Zillow is a great place to learn sales.  I came in new to the sales industry and Zillow really puts you in a sink-or-swim environment.

This is what you're day will look like
- Log into Salesforce
- Use their dialing system
- Call around 60-150 people a day and try to sell them lead generation

What I liked was that management will listen to calls and give you good feedback but they are pretty hands off.  Most of the customers you'll be calling - have probably been called by Zillow an average of 20-50 times per year.  It can suck but it forces you to be a good salesman.  You'll learn how to overcome resistance, create time constraints, demo, build your own follow up processes.  Zillow is so quota focused (you hit your quota or you get fired) and they are pretty attainable, so you can't just coast.

If you work your butt off and you have sales ability you should be able to make six figures.

A lot of the sales managers I had were really good people that would listen to you and want you to succeed.  

You can really leave your work at work.  The second you clock out you aren't even allowed to send an email. 

Even though this review is mainly negative - I would still recommend Zillow if you are serious about sales and want to build good fundamentals.","I started in early 2018 and left in early 2019 and this company is going downhill fast.   I don't even know where to start.

If you are sales/support (read: Denver hires) they don't give a crap about you as a person.  It's the only job I've had in my professional career where they treat you like a kid.  You are paid hourly and have to clock-in and out.  You have to be there at 7:30 every morning even if you are calling a region that won't be up for another hour or two. Limited vacation and they are really weird about quota relief. They have a policy where if you miss quota a couple times in a six month period you will get put on a final notice and let go.  You have to get approval on vacation in advance and submit quota relief but you'll be scared to do that because you might be struggling that month.

Want to take a vacation the last week of a month when you're at quota so you won't have stress?  Tough luck.

One of their core messages is ""Zillow is a team sport"" and it's the exact opposite.  You'll be part of a 20 person team that is all calling the same accounts over and over and over.  The people who do the best either spam emails (and never get in trouble for it) or call accounts that slip out of other reps name.  I never once felt like I was winning sales because of my ability - it felt like I either got good inbounds or the timing was right when I called someone that a different rep demo'd a couple months ago.

They have done a terrible job at setting up salesforce and their auto dialing system is terrible.
They will raise quota yearly without giving you a raise.
They hire like 4-5 new reps every month to a team because they know people will get burned out.

When they launched Zillow Offers they started removing MAJOR regions and making it so you couldn't sell their anymore.  I had friends in the Southeast that said Atlanta was basically 30% of their closings and they removed the city over night.  They kept quota the same and basically said start selling crappy zip codes that agents don't want. 

You'll go into a company sales meeting and they will waste your time saying stuff like ""EVERYONE BE A LION. GO OUT AND HUNT""  instead of talking about the things that matter to sales people like inbound lead flow or getting better data in the CRM (hmm maybe put a field for zip codes they've bought in the past...) .

They don't really care about their customers.  They know there are major zip codes that deliver crappy leads because they still put their contact form on underpriced/unsellable plots of lands and when the agents complain they tell them tough luck. Prices got so outrageous that I felt guilty going over ROI and showing they would be lucky to even get a 1.5x ROI in most regions. 

I checked back in and probably 30%+ of the best sales reps (many who had been there since Trulia) finally decided to leave. 

In the end it's all about the money.  You can sell hot,  treat customers like crap and email spam as long as you hit numbers."

634,Zillow,I wouldn’t work here,2019-10-23,1.0,Anonymous,My hours were good. Nice view from building,Management doesn’t care about the views of all employees. Managers view opinions of younger employees over those older than 30.  Change is not their friend. It’s like working in a high school. Clicks everywhere and too much unneeded drama. More money is spent on snacks than promoting a good working environment

The executives used to be very communicative with the employees on a quarterly and annual company meeting as well as company email. However, with the new CEO and CFO, there are dramatic negative changes to the company cultures and the employee morale has gone down dramatically.  For once, there is no longer budget for team activity and department; no longer communication from the executives regarding the new changes within the company itself. Company culture has become more toxic and no longer has that tech company feel to it. All the perks have being cut across the board which lead to low employee morale and high turnover rate. Support and mentoring programs are no longer matter."

638,Zillow,No longer a tech company,2019-10-18,1.0,Principal Software Engineer,"Strong focus on equity and belonging is transforming many aspects of the company.   

Much work has gone into modernizing the tech stack, so depending on the team you might find you tool chain and frameworks pleasant to work with.  (warning is still loads legacy lying around.. just depends on the team)

Lots of opportunity to move up through the ranks with so many departures.

As a new employee you maybe be able to negotiate a nice package.  This is critical because after your in HR will clamp down hard on your compensation adjustments, even for top performers.
Many of us joke we should leave to a start up for a few months then come back in order to get a raise.","So many people leave we have dubbed Fridays as ""Farewell Fridays"".

Massive cost cutting is happening everywhere.  Most of the perks that existed when I started are long gone.  If you are coming from a non tech company the current benefits are probably par of the course.  Just think of Zillow as a traditional Real estate company now and not a tech company.

At the time of this writing Zillow is hemorrhaging money in the Zillow Offers business and seems to be cutting everything possible to slow the bleeding.    Related, if you are working in a part of the company not focused on the Offers business expect to be severely resource constrained.   I suppose you could romanticize  this as the rest of the business is getting lean and might rekindle a ""start up feel"" .. just a start up without much funding or perks...

Many people do not know what they working on.  There are secretive vague ideas and seemingly quarterly org changes.   Many in the ""know"" have little to no roadmap or direction to share with most of their team.

Of many parts of the company it feels like they don't want the stigma of layoffs so instead they are cutting benefits, lowering bonuses, etc in order to force people out.  Multiple manages have discussed waiting for certain people to leave."

Reduce EOM lunches, OK. Understandable. But to make the annual holiday party way earlier, on a Thursday, and with NO PLUS ONES is completely disrespectful to all the employees that work so hard to make this company profitable. This time they cut the wrong corner, and it is only for the Seattle office because we are so large. So we get punished because we are growing (while smaller offices get to bring plus ones to their parties)? They say they can't accommodate plus ones because there are so many of us, but that is untrue because companies like Amazon and Facebook still manage to achieve this with way more employees. People are probably going to be looking elsewhere at companies that don't disrespect their employees like this."

Zillow takes pride in their company slogans, however they don’t actually live up to them at all. It’s very much like a high school setting with the way everyone acts. You’re entire job is to text, and call potential buyers and connect them to an agent while using an SOP to follow. 10 hour shifts with an hour lunch, and you must work at least one weekend day."

Very nice and comfortable work stations.,When Zillow took over Trulia the atmosphere slowly changed and not for the better.   Revenue is brought in by the sales teams and when you continually raise quota with the same payout as the original quota it really puts a bad smell in the air and the writing on the wall was very clear.  Zillow has turned corporate greed into an art form.  I was once proud to say I worked for Trulia/Zillow and now I am embarrassed when I talk to my Realtor friends.

Culture - Zillow really cares about its employees. There are various networks to foster a sense of belonging for marginalized groups, career development opportunities, emphasis on well-being and work-life balance, etc.  I also love that despite being a mid sized company, it's still got a tech startup feel to it. 

Internal Mobility - Plenty of opportunities for career development. Zillow really invests in the growth of their employees.

Innovation - Zillow is constantly iterating and never stagnating. I love that things are constantly changing, it really keeps you on your feet. I also really believe in the vision the company has. I see a lot of potential and Zillow definitely is not missing the opportunity to execute on it.","Contact-to-Hire - I started at Zillow as a contract-to-hire employee. The contract-to-hire process was the worst. Despite being identical in function to every other Zillow employee, I felt like I was treated as a 2nd class citizen while a contractor. Contractors get terrible benefits, are excluded from certain events/activities, and when you are finally converted you lose your hire date - so all the time you spent as a contractor doesn't count. One thing that really made me feel excluded as a contractor was the fact I didn't get a z-Pal, which is a program they have for new hires that pairs them with someone from outside their team to bond with and introduce them to the company in a more informal way. The only reason people have to go through this unfortunate process is because management wants to make easier to let employees go if they don't live up to their expectations (my manager admitted this), which is a pretty bleak way of looking at it.

Growing Pains - As things scale up, Zillow has experienced growing pains in a few areas. I feel like leadership really needs to step it up on transparency and communication. As an individual contributor I feel like I'm in the dark on what's going on. Sometimes changes happen and I find out weeks later that something had changed. So not only do I not have the chance to provide feedback and be involved in the process, I don't even get looped in on the change. Lower and middle-management could work on communicating out the direction and vision for our org."

To continue to promote those who lie to agents about what they are paying for, commit management known fraud within the workplace, and cheat the system is not the best form of “act with integrity” core value. After watching multiple hard working number producing employees get turned down for roles they were well qualified for I realized that being part of such a toxic environment was not for me and had to leave.

661,Zillow,"Turnover rate for sales is around 70% (no, seriously)",2019-07-01,2.0,Sales Executive,"Free lunch on Fridays, great benefits, gym reimbursement, free snacks.","I stayed around 6 months. At first, everything was great; they do the old smoke and mirrors trick- free lunch! gym reimbursement! tons of $$ if you hit quota! But the reality is: everyone is extremely stressed about hitting quota and it creates a negative office environment. The well is very poisoned here. I felt like after a month of training and traveling to Seattle, the smoke screen was gone and I realized I had made a mistake accepting an offer. You basically have to hit quota 3 times or you're gone. The quota is pretty high at $8,000 and you're selling to real estate agents that either hate Zillow and have burned by the product before or don't have the money to buy it. A lot of people I know are ""on plan"" meaning they have to hit 3 months in  a row or they're gone, and only 2 out of the 7 people I trained with are still employed here (by choice or not). I personally left because the stress and lack of job security wasn't worth it. None of the managers came and said goodbye to me when I put in my two weeks (which, they tell you to wrap it up within 10-15 min of giving notice, but at least they pay you for the two weeks), which is whatever, but just contributes to the ""you are extremely replaceable and ultimately don't matter here"" sales culture.

I could probably go on, but if you're on the fence about applying...don't. It's monotonous, some managers can be micromanagers, and it just really sucked to work here. Although I took a pay cut at my new job, I feel so much happier and less stressed."
662,Zillow,Zillow Changed My Life,2019-06-28,5.0,Senior Business Consultant,"Zillow hires the absolute brightest people on the planet. You will be surrounded by these people day and in and day out, challenging you, helping you grow and making you a better professional and person. I'm incredibly happy to have had the opportunity to work among such an exceptional group of people. 

Due to the highly selective nature of who they hire, the culture is by far one of the best in the world. It's not because of all the ""fluff"" (free food, free travel, insane holiday parties, incredible events, and the unlimited supply of office supplies to ensure you have what you need). No, it's truly the feel when walking through the doors of a Zillow office, regardless of location. You feel the energy, the drive, the endless pursuit to accomplish the Zillow mission. 

Due to the selective nature of those hired that creates a phenomenal culture, you are then surrounded by limitless opportunities. The best example is a colleague of mine being brought on as a ""trainer,"" so to speak. Though, she was a graphics designer, marketing guru with an untapped imagination full of ideas. Fast forward 2 years later and our mission that was in all of our minds, was graphically created and brought to life physically, by this person. She is now a leader within her department creating marketing ideas, material...etc. You will not find a lack of opportunities because of the limitless amount of ideas that create those opportunities for you to pursue. 

Lastly, leadership. Everyone knows the saying: You leave because of your manager. Zillow isn't perfect, but in my 4 years of experience, every leader I had was exceptional. They were exceptional because their common trait was, ""Servant Leadership."" Zillow's cultural identity in leadership is defined by the thought and action that your leaders serve you. Not the typical environment you see with boss man yelling commands and you follow. Your manager will look to help lift you to the next level and get you to the place you desire in your career at Zillow. 

My life has been forever changed by Zillow professionally and personally. If you desire to be part of a revolutionary company that manages to have a start up feel with a Google-like culture, do everything you can to join this phenomenal company.","The only con that I personally encountered was the difficulty to fall into a solidified team who is seeking a new leader. The opportunities were there, but the idea of bringing an outsider into a solidified team who needed new ideas and change, was scary. Past experience aside, It'd be great to constantly push to innovate, build and bring new blood in to an already established team. This will ensure innovation always occurs or difficult times may lie ahead."

If you miss your quota for 3 months you are fired no questions asked. Quota is $8,000 per month which is extremely difficult since majority of real estate agents have already been burned by the product you’re trying to sell. It’s an extremely difficult and expensive sale to make and very hard quota to hit. Managers play favorites and will give leads to sales executives they are close with. You are very replaceable. You think it’s going to be such a great experience when you get hired thinking you are working for one of the coolest companies out there until you realize you’re just another replaceable telemarketer. Almost every sales executive I spoke to was looking for a new job realizing they will get fired soon like the rest of them. Only about 1% of sales executives last for multiple years."
680,Zillow,"Great company to work for, unless you're in the IT Org",2019-03-19,2.0,Security,"Snacks, good healthcare, diversity and inclusion, LGBT awareness, equity, ""unlimited PTO"" if your manager likes you.","There is ZERO career development in the Zillow IT org, most particularly in the Security space. The company claims to take security seriously, but doesn't anywhere anymore except on paper. The team has had  massive turn over in the past six months. (Which isn't surprising if you consider the level of management turnover in the IT org as a whole.) 

The annual review system is broken. You can get zero compensation raise and zero equity without an explanation as to why -even if you met ALL of your performance goals and have good manager and peer review. If you ask for some rationale as to how this happened with an entire year of good feedback from management the only response you'll get is, ""Let's just focus on the future.""
The annual review system seems to be based on how well your manager is liked by their manager. None of it makes any sense. So good luck getting a raise. Ever.

Honestly, if you are considering work on the security team at Zillow, you shouldn't. You can easily get hired elsewhere in town where the leadership takes security seriously. You can find somewhere where you won't have multiple managers in one year because of turnover. (literally) You can find a place that takes your career seriously. 

The security team has seen high management turnover, zero career development, can't get traction with other teams, budget gets approved (verbally) then slashed over and over. Then upper management says asks why security hasn't solved for X problem. It's because we have no budget or headcount!"

Prepare to question your life choices,2019-03-05,2.0,Sales Executive,"Great benefits, great CEO great workspace with more snacks and array of beverages than you could ever imagine.  View from any floor is amazing.","It's really disappointing because i have a lot of friends that aren't in sales that work for Zillow and they can't stop talking about how much they love it.  Zillows core values and direction and culture is absolutely amazing UNLESS you are on the sales floor.  It is a shark eat shark environment where you can't trust anybody.  Everyone is always trying to figure out ways to snake your deals, which results in a lot of bad blood and a pretty contentious relations with most of your coworkers.  So if you like being a shady sales person in a turn-and-burn environment, this is a great job for you  Training is the biggest joke imaginable and barely applies to what you are actually selling.  All the managers focus on are daily activity metrics since they are under the impression the more dials you make the more business you will close, which isn't true.  But if you don't hit your INSANE dial/activity metrics every day, then you will get a firm talking to.  We are talking on average about 100 calls/day and another 150 talk minutes on top of it.  You don't have time to strategically prospect and build relationships.  I barely feel like i have time to take lunch.  On top of that, it takes 70% of the team until the last day of the month to hit quota, so the stress literally never subsides.  I stress like MAD when on vacation because you literally need every day possible to hit your goals.  This is absolutely not how a job should be.  I never felt able to breathe and cruise for just a day or two.  The best part is that at any point in time you literally only have 3 month of job security.  You are put on a PIP if you miss two month in a row (even by a minuscule amount) at that point you MUST hit 2 consecutive months to not get fired.  I have seen so many talented people who just had a few bad months get let go.  I have always wondered why Zillow Sales doesn't focus on developing existing talent.  They much prefer to do hiring classes of 30 people every couple months and just see who can actually last.  The turnover is absolutely mind blowing and i'd say the average tenure of an SE is 8-12 months.  The product is hard to sell because so many agents have been burned by Zillow.  What you do when you invest in Premier Agent is called GAMBLING.  I didn't feel comfortable selling agents on a product that probably isn't going to make them money.  It felt like i was stealing from good people."

702,Zillow,Fix engineering pay in Irvine,2018-12-23,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Zillow overall was a great company. Collectively it’s a company that is consumer focused which also means it’s always focused on the long term. The CEO and the marketing people are probably some of the best in class. The company had a mission that I really believed in. I came to Zillow with an intense passion for what I do and despite the company’s shortcomings, for a long time, it was tolerable.","The biggest problems with Zillow Irvine is the abysmal compensation for all engineering and the interactions with HQ. Many Seattle engineers and managers will give you face but don’t really respect your opinions as engineers. The teams in our office were years ahead of Seattle on both software and operations technology yet we typically heard about how Seattle was the first to do X, 2 or 3 years after us. I consider myself and my colleagues quality engineers who deserved the same respect the two large offices receive. Zillow’s success largely depends on the important work we did.

The real root issue here is that Seattle treats the Irvine office, as well as others, as the “cheap labor” of the company. All levels of engineering here are paid shockingly below market for this area and even further below Seattle. Yet, The average home price in SoCal costs $300k more than Seattle (which Zillow, of course, is very aware of). There are lot of people living pay check to pay check who can barely afford their rent. People (especially those with families) come to work stressed on paying their bills on time. After many internal survey comments from many people, nothing’s really been done to address the massive pay gap even though equity is preached HEAVILY. Zillow uses stock to compensate employees but the issue there is that it’s basically worthless and it’s artificially kept low because Zillow reinvests or dilutes it’s own equity as soon as the price rises above most of our strike price. Zillow Irvine will lose a lot more talent if this trend continues once people realize they’re being grossly underpaid.

Also as the company has grown, a lot of the fun things about the culture have disappeared because they’re simply not allowed to have fun in a lot of ways. I’ve worked at larger companies that were still able to maintain a fun culture and somehow avoid a lot of trouble that Zillow finds itself in from time to time."

I wasn't thrilled at working in a call center environment but the benefits, pay and people outweighed that. The biggest reason why I stayed at Zillow is because of the top notch benefits and the people. I would say about a third of the managers I had were excellent leaders. They kept me there. They didn't just say they valued my opinions-- their actions SHOWED me they did. Ultimately, Zillow gave me experience in a corporate environment and helped me develop skills that I now use in my dream job. For that, I am grateful!","The first year in PAC was great. People had their complaints but I realized that every company had their office politics. However, as the company grew FAST-- things changed.  Management changed and department moral declined. I would go to all hands meetings and Spencer and Amy would deeply inspire me. Then I would go back to a department that felt so separate from the rest of the company. We weren't included in many functions that the rest of the company participated in. I realize that business needs dictate scheduling but there is always balance. Management spent so much time trying to convince us that we were no different than any other department when they could have exercised humility and OWNED IT. WE WERE DIFFERENT and you know what? That is okay. All I ever wanted was for management to admit that. Also,  I understand that mistakes are made in corporate environments. That does not frustrate me. What frustrated me was that genuine apologies were never made, only excuses. I'm fairly confident I will receive a response to this assuring me that ""management did admit when they were wrong!"" An apology is not ""well, you know, possibly the messaging was not the most effective and we are looking into maybe changing this. However, the reason this happened is because we were in a time crunch and we were doing the best we could with the resources we had."" An apology does not include excuses. It is simply, ""We are sorry for our actions and we will strive to do better."" 
Thankfully, for my last bit of time at ZG-- my team lead kept me engaged. They are the reason I stayed and I am so grateful for their encouragement and effective leadership skills. 
Additionally, leadership was constantly asking for honesty and feedback. So, in skip levels, occasionally, I would speak up. I learned quickly that this was not effective. Generally, the response from management was: ""Thank you so much for sharing! However, do you realize how good you have it here? Most jobs didn't have free food and top notch benefits."" I must have heard 10 different versions of that answer. Again, I understand that you cannot just allow people to sit and complain without bringing up possible resolutions. I am not suggesting that managers should sit and allow people to vent without end. If your employees are venting in a kind and professional way, as a leader, you should listen and do your best to help them problem solve without making them feel like their thoughts and ideas are not valid. PAC had so much potential to be an amazing department (even with scheduling differences and limited access to functions and meetings). Unfortunately, during the time of my recent departure moral was continuing to decline. There are great people in PAC. People who care and who lead with kindness and humility. It is my hope that those people will take action and grab hold of the amazing idea that PAC stemmed from. I genuinely believe that the solution to many of the problems here is honesty and a willingness to be humble when you make a mistake."
707,Zillow,On the surface it's great; in reality - it's dangerous,2018-11-24,1.0,Client Engagement Team Lead,"The benefits and shiny offices will keep you coming back, until the cons below make you go running home.",I could go on and on in this section but it's best to keep it simple and to the point. Zillow Denver offices are unprofessional and unsafe. This is a frat house culture. I was forced to drink alcohol (even though I'm under 21) while on the clock. I witnessed people be terminated for having disabilities. Everyone in PAC hates their job but the pay and benefits keep people around. However this enables Zillow to pressure their employees to break the law while on the clock.
708,Zillow,"Excelling in Inclusivity, Equity and Belonging",2018-11-19,5.0,Account Manager,"A lot of companies give lip service when it comes to addressing inequities around sexuality, gender, and diversity in the workplace.  Because we were so driven product wise for years it felt like maybe that is all Zillow will be; lip service.  Last few years though I am inspired and impressed by the excellent work from C level down in advocating for inclusivity, equity and belonging for everyone.  
It is not easy work and we still have ways to go but I can confidently say we are authentic at Zillow about our commitment.  For example, in the past few months, I have been able to communicate and get support around issues of bias that a few years ago I wouldn't have felt safe to address.  I can't say enough how valuable this has been.

If we at Zillow keep going as passionately about this aspect of our culture as we have been the last two to three years we are going to be a model in the technology industry and beyond about the business and cultural value of making all employees feel welcomed and part of an organization.   Because of the leadership buy-in, I believe we will continue on this path.  

Also, you work with some of the smartest people in their given specialties.  Come in hungry and open to learn you will grow.   You will never get bored here if you are curious and you lean in. 
Work-life balance is ample and promoted.

711,Zillow,Not a place if you want a real career in sales,2018-11-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some good in-office perks, good healthcare, great peers","Complete misalignment when it comes to sales career. Management focuses too much on making sellers do administrative work - answering support calls, dealing with cancellations. It takes away time from selling.
Monthly quotas are extremely short sighted. All real software companies have annual or quarterly sales goals. You aren’t allowing your sellers to think strategically and grow customer relationships for larger deals.
 Zillow promotes employees to managers who hit sales quota, most don’t make good managers - they have no experience coaching or advising rather just focus on looking good to upper management."
712,Zillow,Great opportunity,2018-11-06,5.0,Client Engagement Specialist,"Honestly the best position I've ever had. There is so much this company offers you as a whole, with full paid health benefits, great pay and career development I can't see why anyone would have anything negative to say. Yes we are going through some changes that I can say can be difficult on some people but it has to be done to make the consumers and the agents have the best experience with Zillow. I've worked for companies in the past that would never give you any opportunity to grow and with this company they don't want to hold you back at all. We do work 4/10s but we also get three days off which helps with my schedule perfectly so I can have more time with my children. They also very understanding with your personal issues like sick time, mental health and PTO. When your sick or have a family emergency, no problem. Zillow fully understands what your going through, they will give you the time off you need to help yourself or fix your family issues. Which to me is almost unheard of in other companies I've worked for. No matter if I felt like I was near death I had to go to work in the past. The Affinity groups are great as well, these groups help you build connections with other people in different positions at Zillow so you can promote yourself internally. I love working here and can't wait to see what the future holds for me and for Zillow.",The only con is I wish we can get more notice for changes in the SOPs due to I feel like people feel rushed and more errors occur.
713,Zillow,Don't Wake Me Up,2018-11-03,5.0,Marketing Analyst,"Vision - In a tech hub like Seattle there is an excess of great ideas in a very central location and Zillow is no exception to that. The idea itself was grand ""creating the worlds largest and most vibrant home buying and selling platform"" but it takes the will to think big in order to make a company worth investing in, Zillow has done just that

Flexibility - When something isn't working Zillow's leadership team is not afraid to retool and rework it's original plan. This is an underrated trait of any company in my opinion because it means that you'll have to admit being wrong, which isn't as easy to do for some C level execs. 

Leadership - speaking of the leadership team: Spencer Rascoff, Jeremy Wacksman, Stan Humphries, Rebekah Bastian, Lionel Lee, Jas Thind, Amy Bohutinsky and the numerous other fantastic, qualified names I've left out on this list are outstanding. They are the engine of this well oiled machine and the company's success is a function of their ability to simply do the right thing. 

Autonomy - there a few sub points to this one for me including how I'm compensated (which is excellent) but I feel everyone should be trusted to do their job, that mean's not being micromanaged or harassed in any way. Zillow has a knack for putting its money where its collective mouth is and employing people who they know fit the culture and then trusting those people to do their job the right way by giving them all of the resources necessary. Excellent. 

I could keep going but I'll cut it short","The Grind - I'll admit, when you're a company as large as ours it can be easy to lose sight of the purpose of your day to day at times. We have high expectations to deliver and at times that can mean doing a lot in a short amount of time with little understanding of who it benefits, it's a numbers game and at times that can make Wednesday afternoon at 3pm a drag. 

Distractions - I used to work for a start up and even then it was hard to keep my email, Slack notifications, distracting open office chatter, and myriad of calendar invites to a minimum so that I could simply work and Zillow is no different. In fact, I would argue that the size of the company makes said distractions a bit of a headache, definitely something to consider if you, like me, struggle with simply staying focused on the task at hand."

They encourage you to work your way up within the organization, whether that is within your team or not. The rentals division specifically is a fast growing section of Zillow Group, and still has a ""start up"" feel within a larger company. The product sells itself at times, and as a sales rep you function very independently. Your success is largely determined by your ability to function independently and learning as you go.  

I have been in this role for over a year, and still find it engaging and I am excited to come in to work everyday. Great leadership team, and you are trusted as a team member to get your job done most likely because of their confidence in the extensive interview process.","The ""start up"" feel is not for everyone, and if you do not like constant change this is not a role for you. Travel can be extensive at times, but it is necessary and you are largely in control of when/where you travel which helps prevent burning out."
716,Zillow,"Best Job I've had, and I have had plenty....",2018-10-23,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"As a college student working towards a degree it is difficult  to find a job that seems to work with you. I originally worked at another large corporation that shall remain nameless, but was very hard to work with my school schedule. Dotloop is apart of Zillow, but seems to work as a small company within a large company. The benefits of working at Dot loop are tremendous, the pay is good for the area and economy, the healthcare is great,  there are free snacks in the office, along with free yoga just to name a few.  The schedule for my position varies, from am to midnight Monday- Friday, and am to pm on the weekends, but they are willing to work with you as they offer Paid time off, and Sick leave separately.  The offices have different networks that discuss varies topics like investments, disabilities, and a network for each office that informs everyone of what is going on in the city or if you just need a helping hand. Overall my experience so far at Dot loop has been unmatched, and as a former flight attendant, casino lead, optometrist apprentice and many other jobs I could name this experience is fantastic.","The downside of this job, is that in Cincinnati there are not as many opportunities to move forward in specific fields, as it is a smaller office. With that being said there are other offices we have including Seattle, Phoenix, and San Francisco just to name a few that offer tech, customer support, HR, and Accounting.  They are willing to let you move forward to different offices if possible."
717,Zillow,"Great company, but PAC is a disappointing department",2018-10-21,2.0,Client Engagement Specialist,"The perks and benefits of the company are obviously one of the best things about working for the company. Medical/dental/vision all offer great coverage, the well stocked kitchens are great, and the amount of PTO offered is generous.","Unfortunately, the cons of working in PAC seem to outweigh all the benefits the company has to offer. The company is headed in a great direction and does have a bright future, a lot of which depends on what the PAC department does, but they're not set up to fulfill this vision yet. The department is incredibly understaffed, particularly on weekends. This creates a negative environment because we are not living up to our promises and are setting ourselves up for failure. It's hard to remain motivated when you there are times that you simply cannot succeed, just because there are not enough people to do the job needed to be done. On days when the department is not running hours and hours behind schedule, there is still the problem of the job just being mundane and monotonous. For some, it may be an ideal position because it isn't the most mentally challenging job (though it is mentally draining), but for others with more ambition it can be a bit too simple. The Denver office,  while growing, does not offer a lot of opportunities for growth in other departments, unless you're wanting to get into a sales role. Most of the job opportunities available will be at the headquarters in Seattle, which is unfortunate for those who do not wish to relocate. There are many other headaches that come with working as a Client Engagement Specialist, such as poor communication and lack of transparency at times, but right now the biggest issue is just the fact that the staffing levels are not set up in a way for us to do our jobs the way we should be doing them. They preach about a 6 Star experience for Beth, yet there are times that we're delivering a 1 star experience, if that. If the company has a specific vision, we should not begin executing it until we can do so in a way that provides our consumers with the service they deserve."

Management will ensure that you know you are at the bottom, and will go out of their way to make you remember it every day. The will gossip, openly judge you about non-work related aspects, and prevent you from ever trying to progress professionally. Zillow likes to shout that they are a great place to work, but there have been multiple occurrences where employees have tried to speak up and the result was always the same: nothing. Then based off previous comments to reviews they will reply with ""we have not heard this level of feedback prior"". Unless someone along the chain is purposely preventing them from hearing this feedback, then this just goes to show how hard they work to keep up this facade of a great place to work."
719,Zillow,9 Year Veteran,2018-10-17,5.0,Strategic Business Advisor,"9 years ago, I started with a handful of sales generalists at Trulia.  We quickly grew from a 5 to 200+ person sales organization, underwent an IPO, and successfully united with the Zillow Group family through an acquisition in 2015.

I can genuinely say that each year has felt like an entirely new startup company while still preserving the momentum and progress we’re creating. Personally, it has made my 9 years fly by incredibly fast.

But it’s not just fast and fun times with the BEST benefits and people...

My time here has proven to me that the leadership at ZG is thoughtful about our future.  I absolutely trust that the company can navigate our disruptive industry and is willing to innovate to the degree that most companies seemingly only talk about.

While I feel like we’re only now at the top of the roller coaster ride, it’s completely reassuring to know the company I’m committed to is equally committed to me both personally and professionally.  I’m proud to be part of Zillow Group and am excited for our future.",Every industry is facing change.  Zillow is not afraid to embrace change for the long term mission.

Spencer truly is a nice guy, and does care about the company.  However, when it comes to integrity - the truth is you are an employee, a number, and while they want you to be loyal, it will not be returned.   I had seen many great, hard-working people be manipulated and terminated, while some were allowed to walk on water.   

2. When a class action wage lawsuit was brought against them, they did what any company would do - paid what they were told and not what they really owed, leaving out employees who should have included but were not named.  Is this because they didn't have the money to pay everyone? I believe it comes down to  bonuses and stock prices.  Don't believe me, look up the executives salary and everyone else's.  Yes, executives should be paid more, they have a lot of responsibility, but should that be 300 times more than you? 

3. Stay long enough and peel behind the curtains.  Hope you don't have to stand up for yourself because HR is not there to get your back, they are there to protect the mothership.

4. Pay has never been very high.  Beware that when they decide to bump the pay for a position, your pay may remain the same.   Yes, you may have a year of experience and being paid $10,000+ less than the guys and gals who haven't started yet.

The entry position is a very easy CES position which is where most begin their Zillow career. However, there isn’t much of a system to monitor employees. You can be a top performer on your team and/or in the department, and the treatment is the same as the guy sitting next to you doing half the work but taking double the breaks. They claim this is monitored, but there doesn’t seem to be much managing of the “slackers”. Top performers are rarely recognized by upper management and receive zero incentive for their hard work and dedication to the company. It sucks.
As managers are encouraged to help with career development,  the room for growth is sparse and the demand is high.
A survey is sent out to employees to provide feedback and every time I fill this out, I voice my opinion about compensating top performers and I never ever hear a word about it. They stress “power to the people” and that they hear us, but this topic continues to go unheard. It’s so un-motivating especially to the people who are actually dedicated.

There are many agents and brokers that see great success because of their advertising with Zillow Group. It really does work, when they work it.","The problem is with the man in charge of the sales organization. 

He does not align with the values of the company. He is dishonest. That's actually the nicest and most professional way that I can say it. While I was there, and since I left, I have watched him destroy the careers of, push out, and ridicule some of the most talented salespeople and sales leaders that I've worked with. I had many 1 on 1 conversations with him over the years that left me feeling sick to my stomach. The way he views and treats the people whom are ""beneath him"" is not representative of how the CEO thinks or operates. So many talented people have left within the past couple of years, but not him. It begs the question; what does he have on them?

Training is exceptional. If you want to learn how to sell, Zillow offers some of the best training top to bottom. From learning how prospect, qualify, and close, you will get a great crash course on how to truly sell.

Best product on the market as well. Yes there are competitors, like with any business/product, but Zillow is the most known. Some agents will buy from you for the simple fact that you’re calling from Zillow.","The culture of the Orange County office specifically has changed a lot in the last year. One of the core values is Orange County is a destination sales career. This is getting less true by the week. The Orange County office specifically is beginning to see an exodus of talent and employees who have worked with the company for a substantial amount of time. This isn’t a coincidence and over the past 6 months it’s gotten harder to ignore.

Loyalty is lost with Zillow. If you’re the #2 sales executive in the company you will still be let go if you don’t hit your quota for 3 consecutive months. It’s a very “what have you done for me lately” role...

But they will make exceptions for people they “like.” There have been instances where someone has missed quota for 3 months but an exception was made. Get on their good side.

One of the biggest things Zillow preaches is that you have to fit within the culture. They offer no movement for lateral mobility (in the sales executive role) unless you have consistently met your quota for a year or more. This is a little confusing because there are openings regularly in different departments. If Zillow truly only hires 1% of the people they interview and they deem them a cultural fit, wouldn’t it make sense to let them move into a role where they might succeed?

748,Zillow,Good company but not challenging,2018-07-16,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,Wlb is awesome. People are very friendly and downtown location is good. Company is expanding quickly into new areas and growth is amazing.,"As some others have mentioned that compensation is a bit lacking though not too much.
My major gripe is that work is not very challenging. It is tedious and needs you to think about how people will use it best but from a purely engineering perspective it is not hard and doesn't meet the rigor that you expect. And you can argue that you should engineer what people want to use but sometimes I feel my skills are underutilized and getting rusty."
749,Zillow,Senior Business Consultant/Senior Sales Executive,2018-07-12,5.0,Senior Business Consultant/Senior Sales Executive,"Zillow was a great place for me to grow as a sales professional over the past 4 1/2 years. I experienced a ton of change throughout my tenure, and even more personal growth. This is a world class organization at ZGOC. There are some great leaders starting with a Senior Director who will be dearly missed when she heads north. The people are great here, that’s what I will miss the most. The product is best in the industry when used and scaled properly by the Premier Agents. The sales processes are great and ever evolving with consistent and ongoing training. The performance of the ZGOC sales team is the best in the company, and I am proud to have been a part of it. There’s a strong financial opportunity for top performance.

Zillow Group as a company truly follows its core values while working towards a strong and ambitious mission. Culture is amazing, benefits are awesome: health, 401k, fun office environment, award dinners, catered Friday lunches, food, coffee, ZG week in Seattle....","It can be a grind, but when things roll they’re great.

Change happens fast, not a total con, but be ready to pivot at times and trust the process.

758,Zillow,Poor Management Taking Zillow Backwards,2018-06-25,3.0,Performance Consultant,"I'm very grateful for the years that I worked at Zillow as it helped me grow professionally and their decent compensation and solid benefits really helped financially. Back in 2013 and 2014 I had a few great managers that helped my growth. From 2015 on the managers I had were a mix of horrible, pathetic, and okay. More on that in the cons section.

- Sweet office (in Seattle) and I was friends with a ton of co-workers. That was one of the only things that kept me coming in my last couple years. The close friends I had and got to see everyday (sometimes the bond was really strengthened out of our disdain for management), the views to enjoy every day, the plethora of free snacks and coffee. That was all great!
- Zillow is a fairly important company in the tech world. It was exciting to be involved in something that had such a large reach.
- Travel (depending on the department) really was enjoyable and helped break up the mundane Monday through Friday.

There are enough Pros to make this company worth consideration for employment. I can't in good conscience say it's a bad company - it's a company that used to be really fun and pretty great, and has slowly sunk into mediocrity and isn't very fun anymore. The last few months I found myself consistently not wanting to get off the elevator and put in another 8, or should I say 9+, hours. 

If you are considering working at Zillow, be sure to read some of the negative reviews too and think about working in that environment. I'm not saying don't do it, I just want to encourage you to have done your homework - it's not all sunshine and daisies like most people will lead you to believe.","Where do I even start? 

Why don't I start with my co-workers that got fired for made up reasons just to get rid of them. You better be careful about being an employee that works hard, performs at or above average, and asks management the tough questions in an effort to try improving the company or department. You will be viewed by management as a problem, someone that ""questions"" them and ultimately as someone to get rid of. Since I've left I've heard of this happening to a few other colleagues of mine that were fine employees. Zillow encourages employees to provide feedback, but what they should really say is ""you can share your ideas with us but we're going to say no because we know better, and if you continue to bring up your recommendations you may not ever have the chance for giving that feedback again."" It's mind boggling how a company does this. A lot of the employees that write positive reviews are just blind to these firings - and to Zillow's ""credit"" they do a great job of hiding it.

For most of my tenure I was on a thriving and growing department of about 40 people and then it was quickly run into the ground - and actually cut entirely - by the actions of the most unprofessional management group you can ever imagine. A few years ago about half of the management team was inherited from a merger, and they were what drove this department into the ground. There's no point in giving further details, my point is that I can't believe upper management allowed this to take place. Simply pathetic. The whole way through this downward slide I was consistently vocal that things should be going the opposite direction. I had numerous colleagues thank me for being the one that spoke out, however, management told me I was a ""problem"" and on more than one occasion wanted me to apologize - I didn't. I'm confident I wasn't further reprimanded since I was a top producer. I eventually left that department (before it got cut) because I got sick of being treated like a child. It didn't get a whole lot better in the next department as I continued to be treated as junior level employee, and not like someone that had been with the company for half a decade.

Another major reason that I left Zillow was that when I transferred departments (from Onboarding to Premier Broker), going into a more difficult and important role, I was asked to take a $12,000 annual pay cut. No commissions I'm hiding to throw off the numbers - this was a legitimate huge pay cut. Oh, we were promised that we would be getting at least some sort of bonuses starting later in the year, but that didn't happen and that's a whole other story. None of us believed the bonuses would actually happen, we knew it was just more deceit and lies from management in an effort to string us along, again. Anyways, when I poked and prodded about the proposed pay cut it was explained that this was in an effort to minimize the gender pay gap. I was told that Zillow was going to start putting people at the same pay when they joined a department regardless of their seniority, tenure, etc. to make sure that men and women were not paid differently. Keep in mind, this was shortly after Zillow reported that they paid women $1.01 to every $1.00 that men make. In the end management agreed to meet me halfway, so I decided to take a fairly healthy pay cut in the name of equality.

You can see why I left, can't you?

I've seen so many grievances take place against my co-workers that I couldn't even begin to list all of them; I would be typing this review for the rest of the day. I suppose some mismanagement is to be expected in any quickly growing tech company, but it's hard to imagine it being much worse than it is at Zillow. Don't even get me started on some of the problems in Denver too, holy cow is that office completely out of hand on so many levels. The stories I could tell. Wow.

In my last year or two we were expected to essentially be robots, just repeating the script we were given. We were highly encouraged to make up client success stories that fit the narrative of that ""call script"". I always told management ""No. Absolutely Not."" to these approaches, and you know what's ironic? I was considered one of the best client coaches - even though I would consistently go outside of my lane. It was a running joke among my colleagues that we should just record our coaching calls, push play when we got the client on the phone, and that would be the best way to appease management. Unbelievable. 

An astonishing number of very successful employees have left Zillow in the last year or so. A lot of people have finally had enough.

I could go on about numerous other issues that Zillow has, but I'll stop there."
759,Zillow,Best place to work,2018-06-21,5.0,Financial Analyst,"Amazing benefits, unlimited paid time off, great work environment, fantastic location and employees.

760,Zillow,Zillow Premier Broker is the place to be!,2018-06-19,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"I sell a brokerage solution that helps brokers build teams and bridge the gap on working online consumers.

We have one of the best teams in the organization in terms of culture, support and growth opportunity. Within my time here, I've seen consistent positive growth to accelerate income and opportunity. Feedback is taken very seriously, management truly cares and it's a really tight knit group within the greater Zillow family.  

You can be yourself, have a great work/life balance and make great money at the most iconic brand for Real Estate online.  Zillow Premier Broker is the team to be on!",No real cons. We had a few learning curves with new product launches last year but learned quickly and adapted. This is to be expected as Zillow moves fast within a traditionally slow changing industry.
761,Zillow,"Changing the game, but still room for improvement",2018-06-14,4.0,Client Engagement Specialist,"I want to start by saying I WISH I could give Zillow 5 stars, but the way PAC is treated  and a few other things really bring it down to 4. 

Now down to the real pros and cons: 

- AMAZING Culture. Truly one of a kind and I believe the company lives and breathes the values.

-Benefits are top notch. Healthcare, dental, vision, snacks, stock, competitive/above average pay, 401k match, games, occasional catered lunch, etc. Think of the most stereotypical Silicon Valley company (In a good way :) ) and you've got Zillow. 

- Incredible technology and innovation. Zillow is THE #1 site when it comes to real estate. Zillow is 10 steps ahead of the competition and I’m excited to see where they go next.  

-Changing behavior - Some people may see this as a con, but the company is in a constant state of flux. They are changing people's behavior (Potential home buyers/sellers, agents, loan officers, landlords, etc.) and it was fun to be a part of, but you need to be okay with change.","- Internal mobility is an absolute mess. This is one of the main reasons I left the company. I applied for a job after being with the company for 2 years and was quite literally “forgotten” about until a Sr. Manger pinged the internal mobility recruiter- I received a formal apology, but it was really hurtful. 
------As a follow up to this internal mobility, all Denver hires should be aware that the majority of the Denver office (80-90%) is sales and customer service. If you want to move up in those departments it's a great opportunity, or if you want to stick it out for a year, get to understand the company and culture, etc. you can transfer to another office after a year. 

- It's mostly a joke within the company, but PAC or Premier Agent Concierge (The entry level department a large number join into as an associate CES) is the red headed step child of the company. We work 363 days out of the year until 8 PM, 7 days a week(Holidays included) and other departments pity our department/consider it a joke. It's ridiculous that PAC still is expected to ""thank"" management when we were allowed to participate in entire company events. 
-----This has gotten A LOT better since I started in early 2016, but there is still a long way to go

-Management communication (especially in PAC). When news comes out, it instantly turns in to a game of telephone with some team leads/associate managers saying one thing, while others say another. One SOP changes and some say follow it, others say do whatever you want. There were a couple times when we had LARGE meetings where EVERYONE got the exact same information- I think this needs to be more frequent and a standard practice to reduce this chatter and try to nip the ""Zumor mill rumors"" before they bud."

Since I have started the thing I say to anyone asking about the company is that, this is the only job I have ever had that you will work 7.5/ 7 hours out of an 8 hour work day... and they'll pay you well for it. As a salesperson that has had many salaried+commiss sales jobs is that it always turns out your pay is constantly being messed with. Working here in that capacity, they will pay you what you are worth, yes you'll work hard and you'll feel good about your work and they will pay you well for doing it! I cant ask for much more than that. It's a tech culture so you feel like you're being taken care of, great kitchen, snacks etc... but to me the most important thing is that you compensate me for the work you're asking of me and I can't stress how good it feels to be in a company that does just that.","Mid management politics suck at every company this size. The good thing is most of the managers have been here as reps prior to being a manager so they get the Zillow culture and live by it, outside management hired into the culture tend to not buy into so much, so it can be difficult as a seasoned rep here to deal with the politics that usually comes from management hired from outside the family.

There is no constant when it comes to everyday operations and systems, each member of management you speak to has a different answer and they tend to conflict with each other, causing issues for the employee. There are cliques within every department, which is somewhat normal, but at Zillow, it’s extreme. The management plays into the cliques, causing more problems. Favoritism is the way to win in this company. If you suck up to the right people, you will excel and move within the company, but if you make one mistake, or if someone in a management position does not like you, you will be stuck or be fired without communication. I experienced many situations where employees where fired with very little warning. The way they fire employees is absurd as well, they will pack your desk while you are in the restroom or on break, and meet you in the hall (keep in mind this is an open floor that all of the employees and management share) with your box of things and walk you out. In front of everyone. When they try to offer some reasoning for the employees dismissal, they are very hush hush and do not posses transparency. They do not “turn on the lights”. The core and heart of the company has major faults, unfortunately nothing is being done about those faults. They are simply covering them with bandaids and even offering a candy wall for your troubles. My advice; don’t give into the gimmicks, save yourself the stress of job security and the stress of pettiness; do not work for Zillow."

789,Zillow,Great company overall but experience differs greatly by department,2018-03-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Awesome benefits, great work/life balance, collaborative/innovative culture","Now that we're getting bigger (3,000+ employees) reorgs are happening in some departments (much like Microsoft), which can make your role vastly different than what you were hired for. This can make it hard to make a career path for yourself. 

In particular, I'd be wary of Brand Marketing. Two reorgs in the past 9 months and leadership is struggling to keep up morale."
790,Zillow,Sales Executive,2018-03-08,5.0,Sales Executive,"Great work life balance, great compensation, great opportunity to make as much as you want. Great work culture, amazing benefits....plus a lot more.

I'm writing this review because I've worked in the Seattle sales office for a while now and shocked to read all the comments about have to work over 40 hours a week in order to make quota. Which is NOT TRUE!!! I think our quota's are more than reasonable and most decent worker in sales usually surpass their quota about 120% if not higher.

If you feel like you need to work more than 40 hours in order to hit quota, you're probably not cut out for sales or this is not the right job for you. That's just being brutally honest. I've worked in sales for over 12 yrs for many different companies and Zillow is probably one of the best ones with low stress, great work life balance and still have potential to make a lot of money. 

Of course you have to work HARD though, I honesty work less than 40 hours a week and sales managers don't mind. As long as you keep your numbers up and hit quota which is very achievable you get full autonomy and if you want to leave a little early on a Friday its totally OK!","Can't think of anything, keep up the good work!"
791,Zillow,THE BEST PLACE ON EARTH,2018-03-07,5.0,Sales Executive,Everything about working for a company like this is the family uplifting atmosphere and an unmatched culture.

794,Zillow,Could be so much better,2018-03-01,2.0,Sales Representative,"Great benefits, great coworkers and camaraderie amongst teams. The CEO is truly amazing.","Very disappointing -  The day-to-day does NOT match the job description. They will try to sell you on the Enterprise team being a ""senior level"" position but they treat you like a very junior, entry level rep. Minus the training and support. I definitely did not trust my manager or director, I know they wouldn't have my back if it came down to it. Very greedy and off-putting. They only like you when you product numbers. The manager is also very junior and can't provide much guidance and actual strategy around roadblocks. If you have more than 4+ years of sales experience, don't expect to gain much development here. You're cold calling all day.

Leadership trying to run a senior sales team like a junior inside sales team. Heavy micromanagement created a hostile environment and overall negative morale amongst the team. I saw some really talented people be let go because of ""attitude"" which really means they challenged their leadership too much on their status quo process. 

When looking at the leadership on this particular team, they all came from the premier agent inside sales team at some point so they are naturally trying to run an enterprise team the exact same way which is a true shame. Leadership is not open to suggestions and gets highly defensive. I personally witnessed a meeting where the director asked the room to name a few reasons why the team was severely underperforming and listened to three reps basically get their heads ripped off, replying that each reason was ""an excuse.""

There is very minimal ongoing training. Leadership will come up with new objectives for the reps to perform but give very little guidance - do not mistake this for autonomy because there is definitely none of that here. You are held to daily metrics and expected to work way more than 40+ hours a week - in fact, you are praised for coming in hours early and staying hours late. It is expected."

-surrounded by positive people
-world class leadership 
-come to work excited, motivated, determined
-challenged to reach goals
-super transparent about expectations and hard work needed


The culture at Zillow far exceeds anything I’ve ever been apart of. I am surrounded with an amazing team of positive people that want to think fast, move big and the leadership is world class here. 

I’ve learned more from Zillow in the short time I’ve worked here than 4 years in college at a good university. I’m still amazed I work here and that I have such a great opportunity to be with an amazing company. I will continue to give everything I have to Zillow and more because of the time and effort they put in with me to make sure I am in the best position possible to succeed. I can’t see myself working for any other company. 

To put in perspective with how transparent company is. In my first month, I’ve seen the CEO, Spencer Rascoff, speak in person 3 times, had a Skype call with the CBO and the COO and we also had an hour sit down with the VP of Sales and he really wanted to take time and get to know us. Absolutely incredible!","I’ve noticed the training classes are all different on the end procedure. I saw most newer classes go to “training bay” right after our 2 weeks course. My class didn’t get that consistent help right off the bat so it took me a little longer to get the hang of the systems being newer into sales. 

I came in at the end of the year at a time where a lot of transitions where happening because of growth (good problem). When I came out of training, there was a lot of change so I had no direct management. They were reassigning teams and it was towards the holidays so I completely understand why it was chaotic."
796,Zillow,New job after 8 years,2018-02-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Very friendly work environment, lots of perks.  People are left to find the best way to  do their role.  Not alot of structure but plenty of system infrastructure.","small desks, open floor plan can be noisy."
797,Zillow,Hands Down the BEST Company I Have Worked For,2018-02-23,5.0,Client Engagement Specialist,"I left Zillow Group in Jan., 2018, only because I was moving. Putting in my notice was a very hard day for me. This company knows how to take care of their employees, and with how big the company is, they do a great job of providing undivided attention to your needs. They work hard to make sure you know about personal growth within the company. All the managers, leads, CEO; etc are easy to approach and communicate with. This company cares! Every department continues to expand and change, as well; which is great because you are able to continue that growth within your own department. In my opinion, this company deserves more than a five-star rating. Would I ever go back to Zillow? Absolutely!","They don't have an office in Dallas, Texas! Please get one!!"
798,Zillow,Client Engagement Specialist,2018-02-22,3.0,Client Engagement Specialist,"Great pay, benefits, open kitchen on multiple floors, friendly atmosphere, safe place to work, opportunity to create something new or start a project with a team, game room a plus, amenities were great!","Leaving a department is incredibly hard, movement in the company is difficult, department leads play favorite, people 'work' the system to cheat and meet goals, lots of gossip. Can feel very isolating, and work life balance in some departments is unfair. You have to pay to park at your own job daily."

Too busy trying to hit quota to enjoy ""Z-Life"".","It seems that you must be a male to be promoted, regardless of experience or production.  Very little work/life balance in sales positions. I worked a ridiculous amount of overtime without receiving compensation because it was necessary and encouraged."
801,Zillow,Good company to work,2018-02-05,4.0,Software QA Manager,Good company to work at,"you don't leave the company, you leave the manager"
802,Zillow,"Great company, no other like it.",2018-01-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"They treat you like a person, not an employee.  That's reflected in the benefits and how management approaches employees, no yelling and screaming about challenges, just collaboration and ideas.  
The office environment is very fun, and expansive (can only speak for Seattle).  It is a very challenging company due to the pace and ingenuity around every corner, which is awesome.
If you apply yourself, you'll go some where.  Yes, office politics exist, but generally it's a meritocracy.","It's hard to write cons because I genuinely enjoy the company.  But first off, if you're a recovering alcoholic, STAY AWAY, or have your sponsor on speed dial.  Unsecured booze is in every corner of EVERY floor, stashed in closets, in every fridge with teams taking jellow shots in public kitchens.  It's very hard to deal with in sobriety.  Almost every event has booze, morale events are at bars, gifts are generally booze etc.  Be firm in your sobriety or do not work here.
Lastly, this is a company of affluent people, who are generally from affluent backgrounds.  If you're from the poor side of things, and still have the chip on your shoulder, don't work here.  Example, a room full of people (80+) laughing about someone being in prison.  Disgusting.  Often the experiences of the poor are mocked and minimized because hey, they can't buy houses."
803,Zillow,"Amazing company, let’s keep it amazing.",2018-01-25,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Zillow’s culture is incredible, employees are happy 99% of the time because the company cares about us and genuinely wants us to be happy. We get treated extremely well and the perks and benefits are second to none. Thank you X 1 million. 

Zillow has a tradition of hiring new employees and immediately asking for their outside feedback, and fresh perspective to create positive change. This is so smart, and really hook, line and sinkered me when I was hired.

Zillow tailors your workflow to your personality, we have 1 on 1s with management whenever we want, they make us their priority and work around us. They give us the freedom to explore avenues within our roles that fit our interests and help develop the skill sets we want to built. 

Spencer and the ZG leadership team are pros. They know that different kinds of minds working together in a collaborative space with the right tools can revolutionize an industry. They have created an atmosphere that breeds new ideas and creative solutions. Working on the floor together allows us to collaborate easily, come up with new pilots and make the company better. It makes you feel like you’re doing something important, but we’re having way too much fun. No one has that much fun at work. 

They don’t just want to make sure we’re doing well in our jobs they’re helping us develop as humans in life and in our careers. I’m so grateful for the coaching and development I’ve had at ZG. Management is always trying to help us find new ways to learn and grow for what comes next. If you want to teach yourself something new and move into a different department, you just have to want it more than everyone else and work really hard. 

Women are actually treated as equals, and this is the first workplace I’ve ever seen with this level of real equality. I think that’s what I love the most about Zillow. I really feel like it’s a melting pot of tons of different people from all walks of life. Working next to someone who’s background and life experiences are different than yours, you really get to know and appreciate them for those differences, not in spite of them. This breaks down barriers and opens dialogues, it makes us better listeners and better people. It’s what we want our country to be like, and it’s honestly a safe haven from the rest of the world for a lot of us. I feel happy, healthy, and safe at my job. I never wake up and dislike coming to work. Everyone is amazing and we’re doing something important.

I’m very personally connected with Zillow’s mission and core values. It’s the reason I joined the company. I want to do something I enjoy, and that I’ll be proud of at the end of the day. I came to work for Zillow because I thought it was the place I could do just that. And it has been 100%, but right now I feel like that is being put in jeopardy which is why I’m writing this review.","I’ve worked at Zillow for over 3 years and enjoyed pretty much every second of it. I try to live our core values every day and I expect the company to operate under those values. Again, that’s why I’m here. Recently certain departments have started outsourcing jobs to 3rd world countries which is taking a toll on our quality and making employees of Zillow Group feel horrible. Don’t tell us how great of a year we had and then outsource portions of our jobs instead of fixing the problems that can be fixed to avoid that. You can’t put 5000 bandages on something and expect it not to fall apart. Take the time to do the job right and figure it out. We can do it. 

Also it’s really sad. These people are probably getting paid close to nothing to do some of our jobs, and to me that’s not Acting With Integrity. That’s Donald Trump behavior. We also don’t want to join every other company thats headed down this slippery slope. It makes consumers really angry, and that’s the opposite direction I thought we were going. Everyone’s had the experience where you reach out to customer service and get mad when the message comes back and you can’t understand because it’s a robot or someone who’s half way around the world completely disconnected from the product and the mission. Your problem does not get solved, you don’t get the help you wanted and the experience ultimately leaves a horrible impression. When this happens, people tell everyone. Word of mouth never dies and social media multiplies that. The internet can turn a small and unintentional error into a PR nightmare. Why risk it? We can balance the work, we just need to not get ahead of ourselves, perfect what we’re doing and then move forward. Leadership is being too aggressive, they need to slow down and take the time needed for the engineers to do their jobs and then make their next moves. 

This will negatively effect the Zillow Group brand. For many employees across departments this decision is deep within the gray area of the moral/ethical scale we hold ourselves to at ZG."

-Food (ie drinks, cereal, snacks).
 
- Catered lunch twice a month at HQ but only to keep sales people hostage so they can bring in more revenue before the end of the month. 

-The people, but not everyone. It really depends on whether you have a good relationship with people and if you mutually respect and like each other.","- If you're an individual contributor at the company you are just a workhorse in upper management's eyes.  Managers and leadership don't care about your well-being even though they say they do. They just want someone who is ambitious and eager to accomplish the task at hand but don't want someone too ambitious because then they'll feel threatened and the relationship will turn very sour. 

-As an individual contributor, your pay is terrible. Everyone complains about it but leadership doesn't do anything except say it's based on standard of living. 

- If you like the environment where you feel like a chicken with it's head cut off then this is the place for you. 

-If you like being told what to do, and be told, ""you're empowered to speak up” but in actuality, no one cares what you have to say, because leaders already know what’s “right”, then this is the place for you.

- If you’d rather discuss career development rather than actually be developed, then this will be the place for you. 

- It's extremely top down but again if you like that, then great.

- Really think about this, and look at other companies’ glassdoor.  Not often will you see leadership responding to EVERY review. But if you look at Zillow’s you’ll see that every review good or bad, has a comment. Doesn’t it make you wonder, does Zillow have something to hide and are they so concerned with their image that they need to have a rebuttal for every comment made, and why? Shouldn’t management be working to help their employees rather than spending their day reading reviews?"

841,Zillow,Great Culture and Workplace,2017-09-17,5.0,Client Engagement Specialist,"Zillow has an amazing culture and set of values. The longer I work here the more I see new ways which they live up to those values. I both feel appreciated and listened to by my coworkers and superiors. And the pay and benefits are, also, pretty amazing.",I really haven't experienced any.
842,Zillow,Great benefits and culture,2017-09-12,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The culture is great, everyone is empowered to pick up any project outside of their job description.  Everyone is ready to help out another coworker, either in a project or to educate.","Career development is still very blurry, if you're a strong individual and know what you want then this shouldn't be a problem."

The organization of my team was a mess, the director ignored feedback from employees, and there was no growth opportunity. The company itself is very social- loud music, beers, constant parties- which can be fun, but it's over the top and it would be great if they would take some of the money spent on parties and swag and pay employees more."
845,Zillow,Highly recommended; prepare to work hard,2017-08-26,5.0,Senior Business Consultant,"The work environment/culture is amazing. People are positive and have fun at work, while working hard. Management expects a lot out their teams. For those that are willing to work hard, have a great team mentality and attitude, and quickly adapt to change there is massive opportunity for financial earnings and career growth.

I could not be happier with my role here. I leave work every day and week feeling good about my opportunities and contributions to the greater whole.  I highly recommend Zillow as a career path. Thank you!!","Communication from management can sometimes lack clarity. Some of this has to do with just how quick things move and evolve here. Continue to focus on delivering new updates, training, etc. in digestible formats."

847,Zillow,Most nurturing culture/employer for career growth,2017-08-23,5.0,Senior Recruiter,"I've only been at Zillow for 6+ weeks but I don't have enough great things to say about my experience and the Zillow Group as an enterprise. 

- I started with a 2 week onboarding agenda given to me day 1. This really  helped with a quick ramp up and set a promising foundation. 
- My team is very supportive. They make me feel truly appreciated. They have been by my side as a cheerleader but are also first to jump in when I voice for help and advice. 
- My management, the VPs, and even our department Chief, have gone out of their way to ensure I have everything I need to be successful. They consistently remind me that they are here in any capacity needed to support my role and success. 

It is really refreshing to see an employer trying so hard to foster their employees   and empower them to grow beyond their means. 

Reflecting on my past 6 weeks and overall impression as a new hire, joining Zillow has been a great decision for my career growth.","I can't really think of any to be honest. The benefits are great. The people are great. 
 My manager is great. The work is fun and challenging."
848,Zillow,Sales Executive,2017-08-16,5.0,Sales Executive,"I'm new. Accepting this job was the best decision I ever made. It's already been life-changing. Imagine what it feels like to get 15 pats on the back and ""attaboys"" for simply closing your first sale, and then to get a barrage of emails congratulating you, from people you don't even know yet. All from a group of people who are legitimatly stoked for your success. THAT is what it feels like to work on the Sales team here. Its hard work. But it's fulfilling, and the training is phenomenal.

If you are interested in working at Zillow, or on the fence about applying, read Spencer Rascoff's blog post on Linkedin about his quarterly meeting with investors who didn't care about financials, and only had questions about company culture. I think THAT is the ultimate secret at Zillow; amazing company culture.

No doubt in my mind. They have complimentary  good coffee, healthy snacks and catered meals at the end of the month just to show they care.

859,Zillow,What It's Really Like At Zillow,2017-07-14,5.0,Sales Executive,"I feel extremely fortunate to work for Zillow Group for a variety of reasons.  I could go on a tangent as to why, but in writing this review, I'll focus on what I believe is most pertinent to prospective applicants in case the reviews about catered food and free cold brew aren't doing it for you. 
 
In a career search, most people look for key components when applying for a role: compensation package, benefits, career growth, work/life balance, and excitement about the company you work for.  When considering these things on a scale of 1-10, Zillow is an 11.

When I first started, I had zero sales experience but was eager to learn and confident in myself.  When I hit the sales floor, I initially struggled, but my team lead at the time spent much of his time developing and coaching me and got me to a point where I now consistently exceed and have more financial opportunity than I’ve ever had in my life. The point is, Zillow provides exceptional training on a daily basis, which positions anyone who takes it in for career growth and the best opportunity to be handsomely compensated. When it comes to work/life balance, I’ve never worked more than 40 hours a week, I’m encouraged to take vacations, and I occasionally take a Monday or Friday off just for fun. The benefits package is unreal and I’d bet you’ve never seen better.  As far as excitement goes, Zillow is the largest, most innovative company in its space and the direction in which it’s heading is only going up. 

I feel as though I’ve been taught invaluable lessons I’ll use my entire working life, that I’ve been given more opportunity than most any other company could give me, and most of all, I’ve truly been cared for at Zillow.","The sales role is definitely a grind and is not an easy job but nobody withholds that information from you prior to joining.  If you're not optimistic, this will be your con"
860,Zillow,"Great company, treats employees with respect",2017-07-14,5.0,Principal Software Development Engineer,"Zillow is already one of the best tech companies you can work for, and they are always striving to be even better. They treat their employees like responsible adults (discretionary time off, rare after hours work, etc). Zillow is also great because it allows you to grow your career the way that you want to; you aren't forced to take a management role to progress.","Some of the release / engineering processes can be frustrating. Also, I disagree with the way they've historically chosen development managers. That being said, that's another area where I think Zillow is trying to improve."
861,Zillow,Zillowgroup saved my life.,2017-07-13,5.0,Client Engagement Specialist,"The people are the best part #ZGisateamsport. Everyone is friendly, intelligent, smart, and hard-working. If you engage yourself with a holistic approach to your job, it will become a career for you #ownit. Zillowgroup gives you the tools to not only be successful within the company, but also gives you skills to be successful if you want to pursue another passion. The company truly cares about it's employees happiness, and is constantly striving to address our concerns. Nothing is ever ""brushed under the rug"" #turnonthelights. I trust my fellow coworkers, and the direction of the company because Zillowgroup works to do what's best for the company, individual employee, and the consumer #actwithintegrity. They give us great pay and benefits for the amount of work we do. Our office are full of amenities, food, games, and is constantly kept clean and safe. I couldn't imagine a better place to work.","The work can be repetitive at times and it's definitely a grind, but I think the only people who complain about those things are ones who aren't a great fit for the culture at Zillowgroup. Zillow takes ""work hard, play hard"" very seriously. We get spoiled with great benefits, events, and rewards for a job that in my opinion is not that difficult. I feel like most people who talk negatively about the company are those with a sense of entitlement and don't have the patience or work ethic to reach their desired goals. If you look at your job as a multi-year career and not ""I need the raise and promotion I want after a year or I'm gonna quit"", Zillowgroup will give you all the tools to be successful and reach your goal.

There aren't a lot of cons if you are hard-working and see the big picture."

The frown on hard work.,"Managers, hr, and everyone else in between can't be trusted. They all are unethical liars. They fire people with no explication or proof. If they don't like you, they will treat you bad and get rid of you.  They have a horrible turn over.  They encourage and reward lazy unprofessional behavior.   Pay sucks.

It's actually fun coming to work. There's no ""Corporate America"" feeling whatsoever. Especially in OC, that tech/media company feel is hard to find. You get paid very well for the work you do, the people are awesome, you get snacks, free lunches, contests, COLD BREW COFFEE ON TAP!!! The CEO sit in the same type of desk as the rest of the employees, there's a great open atmosphere that anyone can thrive in.",There are no cons. The company is completely transparent and all the leaders are awesome. There's nobody that you can ask questions too.
867,Zillow,"Zillow as a whole is great. My department, the worst...",2017-06-27,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Overall company culture is great
-Good people
-Free food everywhere
-Work life balance is good with PTO and DTO
-Commuter Reimbursements 
-Gym Reimbursements 
-Referral bonuses 
-Casual dress code
-Ping pong and video game rooms
-CEO and execs are great","The operations department is where I spent my time. It started off good for about 3 months, then managements true colors start to show, or lack there of. The managers operate in an old fashion corporate way, not the Zillow-way. You get watched like a hawk, micromanaged, no recognition, no bonuses, no team morale. It's a dead end department where your Zillow career goes to die and if you are reading this and considering joining their team, DON'T... Yes, there is an internal transfer program, but the managers are not too supportive when you want to leave their team. They talk bad about the team your interested in to try and keep you to stay. They dangle leadership advancement carrots in front of you to try and keep you as the robot you are. No fun is allowed in the department, it's widely known as one of the worst departments to be in. They have no morale or team bonding events. Zillow encourages managers to take their teams out to bond and do happy hours, but they still don't. Their is no career advancement opportunities within the department either. There are people on the team 5+ years that don't have even a Senior title. There is no team leads. Just 2-3 managers with a bunch of pawns. Their is a ton of hypocrisy within the department as well - the managers all live by the do as I say, not as I do mentality. You're expected to be robots, while the managers sit on social media, CNN, Youtube, Amazon all day. Myself and other employees saw it all the time. They need to just clean house and start over, or do some serious management training (which is provided by Zillow), but they obviously don't attend. They pay you poorly, just about the Seattle minimum wage, and hope you stay forever and are happy with your yearly 1.5% merit bonus and 50 stock options."
868,Zillow,The best company I could have imagined working for,2017-06-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"THE CULTURE. The company takes care of their people. Its not just a thing that they say either, they really do. From fantastic benefits to constant availability of snacks and food, they really want their people to be happy (happy employees make good employees). They go above and beyond what they need to be doing to ensure that everyone has a good working environment. I've only ever met really great people in management, and they really are, not only open to, but encouraging of movement and growth. They want you to explore different roles in the company and keep learning. Work life balance is great, I don't feel like I have to take work home or stay later than I'm supposed to .","Although work life balance is great, the nature of the company (nationwide real estate) there is a necessity for some people in departments to have a schedule that forces them to be in the office either early in the morning, or later in the day, and on weekends. Not the end of the world, but its definitely not a conventional schedule. The pay is good, but its just enough, I'm not going to be building a huge savings account with it (although with annual reviews, your salary is part of that and can go up). The snacks don't rotate very much, so you do get tired of them (but, oh darn, free snacks, amirite).  There also sometimes feels as though there aren't perfect lines of communication between, not only offices, but sometimes departments. Things change very fast and sometimes it's hard to know exactly what should be happening or if the people in charge know what's going on. It's a big company with a lot of offices, so its hard to feel totally connected to all of them (the collective holiday party in Seattle definitely helps though)."

Some of my best friends came from working here and we still stay in weekly contact.
The mission is incredible -- helping Americans find a place to live. It's one of the basic necessities of life and truly rewarding.",Cons are small and not worthy of mention.

- Very hands off management - open to new ideas, always willing to listen, great for someone who can navigate and make their own mark. Sometimes might seem too 'lax' but that's the trade-off
- Core values are really practiced hard here!","- Not many benefits/life work balance geared towards workers with families - no flex work arrangements - commute to work every day is a bit too daunting for folks who live 20-30 miles away. These deter some referals away too.
-Since a lot of the growth is organic, there are a lot of mid-level pm's and managers who might not have a lot of industry exposure, need to invest and mentor to setup these roles for success.

Everyone has amazing character, positive personalities and really just want to help. The inside sales org offers opportunity to make a lot of money . The executives are people you are proud of and they inspire you to work harder. And the benefits, so many amazing benefits.","Zillow has been working hard to be more diverse and it is apparent in most of the department's, except for inside sales. It is still very much a boys club. Even though half of the sales staff are women, almost all the managers are men. All of the General Managers are also men. Being a women means you have to work twice as hard to get half the recognition. I have been at Zillow 2 years and I have not seen a single women promoted . The ""boys"" also treat the environment with a very ""frat like"" attitude. You must have very thick skin to survive  the environment."

The role is overall constantly evolving, from inside sales, to outside sales, to travel out of state once a month, to travel out of state 40% of the time. You never really know what to expect and it is important to be okay with your role changing all of the time in all aspects of the business.

879,Zillow,"Great, just not for me",2017-05-07,4.0,Associate Client Engagement Specialist,"Benefits, benefits, benefits.

The higher-ups seem to always be willing to talk, strategize, and be of support. My director supervisor was incredible; always went to bat for me and the team, practiced transparency constantly, and was always trying to keep the team moral high. 

The office is beautiful with amazing views and has tons of free food and goodies. 

After a year of work, you have the option of considering other teams. This was a great incentive and provided hope and various career paths. I was not at Zillow long enough to experience this so I am not sure how smooth or competitive the process is.","People you walk by won't always smile or say hello, of course due to the size of the office, but this often does make things feel a tad bit ""cliquey"".

The associate client engagement specialist role is very repetitive and doesn't offer much room for creative or critical thinking.  The hours are tough, 4 10-hour days, and are not for everyone. Although throughout training we were told our customer support conversations with consumers would mostly be positive, I have to disagree.  People in this role are restricted to always being on the phone/email/text, hence are not able to go to most special office events or ""all hands"" meetings."

In the office I truly enjoy everyones positivity and excitement daily. Most of our sales team has been with the company less than a year and everyone steps up to help others, runs huddles, and share their knowledge without hesitation. After coming from a bigger office its amazing to see what we have accomplished in less than a year.

Leadership was very focused on call volume which in turn decreased the quality of our work."
892,Zillow,Strong culture and environment,2017-04-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Input is incouraged and often implemented upon across the organization. 

Benefits are really strong, even for the Seattle tech community. 

Focus on career advancement is the strongest I've ever experienced in a company.","Growing pains are evident, especially when it comes to process and procedures (or sometimes lack thereof). However, as eluded to in the pros, the ability to help shape the direction of future goals and drive future success is a strong mitigating factor to this. 

Ownership is a requirement here. Not necessarily a con, but a heads up to anyone who just wants to just wants to sit at a desk and execute on an already delivered plan, that won't always exist here. For people who want to help shape the future of a team, this is honestly a plus."
893,Zillow,Still loving my job,2017-04-06,5.0,Sales Manager,"I've been at Zillow Denver for over 6 years and really enjoy what we do here.  The people in the office are incredible and treat each other like family.  Things are constantly changing, so the job never gets stale.  We have a very respectful, talented and strategic leadership team in place, an unbelievable group of salespeople, and a support staff that any organization would be jealous of.  From IT, to customer care, and our newer group of client engagement specialists all the way around are top notch.  I've seen this office grow from a baby with 22 employees to one of the most amazing employers in Denver with around 500 currently.  We have grown a lot as a company and are just getting stronger and more innovative.  It's been a fun and interesting journey and I wouldn't trade it for the world.",I cant think of anything off the top of my head
894,Zillow,"Move Fast, Think Big",2017-04-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Never have I ever felt so appreciated. The openness, transparency and communication to employees is core to Zillow and it shows. Individuals, departments and teams are encouraged to swing for the bleachers and move things forward at warp speed. Zillow is changing the real estate industry, and it is fascinating to be a part of it.","Sometimes in the moving so fast, we don't take the time to give proper shout outs or credit to those that worked hard on a project, or communicate cross-company about changes."
895,Zillow,Sales,2017-04-05,5.0,Business Consultant,"This review is based off my experience at Zillow Irvine. 
Where do I start with the amount of pros I have in mind. I started off at Zillow group about a year and half ago. The experience thus far has been amazing! I have never been part of an organization that genuinely cares for its people. It all starts from very top from CEO all the way down to our floor leaders (managers)

Financial opportunity- The financial opportunities are endless. We sell one of the greatest products in the industry. If you work hard and smart compensations are generous.

Work culture- The thing I admire most about Zillow group is our work culture. This company puts its people first before anything, it truly believes that for it to continue to be an industry leader, it must treat its employees with respect, opportunity and growth and therefore it will attract the best talent around. Everything at Zillow group is about positivity, growth and professional development.

Benefits, perks, parties etc- We have great benefits. Full medical coverage, fully stacked kitchen, great Christmas party (fly out to Seattle with airfare and hotel provided by the company)",I personally don't have any cons. If you respect your work environment and work hard. The potential is unlimited.

898,Zillow,Truly Living the Values,2017-03-30,5.0,Consumer Insights Manager,"- Everyone at the company (at all levels of leadership) truly lives the values that the company has laid out
- Colleagues are very competent, knowledgeable, respectful and open to new ideas and concepts
- Support from leadership is second-to-none
- Truly customer-focused
- Office perks are not bad, either!
- Benefits outside of salary are generous and much-appreciated
- I have never been treated so well by everyone as I have here - I genuinely look forward to coming into the office every day","- Working out the kinks as the company transitions from a very small start-up to a larger company (acquisitions, lack of clear systems / processes) --> Not the place for someone that needs to have clear and precise processes in place to be comfortable.  You have to be willing to create your own.
- I really wish that it wouldn't rain this much in Seattle."
899,Zillow,I have been part of a sales team at one of the newer divisions at Zillow,2017-03-27,3.0,Account Executive,"Relaxed atmosphere, low stress, generally achievable quota, great co workers, flexible schedule, great vacation time. The job is easy as long as you remain focused and creative.",Money could be better. Advancement is limited. Lots of favoritism and politics by managers. Repetitive work and Inefficient workflow for salespeople.
900,Zillow,Zillow and CES/PAC review. Growing department in a fantastic company!,2017-03-27,4.0,Client Engagement Specialist,"This is mainly a review regarding the Client Engagement Specialist (CES) position. The position is a great way to meet like minded, career oriented young professionals. I thoroughly enjoyed the people I worked with and appreciated their attitudes. In the CES role you get to start at the ground level in a market changing company and interact with many different audiences from website consumers, to real estate agents, to lenders as well as internal departments. The CES position is what you make it. It can be extremely valuable if you take the time to cultivate relationships, build your network and learn more about Zillow Group. My former manager Justin, was one of the best mangers I have had in my professional career. He took the time to listen to me (regarding the good and the bad), he always made time for me and my team and he was always on our side and represented us in a good light. I have since moved on from that role (and stayed within Zillow Group) but if it was not for Justin, I probably would not have my new position within the company.","Being a CES on the Premier Agent Concierge (PAC) team does come with challenges like any position at any company. PAC was a pilot when I started and grew into a full fledged department within Zillow Group. Now staffing almost 300 employees (including team leads and managers), it comes with growing pains. The job can be monotonous and team leads and managers have a difficult time combating that. You occasionally deal with rude consumers and unprofessional agents. PAC also has long hours and works weekends and holidays so it can be hard to get the time off you want and the schedule does not work for everyone. Zillow Group has a phenomenal culture with company events and perks and PAC member do not always get the opportunity to part-take in those. Management says they are working on it but have never had a successful solution. Much of this has to do with the nature of the job and isn't necessarily a short coming on Zillow's behalf, but they are things applicants should be aware of."
901,Zillow,Great People,2017-03-27,3.0,Client Engagement Specialist,"The Seattle Zillow office is very nice with an outstanding view. However, the best part of my job by far was the people I worked with. My colleges were supportive, fun and just all around amazing people. My team lead Justin Wixom was always encouraging and always positive. We had a great team dynamic. I enjoyed meetings and anytime we were together as a group. It was the people on this team that made leaving this job very difficult.",The position does not pay well. It is hard to live in Seattle with a salary like this. It was challenging to work early hours and have to pay to for an uber or parking to get to work safely.
902,Zillow,Business Consultant review,2017-03-23,4.0,Business Consultant,"Perks, co-workers, location, hours, kitchen","Feel under a micro-scope, micro-managed"

904,Zillow,"Great company, could work on the department",2017-03-18,4.0,Customer Engagement Specialist,Work 4 days a week and have 3 day weekends. work with great people and have great teams.,Don't get to benefit from everything that Zillow offers. You are tied to the desk for 10 hours a day and ot's exhausting. There is not a lot of room for movement within the department and they don't encourage you to get to know the company. They want you to focus all your energy on the department without being able to learn anything else.
905,Zillow,Best job you'll ever have,2017-03-16,5.0,Agent Care,"This is a fantastic company for more reasons than I can even describe. ZG stands for amazing things that really sets up the employer for the best possible experience. Not only do I love my day to day tasks, but the people and the culture are truly something special and amazing. I came from a previous employer that did not treat employees well whatsoever, so seeing how ZG just does everything right is such a breath of fresh air. They really provide you with all the resources you need to succeed. If you want an extra training, ask. If you want more experience in something, ask. If you have a certain place you want to get to within the company, ask. All the managers are easy to talk to and are great at helping you reach your goals. They also are extremely transparent with their employees, or ""leaving the lights on"" as they say. They are huge on ""power to the people"" (another one of their missions that they strongly stand by). Denver has a really cool office and I have not met one person who is a jerk. It is truly amazing and I could go on forever!",I have not experienced any challenges or cons. Maybe too many snacks in the kitchen? Too many awesome food trucks? Too many catered lunches? ;)
906,Zillow,Best company I've ever worked for,2017-03-16,5.0,Client Engagement Specialist,"•The management. No micromanagement at all, lots of freedom, and they really do treat you like family. After working for Zillow for a little while, I decided to go back to personal training in the Seattle area. It was one of the hardest decisions over ever made. When telling my managers about my choice, they fully supported my decision. They told me I would always be part of the Zillow family and that I'd always have a place here. 
•The employees. Again, family. Zillow has a long/tough interview process, and it shows. They pick out only the best. Everyone is so genuine and easy to get along with. 
•The benefits. Literally anything you need covered or helped with, they provide. 
•The candy wall...for obvious reasons.",I can't think of anything.
907,Zillow,Great Place To Work,2017-03-14,4.0,Client Engagement Specialist,"Amazing company culture, very transparent in every aspect, office is open with no private offices (not even for the head honchos) so it is a very welcoming and not intimidating atmosphere. Amazing stocked kitchens and games and clubs to participate in. Great company parties and happy hours and the benefits are insanely good. Bonuses are awesome.","They changed the promotion time from 6 months to 12 months, which is understandable but a bit frustrating when you started in entry level expecting to be moved up to a position in the time frame they said. Changes to SOP isn't always clear or communicated clearly to everyone. Benefits are amazing but the hourly wage could be a llittle more competitive considering living costs in the area."
908,Zillow,"Fun, Relaxed Environment",2017-03-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Culture, attitude, transparency, room for career growth",Difficult to move laterally into certain departments
909,Zillow,Believe the hype. This is the real deal,2017-03-12,5.0,Client Engagement,"Zillow Group has wonderful benefits for employees and the Concierge department, as well as the company is always looking for ways to improve and remain relevant in an ever changing technology environment.

People talk about the culture here and many who are looking to become a Zillowite reference that in their interview, which is great. But it's not just a talking point here or some sort of spin for recruitment efforts. Culture is what we make of it here and everyone truly works hard to create the culture they want to see. Nothing like it anywhere that I have seen in 20 years of business, both public or private.

Big ideas are constantly generated and some of the most important things we have implemented as a company have come from front line folks. 

Management cares about their people, and strives to provide support, remove roadblocks and challenges, and create an environment for those they support to grow in their career progression.

We all believe in the vision here, and for good reason; what we are doing is revolutionizing an entire industry for the better.","There is a repetitive nature to the workflow in Concierge, but that could be said of many positions. What is more accurate is that there is a flow and rhythm to what we do which works for most, but is not for everyone.

What it does allow for is an opportunity to become really proficient and a subject matter expert at what you do, thus giving you great insight into many other departments within the org.

If there truly is a Con here, it's that the Big Ideas and fast movement we must adhere to in order to be the best at what we do, can be frustrating for some. The truth though is that it's a glass half empty kind of outlook and while certainly challenging at times, always leads to a better product for our consumers and clients... and isn't that what we are here to do in the first place?"

Pressure to make 400 calls a day and over-sell to the real estate agents who are the target audience.  Company really makes money on website ads not their actual product.

Strong Executive leadership who i have faith will continue to navigate Zillow into an even powerful brand.
Many of the recent glass door reviews seem to be negative or talking about poor leadership however in my 6 years at working at this company i could not have been surrounded with better talent and leaders who care. the other GM's in Denver are world class leaders and even the GM's across the rest of the company - i was/am proud to have called this place home as should the current employees at ZG.      this company is just starting to scratch the tip of its potential and i cant wait to see what comes in the future!

I am very proud of my time with ZG and i know anyone looking for a great place to learn and grow this would be an incredible opportunity!","yes, a lot of change has taken place but if you take a look back as i have, all the past changes have been the right move.    change is never easy but its necessary in a growing company - i expect Denver to lead from the front and voice there concerns in a professional manner."

The people are good, for the most part.","I worked in the Denver office. The drug culture is out of control, even reaching into management level. I have been in the office when someone came in stinking of marijuana. I have seen another rep come in from lunch with a white ring around his nose. If I had a 20-something son or daughter I wouldn't want them to work here simply because it's easy to get caught up in that culture. pill popping is not uncommon at all. I have had managers who were coked out during the day. There's one guy in particular who would be on adderall and just stare me down for no good reason. It got to be uncomfortable after a while, to the point where I no longer wanted to there anymore. 

Also, since Zillow bought Trulia, it stopped being any sort of fun in the Denver office. It used to be a really fun place to work. I used to look forward to going in because every day was a new adventure. Then, somewhere along the line, it just turned into straight up drudgery. Also, there is little to no room for advancement. 

It's a good place to cut your teeth but I wouldn't want to be there more than 2 years. that would be my maximum. it's changed for the worse, that's for sure and that's the consensus on the floor. One region, right now, is fomenting mutiny. It's just a matter of time before that situation blows up. The die-hards will stay because they're grandfathered in.

One of their motos is #turnonthelights meaning there is complete transparency from Senior Execs, company shifts, etc all the way to the bottom.  Open door policy - They seem to value opinions and ideas.  In the past I've worked at several companies where 'sharing your opinion was welcome' but in reality would put you on the radar as a troublemaker.  GREAT benefits.  Strong 401k match.  In my opinion, the health plan is among one of the best I've heard of.  Maternity/Paternity just increased to 16 weeks.  If you produce they will take care of you with pay increase + stock options.  Of course, the never ending supply of cafe/coffee and snacks is a nice perk.  I could keep going but if you're thinking about applying do yourself a favor and pull the trigger.  Spencer and the exec team are talented, strong leaders with a vision.  I'll remain at the company for some time because I truly believe it will continue to expand into something even greater than it already is.",None yet.

951,Zillow,Happy to go to work every day,2016-12-12,4.0,Agent Care,"Zillow is a great place to work. The company has a set of core values, and I feel that the employees from executive level down live those values. Some highlights of Zillow:
- Transparency: If there is a new project or big move happening, leadership let's us all know
- Opportunity: Leadership does an excellent job of helping us make a clearly defined career path and giving us the necessary steps to get there
- Trust: We are all encouraged to run with our big ideas, and if they don't work, we're not scolded. Our leaders help us assess what went wrong and how to be more successful next time. Management believes that we're all competent and working here for a reason, so they trust in our ideas.","- The pay (at least in my org) is barely livable. People who have college degrees are only starting at $40,000 a year, which is incredibly hard to live on in Seattle.
- Growing pains: My team is growing fast, and that causes some small struggles."

954,Zillow,Hands down best company to work in Seattle area,2016-12-05,5.0,Software Development Engineer,"Witnessing tremendous growth, but still maintaining rock solid culture. Really like how management cares about employees and listens. I mean it, employee surveys are taken seriously and actions are taken based on that. 
 
Innovation is at the core of the company. Always thinking big and moving fast to achieve those goals. It is hard to see from outside, but that is the reason Zillow dominates the markets and competition keeps on playing catch up game. 

Pretty much still bottom up approach with small teams diving up awesome products. There is level of autonomy given to engineers. 

Work life balance is great. I really like how we do all release activities during day time with almost no downtime to on live site. We have really efficient operations  team that make this happen (they can be little stubborn at times, but they need to keep Zillow running -- understandable). That means no on call for developers.",Mostly due to flat organization structure hard to see clear career progression.

967,Zillow,Great place to be!,2016-10-11,5.0,Sales Executive,"Upper management doesn't always get things right to start but they make things right in the end. At Zillow everything changes quickly and it's really good to know that if something changes to the negative it won't be for long.
Free food is awesome
Lots of cool groups like basketball, reading, etc",You have to be okay to change what you do on the day to day quickly but if you're cool with that there aren't many things I would consider a con
968,Zillow,"In a lot of ways still great, but developing a lot of issues",2016-10-02,3.0,,"- Relatively low turnover. You can get to know your colleagues well (in engineering at least) because people tend to stick around.

- The company really trusts engineers. Design decisions are made by stack owners with little scrutiny from the business side. None of that absurd ""frugality"" business standing in the way. It's almost unprecedented for a company of this size to have so much faith in their engineers to drive the stack however they choose.

- The culture is really laid back. If you can get all your work done (and do a great job), then you're absolutely free to play ping pong for four hours, which is great because this is how some people work most effectively.

- The culture is passionate. Some of the most treasured moments in my career so far have been sitting, drinking and talking about the architecture of services late into the night with ops. We'd also find ourselves after-hours on a Friday evening huddled around, looking at property listings and talking about all the renovations we'd do if we bought that house. Zillow loves technology, and loves houses. It's remarkable how much you grow professionally in an environment where people will talk anyone's ear off for hours about non relational databases.

- VPs and executives are so accessible. They make the effort to be available for communication, and even when they're spread thin, they take the time to at least try to address any issues you may come to them with. It's not the company it was five years ago, and they are no longer the people they were five years (in terms of demands on time and responsibility, at least), but they always try their hardest to remain human, which is nice.","- The risk of being blocked is high at all software companies, but it would happen for sometimes weeks on end at Zillow, due to a slight perversion of ill-defined ""core values"". People would break tools that the entire org depended on, shipping untested messes behind the smokescreen of ""move fast, think big"". Maybe it should be modified to ""move fast, think big, be considerate, write unit tests""?

- There's a growing problem of feeling generally less effective and less gratified. Four years ago we just sat down, designed and built features, and shipped 100% of what we wrote. Due to growth/ineffective project management/blocking issues, our velocity wasn't where I'd become to accustomed to by the time I left. I loved Zillow, but what really crushed me before I left was being told that things I'd been asked to work on wouldn't be shipping because they'd been ""deprioritized"". That is soul-crushing.

- Zillow has a serious diversity problem. Everywhere does, but Zillow seems more reluctant than other places to acknowledge and work on it. None of the senior leadership are people of color, and they all came from very similar backgrounds. Zillow execs, VPs and ESPECIALLY HR are very out-of-touch with the experiences and needs of employees of color (and women, and people who identify as LGBT, and pretty much any other sensitive, lawsuity area), and often say and do very offensive things without realizing it.

- There are some management issues. Management is often untrained in dealing with people, and unequipped to fix issues before they get out of hand. It seemed like employee needs were sometimes dismissed or ignored until they reached the point of lowering morale."

Really good benefits, good pay, and the upper management such as the CEO are awesome.","The Premier Agent Concierge department is a decent job, but management makes it really difficult to enjoy and prosper in. It's honestly the worst management team I've ever had. They're the bottom of the barrel in intelligence, but had connections or were found attractive by upper management and were promoted to their position. I know that's usually how it goes, but it's worse here than anywhere else I've ever been, by far. I cannot stress this enough, I really can't, they basically only know how to micromanage, they have no actual skills or abilities to improve you or the team. Beware, if you don't like being treated like a 4 year old, or actually want to go places in your career, this is not a place you want to be. The job itself is basically making the same 30 second phone call 400 times a day, repeating the same thing over and over and getting hung up on and screamed at. You gain no more career skills than a telemarketer does in this position. I would recommend it for people as an in between job, but not as a serious career."
972,Zillow,"Great benefits, but that's about it",2016-09-19,1.0,,"Great benefits, easy hours with a great work life balance. Unlimited time off and laid-back enviornment",Incredibly disorganized.

977,Zillow,Dose of Reality,2016-09-09,4.0,Client Engagement Specialist,"In my time at Zillow, I felt motivated to continuously be a top-performer and I was.  As a CES, I was consistently on our daily leader board and felt a drive to push myself due to an unparalleled work-place culture.  Truly felt appreciated as an employee for a multitude of reasons; free food didn't hurt.  My co-workers and managers both were beyond influential in helping me receive the highest possible bonus you could in our department for every quarterly review conducted on my behalf.  I worked hard and build solid rapport with almost everyone in the Denver office.  It is incredibly unfortunate that I'm even having to type the duration of this review out, but it needs to be heard.","There really aren't any cons to working at the Denver office, minus the deplorable comments and actions of an individual who single-handedly brings down the morale of almost 200 people on a daily basis.  The statements are reprehensible, I was told in order to succeed at this company, I'd have to ""fake it until you make it.""  That deplorable mentality carries over to a truly vile managerial style that does nothing but promote unnecessary micro-management that invalidates efforts done by members on the team, myself included.  Which only succeeded in making me feel inadequate and like I was not a valued member of the office.  Constant complaints are mustered against this individual to no avail and this imperviousness is a true mystery.  This individual personally led me to have overwhelmingly debilitating panic attacks on an almost daily basis which eventually caused my numbers to fall, for me to be forced to leave my desk and sometimes even have to leave early.  This was then used against me in order to justify my termination.  Multiple co-workers and leads were aware of the situation and but by then, it was too late.  It pains me to write all this out and make it public knowledge, but it needs to be seen and heard, not swept under the rug like the company would prefer."

Since we are a glorified call center, we don't get the benefit of having most holidays off and we work very unusual hours.That being said, the job gets quite boring and tedious. It's stagnant and soul crushing; it is probably the reason why people leave quickly.  I say glorified call center, because most people do not know what they are getting themselves into. Some of my colleagues were not aware of the full details of the position, due to ambiguous phrasing from recruiters, until the actual training!"

If you want to work in a place where you will be handed the tools to be incredibly successful on a platter, this is it - but remember, only you can make the choice to use them (These are tools, they don't just magically fix things themselves).

 Within 6 months of working here I was promoted, and to be quite honest they're going to have to drag me out of this place some day - Zillow Group is a family, and one that welcomes with open arms.

We move very fast here and I don't see that changing any time soon. The pay could be a little more competitive, it's hard to move up or get promoted in certain positions.

I feel more supported to succeed than ever before and I trust management and the executives to always do what's best for the team.","The only con I can think of is not something I see as negative.

I'm generally skeptical of things like ""core values"", but Zillow has managed to roll out these big company concepts in a way that feels genuine.  We're in a transition from a small company to a relatively big one (2k+) and the leadership team is taking deliberate steps to have the right amount of process to keep things running efficiently.

There's a strong emphasis on over all quality of life.  Generous vacation, good parental leave (which everyone actually uses) and a culture that doesn't expect you to be connected all of the time.

Zillow has a dual-class stock structure that allows the Founders and CEO to have complete control over direction of the company, allowing for a long term vision.  It exciting that Zillow is able to invest so much in the future, tear-down and rebuild business models and expand into adjacent markets even if it limits near term profits.  No concern with activist investors here.

Overall the best place I've worked.","We're pretty spoiled overall though the pay the benefits aren't quite as good as the ""tier 1"" tech companies (Google, Facebook, Microsoft), though they are getting better every year.

The location is good too, they have free parking and it is across the street from Top Golf.","The premier agent concierge department is just a little bit of a mess.  When I was hired I thought it was going to be a lot different then it was.   This position is basically telemarketing without the sales, you are harassing people all day just dialing nonstop getting hung up on and berated.  When someone reaches out to a realtor in this program they are expecting that realtor to call them but instead you do and try to schedule a time for them to speak.  It's good for busy agents who don't want to deal with bad leads like rentals but it frustrates consumers, it's really hard to feel good about what you're doing either.  
     Management is very inexperienced and young which can make your day tough as well, the average age of our leadership team is probably 25 I would guess.  For many of them this is their first job so they don't have a lot of real world management skills, they resort to micromanaging a lot.  It started out as a fun environment but as time went on they have implemented more and more rules like no cellphones, no wearing shorts, no talking with each other at your desk, ect it feels a lot like highschool now.  That's really all your manager or lead will be there for, watching you to make sure you're not texting. They can be very disrespectful too, it's definitely not a team relationship it's more us verse them. They don't have any sort of performance improvement plan either, if your numbers are bad they'll just give you the cold shoulder and not say hi in the hallway and stuff like that.  It sounds really childish but again, it's a really inexperienced management team.  
     The job itself breaks a lot of people just like telemarketing does too. In a typical day I'll make 200 dials.  Since the job is so easy there is no advantage to people who have been there longer, it all comes to how many dials you can make in a day.  New hires come in and do really well because it's new and they are optimistic, this position takes no skill or learning either just dial.  After a few months though and realizing advancement wont happen you will be worn down and the thought of even making another call is tough.  As soon as your numbers start to fall management will treat you very poorly.  That's how the cycle has gone since I've been here, they have lost most of what I would consider their bright employees because of this.  This creates a really odd environment too, about half of the floor is completely negative about everyone and everything here and talking openly about looking for another job.  
     The advancement opportunities are not good either, this also creates a lot of the tension.  This team has almost 200 people and many of us hired on wanting to advance here.  They really sell you on that but they prefer to hire from outside rather than promote from within.  
     Overall it's not a horrible job, the pay is really good for what it is and the benefits are nice as well.  Definitely don't look at it as a career though, most people make it about 3 months before they start looking for something else.  Management is really inexperienced and poor and it will feel a lot like high school but as long as you can handle that you can get by until you find something better."

The sky is the limit of how much money you can make, however it's all about the effort that you put in.  If your someone who likes to push yourself, doesn't give up, likes a challenge, is competitive and wants to make money then this is perfect.

1021,Zillow,The American Dream Realized,2016-04-05,5.0,Inside Sales,"I had no idea how much a job could positively change the very life you live, until I started selling for Zillow. The reason why is simple, there is opportunity here. As a career salesman, I couldn't ask for a better company to represent and a better product to sell. I represent a company that is true to their ideals and takes employee satisfaction very seriously. I sell a product that can REALLY enhance a persons career potential and is a force that benefits millions across our great nation. As the company grows, I feel like I am growing with it. I love being involved in a company where there is so much innovation and change as time progresses. There is always another challenge and therefore, it never gets boring. 

The reason I titled this ""The American Dream Realized"" is because Zillow has finally given me the platform and tools I have been looking for to start making a great living. A great living of course must be earned. All anybody can ask for is a fair environment where excellence in rewarded, and the inevitable struggles are dealt with compassionately from superiors and colleagues. Everyone is in it together and they are willing to help each other succeed, despite the underlying competitiveness that is natural in the sales world. To feel that I'm genuinely being compensated based on the work I put in, is the one of most empowering and exciting experiences I have ever had in my life. I care for the people that I work with at Zillow, and I feel they care about me too. It's just simply a pleasure to be here.","I've been around for less than a year, and clearly it is too early for me to come up with anything.

1024,Zillow,"Consistently on ""best places to work"" lists for good reason!",2016-04-04,5.0,Business Consultant,"Zillow Group is consistently on several ""best places to work"" lists and for very good reasons. I have been with several organizations throughout my professional career and Zillow Group has hands-down done more for me than anywhere else I've worked. First off, the culture is second-to-none. From free food and beverages on a daily basis to incomparable perks and bonuses, Zillow Group truly has an amazing culture. The leadership, starting with Spencer Rascoff on down, the management, and the employees make it a truly great place to work! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic career opportunity! Benefits packages offered are literally the best I have ever seen throughout my professional career. I can honestly say I look forward to going there each and every day and contributing to my team and the organization as a whole!","Being a tech-based company, you must constantly change and adapt to stay ahead of the competition. Our CEO, Spencer says that if you get complacent, you will get blindsided by the competition. With that said, change is the only constant at Zillow group. If you are flexible and adaptable, it is a very fun, exciting, and challenging atmosphere, but if you prefer the status quo and do not do well with change, it would most certainly not be a good fit."
1025,Zillow,Great Corporate Culture,2016-03-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Benefits were amazing. People seem to genuinely enjoy coming in to work. Lower-level management.,Sales goals and expectations become increasingly difficult to attain. Mid-level management.
1026,Zillow,"As the company grows, so do your opportunities.",2016-03-30,5.0,Program Manager,"In my time working at Zillow (less than 2 years) I have witnessed some of its growth (acquiring trulia,launching a new app for pros, etc) and I have not felt lost, or like an anonymous individual in a sea of people.

Zillow is a great place to work at if you're proactive, hard working, creative, and an innovative problem solver. Clearly their amazing benefits and fun work environment are huge perks, but for me, the way zillow allows employees to come up with ideas, run with them (as a pilot, small project that grows, or mini initiative) is the reason why i love being here.

I have always found at Zillow that if you have a good idea there is nothing to stop you but yourself, and the quality of your idea.","While it is difficult for me to find major cons, I believe that we can only improve with honest constructive feedback, so here's some of what I have noticed (that they are already working on!)

* Our benefits are amazing, but uneven (DTO for some, and limited PTO for others) above average parental leave, and other great benefits. But it stops short and is not revolutionary enough in a competitive tech environment. I'd like to see longer parental leave benefits, tuition assistance, pet care for work-travel, etc.

*Unclear road to career growth: I don't feel personally affected by this. I feel that I am entrepreneurial enough to make my way and find or make my own opportunities. But if someone doesn't have have that self-starter spirit or know the right people, it's difficult to see a clear path to grow in your career.

* HACK week not open to the entire company - we're missing out on collaboration from other teams. 

* Not enough focus in hiring and growing our ability to serve customers in languages other than English."
1027,Zillow,Growing Company,2016-03-20,3.0,Client Engagement Specialist,Zillow has some of the best benefits available to employees.,The company is still going through some growing pains that can be painfully obvious.
1028,Zillow,"Large, stable company with small, start-up mindset",2016-03-18,5.0,Senior Software Development Engineer,"Zillow is, so far, the best company I've had the pleasure to work for. They really stand behind their words with actual action. If people aren't satisfied with something, they listen, discuss, and take necessary action. They provide many avenues to voice your opinion, which empowers you as an employee and as a stakeholder in the company itself.

Culture isn't something they just talk about. They live it day in and day out by being active philanthropically, engendering a culture of respect, and providing avenues to unwind at work and outside of work.

Although Zillow is a large company, we still get plenty of opportunities to work with cutting-edge technology. There are hardly days where I feel like my team is stagnated or that I feel like technology is leaving us behind. The teams here aren't scared to work with bleeding-edge tech, and making mistakes or failing big is a part of the culture, not something frowned upon.

To summarize, if you're looking for a company that stands behind what they say and provides a challenging, yet fun place to work then Zillow is where you want to work.","I've been here for almost a year and so far I can't really pinpoint anything as a downside. The work-life balance is great. The culture, coworkers, and management make day-to-day work a pleasure."
1029,Zillow,One Year In and it Keeps Getting Better,2016-03-16,5.0,Senior Database Developer,"Too many specifics to list here, especially without parroting all of the others - outstanding health benefits, discretionary time off (huge for new hires who don't have to wait for years to accumulate time off), morale events, interesting speakers, and the list goes on.  The biggest pro is leadership that truly listens to its employee base.  In the year I have been here Zillow has stepped up in offering a more aggressive 401k package, top-notch health benefits, more competitive pay scale, option of RSUs vs. options, DTO vs. PTO, and so much more.  Every enhanced benefit is in direct response to the collective voice of the personnel.  Bottom line - employees are treated as adults and allowed to perform at a high level.","My position is one of the few still typically still occupied by Boomers in a house full of Millenials, so for those fortunate enough to qualify for a position here later in one's career you better be young at heart to keep up."

Decent lunch break and you don't have to ask if you need to take a break. All upper management has been super helpful and readily available to help whenever you need it. They also have a casual dress code which is amazing. I love being able to dress comfortably to work. $75 monthly gym reimbursement, elevating desks, great benefits, etc. The company is always changing and moving forward. I was a career changer and this job has been super refreshing for me!",I would say the biggest con is the scheduling. Unfortunately with this particular department it's just how it is right now. Real Estate does a lot of their business during the weekends and evenings so there's a high chance you will be working those shifts.

1031,Zillow,PAC,2016-03-07,1.0,,Great benefits package but that is all I can say.,"Massive favoritism. Unless you have a cheerleader/jock/frat personality you are treated poorly. I was treated as an outsider. You are told they value their employees and will work with you but if they don't like you they will find a way to exclude you and get rid of you. I was treated so poorly it sits on the edge of harassment. They say everyone is a team and is equal but that is far from the truth. If you aren't a favorite they will treat you so bad you will quit. The lack of structure works against you. I was treated so poorly and was given such false, hypocritical information it has to be illegal and will be speaking with a lawyer to see what can be done. I would never wish that kind of treatment on my worst enemies. Make sure there is documentation and a witness when you speak with management because they will lie. It is not surprising they are only rated a top company on glass door because the people who do have issues are afraid to voice their opinion. If you express concern for being singled out they will find a way to fire you or get you to quit. The open door policy is nonsense, once you express anything negative they will retaliate. There is no work/life balance and I am an example of that. I had the same experience another employee who reviewed had."

The goals are a far reach (to say the least) and the payouts have been lowered substantially. We no longer get stock regularly, nor do we get quarterly payouts. For the first year you do get a ramp, which is nice, but once its over the future is grim. It is not sustainable, the stress level can be extremely high. There is not a lot of flexibility or understanding for life's demands outside of work, you are held to your hours without options to work remotely. Although plenty of realtors are happy with our product, it is hard to feel pride for what you are selling when you can give no guarantee and its hard to measure their results. You feel as though you can't strategically work markets when you see them fail time and time again. Three words: corporate corporate corporate. Welcome to a world where the 'Kool Aid' is the only thing on tap. ""Zillow Radio"" is full of techno pump up music and blasts in your ears all day long while you try to work.

1046,Zillow,Rentals,2016-01-13,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great autonomy, great benefits. Working for this brand in the market is great. Product is strong and viable.","Account shifts are difficult for the clients, as well as the rep. it appears that management is still trying to decide if virtual sales team is part of the future. Long selling cycle."
1047,Zillow,BEST COMPANY EVER!,2016-01-12,5.0,Senior Account Executive,The culture is amazing! The people are the best in the industry! And they take care of their employees.,Not many cons. I think that the only con would have to be the HR dept lacking proper procedures and etiquette in certain situations. Acting on emotion instead of following employment laws may be happening often.
1048,Zillow,"Recruitment, interview and offer process for Zillow",2016-01-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"My overall recruitment process with Zillow was very pleasant as well as shockingly quick. The total time from phone screen to offer spanned just under 4 weeks, and the winter holidays took place during that time, so it probably would have been even quicker.

My recruiter was responsive, knowledgeable and very kind. I felt like my recruiter was really motivated for me to have a good experience. 

When an offer was made, the details were clear and the aspects that had wiggle room to negotiate were also made clear. On top of a very competitive offer, the CEO sent me a personal note and we exchanged some emails about the company - a really nice touch.","The only negative in the process, and this is small, is the number of handlers I interfaced with during the process. From beginning to end, there were 3 individuals who helped me through the process and it wasn't always clear who my main point of contact was. Again, this is small stuff, but it would have been nice to know upfront the different roles to set my expectations."
1049,Zillow,Love it,2016-01-10,4.0,,Exec team is super accessible. Love the free food. Really data driven. The company is willing to do what it takes to really win.

I told myself I would wait a year before I wrote this review, I wanted to make sure I wasn't just in a ""honeymoon"" phase. Well it turned out that it is not just a ""honeymoon"" phase at Zillow, it keeps getting better. My favorite perks/benefits are our desks that convert from sitting to standing at the push of a button, all the free snacks drinks and catered lunches, the gym reimbursement, 401k match, summer outing(we chartered a yacht for the day), holiday weekend(company flys all the employees out to Seattle for an awesome weekend), great health care....I could keep going but I think you get the point, it's awesome. My coworkers are all very self-driven so there is no need for micromanaging. The members of the executive team are all kind, down to earth and very intelligent. I have friends in the tech industry at other companies and when we compare cultures theirs just doesn't match up. Hoping for many more incredible years with Zillow","The only cons out there are the misconceptions that agents or others in the real estate industry have of Zillow, if they truly understood what Zillow's mission was, I think they would have a better appreciation for us."
1051,Zillow,Finance & Accounting - Sink or Swim culture. No Training or Support.,2016-01-04,1.0,Accountant,Lots of free food. Nice view from the office and good location. Zillow name looks good on a resume.,"Little to no support from managers and supervisors. Management talks a big game but I didn't see them act out the values in reality. The culture is completely lacking in support and training. If you can't hack it, you will be let go. And the bar is set really high, because almost everybody below the manager level is in their twenties and doesn't have a family (or a life!), workaholism was common in Finance.  This is just a huge bureaucratic (and publicly traded) company now. How much creativity can really come from that?"
1052,Zillow,One of the best places to work for,2016-01-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"They practice what they preach - their core values. They value being transparent in all levels of the Zillow team - inter-departmental. Although there are directors/manager/leads, there is no real sense of hierarchy, and everyone is willing to lend a hand. We all work hard, and play hard. The teams and managers are very supportive, and there are many opportunities to help the community (which I think is terrific!). They have free food at least one time/month, and we are well taken care of by the business as a whole.",None so far! It's such a great company to work for.

I never thought I could be apart of such a huge company and still feel important and supported by smart, talented leaders.They have an open door policy that they actually live by!  Not only does this company treat their employees better than any job I've had before (the benefits are crazy good) they take care of the clients and are constantly coming up with new and innovative ways to help real estate agents grow their business by delivering the best product in this industry, hands down. And not to mention, the happy hours, team events, trips to Seattle for our holiday party - all icing on the cake.

I get to work with execs and share my projects when it is applicable, despite only being a coordinator. There's very little red-tape or protocols that block people lower on the food chain from contributing meaningfully and sharing their work and projects with execs. Most importantly there is support throughout the company for having work/life balance. I live over and hour commute from the Seattle office and I never feel pressured to stay late and miss my train. We are treated like adults and trusted to get our jobs done. It is a great place to work, not just because of the perks, but because of the respect and support we get from our managers and execs.

They make sure to practice Core values but, don't seem to implement it in their career at Zillow. They have numerous complaints for this manager and she's still employed there.

Beyond building up each employee and truly investing time and efforts in them, Zillow provides an atmosphere that makes you want to be there and work hard as the company is doing the same for us. We just recently had ""Engineer in Training Day"" which allowed us to bring our children in to work (it was synched up with a school holiday too). There were over 250 kids from ages 3 to 18 and the event was so much fun and so well organized. My 5 year old absolutely loved it and I did too. Zillow also brings in guest speakers to help widen our views and learn what it takes to be highly successful.","Come here and try to find some, I haven't found any cons so far... pay is competitive, benefits are great, atmosphere is fun while not missing the goal of growing and improving to become a better website/product."
1075,Zillow,Company run by the kind of folks you would want as a neighbor,2015-11-13,5.0,Washington,"There are so many pros.  But I am particularly impressed with how Zillow has created what most companies struggle most to achieve; humanity and humility at all levels of the company.
The leadership culture of many, if not most, companies either originates with, or evolves over time into a self-protecting aristocracy.  Leaders ride on the backs of, and take personal credit for the productive work of those they manage.  They look out for 'threats' and protect their narrowly-defined turf. Ugh.  It is so typical it is almost an office culture cliche.
Not so Zillow.
Zillow is a team sport.  Throughout the C-suite, VPs and Directors there is an appreciation for 'collaboration' that goes well-beyond the lip service other companies pay to the concept.
The CEO, CFO,CMO COO etc. do not have their own offices.  They are readily available and view their respective roles as one part of an enterprise that is driven by the creativity of those they work with.
This is a modern business, so there is a hierarchical reporting structure, but this traditional necessity is reluctantly superimposed on a culture ingrained with egalitarian meritocratic ideals.  No matter what your official title, if you have an idea/concern/critique you express it...to whomever is in the room.
Also, the founders, CEO and others in leadership positions clearly want to make Zillow as civil a work environment as they can while also encouraging a relentless drive for success (Core Value: Winning is Fun).  It seems that their model for a successful company is realized through a supportive environment where individual risk taking does not equate to 'risking ones job' and proposing innovative ideas is not considered a way of  'sticking your neck out'.
From my experience, tech companies that get all rigid with an unaccountable leadership class wither and die, or get blindsided by more agile, companies with non-hierarchical cultures...like Zillow.
Zillow was conceived by civic minded, yet highly competitive innovators and savvy business people.  The company culture is organized along these lines as well.","If you are seeking promotion through bluff, bluster, or office-scheming rather than through repeated demonstrations of your competence.  Or if you manage-up well and manage-down poorly.  Then this company really sucks."
1076,Zillow,Always impressed by this company!,2015-11-05,5.0,Inside Sales Consultant,"Excellent work atmosphere, at a company that does the right thing by its customers, users and employees.  I have worked in the banking and finance industry for 14+ years and have never before experienced the feeling of getting up every morning and being excited to come to work.  From my first day through my first year this feeling has not changed.",Sometimes the coffee machine runs out of beans.  Seriously this is the worst thing that happens here.  On a serious note you have to be able to adapt to change quickly at this company but if you are able to accept that change is good and run with it you will truly enjoy the privilege of working here.
1077,Zillow,Zillow is my second family,2015-11-03,5.0,Product Manager,"I never thought I'd find a company that I really, truly loved going to work everyday at, but Zillow has become a second family to me. Management is transparent, approachable, and genuinely invested in making Zillow the best possible place to work. Benefits are amazing, corporate culture is incredibly cohesive throughout the organization, and a balanced work life balance is encouraged from top to bottom. I never want to work anywhere else.","The only con is that the stock options given as part of employee compensation are essentially worthless. The executive team has made it clear that they're focused on making Zillow a stable, long term company and they're not very focused on driving up the stock price in lieu of long term stability."
1078,Zillow,Great Job So Far,2015-10-31,5.0,,"I have been with Zillow a little over a year and have loved it so far.

Quota's are very attainable the product is great and is a very easy sale! The company culture is the best I have ever worked for tons of benefits. 

Coming to work is so much better when you work with awesome people and know that I am helping make some of our customers tons of money marketing on the biggest real estate platform around.",There is no dedicated support department a large % of my time is spent on Customer Support issues as opposed to strictly sales calls.
1081,Zillow,Great Place to Work,2015-10-14,5.0,,"Move fast, not afraid to make mistakes, and thinking big.

Perspective on what's important and what's not...sound work-life balance.",Maybe moves too fast sometimes?
1082,Zillow,"Best Company to work for, as long as you can handle stress and hard work :-)",2015-10-14,5.0,Senior Business Consultant,"I love the transparency of the company all the way up the ladder the our CEO and founders. I've never worked for a company that had such an open door policy before. 

I'm in Sales and what I love is that you really are rewarded for how much work you put in. Your commission isn't limited, so just keep selling and you'll keep making more money and let me tell you - the pay compensation is very fair.
 
In addition to your salary and commission, there are also constant contests. I've won cash prizes ranging from $25 to $1,000, gift cards, remote control cars, a blackjack visor, a macbook, and that's just what I have personally won!

The benefits are Amazing! Phenomenal health insurance, free public transit, an amazing office in the heart of Downtown Seattle with beautiful  panoramic views, a video game room, shuffleboard. Ping pong, Foose ball, 3 break rooms/dining areas, a frozen yogurt machine, several catered lunches a month, the craziest holiday parties I've ever been to, and more!

 I also love that they reward you for selling the right way, or as we call it the 'Zillow Way'. They consistently give out bonuses to the reps with the lowest cancel rates (ensuring they are bringing on new business in the right way with clear expectations) and you also lose commission if your sale cancels it soon after buying. This may seem bad,but it's really not and is just to make sure you aren't 'Selling hot' or putting someone in a bad position. 

I love the fact that I only have to sell to one group of people (Real Estate Agents) and I'm selling the UNQUESTIONABLY BEST marketing product in their industry. Seriously how much easier can it get? 

If you can't CRUSH this job, you don't belong in Sales. Period.","Now for the Cons. If the benefits, management, pay, and work environment are all awesome then there can't be a downside right? Wrong. 

It is a grind! If you aren't prepared to work your butt off, then don't bother. They want the best, they hire the best, they provide the best tools, and if you don't give your best ... well then they don't want you. This job is all about the numbers and not getting beat down after your 30th hangup of the day. The next sale could always be 1 call away and if you don't go in to every single call with the mentality then you are limiting yourself."
1083,Zillow,Happy Times,2015-10-14,5.0,Senior Manager,"A group of us were talking about how Trulia/Zillow changed our life so I figured I would jump on and share with you lovely people. I have been with Trulia (now Zillow Group) for over 4 years.  5 years ago if you would have told me my life is what it is today I would not have believed you.  I have always been a hard working, dedicated and driven employee. With that being said I had the pleasure of working for large retail and corporate organizations successfully for over 10 years.  While i have been lucky to work for great companies in my past, none of them hold a candle to Zillow Group. Since i have worked here I have grew in both my professional and personal live. I have been able to build a nest egg in my savings account, buy a house, upgrade my car and travel. Professionally I have been developed from role to role under great leaders and could not be happier to get up in the morning and come to work and kick tail (a very rare thing a few of us lucky ones have the luxury of experiencing).  Since the Zillow/Trulia merger, while I did feel the pain of being on the Trulia side of the business and returning to being a newbie on a large team I have continued to grow and learn and am in a ""Happy Place"" again (after a couple months of growing/transition pain). I truly feel grateful and excited to be part of a unbelievably amazing organisation where you are not just a number on a paycheck.  For those of you who are just all about the perks, here are a few words. While the crazy amount and variety of snacks and drinks in the kitchen are not the reason I come to work everyday, I do very much appreciate a PBJ, Chips, Lattes, Peaches, Bananas and more...   Our insurance (free by the way) is the best I have ever seen (remember I have worked for large corporations where good insurance has been my norm, ZG benefits are above and beyond). Our yearly reviews resulting in bonus RSUs/Options for our hard working employees are simply above and beyond.   For the record I was not asked me to right this review, nor do I in anyway feel obligated to say random nice things about ZG. Truth is I sincerely believe in where I work, what we do and the people we help everyday.",Like I said above the Trulia/Zillow migration was a bit painful for a couple months. While it was not nearly as bad as other mergers I have witnessed and Zillow tried to ease the pain as much as possible the reality is those of us from the old Trulia side felt the pain.

It's a fun place to work, I work my 8 hours, raid the free food and drinks, and rally home.",It can be a grind.  Making 80-100 calls a day can wear down even the most motivated salesperson.
1086,Zillow,Amazing!,2015-10-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Wonderful people, unique culture, phenomenal benefits, and great pay! Everyone I worked with was genuinely excited about their work (and coming into work)! It was hands-down the best place I ever worked! Zillow's culture is refreshing and vibrant! Plus the amenities were incentive enough (fully stocked kitchens, fresh juice and snacks, massages on Wednesdays, mani-cube manicures in office, treadmill desks, awesome Christmas gifts and an out-of-this-world, company-wide holiday party!)","None. Absolutely NONE! The words ""dream job"" come to mind!"
1087,Zillow,Experience,2015-10-08,5.0,Senior Business Consultant,"I can honestly say that this is the BEST company to work for.  No, I am not just saying that.  I know that we recently went through a big merger with Trulia and Zillow, and it was very hectic at first.  Now that things have slowed down, I can see why Zillow is the #1 real estate website and why employees love working here.  Yes, with any large company, it's impossible to make everyone happy, but overall theme is that employees love coming to work, love what they do and Zillow treats everyone very WELL.  Anyone that says different is either not working here anymore or not old enough to have a professional, business attitude, which should be required for any job you can make over 6 figures in.

Here are a couple reasons why things are so great.  First, compensation is world class.  Given all the additional perks we receive here, subsidized medical premiums, free snacks and breakfast, GREAT PEOPLE, the best benefits ever offered and most of all, the best work hours you can ask for--those are what make Zillow so great.

It baffles me, the negative comments some people put on here about this company.  Those are  probably former employees that haven't found another job or are so miserable in their new job, they have nothing better to do than to complain about a company they know NOTHING about.

I am grateful for the opportunity given to me and I have been around in corporate America long enough to not squander it.",Only downside is: I wish significant others were allowed to attend award functions.  I thought and thought about this and I honestly can't find another downside.
1088,Zillow,Great place to work!,2015-10-08,5.0,Business Sales Consultant,"I've been in sales for over 20 years and have found that the overall experience at Zillow has been VERY rewarding and fulfilling.  The culture is beyond compare and, if you know how to work hard, you are compensated very well for it.  I'd recommend working for Zillow to any of my friends and family members without hesitation.","The only downside that I've found is that my significant other is not included in all of the award dinners/ etc that I've been able to attend.  I love my fellow employees, but would rather spend that time outside of work with my wife .  Not complaining about the awards, just would like to share in them with my wife."

1090,Zillow,A really real rentals review,2015-10-06,5.0,Rentals In Market Regional Sales Executive,"The whole thing is actually great! Dont let the haters tell you different. This is the best start up type company to work for. i had no background in rentals and came to this team and haven't missed quota even once. These other posters are clearly disgruntled about this not working out for them. Zillow pays a great base and it's no secret that some sellers are fine not trying to do more, sitting back and pretending to do work. That doesn't sit well with anyone. The two guys that led the sales team were replaced a few months ago which these other posters are hanging onto, the people in place now are higher up and are just a lot more direct. No clue what some of these posters are talking about the support teams are great. Not naming names but they have closed deals for me when in a pinch.","Those of us not in an office miss out on the great culture that everyone talks about but we did get flown to Vegas as a team which was fun. Also the video conference system doesn't always work very well. I said it in the pros but the people who have posted here and are really bad. Working with people that think they know more then they do because they have worked for a rental vendor. Thanks but no thanks, I'll take zillow's track record every time."
1091,Zillow,A Fair Perspective from a Current Employee,2015-10-04,3.0,Rentals Sales,"While they're have been many reviews from Zillow employees specific to the Rentals team, many have been negative. While many of these reviews offer valid points that are indeed true, they lose credibility from what can be construed as a disgruntled former employee fired for non-performance. I'd like to offer a perspective as a seasoned sales rep, with 10+ years experience, who also left a great job to join the Zillow team, who agrees there are issues at Zillow, yet also still wants a future on the Zillow Rentals team. I'm one of the reps that has been at Zillow the longest, and I have a history of high sales performance. As for the pros, I'll firstly agree with almost every other review in saying that the 401k and benefits are stellar. The medical insurance even covers infertility treatments, which is almost unheard of. Zillow culture is awesome, and a huge point of effort on the CEO's part. That being said, I work in-market, and it doesn't translate (not sure how they could do this, in truth.)","The rentals org is a mess. Accounts are constantly fought over and moved to new reps, causing annoyance to our clients. The account management team is in constant battle with the sales team because there are no clear cut rules on either side. I've personally asked our sales trainer for specific group training as a group several times, with no such training in the works. I agree that Zillow offers poor training, the cause of that being they have no real idea where they're going or even what they want it to look like. One thing this team does have is TREMENDOUS potential. I believe the leadership in place can indeed get is there, especially the two mentioned in a previous review. One of which does have an extensive background in Sales, and has built highly successful organizations. Changes need to be made, there is no doubt. No one wants to work in fear all of the time, and eventually the real talent will leave with that atmosphere. No one wants to be treated like a number, and one person in leadership in particular treats us like we are nothing more than his personal cash cows. Although, that same person in leadership has a brilliant mind for operations and will be a great leader if he learns how to have a heart. He is a definite asset to Zillow, and will grow to be an even greater one of he treats his employees like assets. There is so much potential here, and I personally plan to play it out until they tell me I can't anymore. This team will be great, with some changes."
1092,Zillow,Not the place for a professional and career oriented person,2015-10-03,1.0,Sales Representative,"medical, dental and 401k benefits are good.",For an experienced sales professional Zillow is not a good choice.  Zillow is better for someone straight out of college who needs some experience and Zillow would look good on a resume. Zillow does not provide good training and has very poor leadership. Leadership talks about the core values of the company but for most of the do not practice.  I think Spencer is a good CEO but does not realize how his mgmt team treats employees.

The rentals division is a complete disaster using, turning, burning and discarding people at an alarming rate. The two guys running the division have never sold anything. They are absolutely the worst leaders I've ever seen. How spencer can sit and let them destroy the lives of so many is inexplicable. I cannot wait until Karma comes around.

There are great people that you get to work with, but you usually find that they soon move on to other career opportunities.","The Rentals division is a ship without a captain or a course.  I worked there for almost 2 years and the direction was changed more times than I can count and the leadership was so ambiguous you didn't know who actually had authority to make decisions.  

Don't plan on taking any vacation time either.  If you request time off you get looked down upon for doing so.  When I requested a day off one time the email response that I received was, "" Is that a good idea?"" I guess that's why they don't even offer vacation it anymore. 

So if you're your looking for a company that over works you and underpays you this is a great place to join.  If you want earn what you're actually worth keep looking!"

We are doing really cool stuff to transform a fascinating industry, and there is a ton of runway ahead of us. We have lots of resources to support great ideas. Our culture is extremely strong and well defined. People really get our values, and we try hard to live them. The people here are very smart, very capable, very hardworking, and very nice. We have access to the data we need to make decisions properly. We have JUST enough process to support our growth, and no more.
Benefits are finally getting to be competitive. Good IT hardware and software. Standing desks and Aeron chairs. Lovely downtown office and frequent free food.","Pay outside of the tech team is not competitive, and even tech has trouble competing.

I would say that in the end, the culture they created did not provide an atmosphere that brought out my best, but if sales is your thing and you don't mind pounding out 150 dials a day with lots of noise, then it could be a great fit. They have also transitioned a bit from giving you, the sales rep, control of your book of business to a more hybrid account management model where a waitlist team takes a percent of your sales and you get less commission off upsells and any waitlist calls you make. Part of this makes sense since the premier agent program is now so big that they could not keep the payout as high as it used to be, but it's frustrating to see so many cuts happen on your commission as a sales person. 

I would say one of the more frustrating parts about working on the sales floor is the music and ""energy"". Of course energy on a sales floor is important and something that managers are constantly trying to maintain. But at some point in my time there, it simply got out of control to where they handed out plastic clappers to all the sales reps and whenever anyone made a sale, you found yourself caught in a windstorm of clapping plastic hands which, together with the screaming and yelling made for a very loud and obnoxious celebration. Keep in mind you are in close proximity to other reps, and it was not uncommon to be presenting over the phone and get drowned out with the noise. It's easy to get over this in the short-term, but in the long-term, it's the principle of the issue that I found disturbing and one of the core problems that still exists at Zillow to this day. Anyone who complained about the noise level was reprimanded while management seemed scared (or perhaps incapable) of dealing with loud, disruptive reps. This unprofessionalism is simply uncalled for and unnecessary, but for whatever reason it was not only left alone, it was encouraged to the point where mere disruption turned it to outright disrespect from one rep to another if you were asked to quiet down. Some other reps legitimately thought it was fun to be a part of a culture like that, but there are many, many others who simply thought it lacked professionalism and moved on with their careers. 

Carefully decide if you function well in that sort of environment if you get a walking tour on your interview and if so, then it could be a great fit for you."

Challenging ramp up as processes, knowledge, and data exists in silos across the company and are not accessible efficiently . Developer resources are limited for a company this size, so being scrappy and willing to adjust technical aspects of a project on the fly is crucial to success. Growth is at a crescendo, so company culture is in transition and hasn't regained it's footing. Additionally, as it grows, ""old timers"" are promoted who have little to no experience managing people. No longer a start up feel, but more a corporate environment creating new barriers to getting things done in innovative ways. Work/life balance is absolutely lip service. Young singles who put in 50/60 hour weeks are recognized often and rise quickly, while those trying to strike a more reasonable approach tread water and are viewed as ineffective."

One of biggest cons I saw was for the contractors at Zillow. I started on a contract myself and it takes a long time to receive an offer to go full-time at Zillow. I would not deny that the 6 month contract is a great launching place but the lack of healthcare (many staffing companies have crappy or no benefits), the lack of job security, and the uncertainty about getting hired on is tough. Most of the contractors I spoke with shared my opinion. I saw so much great talent leave Zillow and find employment elsewhere after 10+ months because they weren't getting hired on and needed to make more money than the hourly rate that contractors receive after the agency takes a huge cut.

Great place to work but if you still have someone on your team after 6+ months, as a manager, you should be pushing to get them hired on. With the rate at which Zillow is hiring, why aren't contractors getting offers?"

One thing that always bothered me about previous employers was the lack of internal communication regarding company direction and decision making.  I've never once felt like I was in the dark at Zillow, and if something wasn't immediately obvious I've always had my questions answered honestly.

As an engineer I've always felt like I've had a clear goal and direction, and I've never had to spend time spinning my wheels wondering what I should be doing.  Management works hard to unblock things if any hurdles do arise, as long as you're willing to admit when you're having trouble.","Zillow is a very team-oriented company, so if you're the type that loves personal glory and recognition, you might not do well.  Achievements definitely get recognized, but arrogance is massively frowned upon.  That's not really a con for most people, but it might be for some."

I enjoy being part of a team that provides meaningful data, embraces technology and focuses on the consumer experience. The Zillow Group is a brand that I trust and feel good about representing.

I'm on the rentals team and I like the substance we're bringing to the multi-family housing industry. We operate with a fraction of the people compared to our competitors and according to the April and May comScore data we rank as #1 for amount of rentals traffic to our websites. It's awesome that we operate lean and yet have the highest number of consumers searching on our network for a place to rent. Paying consumers also appreciate this because it helps control advertising cost.

A side note... Prior to joining the Zillow Group I was a client. The contacts they delivered to my leasing teams were quality, the service superior and return on investment was my lowest cost per lease for a paid advertising source. Now that I'm part of the Zillow team it makes my day when I hear this type of feedback from customers.

I hope this employment review helps anyone considering joining the Zillow Group!

PS Yes, expectations are high however they are also realistic!","The biggest challenges I've experienced in the rentals division is clear communication and sometimes putting the cart before the horse. This is to be expected as the In-Market Sales role is still relatively new and the team grew fast. There have been improvements in just the last couple of weeks.

The culture is really special at the Seattle office and sometimes I need a good reminder of this because I work remotely from another state. Leadership is doing the best they can to communicate the culture and this is appreciated!"

1133,Zillow,Best place to work and grow!,2015-06-15,5.0,Senior Program Manager,"Product Team Structure - Engineering teams at Zillow have clearly defined goals and ownerships. I know what my team needs to do we can usually get it done without spending ages talking and coordinating with other teams. 

Company Vision - Management does a good job of communicating where the company is going both in the next months and years and make it clear how everyone fits into that plan and how their work contributes to that goal. 

Ownership - I don't know anyone at Zillow who feels their job isn't important, or as a joke goes is responsible for polishing the print button, everyone can get enough responsibility to push themselves to the limit. 

Opportunities for growth - My manager sincerely cares about my success and helps identify ways for me to improve and grow. I feel that my career has accelerated since I've joined Zillow.

Company culture - I can tell that everyone I work with wants to be there and cares about their job and the success of the company. Working in a place like this is inspiring and pushes me to perform better.

Benefits & Pay - Zillow benefits and pay have become more competitive over the last few years. It's especially good if you're bullish on the stock, because bonuses are still paid in stock options. Also, as of today there's a discretionary time off policy which means you can take as much time off as you see fit. 

Work/Life Balance - many people I know work 40-50 hours per week and are successful. There's no pressure to work overtime unless there's an exceptional business need. 

Office - The office in downtown Seattle is amazing. Great views, standing desks, snacks, coffee & espresso machines, and weekly yoga.","Stock Options - depending on when you got your stock and when you plan to cash it in these can work against you compared to how you're paid at other big companies. I think this is a good con and filters for the right people.
Change/Growth - Zillow is growing quickly and so far has managed to deal with the larger size well, but this is always going to be a risk. It's no longer a start-up."
1134,Zillow,Hard work pays. Daily grind. Repetitive. Competitive.,2015-06-13,5.0,Inside Sales Consultant,"The opportunity to make a lot of money is there you just need to be good at seeking it out, being consistent, not letting ""no"" discourage you and really believing in the product. The job itself is the best sales opportunity I've ever had because of the product, brand recognition and culture. Im about to hit my two year mark as a sales consultant and I am very proud that I've been able to reach the stretch goals/quotas every month. Zillow pushes you to succeed and if you believe you can, you will. I've really enjoyed the challenge.","My biggest complaint would probably be regarding the expectation to bring 100% energy everyday or hit a certain number of phone calls or minutes everyday. Being on your ""A"" game everyday isn't really possible in my eyes. Some days I would prefer to work ""on"" my business rather than ""in"" it.  With the daily eye on my activity I feel guilty taking breaks to recharge my batteries. Some days I may be really productive taking care of emails, finding new reports to be more effective and researching how to do my job better and those types of things aren't applauded because they aren't recorded in the sales dashboard. To sum it up, I think recognition from management could be improved."
1135,Zillow,This has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding environments I've ever worked in.,2015-06-12,5.0,Inside Sales Consultant,"The sales floor is a fun place to be. You learn quickly how to multi task or be a part of 4 different conversations at once. Surrounded by all personality types. I don't know how I could go back to working in a boring office, I don't think I could. Lots of events and food around all the time. Unlimited motivation. And not the type where it's all about revenue goals either. Any win is celebrated, especially doing right by your client. The hours are great. If you come in early you can leave early. Even though your manager is right by you and checks in with you all day, you're not feeling micro managed.. Which sounds weird but it's true. The expectations are fair. And transparent. In my old sales roles I felt like my 1 on 1's consisted of both parties BS-ing their way through the conversation. They really care about your personal growth here. And will take you step by step to get there. If you're willing to put the work in. Also- the pay is amazing. If someone tells you otherwise it's because they aren't hitting attainable goals set and may not be cut out for sales.","You have to be okay with being on the phone ALL day. It's fast pace and you are expected to manage a pretty big book of business. I would imagine this will get better with time, but I do feel like I get stuck with customer service issues that shouldn't be my responsibility to deal with. We need more support in that department. The turn around time for a simple customer service request is way too long. Online marketing and real estate in general are ever changing industries so combining the two it's to be expected...but dealing with the reactions of our clients every time our product changes or restructures in any way can be exhausting. But it comes with the territory and as long as you believe in the product, like I do, then you will find a way to keep things positive and remind your client you're here to help them grow their business."
1136,Zillow,Fun company with lots of room for growth,2015-06-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Management team is long term focused.  Not distracted by shareholders or competition.  They have a commitment to hiring the best people and cutting bait with those who are't big fast thinkers.,Not many.  Teams generally work well together and are highly collaborative.  Company is getting big with the integration of Trulia and execution is largely the biggest risk.
1137,Zillow,Stay away!!!,2015-05-29,1.0,,"Honestly, it's hard to come up with any","Where to start:

Zillow was the worst experience of my professional career.  I made the jump to Zillow because my to-be manager told me in the interview that, ""everyone wants Zillow"" and we would dominate the market.  Completely not true.  Not only were our goals too high, but they were the same as every other market in the country.  My market has one of the best conditions in the country, and it's completely unreasonable to be held to such high marks.  On top of that, reps were able to sell wherever they want.  I spoke to management a few times about reps selling in my territory, but it kept happening.

Outside of the day-to-day, the worst part of Zillow was interacting with my manager.  He was unprofessional to a degree I have never experienced.  We had weekly sales contests at the end of my tenure, and he did not allow me to participate in them, while other reps were able to.  When I was let go, he didn't have the professional courtesy to tell me directly, but had his boss do it for him.   Be a professional!!!"

-team bonding events
-Spencer is cool",felt like I was in high school again. I also noticed a trend of them getting rid of all the colored people. Felt like I was being harassed weekly by my team lead!
1139,Zillow,Wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy!,2015-05-21,1.0,Senior In Market Sales Representative -Rentals,"I have absolutely nothing positive to say about this company and my horrible experience with them. From the interview process which was the longest, rudest most unprofessional experience where I had to jump through hoops like a circus animal, to the week of training in Seattle where I was immediately made to feel unwelcome and had my motives for being there questioned. If you are a seasoned professional sales rep this is not the company for you. 

The company is predominantly young millennials who very  much think they are the smartest people in the room. With little life experience and job experience they also believe the executives are, and I'm quoting here from what I was told ""The smartest people in the whole world"". Though I don't doubt there are some very bright minds working at the company, they are by no means ""The Smartest People In The Whole World"". Statements like that quickly show how immature, easily influenced and inexperienced their young managers are.","Young Sales trainer who has never worked as a sales trainer or been in sales and therefor has never sold anything in her life is going to ""train you"". She is unprofessional and will question why you're there on your first day and make you feel unwelcome. She will then talk about you behind your back and bad mouth you to your manager and others in the company. 

Unprofessional, rude, condescending attitude, almost everyone in a leadership role thinks they know everything and they are better than you. 
Young managers with no management experience, leadership experience, tact or people skills.  

Outside Sales Managers have no power to build their own teams. The power lies with people you interview with at Zillow's corporate headquarters where they have some type of utopia hiring decision and the ""panel"" must all agree on hiring a candidate. Even though some of the people you interview with are not even in the same division you'd be working in or people you'd be working with directly. Never have I seen a sales organization that doesn't give managers and/or Directors the power to build their own teams but their teams are chosen for them by people at corporate. Basically they are managers in title only. If you're a sales manager, don't apply here! 

They don't want individuals. Drink the kool aid and fall in line.

They have a telemarketer mentality that doesn't translate to outside sales reps. They need to learn there is a difference.

Please, please, please if this helps in any way to spare anyone else from dealing with the most unprofessional people and being jerked around so badly by a company that claims they're all about Power to the People, just not their own people and Turning on the Lights except when it comes to fair and ethical treatment of their employees. I truly hope you will think twice before wasting your time with this company. The  ""kool-aid"" drinking millennials who think because snacks, beverages, and yogurt are provided for them are the ones that think it's the best job ever.

Trust your intuition and run fast and far from this company!"

However, the reality of the situation doesn't match their assurances.

Stock options are generous.  Finally did 401k matching.  Kudos.  We appreciate you all changing your mind about that.,"San Francisco office management feels distant and almost lacking direction.  I attribute that to the Trulia acquisition where hopefully the misfits of Zillow San Francisco can feel like they are part of the group once that comes into play.

The San Francisco office is mostly a a tech centric office that isn't as vibrant as other offices.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a quiet egghead myself, but it can be a little drab with lack of other personalities.

The environment on the team never fostered 'learning' for me..i was pretty much discouraged to ask any questions by my manager. From the first day i started in the role, there was a female bias already in place which is unfortunate for an otherwise great compnay.

As far as personal growth, Zillow encourages you in its core values to Own It. You get ahead at Zillow by owning big projects, taking big swings, and succeeding at them.

Zillow as a large company is also very generous. Every year employees get a very cool gift that has a purpose, to make us better at our jobs. Last year was FitBits (good health means good work), this year it was Kindle Fires (smarter employees are better employees).","Zillow has historically been weak on training, but that is changing quickly.

You get all the fancy stuff like catered lunches, happy hours, unlimited snacks and drinks, unexpected Zillow trips out and an amazing Holiday party in Seattle... but I could not imagine my work life without all the amazing Zillowites I get to spend my day with. At Zillow, there is so much camaraderie and support, each and every person WANTS you to succeed. The benefits are AMAZING and more importantly, the room for growth is substantial. The best part is upper management has all started as a sales rep. They know the ups and downs you go through so there is nothing that they can't help you with. Upper management asks for advice on how to improve and what the ""little guys"" want / are unhappy about and ALWAYS implement. 

The CEO, CRO, Directors, Managers and all the Execs are the BEST professionals and people I have ever worked with. Period.","Like any sales job, the job is going to be TOUGH. Some people hate it because they are not cut out to be sales people. Period. You can not determine your role or how well you will do at the job for at least 6 months. Therefore, if you are hardworking, positive and enthusiastic, give yourself time to see how amazing the job and the company really is. You will have to cold call people and get uncomfortable at times... i was fresh out of college when I started little over a year ago. The thing about this sales job is THE PRODUCT WORKS. There is nothing worse than selling a product you don't even believe in. We have THE BEST PRODUCT in the industry... how many people can say that?!? Once you see it work, the conviction in your conversations will sell itself. Most have the initial fear of failing because you have no book of business to work from. You have to start fresh and that is hard and scary... but every day gets easier and you will not have a better support system anywhere else."

Also, we have a good gender ratio here (as a female, that's pretty important to me) which can be difficult in tech companies.

1178,Zillow,The Best,2014-12-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The Culture of Zillow has continued as we have grown in size.  The leadership has done an amazing job of keeping the transparency and collaborative culture alive and well.  It's odd to say but every employee I talk to loves coming into work.  I never hear someone groaning about 'another day at the office'.  The company invests in it's employees and provides a safe, comfortable, and career growing environment.","The gym at the Zillow Tower is not a full gym.  Yes, this is my only gripe."
1179,Zillow,The real deal about Zillow,2014-12-10,5.0,Inside Sales Consultant,"There is honestly a ton of benefits from working at Zillow but I'm only going to address the top 3. 

LEADERSHIP: Anyone in real estate knows the 3 golden rules for success which is location, location and location. In my opinion the 3 golden rules for corporate success is leadership, leadership, leadership. If I ever quit Zillow, they have switched up how I would search for a new job. The first thing I would investigate is the leaderships track record and let's be honest Zillow's leadership is about as good as it gets. Spencer's natural charisma and knack for leadership gets two thumbs up from me. Don't get me wrong I know Zillow is a Team Sport and we have hundred's, actually thousands of very talented people but I believe the top executives are responsible for the long term growth.


COMPENSATION:  All and all Zillow's compensation is fair.  You can definitely make really good money but be ready to grind you tail off, lucky for me I don't mind. When you throw in all the company functions, health benefits, 401K match, bonuses, regular hosted lunches, bus pass, PassPort card and much more, Zillow makes it worth it to work 10-12 days.

WORK ENVIRONMENT: If you are a person that has high energy, likes loud music, likes wearing relaxed attire, competitive nature, likes to play video game at break time, working in a beautiful high profile modern building, watching the sunrise from behind Mt Rainer or watching the whales swim by at sunset in the Puget Sound........you might want to apply at Zillow","Only a couple negative ones.... 

I've been here for just under 5 years and personally  had issues that really started to surface after we went public which I suppose typically happens. My main issues were pay related because I was hired on at certain splits and then one day they just announce they are changing it. It seems to change up a few times a year now. It's not always in the same form but they are always trying a way to push us harder to get the dangling carrot. I get it that it's good for the Zillow bottom line but it burns people out pretty quickly and ultimately provides lower level customer service to clients because we are pushed to bring on more new clients over anything else. It's an endless circle.

We are so big now and unless you are a person that likes to schmooze you can often feel like your efforts go unnoticed. If you are single with no kids it's much easier to advance because you can participate in all the after work functions.

I feel trapped in my position because I don't feel like I can make as much money in a different position within the company."
1180,Zillow,Love Zillow so Much,2014-12-09,5.0,Support Engineer,"Love the people, benefits, culture, openness of the office. Truly the best position I have had in my career. I have never been so happy at a job as I am now. I love the review process and the core values.","401K match was an issue for some time, but management looked into it and fixed it."
1181,Zillow,Incredible company to work for,2014-12-07,5.0,Account Manager,"I have worked at Zillow for just under a year. I actually found the job listing a year ago on Glassdoor and after reading the reviews, I knew it was too good to be true. 
Everyday when I walk in the office, I am so happy to be there. From my co-workers, to the environment, to the snacks--- it's so easy to see the culture. Zillow thrives on our core values, for example: think big, move fast and winning is fun. These values are apparent in each of the employees. They are posted on our walls as constant reminder of what we are here to do. 
I work directly with our Sales Team and Agents. Though at times, it can be tiring, like any job, I have never been more excited helping my colleagues and customers at any other job. 
I have scheduled monthly meetings with my supervisor, though it's rare that a week goes by without us checking in. My manager is in touch, as well as the VP. 
I have never felt happier at any company that I have worked at. Of course there are moments when you are physically and mentally tired, but it's worth it.","The only con isn't really a con in my eyes... we are growing so quickly that we can't hire support in each department fast enough. The work load is tough at times. If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen."
1182,Zillow,Fantastic company!,2014-12-06,5.0,CX Consultant,"Great leadership. Management is all very approachable and really tries to advocate for their employes. Everyone's ideas and needs are listened to and put to action. The executives are engaging to listen to. Even in a room of a thousand people they make their speeches feel personable. 

The hiring process is really thorough, but if you get a job here you'll see why. Everybody that works at this company is a perfect fit with their team. Zillow sees the importance of company culture and does a great job of making sure that their employes work well together. I believe that everyone on my team genuinely likes one another.

There are a lot of perks for working here, and HR is striving to make them even better. Can't wait for the 401k matching to start.",I think people on the sales team have way too much pressure on them and it trickles down to others.

The product actually works. Most of my teamates are fantastic. people who say its like boiler room are just not being fair or honest. I am not pushy at all and I make really good money.    My clients who listen to my advice kick but.,Long hours. They can work on noise control.

1188,Zillow,Hands Down the Best Job I Have Had.,2014-11-14,5.0,Marketing Manager,"The people are smart and driven. Problems are tackled collaboratively and successes are celebrated before the next goal is tackled. I love that an environment of continual learning is encouraged, from bringing in speakers to sharing tech and industry info via email. I feel like work-life balanced is encouraged as people seem focused on work at work, and then communication slows way down after 5pm and on the weekends. It is great!",I can't think of one at this time.
1189,Zillow,Best decision I've made!,2014-11-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Where do I start... Zillow is a complete 180 from my last employer and I have to say that coming here has been one of the best decisions I've made in my career.

- Transparency: As an employee, I feel like I'm really in the ""know"" with where the company is headed/what's going on. This is incredibly valuable.

- Fun: The work culture is genuinely fun and engaging. Teams celebrate wins together, and there have been great culture events to keep everyone happy and motivated.

- Work/life balance: This was really lacking in my previous job, and I'm happy to say that I've been able to maintain a healthy balance between work and my home life. This isn't important to everyone, but it is definitely important to me. I feel like a person again!

- Benefits: AWESOME benefits, especially for those with a family.

I feel like I have learned a lot and have had great exposure to folks from all levels of experience. It's a flat organization without red tape, and the conversations I have with my peers are open and honest.","Getting started was a little slow due to lack of training in my department, but I'm the type that learns by doing anyway so it didn't take long to hit the ground running."

Working at Zillow feels fun and inclusive. Your thoughts matter and are valued. We have motorized stand-up desks, we have treadmill desks, and we even have a 17th floor outdoor deck that you can work on. 

Zillow provides coffee, but not just drip coffee! We can choose from americanos, espresso shots, lattes, and cappuccinos.We have our choices of cereals and fruit, yogurt, cheese, and hummus, chips, pretzels, and popcorn, and yes...we really do have a fully stocked candy wall.

Zillow brings in industry speakers for lunch hours and yes, lunch is provided. It gives us the opportunity to hear what is working for their company or campaign and how they are ""doing it"". People such as Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Jamie Nordstrom, and Arianna Huffington. We've even had a Seahawks player come speak to us. 

We have core values and Zillow stands behind all 6 of them in every aspect of the company. We talk about them at every meeting and we live them every day.

Zillow embraces culture by hosting Halloween parties with costume contests, Zoktoberfest, Mariners outings, sponsoring Tough Mudder (which Spencer Rascoff joined in for!), we even have a game room with video games and ping pong, and we all get FitBits to encourage taking the stairs. 

Also, Zillow pays for your public transportation (ORCA card) and pays for your health insurance! 

We have modern decor and STUNNING views of the Puget Sound, Cascade Mountain Range, Olympic Mountain Range, Mt Baker, and Mt Rainier.

Everyone here is approachable and helpful. You will look forward to coming to work and you'll never hate staying late now and then. You want to work at Zillow!","I do not have a con about working a Zillow. I smile, ever day, in the elevator on the way up to my floor."

The holiday parties are fun.,"The CEO is nothing more than a PR puppet. The real decision maker is the CRO. Whatever he says goes.

1193,Zillow,"Work to live, don't live to work",2014-10-16,3.0,Inside Sales Consultant,"You CAN make 100k first year 
The product you are selling CAN change lives and work for your clients 
Upper management (executives) seem to care about the employees - local management does not 
This is a great first job in sales (they will hire anybody) - if you can succeed at Zillow, you can succeed anywhere 
You will build relationships with outstanding people all across the country 
If you are one of the few, you will be fast tracked out of inside sales (12 -18 months)","LOUD - you will have people screaming, cheering, clapping, noise makers, loud music, etc ALL DAY EVERYDAY 
Its a non stop pep rally and the farthest thing from a professional sales environment you will ever see. 

Revolving door - 90% turnover - don't believe otherwise

35k base salary

Long hours - expect 10-12 hours a day to succeed for your first year - sometimes more 

Job outlook - This job never gets easier, don't believe the hype. You will make even more calls tomorrow than you did today. There are 200+ sales reps calling the same zip codes, talking to the same agents, about the same product day after day. 

Call time - you are REQUIRED to TALK 210 minutes everyday (no, the phone ringing doesn't count towards it) 
You will be expected to hit this number every day. Skip lunch, come in early, and stay late but for gods sake don't miss call time. (this correlates greatly to the 90% turnover). 

You will be told to stand up constantly. Some managers will even take your chair away from you. 

You will be discouraged from ever taking time off. Management pretends they need advance notice to take your PTO. They will railroad you if you are sick and expect that you work anyway. 

You will sell terrible advertising packages because you have a quota to hit. You know its not worth what it costs but you'll sell it anyway. (This is a flaw because the product can work well when sold correctly)"
1194,Zillow,"Good company, good people, boring job.",2014-10-06,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Free food, nice people, nice offices, room for growth, nice benefits, stock options, decent training program.","Can't speak for other departments, but sales and account management is dull. You're working in a call center - talking to real estate agents, having the same conversation ALL DAY LONG. Team leads are supportive and my manager was a nice guy, but if you don't enjoy being on the phone and want more action in a job, this isn't for you. 
They watch you more than you think and the first month is really more of a trial run - come in early, stay late, take a short lunch or you're sacked - simple as that. If you're in sales, prepare for a grind - if you're good at it, theres money to be made. If you're not - pack your bags. Account management - don't get used to a lot of money - you won't make it. Enjoy talking to real estate agents and having the same conversation every day all day. Your headset and free popcorn will be constant companions."

Nice office. After a year you can be considered a veteran because of turn over.","Job hours are beyond a legal right without overtime. It's a class action suit lawyers dream. Job has high call demand that keeps you late and often beyond a 9-10hr day. Lunch breaks are discouraged. Guilt if you have any appointments or need a break. You feel overworked and over regulated. Not a good job for parents.
To cry or breakdown is normal.
Hard to make good money your first year. Top sellers are awarded with a t-shirt or swag. High turn over and most new hires won't last 90 days.
Management can act childish and quickly decide your fate at the company."
1197,Zillow,The best company I've worked for-Z-OC,2014-09-11,5.0,Inside Sales Consultant,"The culture here is sincerely positive. Support is always there. It's not an easy job by any means but there is a team spirit amongst individual teams as well as the office as a whole. It's fun to come to work everyday.

Great work life balance.  Schedules are flexible.  Good pay and benefits. (stock has been nothing short of amazing)  Happily employed here, will work here for some time to come.  Would highly recommend to friends, family or anyone to apply here and become a zillow-ite!!","Commuting to downtown is the biggest drawback for me.   But almost all the good jobs are eastside or downtown Seattle.  As it turns out, both commutes are not the best.  So what is one to do?"

Churn and burn! High turnover rate. No matter how good you are at what you do, you will be treated as if your just a number."
1200,Zillow,You better enjoy calling people.,2014-09-04,3.0,Inside Sales Consultant,"Great benefits package. All of your medical is paid for, and they also give you an ORCA card so you can get downtown. Great atmosphere. They keep the kitchen stocked with good food, and you occasionally get free lunch from a catering company. Most of the people there are cool.","Their turnover rate is super high for inside sales, and they kinda dont like to talk about it. Of the 12 people in my training class, 1/2 of them quit within 2 months. We had a really great trainer, and we also had a really bad trainer. She would shush people like she was putting a niece in check, and I always wondered why none of her superiors ever addressed her on how unprofessional she was. 

They do give you free lunches often, but you pretty much eat them at your desk because they really frown on someone actually taking a lunch break. One of my fellow classmates was asked if he was ok because he took a 45 minute lunch once. 

 They want you to be over 210 minutes on the phone each day which is arbitrary if your making sales. Ive seen and overheard plenty of top sales people barely pick up a phone all day or go over an hour on the phone. They do threaten to take away your inbound calls or emails if you dont meet your time quota, which will ultimately make it harder to make more sales.

Everything is transparent so you can see peoples sales, minutes and call time anytime you want. They want people to be competitive and make that hot sale. Which is the opposite of what the CEO preaches. We were told to respect that we are asking for real estate agents hard earned money, but when they listen to your calls and critique you for not making a one call close, it makes you wonder what really is the quality of the relationship to the customer. 

Lastly, taking time off is not the best thing to do. It's highly frowned upon, because if your on vacation your not at your desk making sales. End of the month is especially a big NO NO. If your a top earner....your chances probably improve a little."

It truly changed my life and taught me the value of hard work. You're working for the largest real estate network online. You're literally working for the biggest thing going in real estate, and it's only getting bigger. The opportunities are what you make of them. It's a phone sales job, so the harder and longer you work, the more you succeed. It's competitive, and it should be competitive cause that motivates you to make the most money both for yourself and the company. As long as you do your work, management allows you to grow and is always there to listen when you need help. All of the people in our office are very supportive and friendly. Great environment. The money is phenomenal and the perks of the job are great- health, vision, dental, free food, and the opportunity to make six figures if, once again, you put the work in. I literally had no past sales experience, struggled a lot at first, but with guidance from everyone, hard work, and determination, I literally went from zero dollars in my bank account to making six figures in the course of about eight months.","I personally don't have many cons, but it's a very difficult job. It's not for every one. If you're looking for quick easy money, don't show up to Zillow. You need to come in ready and energetic every day. You need to be able to deal with rejection. You need to put in the time and hours. It's not a job where you can slack off or just waste the day. You show up to work, keep pushing, and you'll be rewarded."

Great office culture.  Lots of nice perks like Clipper Benefits, lots of free snacks and beverages (big variety), and weekly happy hours.","Being in a smaller remote office, there can be a bit less room for career advancement.  However, this is improving with management's encouragement of cross office/team promotions and an expanding local office with growing teams.  In addition, because of the office culture, every one is empowered to make improvements to the company, our websites, and our services.  This gives everyone a sense of ownership, which makes working here more enjoyable."

IT IS A HARD JOB but if you can work hard for 8 hours and you have some sales capability Zillow will make you a lot of money! They make coming to work fun and exciting through contests and an unlimited kitchen! I am grateful for Zillow and would only recommend this job to top salesmen/women.

* Transparency
* Free snacks, free lunches at the end of the month and on days where there are events
* Great work/life balance
* Fair, competitive compensation for engineers
* Engineering teams are committed to moving forward and fixing issues with both code and process, rather than band-aiding things","* Growing rapidly, which is great, but things do change a lot and sometimes it takes a while to catch up to them
* Snacks rotate too frequently. Don't get too attached to anything, because it might be gone the next month.
* Lots of domain knowledge required to move through the code base very effectively. This can be a little bit intimidating for new hires, and can extend ramp-up to several months if your work touches multiple areas on the site. Don't feel intimidate to ask someone, though, because we've all been through it, fully understand, and are working to improve it."

I created my own book of business from scratch and it's a living and breathing entity that I enjoy taking care of and expanding. The people are great. In fact I've met most of my best friends @Z and I've only been a sales rep for 8 mo. The culture is dynamic the vibe is fast paced and rewarding. The opportunity, with hard work, is seemingly endless; i.e. Uncapped commissions. I pay more in taxes than I made at my previous sales job that I thought I liked until becoming a 'Zillowite'",Work your butt off for the first 6 months and you'll not only more confident in your own life and skills but your own sense of self worth will skyrocket.

You will be surprised how transparent the company is; you can walk up and talk to anyone from CEO or CTO.","Base salary could be higher, but I guess we are paying the price for other incentives. Sometimes I feel that there is lack of engineering challenges given the nature of business, and I feel my talent is underutilized."
1214,Zillow,An amazing 5 months,2014-06-15,5.0,Senior Software Development Engineer,"What's better than a job that provides 3 weeks of vacation? A job that provides 3 weeks of vacation, plus 2 'hackweeks' in the year, where you get to team up with anyone else and let your creativity run wild. (I'd even trade one of my vacation weeks for an extra hackweek). To top it off, it doesn't hurt spending the remaining weeks innovating with dedicated and motivated teammates.

In five months here, I've had a chance to work on a pivotal feature, win at hackweek, and know that the senior folks are listening if I need them to. Zillow places a lot of emphasis on culture and looks for ways to keep innovating. If you're talented and motivated, consider spending your energy at Zillow, and my experience here so far says you'll get more energized in return.","Some of the legacy code can be challenging to navigate.

In terms of career development, IT'S AMAZING! I've been here just 6 months and have already had so many opportunities to lead projects. Additionally,  being surrounded by ambitious, excited ""do-ers"" is inspiring and is a daily push for me to prove what else I can do. It has been a pretty phenomenal journey thus far, and it attributes to why I love coming into work every day.","Zillow is growing like crazy, so there are new faces every week. Sometimes it's hard to keep up! And because Zillow is growing so quickly, sometimes the resources can't keep pace. You encounter the occasional growing pain, or what  I like to call the 'awkward puppy' moments (you know, when a puppy appears to be quite a big dog but still has huge paws relative to its body size and is a bit clumsy). The expenses system when I first started is a good example, but it's better now. For me, these are insignificant details when it comes to my overall job satisfaction."

They also have an awesome medical plan, stock options, and flexible PTO policy. You'll hear a lot of people mention ""culture"" as they talk about their experience at Zillow. That's because Zillow knows when you treat your employees well, THEY ACTUALLY ENJOY WORK! And we do. We have fun while growing a successful business. Senior management has the ship steered towards growth and their foot is on the gas.","Since Zillow hires rockstars, they want you to ROCK. Some might consider this challenge dead in the water.

I feel comfortable to share my ideas with those that work above me, and I truly feel like what I have to say is taken into consideration.

I really loved my job, but if you upset the wrong manager you are gone, I watched this manager let go great people with great potential over the fact the manager just did not like the person, its a well known fact and spoke about often. If you kiss butt and make that manager feel good about themselves you are golden, If you come in do your job and do not wish to participate in being a cheerleader, then walk away now. I was in extreme fear if I brought this up I would have lost my job. Instead I put my head down and did my job. I took pride in my  job, loved my agents and excited about what Zillow's future had for all of us. Upper management may or may not be aware of this, a real shame if they do. I would have stayed with this company forever and continued to exceed my numbers and help the company grow. Knowing that one persons opinion of you can change your whole life is extremely sad."
1224,Zillow,Disappointing Career Choice,2014-05-12,2.0,Inside Sales Consultant,"Zillow is a GREAT product for both an agent and the consumer.  Exceptional sales team, casual attire, benefits, beautiful location.","There is no work-life balance.  You are informed last minute that you must show up to a ""roll out"" the next morning extremely early.  They offer great lunches but that is because you take your food back to your desk to scarf it down and get back on the phone.  You do have great benefits but never have time to use them as you cannot leave your desk.  Extreme micromanagement.  The VP will email you at noon if your call time is not up to par as it is not the ""Zillow Way"".  Great glorified telemarketing position for an individual with little education and relatively no sales experience."
1225,Zillow,Great place to work. Lincoln Ne office.,2014-05-09,5.0,Customer Support,"My spouse and I have been employed in the Lincoln office for 1.5 and 2 years. The transparency of the chain of command is superb. The ability to chat with the CEO, VP, etc in a manner that makes you feel like you are all in the trenches together is a value beyond comparison. Our office gives us the tools we need to hit the ground running and use our personal work ethic to exceed as far as we want. The positive outlook by upper management Is a refreshing and recharging output of energy. I personally work with our colleauges in Seattle quite often and the synergy between offices is getting stronger each day. The flexibility offered is unmatched, from time off for my significant other for the birth of our children to flexibility for the both of us for kids appointments. I was very impressed of the flexibilty and support I received after a weight lifting accident left me temporarily disabled. You just can't beat the culture, synergy and family focus. My office truly encompasses the ""skys the limit"" mentality if you are willing to work for what you want.","With any merger there are growing pains, however in the past year and a half I have seen great relationship building and information passed all around to all offices. With various heads of the company, along with random people from various departments visiting monthly, you just can't ask for any more open communication than that. I forsee our office as well as other offices changing for the better every day as our brand continues to be a champion in the industry."
1226,Zillow,I feel lucky I get to work here.,2014-05-09,5.0,Development Manager,"Smart people, unlimited problems to solve, ability to innovate quickly and test new ideas.  You are encouraged to think and go big instead of simply iteration on the existing product.  The work life balance is very good for a company that is growing this fast.",The development effort moves fast and spec light so if you want a detailed spec to code to this isn't your company.
1227,Zillow,Great company ok job,2014-05-08,3.0,,"This company works really hard to keep their employees happy. Between the snacks, happy hours, prizes and pep talks it is a fun place to work for. The CEO makes it a point to seem very involved in the sales team and I do like the managers. Compensation is fair if your are able to sell.","The company is great but the job sucks. It is not fun to sit on the phone all day and cold call agents who have been called a million times before by the same company. I have done inside sales before, and it was not this bad simply because selling to agents sucks. Zillow is successful and growing fast but it doesn't change the fact that the people you are selling to are tired of getting calls from Zillow. If you like cold calling this job could be good for you because the product probably does work... But it doesn't change the fact your calling the same agents who have been called 15 times before."

The CEO is pretty energetic and cares about employees.","Mortech training team sucks, they don't work and they are disorganized. Too many rules but It's probably because we are a Public Company and have to comply with all these regulations that all Public Companies have to follow."
1230,Zillow,Exciting ride with invaluable experience...,2014-05-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I enjoy the transparency that our company offers.  This starts at the top and is consistent across upper management.  Regardless of which office you are located in, the cultural perks tend to follow with each locations special flavor.  Being a division of Zillow in Lincoln still allows us to operate independently and focus on our core strengths but also opens the door for collaboration with different offices for new ideas, guidance or assistance on products and cross office mentoring.  It is great to work for a company that continues to be disruptive in an industry that is long overdue for innovation.","Most of my cons working at Zillow are related to the constant motion of internal systems and processes.  I understand the need to transition systems, especially when the company is in rapid growth mode but at times it is a challenge to operate efficiently and not be distracted by a new policy or procedure that has been implemented."
1231,Zillow,Love it - great place to work,2014-05-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"There is a ton of energy, excitement, and passion around the products we are building to empower consumers.  It is also very fun to be part of a growing company.  The executive team is extremely talented and open which creates a transparent and collaborative environment.  There is still a start up feel with small product teams and big responsibilities.    

I love the people, the culture, and the amazing views.",The candy wall is a daily temptation.
1232,Zillow,Best place I've ever been employed,2014-05-02,5.0,Program Manager,"The work environment and benefits are fantastic. I feel like the leadership at the top has a clear direction and can feel that when they speak.  Though they are at the top of the real estate game, you can tell the company wants more and are not satisfied staying where they are at.",It's competitive and they want the best talent....possibly overlooking some people in interviews. But overall it's great.
1233,Zillow,"Fun culture, with a great work-life ballance",2014-04-15,5.0,User Experience Developer,"The company culture is relaxed and fun. The people are passionate about their work without being over-driven.  I feel like I have an impact, which is very impressive in a medium-large company. Zillow has many morale events with great food and drinks. Zillow often hosts major influencers in business and politics to speak and answer questions, which can be very interesting. Free espresso drinks, anytime!","Not as nimble as some smaller companies, but for the size they are more nimble than can be expected."
1234,Zillow,Great place to work - but there are limits,2014-04-14,4.0,,"Great benefit package, phenomenal colleagues, and lots of free food.  Plus, getting to be part of something really big and really cool; bringing transparency in real estate to everyone, not just the most educated or with the most to gain. 

Executive staff really pushes ""zillow culture"" and funds lunches, speakers, and events to keep it going.  In Lincoln, the food is usually from local restaurants instead of the national chains.  The speakers are typically leaders of well known companies, political figures, or amazing people doing amazing things.  A recent speaker was from a non profit building schools in Africa.  

It's also cool that in such a huge company the top brass are very accessible, friendly, and really care about the workers doing the entry level jobs.  I've emailed the CEO, Spencer, and actually received a friendly response in return.  I don't think you'll find that at most companies, especially one the size of Zillow.","Working in a small office outside Seattle, I feel like I'm unable to be promoted or change roles because of the limited jobs and job types in my office.  

I'm hearing about the tremendous growth of the company all the time, but I'm not seeing it in my office and I'm not seeing it in the way of expanded opportunities for me or fellow co-workers.  To take the next step in my career, I'll probably have to leave Zillow."
1235,Zillow,Heres what its REALLY like working as a sales rep at Zillow,2014-04-06,5.0,Inside Sales Consultant,"So the culture, benefits package, commission structure perks are great.  A co-worker put it best ""You get to be yourself here"".

If anyone gets me going about my job I usually can't stop talking for 20 minutes.  Most people eventually respond with ""It almost sounds like you're making it up"".

The management treats the employees with respect and have all done your job before, so the advice/help/coaching all comes from experience and they are super supportive.  This place is truly amazing and you do get to be a part of a company that is consistently breaking records and winning month after month.  The culture values doing the right thing, enriching the lives of the employees and clients we work with and nobody (Sales or management) is above this ""no jerks, support your coworkers"" culture all the way up to the top.","This job isn't for everybody.  The people who shine are VERY competitive and driven, and put 100% into their work EVERY day.  You have to really WANT this to be here.  You don't have to put in more than 40-50 hours, but you do need to work HARD and keep a cheetah pace.  If you want the payoff, you need to spend all your time on the phone.  (It's like they expect you to work hard to make a lot of money, what a concept right?!?) 
This is a DREAM job if you are willing to put in the work, but there are no shortcuts to being successful in this position and people who can't stay focused on the long term career picture and get stuck in the day to day grind may find it difficult to keep pace."
1236,Zillow,BEST JOB EVER!,2014-04-03,5.0,Inside Sales Consultant,Zillow is by far the best company I have ever been employed by.  They truly respect their employees and treat us incredibly well.

You can walk up to Mr Rascoff  the CEO and have a conversation with him whenever he visits Irvine office. Our Leader John B. is great, always willing to roll up his sleeves and get in the trenches with his employees . Also I like working for the #1 company in our industry! You do work hard no doubt but when you finish your work day you know you gave all you had for that day and that is very gratifying for me!","As a older employee (in my 50's) I sometimes struggle with technology and speed (although I must say my Manger is always ready to help) Also I have been penalized for not hitting call time everyday, but its part of the job requirement and is a proven success formula."

Zillow is the best job I've ever had.

Zillow treats you like a highly valued employee, not just a cog in a machine.

The real estate space has great potential for disruption, and Zillow is positioned perfectly to take advantage of it.

Work hours are reasonable.  I leave my work at work. No work email on my phone, no pager.

There's catered lunches at least once a month.  Free snacks and soda and cereal and milk every day.

There's a game room with Foosball, ping pong, shuffleboard, Xbox and N64.  People play games daily for a short break from writing code (Mario Kart and Smash Bros are huge).

The CEO and the Founder interact with employees and are very personable.

Teammates are smart and generous with their time to help new hires ramp up.

Ramping up to speed does not take as long as at other companies.",There is no 401(k) match.
1239,Zillow,Look closer,2014-03-27,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Great benefits and beautiful building,"The organization has not figured out how to grow.  They do not want process in place to slow down their rapid speed but need it desperately to support growth. Generally the right arm doesn't know what the left arm is doing.  People will jump so quickly into action with a new idea that it doesn't matter the amount of money or energy they put into this idea.  The company is not data driven in it's business decisions.  There is not software in place to help the company scale and everything on the business side is done manually and with tons of pain.
They are not ready to be a mature company."

-Transparency

-Competitive vision
-Marketing

Zillow has been a great place to work. The transparency is encouraging and I like the fact we are ""playing to win"" - not just compete, but to win.","-HR (as the company gets bigger and HR being in a different location, it's tough to get answers in a timely fashion)
-Seattle based - this is great for those in Seattle, but employees in other cities constantly get to hear about the Zillow culture but are still trying to figure out how to change the culture at their location."
1241,Zillow,Great company with work life balance but lack of charm of tech,2014-03-14,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"1. Great and friendly people.
2. Clearly defined project and well executed 
3. Great executive leadership, clear roadmap on what they are doing.
4. Schedule is reasonable and not aggressive.
5. Easy problem to so solve if you like it.","The following cons are from engineering/eng-management prospective, may not related to other orgs:
1. Engineering talent/leadership is not top level, and if you are the top ranked engineer, you will feel a lot of push back and dragging. And great idea is not easy to spark out.
2. Mid-management is very laid back, need to be more aggressive to help the company moving to the right direction.
3. Granted, long staying people are now in mid-senior management level, but this is the problem of allowing the company to move forward. They have a lot of legacy, which *should* be fixed long ago if committing to it, but unfortunately, the safe route is always selected.
4. A lot of cost optimization can be done within the technical stack, but hard to convince people to care.
5. The technology management/development is traditional, you will see a bunch of Unix admin/DBA and ops, and handing day to day ops and also the blockers of moving fast in SOA world.

I understand a lot of companies have similar problems, probably Zillow is better than all of its peers, but given Zillow is young and want to move to next stage, then it has to do something different."
1242,Zillow,"Got sold the dream, ended up a nightmare",2014-03-14,1.0,Inside Sales Consultant,"The best thing about this company is you get free food all day, and catered lunches on Fridays and randomly throughout the month. There's no dress code,decent base pay. Games and bonuses.","If your seriously considering working for this company you should read this. The job sounds really great at first, your told you have an opportunity to make 6 figures a year and you get a competitive base, which isn't bad. What they DON'T tell you is if you don't hit quota which by the way is ridiculously hard  to hit every month since most of the product your selling is sold out, they will literally fire you after 2 months of not hitting......Your quota increases each month which is called your ramping period. you literally can never take a vacation, get sick,  etc.... Doesn't matter if you get 3 weeks of vacation time., the job gets easier is a load of you know what, if you increase sales goals how can it get easier. On top of that you have to have a minimum talk time for 210 minutes, the problem with that is you will spend most of the day leaving voicemails which are about 1 minute each, you literally have to push through a call to talk to someone which gets difficult because most real estate agents don't want to talk to you, they get the same call all day by everyone else, also forget about breaks and lunches or you will be there all night trying to hit call time, call time can only be accomplished by working through breaks and lunches and a little extra after work hours, the reps that hit it talk to there old clients they have known for a while, the problems is if your new you don't have that luxury.The reps who do well are the ones who been there for a year that have a large book of clients ( by the way there are literally 15 reps who been there that long), they just call there old clients and up sell them, this is easier for them because product was plentiful, and easier to sale when they started,, and most of these reps are burned I've seen reps making good money quit, that should tell you something.
The worst thing is the turn over, they literally have a sales class every month to replace reps , I guess this shouldn't matter, but its show's instability, and that's a turn off especially if your looking at this as a long term career.. I think most people quit because they simply run out of gas, there is no balance with personal and work life, this is the most intense sales job, and I have a extensive sales background, most reps have anxiety working here, it will do that to you, and you will have to deal with it everyday . The main thing that shocked me is how unprofessional it is, managers use a ton of profanity, and have questionable activities that ill keep to myself, which made me lose respect for a select few, you should look at a person in authority for comfort and reassurance and guidance, there a bunch of cheer leaders who will only talk to you and give you a high five or recognition if you make a sale, other than that, they are not that approachable no managerial skills at all, that may be do to the fact there all recent college students with no leadership background  . I'm writing this because I have seen many good people lose there jobs or get stressed and quit. I feel if I can help someone before they consider working here it was all worth it. I encourage you to ask lots of question before you join this company. There are great sales jobs with less stress and a better quality of life."

1245,Zillow,"Smart, collaborative people committed to a clear and important mission",2014-03-04,5.0,Director,"I've been here for over 3 years(maybe a little more, maybe a lot more). I can count on one hand the number of days I've woken up in the morning and not felt like coming into work. A simple gauge and it's a big one for me. It's awesome to work on something as meaningful as empowering people to make better decisions about one of the most significant aspects of their lives. To do this with co-workers as smart, innovative and devoted as you'll find anywhere. To do this with one of the absolute best leadership teams around(just look at their track-records!). To be part of #1 -- the undisputed leader! -- in this space. And the part that excites me most is that even after so many years, even given the dominant leadership position we have, it is absolutely true when Spencer tells us that we've only just begun and that there is much, much more to do. There is so much more we can do for consumers, and so much more we can do for real estate professionals. Really. What more do I need?","We're growing fast, organically and through acquisitions. There are inherent challenges to this that we're not immune from and as much I trust we'll get through all of it just fine, ultimately, it can make for challenges here and there in the interim: clarity/ambiguity, communication, prioritization, culture, recruiting/talent, employee development, operational vs strategic, etc. Again, the typical challenges for a high-growth company so not necessarily unusual but certainly something that keeps us on our toes and can be distracting at times. Overall, though, I'll take all the goodness that comes from this growth since I trust we'll manage through the Change -- but it's never a given/guarantee and will require diligence, smarts and patience.

I'll also echo what others have said here that it sometimes would be nice to slow down a little bit, take a step back and attend to doing some things a little bit better versus rolling out more and more new stuff. It's the classic quality vs quantity/speed/TTM dilemma and I know it's a tough and core strategic challenge to figure out."

The company is very transparent in its goals and processes, and knowledge sharing is encouraged. There is also a huge emphasis on work life balance, but people also recognize that sometimes those hours need to be put in to hit a deadline.  I haven't had an issue with putting in those extra hours because in the long run it helps.","There are some big company politics that have creeped in subtly with the rapid hiring that we've done of people from the big boys in the area like Microsoft, Expedia, and Google, but most of it is squashed when they figure out how Zillow operates."

1253,Zillow,One hell of a ride!,2014-01-22,5.0,Inside Sales,"Being in the first training class was an honor as the trainers had put a lot of work into the structure and detail of the training process. The job is simple however the demographic you are reaching out to is complex (to say the least). The class was comprehensive and I felt excited to get on the phones and start making dollars. When I got out there and got past the first sale (which is usually the hardest) I saw what was possible. If you’re not in sales for money or recognition, you are in the wrong field. This company does a hell of a lot of both. I have always had an above average work ethic and found myself struggling with expectations but the fact of the matter is; more production, more results. I made exceptional money while at Zillow and couldn’t have been happier with the transparency of the management. I parted ways with Zillow because of timing. Had I been 5 years younger this would have been perfect. When I expressed concern to my manager he understood and we separated on good terms with him even agreeing to be used as a reference. The HR department was expeditious with everything and the exit interview was sad. Sad because working alongside such positive and innovative people was enlightening and I knew I was going to miss that. And I do.","The expectations are rigorous. If you cannot handle them, bail. People hang in with the notion that these standards will decrease at some point. I assure you, they will not. If you cannot commit to working insane hours to accomplish your goal, bail. Going into this I was told very clearly what was needed to be done to stay within compliance. These are not scare tactics, motivational exaggerations or jokes. Be prepared to work with real estate agents all day. If you would like, pick up your cell phone and try to take 15 minutes of an agents time. If you can do that in 50 calls, you may have a shot at succeeding in this job. If you do not have the skin-thickness of a WWII leatherneck Marine charging a beach on Iwo Jima, bail. Rejection is rampant and brutal in this job so if you are easily offended or take things personally you will not be happy. This is why the word “tears” may be found in many of the former reviews."

Company Holiday Party In Seattle all expense paid by Zillow.","I have nothing bad to say about the work atmosphere or the pushy managers, I have no complaints about Quota , or daily call times, If you apply for a sales Job you should expect these things. 

My cons are about what I sold I was explained by the few original sales reps that are left that this product has changed dramatically and by inherited accounts the same story. I like sales that is how i pay the bills but I like to sell a product I believe in. Being that one of Zillow's founders own glassdoor this may not get published so we shall see. I will explain in vague way from my understanding there used to be limited availability to buy space on Zillow but in the time I have been here the claims have been made that traffic has grown so more space becomes available to they pick certain days to have everyone come in at 6 am and push that space. I have inherited quite  a few accounts from previous employees (this seems to happen often it is fast moving revolving door here) the accounts i have taken over tell me they gets theses calls every other month or sometimes monthly and they have taken it a few times but have yet to see and increase in ROI they say the ROI gets worse as we do this? and no this has not happened once , i hear this from a lot of those accounts it is discouraging. The seasoned reps say tell them if they don't take it someone else will and it will get worse, I personally do not feel good threatening paying customers who seem to like the service and when I have tried that some agents have cancelled. I enjoy selling what I beleive works. Spencer Rascoff I have read your responses to negative feed back ""I was bummed when i read this"" and ""that does not seem to be the majority of the feedback"". Like I have said the job is not my complaint it is saturation of the product. 

There s no customer service for existing clients they call us in sales expect help we create a case and weeks can go by before something is done. I understand the logic on us fielding the cs so we can convert to sales (they always cancel btw) but paying customers are angry and managers are no help."

The provided facilities are great! I love the open kitchens with free snacks and Puget Sound facing windows (better to catch the views!). The Ping Pong, Shuffle Board, Air Hockey and Xbox room are awesome! It's really nice to have an area to unwind in after work or during a quick break. Oh man, and the candy wall! Great addition. I think it's one of those things you love from the beginning but move away from due to the repeated sugar overdoses...but the cool factor still remains :) ! 

I'm also a huge fan of the free food that's provided and the Zspeakers! It's such a cool experience to hear these people tell their stories and also have the chance to speak with them afterwards. 

I really love working with my team as well! Everyday is a lot of fun with hilarious humor, support and  interesting work. When I joined, everyone was incredibly welcoming and really helped teach me the ropes. Everyday is still the same now and I love going into work!

The benefits and compensation are really great as well! They provide 100% coverage for Medical, Dental, Prescription and Vision and finding that set up is pretty challenging I think. So I really appreciated that! On top of that, I think that the pay is great. It fully meets my needs as a single male. Then there's paid time off, sick leave and some more. So all around, I think it's a great set up. 

Oh! There's also the free bus pass! If you have a car then eh, but if you don't (me) then YAY! Paying for the bus before was really annoying, so getting a free bus pass was awesome. 

I'm sure there's more that I'm forgetting at the moment. All in all, I really enjoy working at Zillow. I think it's a really fun company, fun people, lively (depending on what floor you're on), great location, great amenities, great CEO and more.","Nothing really. As with any company that becomes large I think that communication and ease of movement are areas for potential improvement. However, I think that's to be expected and I'm aware that Spencer keeps a sharp eye out for those areas and keeps his door open to suggestions on improvements. 

Spencer's personal transparency and provided availability are really great! Particularly since the company is so big, I think the amount of availability and transparency from Spencer is really impressive. I actually got to see and hear from Spencer within my first week of working at Zillow! That was cool. At some point I'll say hi. 

Overall, I really don't think there are any cons. Like I said, for the things that could be cons, Spencer and others do a great job keeping an awareness around them and then providing you an outlet to bring those things up."
1259,Zillow,Meritocracy at its finest.,2014-01-11,5.0,Inside Sales Consultant,"1. I have never in my short life worked for a company that cares more about its employees than Zillow.com nor do I think I ever will. From the second you walk in the door for your interview, they are trying to make your life easier. 

2. One word for you. Transparency. The fact that the CEO of the company will respond to an email, and gives out his PERSONAL cell number to EVERY employee says a lot.

3. The earning potential at this job is disgusting, like good disgusting. Fresh out of school (or still in school) the ability to easily surpass $100,XXX your first year is rad. 

4. Need I say free food and drinks?

5. Every tool to succeed is given to you on a silver platter. Although it is up to you to use them, they are provided.","This is where my review is going to differ from others in this role. Most complain about growth opportunities, long hours, or working way to hard. Those three words never belong in the same sentence. The first comes naturally when the other two are performed. The title of my review says it all. This position encompasses meritocracy in every way shape and form. If you are a person who works at 60% of your capability, and expects easy promotions, then no this job isn't for you. You should wander into your local McDonalds and apply asap. On the other hand, if you do work to 100% of your potential, and utilize all tools given to you, then you should never have a single complaint about this job."

The OC office is amazing - always fun things going on with tons of food, drinks, and other surprises.  Work hard and you will definitely be recognized.  The company is growing and growing, which means that hard workers have many chances to move up (obviously with hard work, patience, and the need to fill a company void).  Aside from all of the perks (trips to Seattle, etc), my manager is 100% supportive of my growth and development and as we've grown, I've been exposed to a multitude of things I couldn't get anywhere else.  It feels like I packed years of experience into my short time here at Zillow and it isn't slowing down.","You're expected to work hard every day.  They tell you this in the interview, so it's not a surprise, but they mean it when they say it, which is a big reason why the company has been so successful.  There is a culture of excellence here and those that adhere to the standards will go far and do great things."
1262,Zillow,LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE,2014-01-07,5.0,Inside Sales Consultant,"Love the fact that i feel like I am a part of a family here. I have never felt so emotionally connected to any job in the past. I know emotions at work can be a bad thing but working here has pushed me to make my self better in every aspect of my professional life. There are not many places you can work and make some serious money and have fun. One thing I learned is you get what you put in. Work hard play harder!!!!!!!!!!!

I am a part of the best team fyi!",None of that i can think of!
1263,Zillow,Best Company I Have Worked For,2014-01-07,5.0,Manager,"Overall my experience with Zillow has been phenomenal.  I have been that the company for three years and have seen significant growth in both my role and salary over that time.  I started in Inside Sales with no prior sales experience and within a few months got the hang of it and was off and running.  The first six months of any sales job is hard so I knew going in that it was going to be a grind until I could create a good book of business.  After that six month mark my sales continued to grow and grow and the role became a lot more dynamic as I was getting new business and working with existing customers of mine. 

During my time at Zillow, I have always been able to hit or exceed sales goals and the pay when doing so was at or above my expectations.   Within the first two years I was promoted twice and am currently in a management role.  I see lots of growth potential still and am excited for what is ahead for both the company and myself. 

In addition, I have referred five different friends here and all of them are still here and enjoy Zillow as well.","The job is hard when you start, no way around that. If you work hard though and take the time to learn from those around you there is definitely a light at the end of the tunnel.  Any job that pays like this SHOULD be hard when you start. I feel proud of the work I have done to get me where I am at today."
1264,Zillow,"Free Diet Dr.Pepper, great! Everything else, not so great.",2014-01-05,2.0,Inside Sales,"Free Diet Dr. Pepper, a fast Internet connection, Cliff Bars, and a 24 hour fitness pass you'll never use.","I consistently see more full grown adults cry at Zillow everyday then any other place, including funerals. You're signing up to be the front man of an army. If you get shot in the first six months (aka fired) you'll be replaced no problem. Get a job, be a statistic, make money for your manager and listen to techno music. Try to sell zip codes that are not available to sell. Cool company, really hard job, it's  just not for everyone. But hey, free Diet Dr. Pepper perks! That pays bills, nope."
1265,Zillow,Inside sales sweatshop without career growth.,2014-01-05,1.0,Inside Sales Consultant,"You can dress casual, very casual.","Call time is huge, micromanagement, with managers are only looking out for themselves. The company does not invest too much in the individual employee because the turnover rate is so high. The product is hard to sell because so many agents are upset about the Zestimate. Selling to real estate agents is hard because they are RUDE. Monthly quotas which are very difficult to achieve."
1266,Zillow,"Despite minimal positives, A great lesson about where not to work",2013-12-24,1.0,Inside Sales,"On a surface level, the work culture is positive. Veteran employees are willing to offer advice.","The whole premise of the company is based on misinformation. The Zestimate is one thing but it's difficult to get behind selling a product when the listing information is outdated, doesn't represent reality, and only causes headaches for real estate agents... that they're very willing to let you know about call after call. The company touts their traffic numbers but I'd be curious how much of that is inflated by people trying to solve a problem the site has created for them.

Being a new rep is extremely difficult for a variety of reasons but one the company will have to confront is an utter lack of availability that doesn't meet demand. 80% of ""successful"" calls where the agent wants to buy end in you only being able to offer a ZIP two hours away from them that nobody wants. A saturation point is nearing and for new reps without a book of business, their best hope is to get clients on a waiting list and get lucky. The veteran reps with a book of business are much more likely to succeed because their clients get waitlist priority. Even if Zillow changes this and opens the program to more people, it will lose its exclusivity and alienate existing Premier Agents.

While the metrics are demanding and about twice as much as expected on a daily basis as in other companies, the issue isn't so much with the expectations; rather, it's the paradoxical ramifications of meeting those expectations. Since the company requires 210 minutes of talk time each day, you must constantly be dialing. The problem with this is if your goal is to meet talk time, it's very difficult to do so if you're trying advanced prospecting and looking to find people who haven't been called. You're left using run-of-the-mill prospecting tools where everybody has been called. While upper management would dismiss this, it's pretty simple: you choose talk time or sales.

You better be a great telemarketer because that's exactly what this job is. You're calling the most solicited profession and they not only likely hate Zillow, they get 10 sales calls a day from similar companies. There is nothing consultative about closing deals at Zillow- you better be able to have a ""shotgun"" approach and be as ""salesy"" as it comes."
1267,Zillow,"It sounds like the perfect job. Just give it 3 months though and unfortunately, that perfect job turns real sour.",2013-12-21,2.0,Inside Sales Consultant,"Super friendly people to work with, pay isn't bad, great office in the nicest building in down town, fresh fruit every morning, bus pass, a great company culture and a rockin' year end party.","None of the pros I just listed actually matter. You are a telemarketer that has to cold call 100 real estate agents everyday who do not want to be called. Trust me, they get cold-called everyday and have memorized responses to get off the phone with you. 75% of the time, those agents who do buy are too incompetent to fully utilize the program, and then they blame you for it. The worst part is (and this is where all the stress comes from) you are held responsible for things outside of your control. You have a talk-time quota everyday, meaning your phone has to be connected on calls for 3 1/2 hours a day. Sounds easy? Its incredibly hard and I've even seen senior reps star-6-7 from their own cell phones at the end of the day and let the phone sit there to pad their call time. You can't control if agents pick up the phone, you can't control if they hang up, but that doesn't matter. I've literally made 150 calls a day with low talk time minutes and been told I was not trying. I could see my manager felt for me, but his boss reamed him out because of me, so his hands were tied. I don't have anything bad to say about the company or anything. Its just that the work you will be doing in this specific position sucks. Forever. A senior rep admitted to me that, after 4 years, its just as hard. But I could see she was in her early thirties and didn't have where else to go. There's a lot of those. The trainers see you as a number, not a person. You can see it in their eyes when they look at you. They mentally calculate how long til you wash out and when the new batch comes in and how long til they wash out. They also tell you turn over is 'low' and keep you in a system (you're only among your training class of newbies) that minimizes your ability to hear office rumors. Unfortunately that's where the truth is. And the truth is the turn over is around 80%; the 20% that stick are dog-eat-dog, and you will never be one of the super reps that they will hold up to you as a shining example in training class, who close 140k a month. Those people are 1 in 1000. Oh and btw, you want to move to management? Good luck. Better be willing to show up at 6:45 am and leave at 5:30 pm. For a whole year plus. Hour long lunch breaks are frowned on. I have to work while eating at my desk which is fine I guess, but lets not pretend that's the norm across all businesses. I mean my friend was put on anxiety medication from this job. I'm not making that up. He told me he would wake up at 4 am, stressed out from a dream about selling a zip code. I would have thought that that's crazy, but I had those dreams too.... I'll be gone soon."

For the holiday party, the company has offered to provide a ride home or hotel room for every single employee. They insist that none of us are on the road after the party.  Some companies say they care about their team.  This one proves it time after time.","Company cons: not many.

They do buy lunch for the reps the last of the month which is nice, but not worth how you're treated in other ways.","Don't believe the reviews on glass door that are positive. People are literally given a severance when they are fired JUST to put good reviews up here. If you miss quota (even by $100) twice in a row you will be put on plan and expected to hit a ridiculous number in two weeks and if you don't they walk you right out the door. They expect you to be able to hit 210 minutes of talk time per day MINIMUM that's 3.5 hours people. This is next to impossible when you are making over 100 calls a day and getting hung up on 95% of the time. If you speak to veterans they maybe use 5% of their day to cold call new clients, BUT if you're new you have to COLD CALL ONLY 100% of your day and 100% of your quota. DO NOT WORK HERE. I was there for 9 months and would hit my talk time everyday and quota every month. I missed quota by $2k one month and was put on plan even though my rolling average was over 156% of quota since I started. When you are new you are meant to make them quick money and then they throw you flat on your face. You will hardly be able to take a lunch and your first year you will be expected to work 10-12 hour days. It's a company that doesn't care about their employees at all as individuals. Pretty sad because the environment tricks you to think otherwise. I had 12 people in my training group. After 3 months half of the people either quit or walked out. After 8 months there were only 2 of us left. And after 9 all of us had quit or been walked out."

A few of the top Inside Sales Consultants DO actually earn a 6-figure income, and even with your base pay and hitting just quota, you can make a decent income.","11-12 hours days with lunch breaks severely frowned upon.  Basically, if you take lunch, it's nearly impossible to hit your ""call time"" of 210 min per day- That's time spent TALKING on the phone- not counting dialing, ringing, etc.  Can you say micromanagement?? I loved my job at Zillow for the first 2-3 months I was there. I thought it was the best job ever.  This seems to be the path of most Inside Sales Consultants.  You are given praise and encouragement and low, manageable quotas during your 'ramping' period of your first 3 months.  You literally ""drink the Kool Aid"" (or Red Bull, in this case) and think Zillow is the Best Place ever.  
Then Reality sets in, as does the stress, micromanagement, constant stream of emails about your talk time being too low.  If you enjoy receiving 300 emails per day asking what you are going to sell, telling you to join the next of a never ending stream of call ""blitzes,"" this may be the job for you.  Still, I think 6-9 months seems to be the threshold for about 85% of people, hence the turnover rate.  This is a HIGH burnout job.
If you are looking at working for Zillow and not reading many reviews like this, consider this: I recently quit my position to take another job.  Several people I that started in my training class have been let go. (Actually from my class of 18, only 3 now remain.)  I recently learned that when they are let go for not meeting quota, they are offered a severance pay in return for signing an agreement to not post anything negative online about the company.  It seems they are buying the silence of anyone who might say anything non-positive about working there.  I signed no such agreement. Just thought you should know this if considering taking the position."

Employees are treated very, very well, we have a really fun culture, we're paid well enough and have stock options that continue to grow, and we're still at that perfect size where a single employee can make a really big difference in the company as a whole.","Pay for engineers at least seems to be a bit below what other employers pay. You probably won't get a salary offer that matches one from Microsoft, Google, Amazon, or the like.

1287,Zillow,Great place to work just to get by.,2013-05-10,1.0,Software Development Engineer,"You don't have to work very much.
You don't have to be a good engineer.","This is a pretty lame company for an engineer. tl;dr - you will not get to make any decisions, you will not even be given any information until it's time for you to grind out some code,  there is no sense of career growth whatsoever, and your coworkers will be lazy.

Orders and all company decisions are handed down from the top. If their decisions are wrong, they'll fire some middle manager scapegoat and craft new ones without listening to their employees.

Product managers will hangout in meetings and won't invite engineers even when they're discussing important details and information about the products said engineers will be working on. You will be told what to do, you don't contribute to the vision.

Zillow has a lot of B-rate ""senior"" engineers who will stop any change, regardless if it's beneficial, to the code/stack. A lot of them are pretty lousy workers too. If you're not brought on as a senior hire, you will get the monotonous work. This is not the place for any sort of career (or personal) growth as an engineer.


HR is trying to engineer the company culture, which means you have to do stupid things to entertain their whims and a lot of awkward, low-budget events happen around the office. Many people just take the opportunities to go home early, so much for the company culture.

Taking days off is almost looked down upon although they say it isnt. Its a hard place to concentrate if you arent mentally prepared, music constantly playing(which is nice) but if you sit next to the loud guy, you are in purgatory, emails come through every 30 seconds which can really deter you from your concentration and or missing an important email. Comp plan changes quite regularly, there isnt much consistency, but such is a startup company. You are selling to real estate agents which in itself is difficult enough. RE agents are in massive debt and have no patience. Even if you sell properly youre still going to find yourself in a miserable place once the CC declines come in and the agents dont pay out or answer their phones, losing you time and money. Too many sales people, the top 40% would put up better numbers and be in happier environment if the ones who didnt sell as much did not work there.

1294,Zillow,"There are many more Cons than Pros for working for this company, Zillow.",2013-03-31,1.0,,"Working for Zillow offers the employee some job stability. That is all dependant on which department you work in.  For eligible employees, the employee benefits are decent, at best. For someone who is looking for benefits, these are better than no benefits.","I feel, working for Zillow is a dead end job. There is very little room for growth. Again, that does depend on, who you work for, rather than ones competancy. The pay scales need to be re-evaluated. There are much better paying jobs in the same industry. The company requires long hours, not a job for someone who wants to have free time to spend with their family."
1295,Zillow,"Incredible growth opportunities and a noble mission: ""Power to the People""",2013-03-22,5.0,Account Manager,"Engaging and inclusive discussions held by senior management for all employees promote and sustain a high level of loyalty, collaboration and innovation. CEO Spencer Rascoff is a very engaging, frank and humble speaker who embodies ""Power to the People"". Plus, he's really, really smart but does a great job communicating in plain English so that all can understand. Astounding capabilities due to acquisitions in the last year or so have created a lot of internal excitement.

Excellent environment, location (in Seattle) and fun periodic events at the office balance out some  downside related to our explosive growth.","Inconsistent and rarely proactive internal communication regarding relevant changes to customer-facing employees; fairly close & noisy work space. Otherwise, it's a GREAT place to be!"

1298,Zillow,"Bureaucratic, but trying to remain within startup culture.",2013-02-24,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pretty good perks all around, such as a great office spaces and food.  Work is stable and secure, not a lot of change, so it's easy to get comfortable.  They generally seem to care about their employees (investors first though). The mantra is to further the experiences of home owners, buyers, and renters, which is a noble cause.","Definitely corporate.  From a full service IT team to full service HR team, it's much harder to get things done with you require manager approval on any little thing.  Additionally, the upper management does not seem to have a good idea on the activities of smaller teams.  They instill odd raises and promotion structures without the advice of managers, so some people are left in the dust.  There are also strange hiring practices, when a team needs new employees, It is clear that certain teams are favored (as they are the ones who are able to hire constantly with little approval process)."

Snacks and drinks provided for you, as well.","The company and culture was presented as a great place to work , with the opportunity to make good money. The truth is it's a glorified call center/telemarketing job. Days are always 10-12 hours, just to hit your minimum requirements. 150 phone calls; encoragement to come in early, stay late and eat lunch at your desk to continue working. The pay will never equal the amount of work you put in. 170% of quota will have you under 100k. 
It's very stressful and extremely unprofessional. Very noisy while on the phone. I  have been told by customers that it sounds like a circus.  And the turnover is outrageous!!  Every other week, more empty seats for those who have been fired or simply quit.
I would NOT recommend this position to anyone!!"

The hype is all day long, lots of stupid pep rally type meetings.  10 hr days plus and encouraged, public scoffing at under achievers,  You sit next to people who haven't sold anything all day yet their numbers say differently.

Zillow is truly a team atmosphere with a strong support system.","I felt blindsided by what the sales position actually entailed.  You have immediate quotas and pressure with daily performance measures.  They don't explain the high turnover up-front as very few make it past the first couple of months.  If you aren't prepared to feel as though you are a telemarketer, this is not the job for you!  I felt passionate about the company and products, however, sales calls have a stigma that do not make the job easy especially with all of the online companies making the same calls to the same agents on a daily basis."

I looked on Glassdoor prior to taking the job and was amazed at the positive reviews and felt privileged to get the offer. I realized pretty early on I had made a mistake. The sale cycle is quick, mostly 1-3 call closes. You are encouraged to work 9+ hours and make at least 120 dials a day. It is high stress to hit your numbers and it doesn't take long to get fired if you aren't. I got burnt out very quickly.

All agents know what Zillow is by now and have either tried it, or have good reasons to not want to. It was an incredibly hard sale and I came from a similar inside sales position where I was very successful. I felt every day was an uphill battle. 

I am the first to say that Zillow.com is a fantastic site and am on it frequently, but as far as what appears to be a dream sales job, I didn't see that at all. Don't say I didn't warn you."

Management said that they will always pay below the market value range of a position.  So if you're happy with $35k to $40k on average, this is your place.  If you expect $60k, good luck.  Also, don't expect people to be professional here.  The coworkers (mainly the sales team and management) take everything personally and do not conduct themselves in a professional manner.  If you're a factual person, this is not the place for you.  The company functions very business backwards (i.e. develop the website but don't consider or work on how it'll actually impact day-to-day work).  Also, for a small company, communication is very poor between small teams (at most 10 people) nonetheless between departments.

They don't demand 80 hours a week out of you.  It's all about getting your job done.  The management is fantastic.
