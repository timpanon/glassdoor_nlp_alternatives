Good to great compensation (depending on where you live).

They don’t care. Your immediate manager has little influence- no matter how much talk of culture and treating workers well, and responsive they may be to work questions, your manager has their heads tied. This is an executive policy. They seem to look for a reason to fire people who are sick. There is a draconian attendance policy in your first 120 days (and beyond), even under doctors care it seems that they look for a reason to write you up, and after 1 1/2 missed days (regardless of medical reason)  you have unfair corrective action, then if you are really sick you get fired if you miss 4 days. 

They say well we give you Sick and Safe time- but that accrues 1+ hour per week working- definitely not enough should you fall victim to any number of illnesses that a wreaking havoc in our society- let alone a pandemic. If you have Covid, they require you to jump through hoops of documentation to prove you need time off. I’ve never had an employer with such a willful disregard for employees health. Work or get fired in your first 4 months."

55,ZipRecruiter,You're treated like a number,2021-06-09,1.0,Inside Sales Representative,Idk benefits? Other than the PTO & sick time,"You're just a number here, they don't care about you. There's a chance to fail out of training because they throw you on the floor immediately after minimal direction and if you don't hit the same quota that's expected of all of the rest of the employees, you're out.
The job is like working at a call center too. So if you enjoy draining, monotonous, and repetitive work desperately talking to customers and trying to sell the plans so you can keep your job. Customers can sense the desperation too, and ZipRecruiter trains you to try to sell something in every single interaction you have. There's no room for creativity either; as mentioned, you're just a number to them. 
Have fun being a slave to your phone alarm too. They don't pay overtime so you need to be clocking in and out ON THE DOT. Even clocking in a few minutes early is a penalization. 
If you're away from your computer for a few minutes (if you work from home) you get a nice Slack message from your supervisor asking where you went. 
This job was definitely a downgrade from any other professional job I've had post-college. If you're already being treated like a human being with needs at your current job, don't come here. This was more micro-management than my barista job as a teenager."

They have events and a great culture, but that is not be be confused with the fact that leaders do not care about you personally, especially if you are not a top performer.

I eventually got let go because I forgot to say ""your on a recorded line"" before a call, right after I hit my goal. You can make a lot of money there, but your ripping people off while doing it."

I write this review amidst a difficult time for many of my friends and colleagues have just been laid off due to the Covid-19 crisis. And while I expect an onslaught of negative reviews from many of them, I feel it's important for those who consider employment at Zip in the future to get some insight. Even if I had been laid off (and who knows, I still might be in the future if conditions don't improve), I would never consider writing a negative word about ZipRecruiter.

Unlike so many other companies, Zip delivers on everything they promise. If you work hard and make your successes visible to leadership, you will be rewarded in unimaginable ways. It's a high performance, high reward culture.","Laying off a large amount of your workforce is painful, and it may be a sign that we were growing a little too fast."

Unfortunately, the writing was on the wall for their recent layoffs, as they simply don’t prioritize their employees’ well being. The culture is unprofessional and toxic. They used the Zenefits layoffs as a selling point to new employees, reassuring them they’d never have to worry about that at ZipRecruiter, so their current situation is quite ironic. All of the folks affected will be better off in the long run, but I don’t discredit how hard it must be for them in the present moment. If I can help even 1 person avoid a negative experience with this organization, this review will be worth it. There are many companies out there that will prioritize your success and well being. I implore you not to settle for anything less."

Their subscriptions are plummeting and customers continue to flood in to cancel specifically due to the pandemic.

Hope you’re good at being apart of the in crowd and besties with your manager - if not brush up these skills 
Department(s) changed from salary to hourly wage aka time clock tethered employees. This happened after employees were either offered the job or already working in the job. This happened to me and I felt duped, sad and trapped.

-Beautiful Location and Office
-Benefits are 10 / 10
-Healthy Lunches and snacks provided. 
-Referral Program is generous, but don't abuse it -  Only Refer people that you genuinely think are good for the company.
-Company outings are SO fun, and you get to feel that Team Mentality.
-Generally, the work culture is pretty great.  Most of the managers have a very enthusiastic and healthy attitude. Although you can tell they're getting pushed from above and as a consequence,  you're going to be pushed hard too. If that doesn't scare you but excites you you'll fit right in.  A good attitude and willingness to learn will get you very far.

This is a company that is fairly young and constantly innovating, working here will give you the chance to grow and make your mark on a growing yet stable industry.  If you show some promise, drive and learn from the experience you can start a real lasting career here.","The pay for the amount of grinding in this particular position is a bit less than you could potentially make at other companies, for most folks. If you're looking to make an easy 60-70k+ here, reevaluate your expectations. Those figures are possible but not common for most people in this role. 
-Same disease as a LOT of Inside Sales Orgs. : A fair share of really bad leads.

I still feel the pros outweigh the cons and I am extremely grateful for the time that I got to work there."
167,ZipRecruiter,A uniquely amazing and career defining opportunity for some.,2019-09-29,4.0,Senior Leader,"ZipRecruiter holds true to its core mission of building the best solution for employers to find qualified candidates quickly and affordably.  No solution provides the return on investment that this platform does.  Yes, some are cheaper, and they bring in lower quality candidates and lower volume of applicants.  And yes, some other companies may deliver more high quality candidates, but they do so with a significantly higher cost (think 5-20x the cost).  

To achieve the success that ZipRecruiter has over the past several years, the company had to be hyper focused on testing, analyzing, and optimizing the platform, and continuing to iterate on successes- honestly exactly what you would expect from a company founded by product folks.  

But what really makes this company unique has been their ability to take the philosophy of ongoing optimization and apply it to all facets of the business- from HR, to Marketing, to Sales, to Client Success.   No other company I've ever been part of has adhered to this approach with the tenacity and discipline of ZipRecruiter across the business.   This environment creates two very really and very tenable realities for staff:

The first reality is that change is constant and necessary.   Truly, to be successful both employees and leaders must be able to learn quickly, be willing to adapt, and be driven by the opportunity to grow and develop.   As is the truth for all businesses in this day and age, failure to evolve is the greatest threat.  The flip side is that for those who are not focused on putting in 100% focus toward their work, not interested in learning new things, and not driven to improve or grow, it truly can be a very stressful place to work.  For those who do fit the mold, it's the best place they've ever worked... which explains the extremes in the reviews on this site. 

The second reality is that within this climate there is and will always be career development opportunity.   Staff and leaders who show initiative while working within the framework of their roles, who are flexible and quick to adjust to changing priorities, and who seek out opportunities to grow are given tremendous room to grow.  Again, you can read several of these stories within this review site.  Opportunities exist to grow professionally within your chosen career track, to grow form individual contributor to leader, to grow into other areas of the business.  While some have been concerned that these opportunities are given based on favoritism, I can attest to the how untrue that is.  This company is hyper focused on analytics- and opportunities are always provided to those who put in the effort, are proactive in their desire to grow, and who perform based on measurable factors.","As I've said above in detail, it's not for everyone.  This isn't a great environment for people who want to come in, get trained on one thing or one way of doing something, and then be left alone to show up and do their job.  And there's nothing wrong with wanting that work environment- many companies offer that, and some of those companies are successful and great places to work.  ZipRecruiter just isn't that."
168,ZipRecruiter,Thank you for the best 3 years of my career!,2019-09-14,5.0,Sales Manager,"There are so many positives that I can put here. The one thing that holds true about Zip (like many things in life) you truly get what you put in. I started at ZipRecruiter about 3 years ago and I have been challenged in more ways than I could ever imagine. I originally started as an entry level AE and worked my way to our top sales team at the time. 

See Zip uses an incredible promotion system based on promotional credits. So you promote YOURSELF with YOUR performance. I always wanted to be a leader in my sales career, so I vocalized that with our leadership team. At that time I was not ready to be a leader, but I kept coming back asking for advice and things that I needed to work on. During this time every one from my manager to our Senior VPs were more than open to help me out in  my goal to be a leader. In most sales orgs there are leaders that would not even entertain that conversation with me but not at Zip. After a few months of seeking guidance and reading a plethora of recommended books I became a leader.

I was a leader at Zip a bit longer than I was actually a representative, so I really had a good understanding of both worlds. Zip has promoted many reps to be managers from within (I personally have promoted 3 people), so if you are looking for career growth you are at the right place. Being a leader at Zip taught me so much about how to grow a business, but the most important lessons I learned was how to be an effective leader. My directors really took the time to invest in my development and to make sure that I was able to fill the cups of my representatives on a daily basis.

During my time at Zip I worked with a myriad of leaders in some sort of capacity. The thing I can tell you from my experience is that they all care. Zip has some of the best people managers in the industry. These guys and girls all work their tails off everyday and truly want to see the best for their representatives. Between contests, taking teams to Medieval Times, WWE events, and swanky dinners these leaders continuously go above and beyond to curate a positive culture at Zip. This is a top down initiative coming from the CEO himself. 

At the end of the day I could not have asked for a better tenure at a better company. The guys and gals that I worked with at Zip were some all world class. Ian, Will, Joe, and Ward (Ziprecruiter founders) truly care about every single employee and they have built an excellent team around them that carry the same sentiment.","There are not many Cons about working at Zip. Ziprecruiter is great for people that want to be challenged every day, that are curious, and have a good work ethic. The company is constantly changing and innovating (it feels like daily at times). At Zip it is literally like putting a rocket together in mid-flight. There will be days, weeks, and months that you will feel the pivots harder than others. Always know that people are working feverishly behind the scenes to make things better.

170,ZipRecruiter,Smoke and Mirrors,2019-09-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Health Insurance, other benefits and perks: lunch and snacks provided daily, unlimited vacation, covered parking...","Zip lacks a quality product on both the employer and job seeker sides. Sales reps are pushy, aggressive, and misleading. The product for job seekers is essentially useless (trust me, I’ve attempted to use it a few different times in my career). 

The culture is very toxic, unhealthy, un-collaborative, fake, and there are ample “protected” or “chosen ones” who could probably get away with murder (OG employees or essentially anyone in Santa Monica (especially CA HR team members)). 

Communication is horrendous; as a company, between departments, within departments, between HR and other departments. Managers within Inside Sales don’t even know each other or interact! They work on the SAME floor, just yards away, but don’t even speak. If someone tells you about collaboration during the interview process they are lying big time. Because of this there is a lot of finger pointing, a lack of responsibility and of leaders (and certain HR employees) refusing to hold themselves accountable and own up to their stuff. You WILL find yourself (or your department) thrown under at least a few busses, so gear up...

Aside from initial sales training, training is non-existent. Why they have a team of 10 or so people in L&D NO ONE KNOWS, literally no one has a clue... 

It really is all about money, money, money for anyone and everyone in a sales-based role, especially upper management. Some HR team members do attempt to truly care about employees but they tend get sucked up in the toxicity and BS too. 

Don’t bring too much attention to Zip’s shortcomings though or they will make sure that you find your way out the door. 

Long story long, I would not recommend working at ZipRecruiter as its shady, full of smoke and mirrors, and doesn’t really have the products to back any of it up. How they have 3.4 starts on here I have no clue... I believe that many of the 5 stars are fabricated, read them and compare them to the lower reviews and you’ll see..."

- Great individuals/people 
- Nimble team // quick and agile learning processes (they're always testing and deploying)
- Innovative approach (the use of AI)
- Supportive benefits (esp if you're a parent)
- Growth opportunities (if you have the right profile/pedigree)
- Great attention to details (esp when it comes to office spaces, swag, and events)","This will likely lead to no changes whatsoever but here it goes -- 

- New management that enters and is threatened by existing employees and devalues the same employees who often have strong institutional, value-additive knowledge. To the point where they do everything in their power to drive out top performers by labeling them sub-par with the only support for that being minute, often PETTY, micro-managing that favors form over substance.  At one point, I was told directly by my manager, that I never earned the title I worked hard for, despite many years of scaling up with numerous impactful initiatives and adapting to the trajectory of Zip's business growth. i.e starting with Zip before the company had 100 people to the entire team totaling 1000+ employees, mind you with consistent, positive growth throughout. 

- New management that comes in and favors certain pedigrees (MBA/consulting etc), sometimes with ZERO experience in the disciplines they're being hired for over proven skill sets and contributions. Example - Was told at one point that we needed to hire an ""expert"" in certain discipline to handle an emerging initiative. But it ended up that an MBA was brought on, with little to no marketing experience. They had to ask the team to define what a ""lead"" is (HA!)

- Negligent lack of transparency around career pathing

- In the later years, a stark and blatant devaluation of employee contributions as shown by compensation increases that can be characterized as downright disrespectful. Despite the extremely positive economic upside of the business which includes consistently large rounds of funding. To define, stark/blatant and disrespectful - this means providing 'merit-based' increases that barely cover the rise in inflation.

- When it comes to the funding piece, this only leads me to believe that someone could be cashing out rather than investing in the people. The people likely being one of the key motivating factors in their ability to even raise $100M+ rounds in the first place."

Not much else","Many sales roles are offered, hired & on/boarded with compensation being salaried/exempt incorrectly (outside the scope of which labor law outlines when an employee should be salaried/exempt). ZipRecruiter is effectively side stepping laws regulating when an employee should be salaried/exempt or when an employee should be compensated with hourly wages/be non-exempt. ZipRecruiter should be paying hourly wages to sales employees who do not have leadership/managerial decision making authority AND who’s Annual On Target Earnings/OTE  are comprised of less commission than base pay/frozen wage. Furthermore, due to this practice - ZipRecruiter will not pay overtime when work takes employees beyond 40 hours weekly (whether in the office or at home). The “not so legal” positioning ZipRecruiter takes when on-boarding certain sales people as exempt enables them to squeeze more than 40 hours of work per week from baseline sale employees, and to avoid paying legally earned and due overtime wages.

If seeking a sales role do not accept a salary (demand annual compensation remain the same as ZipRecruiter initially offers through a non-exempt status)."

177,ZipRecruiter,Great Company! Terrible Position,2019-07-29,3.0,Reactivation Specialist,"Great Benefits! No Dress Code, Free Catered Lunch and Snacks on the house! Awesome Location 1 minute from Tempe Town Lake, Music on in the background all day. Very Cool Work environment","My first Con would be Lack of Diversity,  Zip seems to be an episode of Laguna Beach. I have never seen so much privilege working in one place at one time.

My second Con would be parking! the parking structure next door is ""full"" so Zip has new employees park 10 minutes away and sends a shuttle to pick you up and drop you off.  That is awfully inconvenient in the case of an emergency at home or even when running a little behind schedule.   The parking structure seems to have a ton of empty spots my guess is ZipRecruiter does not want to purchase anymore for new employees. 

My last Con is the most important for anyone thinking of applying for REACTIVATION! 

That Department is in my belief the worst one in the company!  it pays a 25% commission when other departments that are way easier pay a 50% commission. 
Reactivation is a Win Back department meaning we are trying to win back clients who no longer use our service  and all leads come from a cold calling dialer.

Other departments such as inbound, chat, and even site registration (a client logged in ready to purchase but didnt click submit) pays more than Reactivation and Reactivation is the harder job.

Management will try to encourage you to put up huge numbers to earn promotional credits and up your hourly pay but even then any other organization would be paying out close to 6 figures for the type of role Reactivation is but not ZipRecruiter even the top reps are not anywhere close to that figure. 

Also the company invested in a employee to client screen-share program and have made a silly metric out of it in order to hit your monthly goals.   So even if you have plenty of sales for the month if you didn't share your screen with enough clients you failed to hit that metric. 

it is clear management does not pour any money into the Reactivation Department Gift cards for drawings are 25 to 50 bucks at the most. in other words Reactivation is the step child of ZipRecruiter which is almost a perfect company to work for as long as you do not choose that department."

(Basically do several different jobs) All while being treated like a entry level customer service rep. (with set hours, low pay, micro management, and nonstop basic training meetings) 

 The upper management has no clue how to run a department. With unrealistic promotion paths and a points system based on how the manager feels at the time. (Let’s not mention the favoritism with promoting specific people just because) The upper management of the department hardly interacts with any of reps, so has no clue how the department feels as a whole or what direction to take the department in. The management makes it pretty apparent they have no clue what’s going on. They didn’t even make an effort to learn the product correctly.  They try to implement basic CS activities to make the team “happy” like getting in a circle and telling your win of the week. Most reps roll their eyes at these kindergarten type activities as they are managing a half a million book of business. 

The department has an extremely high turnover rate with 1- 2 people leaving every few weeks, due to new tech companies moving into the area offering same benefits and way better pay. Hint: use zip to find and apply with these companies, you’ll thank me later. 

The company as a whole is losing the dynamic that once made people proud to say they worked here.  Not sure the uppers are doing but there “rocket ship being built in mid flight” is erupting in flames!"

Any kind of meeting we had as an organization was always fun and engaging, I absolutely loved every second of it. To management now this might not sound good, but I wasn't necessarily always in my seat. My manager encouraged us to reserve one of our conversation rooms and include them in calendar invites sent to a client who may be asking more advanced questions during our discovery and closing calls or a client who may need some kind of special attention. It was also nice taking a break to compete in a ping pong tourney. A variety of entrees and a side is offered daily with breakfast available on Wednesday mornings. Casual dress code and prompt IT/Helpdesk response with chat available.","Good and positive management is deteriorating at a growing rate. There's a story about a manager who took a few accounts out of a few reps' names and fed these hot leads to their team, ironically enough their team was copiously the best team in the department. That all got hushed away quick and nothing has happened since, their team was 1st again the next month. In my time at ZipRecruiter I may have moved desks 7 times. There is a drastic increase in headcount which is causing our building to near our capacity. The increase in headcount is also causing a staggering number of reps to lose money as there is not enough viable accounts to go around. When reps voiced this specific concern management presented us with new training, telling us ""The old way doesn't work anymore"". We mainly have 3 lead sources, 2 of which typically lead to a dead end; the same can be said about support from management. There was even a meeting with all tenured reps in the department apologizing but for a very unclear reason, telling us that ""It will get better"", I really did not see a point in this meeting. The morale in the department itself is also deteriorating."

Management is arrogant and scripted, ironically for a Silicon Beach tech company, they are extremely uninventive, uncreative, unable to adapt to a highly-competitive marketplace.  The CEO is an entrepreneur no doubt, but he has demonstrated is inability to lead by choosing poor leadership to run his company and fulfill a great vision.  What's most telling is sales leadership is clearly afraid of the CEO.  They quake as he thunders his ""rule the world"" message, and they execute orders from a base of fear and insecurity.  When VPs and Middle Managers management from fear, the blame game emerges, and that's a day in the life of Ziprecruiter Sales.

We are supposed to have unlimited pto but it’s a hassle to take time off. Leadership has very poor and limited experience and typically doesn't take advice. 

Zero salary negotiations. Current leadership  is very disconnected between how the role is and what they think it is. Management doesn't understand their employees job/role and as a result,  hire people that aren't necessarily qualified.

My observations are specifically pertaining tot he sales department in the Arizona office. I've been in sales all my adult life and the ZipRecruiter Sales department is by far the most stifling and least friendly departments to work. You've never experience micro-management like this before. The department recently had some massive changes to compensation, goals, product, pitches, marketing, and culture. Leaders here will beat your ear drums until they bleed about growth and making you a strong and marketable sales person, but the truth is that the environment is a churn-and-burn style with employees. When I began in 2016, turnover in sales was under 2%, now it's over 25%. Certainly, not everyone who's hired is cut out for gritty tele-sales but the numbers and my anecdotal experience will tell you that this place eats its young and moving up will be extremely hard, there was a point in time when it was extremely easy but the doors are closed. I wouldn't recommend a sales role here, every other department is amazing and will have an enjoyable atmosphere. Only take a sales role if you are a pitbull of a salesperson and are amazing at managing stress, this place will dump stress on you 100x what it needs to."
229,ZipRecruiter,Account Executive,2018-04-25,2.0,Anonymous Employee,They have great benefits with very little cost to employee.,Toxic work environment. They are focused on money and not people when it comes to their sales team. Micromanagement is taking away from time people could be working. There are people that work very little and as long as they are meeting their goal their behaviors are overlooked. Very inconsistent. Their policy is produce or be fired while having a very poor training team. The initial training was abysmal in preparing you for the position. Unlimited PTO for the sales team is pointless. If you were to take 2 weeks off you are still required to meet the goal for the entire month. I would rather have a set amount of time and have the goal prorated so that I could actually enjoy some time away from work without worry.

The benefits are slowly being dwindled, such as flexible work schedule. 

Constantly trying to change things and pit departments against each other for the same business opportunities.

Lots of “busy work” that provide reports for middle management so they can be held accountable to upper management and show their stats which slows down productivity.

Accounts were being taken from the majority of sales reps without much explanation or warning. Goals for talk time and sales quota change consistently with little warning. This is especially true after a time when accounts were ""redistributed"". They push this idea of being a consultant for your clients but throw this idea out the window when they take away all the accounts you have been working on for months. You are told to consistently call accounts sometimes the same account up to 3 or 4 times a day. This used to be a sales job that I enjoyed, but I quickly found myself becoming a telemarketer and dreaded every day I had to go in. 

Upper management makes zero effort to help you with any situation since you can be easily replaced. When changes were made and questioned, upper management would not comment on the situation.

As far as growth goes within the company, don't bet on it. Rather than promote from within to have someone lead a team that already knows the product and how to sell it properly they bring in external management who do not know what they are doing.

If you want a fulfilling career in sales, avoid this place at all costs."

Benefits are good too (with the exception of dental explained in Cons).  In addition, depending on your department, WFH perks.

Once again, I want to reiterate that dependent on your department, your manager and co-workers can be the nicest and coolest people in Los Angeles. This includes the person who audits these Glassdoor reviews. (Hi! If you're reading this.)","For those who are practicing their due diligence and reading Glassdoor reviews first prior to applying/accepting an offer, please note this company will lie to your face.

 For my specific position, I asked my manager why there was a similar position listed on the careers site. They lied and said they had no idea what was going on. Weeks later I was laid off. This may be specific to my department but please note they will play games with you.

 Dental benefit is strange. It's the type you have to self-report and pay upfront first and then get reimbursed. So if the dental insurance does not cover a procedure you had done it's going to have to be out-of-pocket.

It's no secret ZipRecruiter is gunning for the big boys like Indeed. However, greed does not equate to a  motivated and good working environment. C-level is desperately trying to go public. Thus the entry-level and sales employees are under heavy pressure to perform. If you are an employee from one of the early days and/or just this amazing/perfect worker, you will do well in this environment.

Read those sales position reviews below. If a company treats their bottom-level employees like that, how are they going to treat you?"

No cold calling, if you come from cold calling you will definitely want to learn and master it, which you eventually will I'd like to think. 

There's really no micro managing, just show up do your job and learn to get better everyday and the whole environment is naturally laid back and fun.  

My manager is great. Happy hours and company events are extremely generous and fun. Zip purchased an entire block in Old Town for a solid 5 hours...it was team building as well as organized all out buffet and open bar,  completely open - DJ was crazy good, it was truly an amazingly fun time.

Oh and the leads aren't distributed equally either.  Reps who have been here for 1+ year are being demoted or at risk of being fired.
•management does exactly that. Manage the process (sort of) and are not true leaders

Company paid meals
Flexible start time
Unlimited vacation","I am not sure where to begin, a few months ago ZipRecruiter was a great place to work.  Unfortunately Zip made the same mistake a lot of companies made and implemented some very drastic changes that are now causing the new logo sales team to turn into a revolving door where all of the reps that are hired are fired 3 months later. 

 First off all inbound leads have been given to 11 people, these are the people who have been there the longest and were able to get promoted before the company made getting said promotions an extremely challenging task.  So these 11 people just sit back all day and take 10-20 inbound calls and beat there monthly sales goal by 200% or more.

Where does that leave everyone else as in the other 60+ reps and the 10-30 they hire on a monthly basis?  It leaves them sitting there waiting for 2-4 lower quality leads and praying they can sell 8k worth of services off of these few leads each month.  You do not get any ramp up time like you would in most sales jobs either.  You receive a week and a half of ""training"" then are put right out there to start working towards the same goal as everyone else.  This is creating a revolving door that is causing new training classes to move in and then have their job taken away 3 months later like clockwork.  This is killing morale in the entire office and chasing away people who are otherwise good sales men and women."
254,ZipRecruiter,"Sir, your rocket ship is on fire",2017-06-13,1.0,Account Executive,Great office location. Colleagues are all kind.

Kitchen has health conscious snacks and drinks.,"In the interview you're told they are building the rocket ship in flight. They are a tech company. Change will come BUT with change they have been ""mindful about their employees"".  Nice to hear right? Makes you feel warm and fuzzy. That management has your back. Yeah.. same here. You'll find that training is an absolute joke. They have no ramp up when you hit the floor. Once you hit the floor you have the same quota as everyone else that has worked there for over a year. The leads are distributed by your conversion of sales. So if you're not selling or you're a new employee you're at the bottom of the totem pole for leads. But here's the catch.. They've hired on so many people since the beginning of the year that there aren't enough leads to distribute to effectively hit your monthly quota. So to paint the picture for you.. bad training + no ramp up + lead scarcity = everyone is in the red. Here's the frustrating part.. if you don't hit minimum two months in a row you have to hit minimum for 9 months before you're in the clear again or you're fired. Your output does not matter. So basically the term it takes to grow a baby you have to prove that you are 'an asset' to the company. So make sure you don't have a family to worry about when signing on at Zip because that's a concern they don't have."

First off they lie to you all through training, make you think you have a chance. Tell you that you'll close a lot and make great money. They tell you that there is growth yet the last 3 months they have made it almost impossible to succeed to even hit minimum unless you can cheat your way through. They have a NINE MONTH performance management, if you don't hit twice you basically will get fired anytime within the next 9 months. No matter how well you do after. Oh ya and the 12 corporate reps basically sit and take orders all day to make ridiculous amounts of money ($29-30k a month ) without any effort. This happens while us reps are waiting desperately for even one low quality lead to sell. 
The corporate team was at almost 200% to quota while not one managers team has even hit the minimum number in 3 months. Any idiot can see how this does not make sense. 

Please tell me how to sell 8,000$ for the company off 100 leads.

THEY SET YOU UP FOR EXTREME FAILURE. The managers are brutal aside from a couple. So many people have gotten hired and are getting fired. It's very sad to see that a company that was once amazing has turned into such a dump. Everyone is sad, stressed and pissed day in and day out."

They do offer unlimited time off but it is impossible to utilize this benefit. My manager Nick was absolutely amazing and by far one of the best leaders I have worked for. It is just too bad it was not enough for me to stay.,"I think the genera concepts are there they just do not have any idea on how to implement them. I approve of creating an end game in mind by getting to corporate however, there needs to be some balance in how they are paying out various levels and lead distribution. It actually hurts Zip in the long run to be giving every single incoming call to Corporate reps as they are de valuing the smaller value ones. (I listened to calls and heard this first hand) They only want to work with the high value calls. They constant changes create low morale and instability with their employees. The incoming sales training was awful and deceitful as well. Hope they change this for newer employees. I see a lot of turn over in Zips future."

At the same time, with every change, ZipRecruiter has always made the best decision for the company and its employees. Zip has always been fair with respect to goals and compensation and their desire to make the company better, and bring its quality employees along for the ride.

Every ""Successful"" person on the sales team, got where they are because of hard work, putting in the effort, learning the product and learning how to sell. I will say that people who are complaining, are just that:  complainers. 

I would also say good luck finding companies that offer free healthcare for an entire family.  In my experience, I have worked at companies where I know they are raising goals, so they do not have to pay the salespeople. This is NOT that company.

As for the response to somebody on here who said leads are just handed to 11 people who hit their goals, I would say, those 11 people have proven they get more from that lead then you would and until you prove you can learn the value of your product, then you will continue to be unhappy at your job.

My advice - If you are unhappy with a job, leave the unemployment rate is less than 5% - Which you should know, since that is the space you are in. If you can get a better job, go for it.","Sometimes growing so fast, can lead to some issues that you are hearing about now - maybe take the foot off the gas a little."
262,ZipRecruiter,Rich get richer while the rest of us watch,2017-05-31,1.0,Sales,The unlimited vacation is a big bonus and same with the catered lunch daily.,"I have never seen a company cater to one specific department more than Ziprecruiter does right now.  People who started less than 2 months ago have already quit because they have already realized that it is impossible to reach the outrageous quotas upper management put on us. The corporate/enterprise team receive all incoming leads and they are the ONLY team that hit their monthly goal while the rest sit close to 50%. Not only are they at goal, but a majority of reps are over 200% to their quarterly numbers and still rising. It's alarming for anyone to see one department succeed so much then see all other levels fail (mid market/SMB). Leadership has told us time and time again that we are building a world class sales organization....well when 75% of your entire floor (both existing and new logo) is below minimum there is a major problem. Management won't listen to reps that have legitimate concerns about their livelihood. People are being demoted/fired every month and the chances of being promoted are slim to none. Attempts have been made to try to get something in play that is fair and management will just tell you if you don't like it leave. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
263,ZipRecruiter,Becoming a corporate sweatshop,2017-05-04,2.0,Account Executive,"Company paid health insurance, catered lunches for hourly employees, catered breakfast three times  a week, free parking, unlimited PTO (which now means no PTO because it's nearly impossible to hit minimum if you take a day or two off) - unless you're on the Corporate or Enterprise team.   
Senior VP is awesome.  Direct managers are awesome.  Peers are awesome.
Great company outings.  Great locations at both offices.","The new management that is now in place.  I think change is good - especially at startups as the executive team learns what works best for comp plans, goals, leadership, etc, but change is not good when it's impossible.  The lead scarcity that has been created for SMB and MM roles across the board is beyond discouraging and has made for the majority of individuals on each of these teams to get strikes and/or demotions (which are 20k plus salary pay cuts).  New management shows and has vocalized favoritism to the team he previously led and these teams (corporate / enterprise) continue to exceed goal and bring home just INSANE paychecks while the SMB/MM reps struggle to hit even minimum.  New management manages with intimidation and threats of getting fired if you don't do certain things (say, 'this call may be monitored' on each and every call) that are not currently fireable offenses that we've signed off on.  They are trying to create this ""world class sales organization,"" yet is constantly vocalizing threats about job security - that's not what a world class sales organization should look like.   Be careful if you decide to work with us and just know that you need to take a fine-tooth comb through your sales after every month to get paid correctly.
It truly is becoming a call center that is no longer a positive, enjoyable place to work."

265,ZipRecruiter,Sales Team is a Nightmare!,2017-05-02,1.0,Account Executive,Unlimited vacation time to all employees,"If you have a family that relies on you or you like consistency, I'd strongly suggest against working in the sales organziation. They have a new VP who that shows favoritism to the team he managed before his promotion into Vice President of Sales. He gives them the leads and left the other teams to dry. Because of his bias approach to lead distribution, people have gotten demoted (negative 20k base salary) and/or terminated. 

If you are currently considering working at ZipRecruiter, take note that whatever they promise you on your signing day, they can take away! I have been at the company over a year and because of the many changes, the company is not what it used to be."
266,ZipRecruiter,Cultural Perspective,2017-04-11,5.0,Senior Designer,"Preface: The reason I'm giving a 5 star review is not because ZipRecruiter is perfect, but because I think ZipRecruiter is literally the best workplace I could hope for. There is no such thing as a perfect place to work because there is no such thing as perfect people.

Leadership is committed to being ethical and honest. I'm constantly grateful for the high standards we hold ourselves to and genuine care for people that determines our trajectory as a company. I love the way the founders get their hands dirty in the details on a regular basis and have created a culture where ""everyone does their dishes.""",We have been growing a lot which has created some logistic issues with office and conference room space. The open floor plan can sometimes be distracting as well with people taking calls from their desks; again this is due to not enough conference rooms / no booths or place to take calls.

276,ZipRecruiter,More Than One Can Expect In This Industry,2017-01-13,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"I currently work for ZipRecruiter as a Customer Success (Customer Service) agent and, by far, I've never seen an environment quite like this from any other employer I've worked for. Throughout my time here, ZipRecruiter has focused less on hard metrics and more on two things: making the customer happy and the employee comfortable (the customer is always the number one priority). The work environment is amazing - people are friendly and will jump at the soonest opportunity to help one another. Different teams and departments are constantly intermingling and helping each other, and employees are free and encouraged to explore different departments and roles to get a feel for what fits them best. Leadership is accommodating and always willing to help. The leadership and support staff are amazing - they're constantly working to make sure that you not only succeed in your current role but that you succeed in your role and advance to other roles that suit you (even if that means that they will lose a team member). The pay is average for the field, but the employee incentives are amazing and the culture is one of a kind.","There are very few cons I found to working for ZipRecruiter, but I will list those few that I found.

- Inconsistency. Things change... constantly. This could be viewed as a good thing or a bad thing, but don't be surprised to learn that that thing someone told you two days ago is wrong and is now this thing, which will also be wrong in a week.

- Amount of Responsibility. Unlike most ""Call Centers"", your role and the amount of responsibility you hold also changes constantly. One day you may be responsible for just calls, whereas on others you may be responsible for calls, chats, and emails, all at the same time. I think ZipRecruiter could benefit dedicating certain individuals to certain tasks rather than switching everyone between all three and, at times, just dumping everything on you.

- I don't know how I am going to adjust if I ever have to leave ZipRecruiter. Seriously... how can I go back to a standard workplace after this?"

278,ZipRecruiter,Best Company Ever!,2016-11-14,5.0,Senior Inside Sales Manager,"I recently left ZipRecruiter and it was the hardest professional decision that I ever made. It felt more like I was leaving family not just changing jobs. I loved every minute that I worked at ZipRecruiter. When I would interview candidates I would tell them that what I liked best about working at ZipRecruiter was that on Sunday nights I wasn't dreading having to go to work on Monday mornings like most people do, on the contrary I couldn't wait to go to work. Every night I went to bed excited and energized about going to work the next morning. I never thought I would feel that way about work but this place is that awesome.

The Founders and the Executive team deserve a ton of credit for caring so much about their employees and for somehow making work feel more like home. The leadership is incredible and I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to learn from and work for amazing leaders like Kevin Gaither and Lauren Delfino. Kevin Gaither is more of a mentor than he is a boss. He sees every opportunity as a teaching moment and I learned more from him in 3 years than I ever could have imagined. He made my career. Lauren Delfino is one of the most talented sales leaders that I have ever met. I would work for and follow Lauren to any company that is lucky enough to have her.

The sales reps on my teams are the best in the business. I couldn't have asked to work with better people. They were high performing reps that were true professionals.They are the reason why I couldn't wait to come into the office. 

I have made incredible friendships that will last a lifetime and I am lucky to have worked with such amazing people at ZipRecruiter. This place truly is special. Working here was the best career decision I ever made.",It would be great if the Product Marketing Team and Sales can work together more prior to launching a new product.

Most problems and inefficient processes are easy to fix/change, as long as you talk to the right people and make a business case of it.

What I really love about this place is that I came here knowing nothing about the employment marketing industry, in a time where I had no idea what I wanted to do career-wise, and I got a chance to bounce around to a few different departments until I found something I felt like I could do long-term.","Company policies and culture do support a good work/life balance on paper, but that line gets really blurry if you want to feel like you're taking complete ownership of your work.

My coworkers are some of the most amazing people I have ever met and have really made this job feel like home. Because it is still a startup, your job duties can change constantly, but management does it's best to walk you through the new processes and compensate you for trying new things. Even though the job can be a grind sometimes, the people here really make it enjoyable and getting positive feedback from clients makes it all worth it.",The company is growing rapidly so I just hope we are able to keep the company culture that makes this such a special place.

Stop making it seem like you are doing us a favor by letting us work there, and that you love that we are there. Change is good, and expected. However, the ego of the managers doesn't matter. What matters is the employees. At this stage of the game there are so few sales people that you have 3 managers babysitting 18 people, if that. That is why you'll have hard times recruiting top talent. Not many people will be comfortable living on $30,000 base with an OTE of $50,000. Especially not in SaMo. From the competing companies in Tempe / greater Phoenix area, they are offering much more, so do yourself a favor if you are considering ZipRecruiter.

Fast growth also means a lot of opportunities for advancement, both into management and not. On the engineering side of the business, there are managerial and technical advancement tracks. 

Open sourcing of non-business critical software is encouraged, and our engineers have contributed back quite a bit of code. (Search ""ZipRecruiter"" on CPAN for examples.)

I enjoy Perl, and ZipRecruiter is a great place to work as a Perl developer. You'll be working with names you know from CPAN, people who really love the language. There are also several other languages in use around the company if Perl isn't your thing. (Python, Java, Scala, C++)

ZipRecruiter means what they say about work-life balance. I've personally witnessed the CEO asking other C-level executives to not pressure their employees into working long hours. I've also heard the CEO telling an employee that they shouldn't be cowed if his name is invoked by a manager: That if the CEO needed an employee to do something urgently, it would come from him directly. People work hard here, but it's not a place that tolerates death marches. 

The offices are beautiful, and Santa Monica is a great place to work. Plenty of food options, gorgeous views, and lots of good bike infrastructure.

303,ZipRecruiter,Great Place to Work,2016-02-01,5.0,Account Manager,"I've been working at Zip for about a year and a half and it has been exciting work environment that embraces growth, encourages challenge and promotion. Management makes it a point to communicate with employees and solicit feedback and implement ideas. 

The culture goes beyond the tasty snacks in the kitchen and unlimited vacation. This is a company that breeds growth and opportunity.","Zip is on a growth path and regular changes arise from day to day. At times this can be challenging, but very much what makes the ride so much fun."
304,ZipRecruiter,Best job ever!,2016-02-01,5.0,Inside Sales,"I have been here for almost two years in the Sales Department. In that time, I have seen many positive changes within the sales organization. The core ZipRecruiter product gets better and better every quarter. It practically sells itself.  Attaining a 100K OTE is very possible at this company within 1 year. The VP of sales genuinely cares about your future and listens to all the reps 
Professionally, I've been given skills to move up in my field and felt I've very much been given the opportunity to contribute to the team and the mission. The sales team is awesome, the office is pristine, free lunch, fun and unique company events",Commission is made on collections
305,ZipRecruiter,Exceptional Company,2016-02-01,5.0,ZipHR,"The best asset ZipRecruiter has and continues to cultivate are its people. I continue to work around smart, driven individuals who are constantly striving to learn, grow and build something exceptional. 

Second, the product is actually very good. I used to be a recruiter, and while a job board is certainly not a new idea, they've done a great job delivering results and adding features that make the software easier to use, more intuitive etc. 

Finally, although many of the reviewers here seem to have had a different experience, I have always been very fairly compensated, and the benefits here are the best I've ever seen.","As with any company experiencing rapid growth, change is inevitable. Unfortunately, this sometimes means a new structure, process etc. is implemented that doesn't work. If you want to work in tech, or any growing company, be prepared for change, some of which you will like, some of which you won't. 

However, I've always found leadership listens very objectively, so if a change is truly a bad one you can guarantee it will shift."
306,ZipRecruiter,Great Company,2016-01-31,5.0,Account Executive,ZipRecruiter has been a great company to work for. They have taken very good care of me as an employee and have made me feel part of their equation for success.  I look forward to going to work everyday. They have awesome snack and drinks for us all day. They have awesome benefits and an awesome vacation policy.,Only thing I wish was different was faster communication amongst all teams when new products and features are released.

Great health benefits and work/life balance.",What could be viewed as a con is the constant change so if change scares you then I wouldn't recommend ZipRecruiter.
308,ZipRecruiter,ZipRecruiter is Awesome,2016-01-31,5.0,Finance Team,ZipRecruiter has a great management team that encourages the professional development of all its employees. The work environment is team oriented and collaborative.  Employees are able to take on responsibility and create an impact. Zip does a great job of encouraging work life balance. There are frequent Zip happy hours and events outside of work. The summer and holiday parties are both legendary.,Work pace is fast and there can be a relatively steep learning curve depending on what team you're on.
309,ZipRecruiter,Entry Level Sales,2016-01-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"ZipRecruiter has free food! ZipRecruiter is located in Santa Monica, right off the promenade! ZipRecruiter has a lot of money from investors, allowing them to hire top talent! ZipRecruiter is the darling of Silicon Beach! ZipRecruiter has a culture that can't be beat! Happy Hours and company events happen all the time!","The cons are the pros have nothing to do with sales representative's bottom line (besides lunch). In fact, most of the pros are indirect cons for most people. Santa Monica is expensive, but we are paid below a level that would allow us to comfortably maintain life. 

Quick math:

Free lunch: $300 a month
Santa Monica rent: averages between $1,500 to $2,000 a month (some lower, some higher)
If you don't live in the area, or if you drive: gas to get to and from is about $200 a month
Don't forget breakfast and dinner: $1000 a month
Any other things you are responsible for: TBD

Now take $30,000 salary and try to live with that. 

This move to Phoenix in two weeks is to stretch the dollar further. People just cannot live on what you small amount of money you provide, with an unproven comp plan. 

Interviewers and candidates alike: Beware! You can get promoted quick, but it is a gamble. Most people who started SMB are still SMB 6 months later. You could be a lucky one, or you can buy a $100 round trip ticket to Vegas to get the same odds at a blackjack table. The choice is yours - choose wisely."
310,ZipRecruiter,"Successful, Challenging, Fast Paced Winner",2016-01-30,4.0,,"ZipRecruiter is by far the most positively challenging work experiences I've ever encountered, and that's what makes it great.  There's not a single leader in this organization that rests on their laurels, relies on convention, or ""dials it in"".  The result is an environment of exploration, evolution, and growth that is laser focused on making ZipRecruiter the most successful company it can be.  The biggest ""Pro"" for working here is that this company takes in new information, learns from it, and adapts more effectively than anyone else.  While the pace of change can be difficult for some, it's the key to our overwhelming success.  When mistakes are realized, we right the ship as quickly as possible.  When new obstacles or opportunities come to light, we alter our course to keep the ship afloat and heading toward our goal of being the best place to fill a job fast.  

And of course there's all the other things we do:
Fully stocked kitchens
Class A company parties twice yearly
Ideally located near restaurants, pubs, shopping, waterfront, etc.
Casual, fun, and open work environment
Ridiculously generous PTO policy
100% paid health insurance premiums (Not a typo...I know, right!?)","I think the cons we experience are truly a matter of perspective.  While some would say our pace of change is a con, for those who understand and appreciate it, this provides an opportunity to thrive, along with opportunities for growth."

314,ZipRecruiter,Great place to work,2016-01-30,5.0,Sales,"In my experience at Zip, people have been genuinely supportive and good. I enjoy the people that work around me. 

When I first started here, there was little structure like most startups. Working in a startup vs. a mature company is very different.  

As the company grew, we started developing structure and more concrete processes. Patience was needed. There were frustrating times. All things I have seen before and you have to roll with the punches. You have to believe in the process and people around you. If you are loyal to the company, they are loyal to you. The company has been loyal to me.

The resources available to me are so much better compared to when I started. 

My comp plan is straight forward and easy to understand. Important in a sales role. At a previous company, you needed a Phd to understand your commission plan. Here it is very straight forward and fair. If you put in the work you will get compensated well. 

I believe in the product (you have to in sales) and excited about the roadmap for my team.

They value my experience, input and have been fair when I pushed back.

Vacation time and benefits are really good.",See above for pros and cons.

People here are very nice and welcoming, that's why so many people here become really good friends! 

The pay is great, you get a base salary and you can make unlimited commission!!! Hard work pays off here!!!

This is a high fast - growth company that is not afraid to spend money on Marketing and Branding to support sales. Management is there to help you succeed, and if you work hard, you will be rewarded.  Very smart technology, with smart people on top in place.  Changes do happen frequently, but when you grow as fast as ZipRecruiter that is inevitable . Most important to me is that I believe all changes that happen are with the intent for the  good of the company and to help me succeed financially and sell a better product & solution.  Free Healthcare, and unlimited PTO ain't too shabby either. Contrary to other reviews on here, I have never been discouraged to take any pto that I wanted to.",i think the culture that was created initially has led to some unprofessional employees hence some of the negative reviews on here.

I hate to be so blunt but it is so frustrating the route they have chosen to take. Employees are not fairly compensated at all. However you may see our marketing team post articles about jobseekers who deserve to get paid what they are worth, hypocrites right?

- Very team segmented. Not much universal culture/ team communication. Once you are in a department, does not seem very easy to interact at work with other departments.  

- Main concern is revenue generation. This is not necessarily a con per se, however that takes precedent over any employee concern, if said employee is in a revenue generating role.

Some people got very lucky to get their jobs, and are now destroying the entire sales team and culture. Zip used to have an amazing work hard play hard culture - that WORKED! Employees were happy - you would never hear any negative things said about Zip. Then, we accepted funding - and everything changed. Now the dynamic is to ""fluff the numbers"" and hire tons of new sales people - when pretty much no one is hitting goal. I'm sorry - but I don't see how that is justified. If your CURRENT team cannot hit goal based on the leads that they have, how do you expect NEW people to come in and do it? They are hiring people at more than half the pay as people that have been around for a while - and it seems like they are doing everything possible to get the tenured people out to continue that trend.

People are leaving left and right, and at the pay that they are offering new sales people I would RUN. Not a good time to start, the good ole' days are gone.

In stark contrast to the overly positive (this is what should be on Glassdoor representing ZipRecruiter) reviews from last year, you'll notice a downtrend. That is not a coincidence. All levels of management, from team leads, to directors, to VP's JUST DON'T CARE. How can you believe it? Well, how does the expression go? Fool me once, shame on you... It is real. Conditions on the sales floor continue to deteriorate at a pace faster than a Usain Bolt mile. The comp plan is a joke, especially given where we are at in Los Angeles. No wonder management is wishing upon a star for the next crop of people to be demoted. Demotions, by the way, are easier to obtain than quota these days. That is the best way to appease the investors. When we go to managers, their response is just dial more. Yeah, that makes sense. We will continue to bombard prospective clients three times a day, and complement those redundant calls with automated email campaigns.

Super successful, fast growth company AND the people are really nice.  No way. "" but I took the job anyway.  Blown me away.  It's true.  The people are really nice and super smart. And we're crushing it.",Probably too nice at times perhaps. Just like any company there's people who should go and management is too nice and keeps them on too long.  But that's just it... Management is loyal.  Which is rare to see.
356,ZipRecruiter,Amazing LA tech company,2014-11-14,5.0,Senior Director,"ZipRecruiter has vision, leadership, culture, benefits, a healthy business and serious VC backing...this is an AMAZING company that is headed for the stars.",Hard-working culture could deter some looking for a easygoing pace.
357,ZipRecruiter,"Fun, friendly, and growing fast.",2014-11-14,5.0,Software Engineer,"I work in engineering. Everyone is friendly, smart, and helpful. Very flexible hours and time-off. No crazy deadlines. Management structure in engineering is flat. Minimal meetings. Engineers are just allowed to get their work done. Process does not get in your way.",Not much that I can think of. Might be a little harder for new and junior engineers to dive in. There's a lot of code. It's complicated. Not too much documentation (since so much is changing). Development environment tools and support is improving though.
358,ZipRecruiter,Best Company I've Ever Worked For,2014-11-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"High hiring standards allows for a great deal of autonomy. Those standards also mean you're working with some of the best performers in the LA tech space. The leadership team sets clear goals, with a good balance between customer success, employee happiness, and long term company growth. Teams are flat, efficient, and take on a wide variety of projects. Above market compensation and benefits, and generous rewards for merit as well. Quite honestly, I couldn't ask for a better place to work.","Growth brings challenges, namely you're constantly working with new people and trying to get organizational structure right. Not insurmountable, but definitely something to keep an eye on. As new talent comes on board and new layers of management become necessary, want to make sure the great existing culture and work output isn't diluted."
359,ZipRecruiter,Excellent Company Culture with Inspiring Leadership,2014-11-14,5.0,Account Manager,"The growth potential here is incredible - leadership has its eye on taking over the job industry, and they are putting the people in place to do it. 

Constant change and growth is being handled very well, and employees are treated like adults, with training, growth opportunities, and the ability to set your own schedule and vacation time. Not that you'll mind being at the office - 270 degree panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean are tough to beat. 

Compensation and benefits are excellent, and much effort and $ has been put into maintaining the special atmosphere they have created here.","Hard to think of any, honestly. This is definitely a sales-driven organization, but you should know that coming in. 
One of the best companies out there to work for by far."
360,ZipRecruiter,Best Company on the West Coast,2014-11-14,5.0,Senior Finance Analyst,"I enjoy going into work every day. Each person is smarter than the next. We are on a rocket ship and not looking back. As for the culture, we get massages once a month, catered food regularly, drinking events for all occasions :) and a Zip Basketball court in the office. Hard not to love it",Couldn't think of one.... I'll re post if something comes up
361,ZipRecruiter,Great group of people,2014-11-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great location (tons of food choices), great people, no mandatory late nights/crazy deadlines. Concerns are listened to and addressed in a timely manner.",The technology is a little hairy and not what you would expect from a new company. Could use a lot of refactoring.
362,ZipRecruiter,Best place I have worked,2014-11-09,5.0,Software Engineer,"Within a few months, the company culture of openness and respect toward all employees made this job stand out as the best job I have had in my nearly 15 year career.  After a year, I still feel the same way.
The company pays well and also provides excellent benefits like stock options and fully paid health insurance.","If I find something I would consider a con to working here, I will try to update the review."
363,ZipRecruiter,"Ignore the CEO, it's a great place to work!",2014-11-06,4.0,Anonymous,"Zip has basically taken every aspect of hiring and managing employees, stripped away all assumptions about ""the way things are done"", and come up with their own way to do it. Every aspect of the hiring process and the work environment has been well thought out and executed. You will never get a question like ""what's the biggest challenge you faced in a previous job and how did you overcome it?"" In the interview. When they extend me an offer, no beating around the bush talking with HR about it--one of the founders personally presents it and asks what questions I have. Yay--offer accepted and first day at work! They walk me down to the apple store, buy all the latest Mac hardware my little heart desires, and then proceed to get out of my way and let me do my job. It's heaven--with free snacks. The people are all super smart and no one is killing themselves with crazy hours. FWIW a lot of employees have little kids so it's a really family-friendly work environment.","The CEO Ian is a total jerk. Seriously if my kid acted like him at school, he'd be flagged as a bully. He disguises his bullying as ""subversive"" ""humor"". However, if you work at zip you'll probably not have to interact with him much."
364,ZipRecruiter,Best Company & Job Ever,2014-10-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"What's not to love about a fast growing, fun and rewarding company and job? I'm often asked what it's like to work at ZipRecruiter and there are not enough ways to express how fantastic it is. Throughout your career, you begin to pick things you love at this company, see at another, don't ever want to experience again, etc. and you begin to form the vision of ""the perfect job"" or ""the perfect company"". I can honestly say that ZipRecruiter is all of that for me. I will try to sum it up by saying that the biggest pros of working at ZipRecruiter include: the opportunity to learn and grow as an individual, provide meaningful contributions, feel rewarded and truly enjoy the company and people you work with on a daily basis.","We've grown so fast that it is hard to keep up with names and faces. Nothing major. To me, there really aren't any cons but that's because it's a cultural fit for me. That is key to enjoying any job - is there a culture fit? If you prefer a quiet atmosphere with minimal social engagement, this probably wouldn't be a fit for you."
365,ZipRecruiter,The way an internet company should be,2014-09-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The best company I have ever worked for. Incredible talent. A product that works. An open and collaborative culture. A genuine concern and respect for both customers and partners.,Can be loud at times - the office is open. Umm...sometimes they run out of free snacks and it can be a full day before they are replaced.
366,ZipRecruiter,The Best Company You Have Ever Worked At,2014-09-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This is the best company you will ever work at. Perfect balance of culture, benefits, job satisfaction, work-life balance, leadership, opportunity, teamwork, etc. The co-founders, early employees, and senior management team set the tone for the culture, not some obtuse set of corporate ""values"" that get written on a wall and forgotten about.

Working smarter is valued above working harder. Leadership is engaged at all levels. The strategy is clear and execution is solid. This company is a rocket ship in every way possible.","If you are not an A-player, you are going to find this a difficult place to work. Well, you won't last long anyway..."
367,ZipRecruiter,"Zip, zip, hooray!",2014-06-24,5.0,Account Executive,"Generous raises, clear-cut career paths, laid back environment, down-to-earth managers who feel like peers, mutual respect among colleagues. I'm amazed every day that everyone who works here is a genuinely nice, intelligent person who is great at their job. We're all friends, work hard, and play harder!","There's always pressure to hit your numbers in the sales industry, but I wouldn't call that a con--just an expectation to do your job :)"
368,ZipRecruiter,The Job/Opportunity you always wished you had.,2014-05-31,5.0,,"I always feel challenged! I'm never bored. The competition with my peers is at a high level yet we work together collectively and have eachothers back to ensure the success of our company.  Yes I just said ""our"" instead of ""the"" company and I'm not even a founder. The culture that the founders have created here is so amazing that I feel like I'm part of something special and I can voice my opinions and ideas (good or bad) and they will be heard and respected.",Not knowing what tomorrow brings. But that's what actually makes it exciting and different :)
369,ZipRecruiter,Collaborative atmosphere,2014-05-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Collaboration encouraged, no bad apples in management, laid-back attitude that understands that getting the job done well is more important than punching a clock, great in-office perks.",No real cons - it's a great place to work.
