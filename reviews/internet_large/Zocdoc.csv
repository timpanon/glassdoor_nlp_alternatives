8,Zocdoc,"Excellent culture, fun engineering!",2022-03-10,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Zocdoc is a great tech company to work at - generous salary/benefits, fun people and culture, exciting growth, and an interesting and complex product. We're growing really rapidly, so there's lots of opportunities for leadership and expansion of your domain knowledge. It's at a sweet spot of size - flat enough where you know most people and can get a sense of it - the CTO and CEO often join the tech staff at our lunch tables (lunch is free, btw). But it's large enough where we have a clear chances for opportunity and ability to learn from a wide variety of talented people.","There are growing pains with rapid growth - still evolving team structure, some dev processes are harder than others, new product ideas that don't go anywhere. Those are fairly normal for a tech company, but worth remembering."
9,Zocdoc,So Far So Good,2022-03-04,3.0,Service Operations Associate,"I love working at Zocdoc so far, everyone has been super friendly as well as helpful when it comes to the job. Free Vision and Dental. I like how inclusive everyone on the Service team is as well as the pay for the job. They are very flexible when it comes to taking time off and even offer ""Flex"" time where you can make up any time you need off on the fly or in advance. My manager is very understanding and caring which makes it easy to receive feedback on how I can improve. I also really enjoy the Work From Home aspect. Always room to grow and they like to promote internally as well.","There are no extra benefits for WFH employees, they recently closed the office space that they were using for this team and have not given us any benefits from this so no expenses for internet or snacks like what is offered for their NY office. There are a lot of changes and expectations for the Service team to handle. Sometimes managers are against when clients are asking to speak with them on the phone so Service has to deal with angry providers even though they don't have the same knowledge as the managers do. Other times we're expected to handle issues above our pay grade such as IT issues that we are not trained in and even have an entire different department that is suppose to handle these types of calls. A large workload that wasn't expected when applying. You will be assigned certain workflows and have them be changed last minute. Day to day can get kind of monotonous taking calls all day, mostly like a call center just not as high of a volume and you are scored on your calls on a monthly basis which can be a bit unfair when you're taking hundreds of calls a month and they choose to base your productivity on a handful as well as weekly average scoring you must try to meet based on how long you were on the call, your hold time, and after call notes average time which is a little much considering we are doing a lot."

- The environment is not a toxic workplace. You are able to laugh, have fun with employees, we have different activities we do as a team together since we all work in different states we don't get that office time with each other so we have family movie nights, during the holiday season they're gingerbread contests, etc and we do all of this while being on video chat so we can socialize.
- The managers want you to succeed and help in any way they can! They go above and beyond to get you the resources and extra help/assistance you need.
- Flexible schedule.
- You can ""flex"" time during the day so you don't have to use a PTO day instead, then you just make up your flexed time whichever other day during the week instead.","- No cash bonuses
- Roughly 4 weeks of training (it's not bad though, just can get overwhelming)
- You have to take a final at the end of your training to make sure you know your information since we work with patient information and providers (doctors) etc.

- We have a lot of people on our team so you have to make sure you put in your request for like PTO days off ahead of time (as far out as possible) because days can fill up fast.

27,Zocdoc,"So far, so really good",2021-12-02,5.0,Integration Support Associate,"** MY POSITION IS REMOTE

- The autonomy given for you to grown and learn is the biggest selling point for me. You're given the tools and unlimited support to learn and grow as much as you want.
- The benefits are really good. Healthcare is actually affordable (go figure), yearly bonuses are a plus, and even though it's a remote working community you still feel like a team.
- They encourage you take use your PTO and live a balanced life which can be uncommon in any information tech/software development environment.
- Overall no complaints so far but Zocdoc is a growing company still and there are bound to be growing pains to come with it.","- Since it is a remote position miscommunication can sometimes happen.
- Starting pay could be a bit more for the work that's being done compared to other competitive salaries.

39,Zocdoc,One of the best companies I've worked for,2021-09-17,5.0,Marketing,"Like many companies, Zocdoc has a lot of smart people. Unlike other companies, almost all of these people are pleasant to work with and will go out of their way to help you. There are few egos here.

The access to senior management is second to none. I've worked at smaller companies where the leaders are anonymous. At Zocdoc, Oliver, the CEO, and other execs are very involved in the day-to-day running of the company and you'll see them in meetings you're in. They are also very accessible, you can have a quick chat when you bump into them in the office and/or email them with questions.

Zocdoc's business is thriving. We've successfully gone through a pivotal business transformation which enabled us to become EBITDA positive. We navigated the pandemic, doubling down on telehealth and increasing telehealth as a share of bookings to 40% in June 2020 from 0.1% in February 2020. This strong base puts us in a good position to grow even further.

Finally, working at Zocdoc allows you to play a role in fixing healthcare in the US. We're making it easier for patients to book with providers, increasing access to healthcare and reducing wait times.",We need to staff up to continue to grow at this pace. There's so much to be done but not enough people to do it yet.

Your coworkers will be smart, funny, and generous. Free lunch and 100% paid insurance premiums for individuals. Awesome place to cut your teeth in health tech. Zocdoc looks great on your resume if you are looking to stay in NYC health tech. When I was there I regularly had recruiters approach me because of this.","When working at any tech company, you need to have something that keeps you going every day. Building a successful company is hard, thankless work. 

Unless you were at Zocdoc very early on, the incentives to give it your all and help build the company aren’t there:
- Pay is below market for most roles (shoutout to all of the recruiters I mentioned earlier in my review for shedding light on this)
- No equity for new employees, so you have no skin in the game
- Maybe you’re not financially motivated and just love the mission. Zocdoc’s business model contradicts its stated mission. It incentivizes bad behavior and paying more money to be exposed to more patients. If it says anything, as a former employee I would not use Zocdoc to find a provider. 

Most senior leaders have been at Zocdoc forever and seem to be compensated way better than everyone else (there were just... clear material indications). It definitely created a divide between them and newer, more junior members of the team. Some leaders seem pretty out of touch and rarely seen. 

I would say as far as startups go there is very little room for growth at this point. The possibility of starting in CS (or wherever) and making a lateral move to another team is rare. I remember being surprised by this because some of the leaders who have been with the company for years started in junior positions. That ladder was kicked down years ago. 

If you got in early then that’s great and I hope you enjoy. If you’re just joining now, that’s fine too, but why? What is driving you? You aren’t helping patients or providers. You won’t get a big payout when Zocdoc is sold or goes public. You might get career opportunities sooner than others if you’re really special but otherwise it’ll probably take years. 

As an individual contributor at Zocdoc you are simply paving the way for senior leadership’s exit plan at the end of the day."

Most managers are just killing time here and will not step up to achieve anything for their team or themselves. BIPOC get passed over for promotions, even those who bother to stick around for years. 

Watching the C suite jet set during the pandemic has been disgusting. They flew across the country to meetings long before there was a vaccine. 

They knowingly partner with transphobic and racist doctors with 0 accountability: racists' money is green, so why not. Leadership's open disdain for patients is palpable: they abandoned medicaid patients without a second thought and then spent time lobbying for healthcare deregulation. 

Nobody trusts the leadership to improve the business. They're just going to cut costs for a little while and see if they can line their pockets a bit more. Least innovative company around, their only advantage is nobody wants to be in this business so competitors die out quickly.

If you've been in corporate healthcare, you know how right-leaning leadership is. This is no different. 

PS Doctors hate zocdoc. Internal content brazenly mocks both doctors and the employees, or anybody who dares to advocate for themselves."

However, once in the door, I saw there was very little area for promotion. The office in Scottsdale, AZ, is super small with the whole Scottsdale employees fitting into one single room basically. 

I also had a hard time with Zocdoc's philosophy. They went from a flat billing rate for providers, to doctors being paid per patient visit, which is a nightmare to manage. In addition, Zocdoc gets their hands too involved in patient care. Zocdoc is not insurance, seems like focus should be more on booking appointments and not dealing with patient billing disputes. Again, Zocdoc is not an insurance company. Patient billing disputes should be between the provider and patient's insurance.

Since the pricing model changed last year, our best doctors are angry and many have left due to ZocDoc's shady practices with the new model. They allow doctors to be charged for no shows and cancellations and I was being constantly yelled at by their offices for allowing this (many cases it would be hundreds of dollars a month). Management only cares about money and did not want to accept disputes. There's no room for growth. It became a very toxic environment and I no longer saw potential for this company nor my career to grow here. They come up with NO new features or improve physician or patient experience."

125,Zocdoc,Not for me,2020-04-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Free lunch, and free Friday breakfast","This company is filled with young people that don't seem to care about the company. I don't think I really saw anyone in upper management do much during my time there, and unfortunately when I needed them during challenging calls they weren't there to help either.  I had many patients call up regarding billing disputes during my time there, and was instructed not to get involved, and for me personally that was troubling. Its hard knowing that someone is calling you for help and you can't be there to assist them.  You are getting screamed at, and they are upset and your supervisor tells you to have them work it out with the doctor. I didn't feel comfortable with that. People would call every day for weeks with this massive bill from a Doctors office and we weren't allowed to help. I also did not feel as if this was a comfortable work environment. On many occasions we would be working with the lights off as supervisors and favored employees through balls and frisbees through the air making it hard to concentrate during calls if not throwing them at you attempting to distract you. There also isn't much room for growth. Either you take more escalated calls, or you are stuck in the same position. For me I didn't care for that because I always wanted to be in management, and the people in it don't leave. Small parking lot maybe 10 spots for everyone, and work hours weren't the ones promised. I think it  is a more fun call center if your a young kid, but it wasn't for me."

Poorly trained/completely untrained middle management, many of whom ""failed up,"" as mentioned before.

Zocdoc brought in several former Bankrate employees last Fall, and they have slowly been killing Zocdoc's culture. They came in to make things ""better"" to likely sell the company soon, with no regard to employees. There are ZERO learning and development opportunities and since they don't have an events department, the events get thrown onto people who don't know how to plan or don't want to plan. The people who really stepped in to help are all gone, with no replacement in sight. I recently left because I could feel the culture dying. The incredible people that used to overflow this place are mostly gone, due to a combo of one of many layoffs or them just being over being overlooked for promotions.

There are many opportunities to learn and grow. Leadership is heavily invested in the growth of employees and that makes all the difference. 
You even get opportunities to work on different projects and teams. Everyone's strengths and skill sets are paid extra attention in order for them to grow. There are also opportunities to develop new skill sets. 
If you work hard, success is guaranteed. 

ZocDoc is also known for it's culture. It's friendly and at the same time empowering. Consistently there are team bonding activities and celebrations to enhance the culture. 

Additionally, the cafeteria is amazing too. There are options for 'ready to make' breakfast; free lunch (veg non-veg main course as well as salads for health conscious). However, Hot Chocolate on the snack bar steals the show :)",Since Zocdoc is at a growing stage there are consistent changes.

Good engineers are leaving. Promotion is somewhat questionable. Leadership is losing its credit.  Compensation table is low in the market

Recently there has been much less of a team culture which makes a cold call sales job that much more unpleasant. Commission is based off your evaluation each month from your manager which simply does not even matter what metrics you get, you can close the most deals in a month and still receive less commission than someone who didn't perform as well metrics wise.  One manager will tell you to do or say one thing and the next manager will tell you the complete opposite.

I have learned that this is a phrase everyone tends to use to feel that our jobs have purpose and are important. There are some people here that really care about their work and its impact. I get to work without being micromanaged and the environment is ""loose"" for the most part. Benefits are great and lunches are just ok.","There are a lot of problems that were not immediately obvious when I started working at Zocdoc. The CEO is pushed out front for company events but it feels forced. I think the executive team is obviously dysfunctional and I see the communications team working to mop up the mess trying to stay ahead of employee criticism, providing managers with talking points. Marketing runs sales.  Finance runs People. Execs are randomly mismatched to their roles. The product isn't improving at the pace it should with no apparent accountability.  I was initially attracted to the company because it's part of the so-called ""unicorn"" club, but the company's valuation was grossly overstated. I am worried that engineers will also lose their jobs like others that have moved to India as the company burns through cash without raising more."

Oliver, the CEO is very involved with day to day operations and seems to care a lot about the company and its mission.","There is a total divide in the company where engineering and product are valued way more than the CS and Sales teams. If you start out in Sales or CS you are basically pigeoned holed into that department with little hope of moving laterally. I often felt under valued and under appreciated by the company; it was almost like they try to keep you at the company with great perks and benefits but care little about your actual career growth and happiness. Work environment became toxic towards the end, and as a result the company lost a lot of its better employees."

It's a surprisingly huge company, bulked up by a big team of sales and tech support, for such a straightforward app. Diversity is ok. Most people are nice, except the middle managers. And it comes with your fairly standard startup food and health insurance.","The product improves at a snail pace that is more like an old hospital instead of a startup, and it has barely changed for the past 5 years except a new branding. For a company that should be focused on hospitality and improving access to health care for everyone, it is unfortunately driven by spammy SEO and predatory sales tactics based on subscription fees from doctors. Until that golden goose runs out, most product and engineering will continue to tip-toe around doing barely anything meaningful or innovative, for none of that will increase sales, and product managers are scared to break anything."
194,Zocdoc,To scale or not to scale,2018-07-06,3.0,Marketing,"Great mission that anyone can get behind. Healthcare is a mess in America and Zocdoc is providing a valuable tool for patients.

I’ve worked on several teams and have found some of the smartest people I’ve ever met. I’ve made great friends over time which doesn’t always happen in the workplace.  The culture has shifted with time, but overall most people still care about each other and the work they’re doing (this varies by department).

Great work/life balance. I was trusted to do my job and carry on with what I needed to do outside of work. No one was policing or micromanaging me (again, can’t say the same for every department). 

Benefits are nice- free lunch, snacks, free healthcare, unlimited vacation

CEO seems to have genuine care and passion for the organization and what he’s trying to achieve.","Cross departmental alignment on initiatives from the top down is often weak or missing entirely, which results in poor leadership, unfinished projects, and unachieved goals if there was even a clear goal to begin with.   Project management is not a valued skill or role here and it shows. It’s obvious that the executive team has had trouble working together, although they’ve made very recent steps to publicly change the optics on this out of necessity. Time will tell whether or not anything has actually changed. There’s a noticeable distance between some executives and the people actually doing work on their teams. 

Middle management is fraught with issues. There’s a wide variety of competence by department and Managers aren’t always held accountable for mistakes they make or problems they've caused so they just linger around lowering morale on their teams. I’ve seen many talented people leave for this reason alone. 

Low pay compared to similar jobs at other companies, especially other tech companies. 

For a tech company, the lack of accurate and easily accessible data is shocking!  It can be a blocker for people in marketing and product orgs to effectively do their jobs and to work against logical metrics with true business impact. For whatever reason a systematic, wide scale fix for this issue has not been discussed publicly or prioritized for the last 5 years. Most internal tooling is a joke at this point. 

Little to no career pathing or development on some teams. If you’re joining as a senior manager, executive, or developer you’ll be fine. For any other position, strongly consider other options if you have other similar offers."

The work is already demanding, but on top of that, internal tooling and reporting have barely been updated by Product, Engineering, or whatever department that is supposed to scale internal infrastructure so employees can be productive and not burnt out!

203,Zocdoc,"Great Mission & Potential, but Many Issues & Risks.",2018-03-28,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Strong mission (""give power to the patient"") that guides most decisions at the company. The healthcare industry is bloated and complicated, so it's a nice to work somewhere that actually puts patients first for a change and is bringing a more modern twist to healthcare. It's relatively easy to drink the Kool-Aid and believe the work you do will drive positive outcomes for regular people/patients.

Good benefits: free daily lunches and snacks, free healthcare, unlimited vacation policy (actually used not just for show) among other things. Reasonable work/life balance (not crazy start up hours). 

A lot of diversity on the executive team - both from a professional experience and personal background standpoint. Unusual to see at tech companies.

Focus on culture and a deliberateness to how it evolves and changes over time. There is care taken in soliciting employee feedback in systematic ways, implementing changes, and investing money/resources in programs to make it a rewarding and fun place to work (not everything hits the mark, but the will and effort is there). 

(Mostly) good people: there are some really smart and down-to-earth people at the company. Everyone is incredibly open to making time out to chat (especially noticeable during on-boarding time period) and help make connections across the company. 

Well funded. Zocdoc has managed to raise a lot of money over the years and seems to be in a good position to leverage that for growth.","Unfortunately, almost every Pro has a Con directly associated with it.

While the mission is strong, a lot of work has shifted away from directly impacting patients (with more emphasis on providers and health systems) which makes it harder to connect to.  It seems the pendulum swings between which sides of the business to focus on every year and the sense is its reactionary not proactive. 

The business model has some challenges in it that need to be addressed ASAP. While the company has raised a good amount of money, there is a lot of work ahead (and many unknowns), even 10 years into being a company, to justify the high valuation. It has the people and resources to affect change, but there are definitely some long-term risks for the company (especially being in healthcare). 

The executive team is the biggest I have ever seen and in some ways is too bloated for its own good. Communication is not effective (executives often do not seem to be on the same page about future plans or reasons for why things happened the way they did). Often times this lack of communication (and worse, trust) between executives, trickles down and leads to confusion on team priorities, micromanagement / prescriptiveness, and what feels like constantly changing direction all of which gets frustrating, hurts morale, and hinders productivity. 

While there is a lot of emphasis and effort around culture, Zocdoc can be a very strange place to work. Your experience is highly skewed by which department you are in (to some extent that will always be the case but is just extreme here). There are some great individuals here, but the level of maturity, professionalism, and competence varies dramatically by team.  This leads to distrust between teams (and even within departments themselves), and things can get political quickly. Teams end up  operating very independently on their own personal goals with no real alignment on broader objectives. 

The company has historically not been very transparent about its performance or financials with employees. Perhaps there are good reasons for this, but its highly unusual for a tech company to operate this way and over time this has eroded trust in management which is taking time to win back with new initiatives."

Leadership has been there for many years and promotes longtime individual contributors with no management experience. End result is micromanaging executives, directors, and managers who refuse to delegate work, disallow their direct reports to operate top of license, and take credit for hard work done elsewhere. Nothing happens unless multiple VPs are thrown at a problem. Favoritism is painfully clear towards people who have been at the company for many years, which limits opportunities and taints morale for newcomers. Middle management has been promoted to their positions without interviewing, hence were thrown into their roles with little qualification to lead teams. Expect high workload, low pay, little recognition, and spending most of your time answering to people versus having freedom to learn and grow autonomously. Be wary of whether that sacrifice is worth it to experience the mission and direction of the company."

The re-brand was great and they're finally starting to make great product improvements.,"The sales department, however, is drowning.  About a year ago the company down-sized its sales department intentionally, however it's no longer intentional at this point.  Sales reps are leaving faster than they can hire/promote SOAs (entry level sales position).  The reason for this is that there is 0 career development after one has become a Sales Executive.  Managers show no trust in their sales employees, they are micro-managed, and there simply aren't enough sustainable territories to put reps in where they can succeed, at least in a scalable way.  

Neither the outbound local sales team, the mid-market team, or the Health systems team have figured out a sales process to teach new reps, so they won't promote anyone from within. 

But the one thing that use to make working there enjoyable- the culture -  has gotten worse as well.  It's very immature and unprofessional (even for a start-up).  They've lost a lot of the talent they had. 

Senior management has been in their positions for far too long and they're no longer the right people to motivate and drive the sales org."

  managers actively cultivate a culture of transparency and candor. i attended biweekly one-on-one's with my manager where we talked openly about my career growth and the health of the team. tech leadership listens to engineers and takes concrete steps to address feedback. it's fantastic when your manager often asks, 'what can i do better?'

culture:
  working at Zocdoc is fun. engineering org is inclusive and highly collaborative. sharing knowledge is celebrated. off-site hackathons are unique and refreshing. i consider the people that i worked with to be part of my extended family.

- The job itself is absolutely miserable. You make 50+ cold calls a day to angry receptionists who have been manipulated by the company for 5+ years. Pay is terrible. No autonomy- prepared to be micromanaged.
- Once getting to full-cycle sales, thing do not get much better. Turnover is incredibly high- a true revolving door. Goals are absurd. I have never seen anyone last more than 2 years in this position.

Healthcare - OK. They claim it’s free but there are many co-pays and many limits to the services provided 
Equity & compensation - you will be lowballed. And valuation is really exaggerated. Unlimited vacation turns out to be 3 ~ weeks a year usually","You should think very seriously about accepted an offer to work here. Just a few issues include: very low moral across most of the company (unless you’re in tech where they are insulated), no room for growth and no career pathing, borderline unethical HR practices, and poor management/leadership. Do not allow the sunny disposition of your interviewers fool you. 

I ignored the concerns raised by other employees on Glassdoor and most, if not all, turned out to be true. My recruiter said many of those reviews were from employees on their own sales team, however, if you look at recent reviews (outside of tech) you will see that many of the issues remain. You have to ask yourself why they haven’t been acquired or gone public in 10 years? I would encourage anyone considering employment at Zocdoc to read all reviews and try to speak to someone on the inside before joining. I would also encourage anyone interested in working there to look at the numerous lawsuits filed by former employees against the company. You should also consider googling to see all law suits from previous employees. 

I thought I’d give myself a year in this company but I’m getting out of this slowly sinking ship as soon as I can.

Management is even worse. They lack talent and truly have no clue how to manage their teams. They are all quick to throw their employees under the bus to scape goat their inability to be effective. 

Zero growth opportunity. All account managers are being driven back to sales, but with more responsibilities and impossible targets to hit. Anyone hired for sales will be stuck at entry level. 

Company is downsizing its sales and management teams because they are struggling to make profit. Since I was there, 4 managers, our director of sales and COO all proactively quit because there was no future for them or opportunity to grow. Not one person was promoted to fill these loses, we were just put in bigger teams (as if the managers already couldn't manage a team lol). 

The company is very dishonest and instead of teaching you to be upfront encourages you to lie to your clients. Both in sales and account management. 

The culture is even worse. The company pretends to be building a better environment, but have an open door policy on swearing and fraternization. Most of upper management is in a relationship with one another! The managers are very back stabbing and everyone hates their job (with good reason) so there is constant complaining every day. Very depressing 

Targets are impossible to hit and they recently reorganized their commission structure to lower peoples ability to make money. 

The only people who do well are those with good territory. You might get stuck with a territory they don't even market or sell into anymore. If this happens to you your pretty much screwed. I was fortunate not to have one of these territory's

Bootcamp - incredibly demanding environment, but no better place to learn about ""office life"" right out of college (including what NOT to do)
Experience - We were held to a very high standard, especially in our industry (Recruiting/ HR) that asked us to work harder and smarter. Most of my best work habits that have really benefited me the last few years were developed at ZD.","C Suite Anxiety - the CEO we worked under has since left the company, but in my time there he created an incredibly aggressive dynamic between all leaders in the company in an effort to get them to work harder and faster. This dynamic carried straight through to nearly every team, from top to bottom, cultivating an environment of fear and anxiety that was only alleviated during the boozy weekly happy hours. Most of that C Suite still remains in place, but I hope with the old CEOs departure some of that strain has been lifted. 

Junior Leaders in Charge - In my time there I saw many people hired into or promoted into management roles who just simply were not ready. This resulted in a trickle down lack of Leadership training, resulting in slipping performance, communication breakdowns, and eventually the ultimate turnover of entire teams. This is to be expected at a start up, but to see the Leaders at the top refusing to acknowledge that they were not giving employees the right resources, and instead eagerly placing blame in the hands of others, was entirely disenchanting. 

Turnover - The Sales team had exceptionally high turnover. Recruiters were constantly filling and refilling the exact same roles week in and week out. I watched many slide from confidence to desperation as they raced to fill roles for every week's sales class. You've read that the recruiters are dishonest or paint the wrong picture of life at ZD - know that, while I can't pardon that behavior, their own jobs were on the line week in and week out. Getting your butt in the seat was often the only thing between them and the unemployment line. 

Company Culture - ZD has a noble mission and great values to support it, but watching many of these values get danced around by the leadership team as they accomplished what they were directed to was disheartening. In my 4 years there I watched many things happen that directly contradicted the ZD values that the C Suite was complicit in. I recognize it is idealistic to expect a company to uphold a moral code at 100%, but I often saw leaders who actively wouldn't adhere to basic values (treating people with respect). The company had HR problems from early on, with enthusiastic but inexperienced leadership at it's early stages, transitioning into a very different model of emotionally-removed operational efficiency. Under that leadership, I saw many processes improve, but at the cost of the heart and soul of the company. We scaled rapidly and employees became numbers without faces, being supported by a People Ops team that was largely unprepared to step foot outside of their offices and truly engage with employees to facilitate comfortable, satisfying work experiences."

People aren't properly recognized or inconsistently recognized for their efforts. Many managers have no business being in management - automatons with subpar people skills and no insights and useful advice beyond what's scripted. An attempt to be transparent about stock options was comically insulting in its delay (by nearly a quarter), its lack of any new information, and lack of follow-through. Lack of follow-through is a common theme - initiatives land with a big splash and quickly wither away - this applies to the product as well as internal efforts. It happens so consistently that I no longer trust or am excited about new initiatives. I witness sexism and homophobia frequently, and I don't feel like it's safe to speak up about it."

Inexperienced management
Incompetent HR and payroll departments
Widespread sexism

Overall, Zocdoc considers itself to be a company that is ""caring, smart, and simple."" Throughout my experience at Zocdoc, I have not experienced any of these traits. This company does not care about its employees. Never in my career have I felt more disposable and more like a cog in a wheel than I have here. And even though they tell you to ""speak up"" if something is bothering you, be VERY careful who you're speaking to. There are plenty of people waiting to shove you under a bus to save themselves.

Zocdoc is not a ""smart"" company either. Brilliant employees, many of whom went to Ivy League schools, are doing work that would be boring for some of the less intelligent species of apes. Employees are constantly overlooked and are eventually forced out by the complete lack of career opportunities internally.

And nothing at Zocdoc is ever ""simple."" The company is trying to be more ""transparent,"" but employees are lied to by management time and time again. Everyone is trying to further their own agendas, so at this point, progress for the company is impossible.

If you are a long professional looking to learn skills and make connections that will help you build your career, this is NOT the place for you.

I was left alone as long as I did my work. I laughed day in and day out and really felt like part of a team near the end.","Oh boy - how much space do I have? Well- they aren't hiring so don't worry about refusing a job offer - glad thats out of the way. If you take this job for what it is, a temporary stepping stone....or a resting spot for trust fund babies who can't fathom operating in a real work environment, then yeah it's really fun. Drinking is certainly encouraged. Some manangers are great, ok maybe 1. The rest of them are absolutely lost. They repeat phrases that seem almost as if it were memorized lines. Why do you keep telling me I'm doing a great job...a greaaaatttt job. K- I get it ...you're starting to freak me out a little. Managers are the core issue, the entire company has changed its tune and course corrected (too little too late though guys) except....no one is looking at the managers - wait why? Prob just too lazy. Figures.

Yeah- there are mice...but that's not ZD's fault- that was our fault. The environment is so lax we all forgot that there are consequences when fiber one brownie bars are left half eaten on your keyboard DUH! it's also quite a scene to see a Friday night aftermath ....you know...the keg party leftovers from all of the people who decided not to go to zoctalk.... but to drink, no chug down multiple beers and bottles of wine while pitching doctors instead. Hey- not complaining about that. But come on- you are surprised about the mice- you just leave that stuff there all weekend. 

People ops....woah. I don't...know what to say. Just pure akward interactions. Shady. Strange. Fake. It's almost as if you are on a bazzaro plane and people ops are the overly aggressive flight attendants, smiley and nice but in a fake way. Oh.... We'll just claw back that pillow and blanket if you don't mind- sorry we ran out of terra chips but here's a package of nuts - enjoy your trip in coach!

Can't explain our own search. Some kind of poetic wording...no one is really sure. I think we all just vomit through our headset when asked why other doctors come up before them in a zip code that is completely different....""well, organic, different for every person....ummmm some guy gave a speech about this I just can't remember what he said- let me have my AM CALL YOU!""

Oh yeah. Almost forgot. Love what you did with the sales team. Love that you put some people in AM roles out of nowhere. All of the sudden a deal that was worth 1k is now $80. Someone is adding things up wrong. Someone got stuck between the old world and new world.

Truthfully - it's a cult culture. It will consume you. Fun while it lasted, but ....it's over now. You can't go back and fix your reputation ZD - you aren't 5. You told us to do these things- then changed your mind. Act your age ZD- you big bully."

310,Zocdoc,Confused Chop Shop,2016-03-23,2.0,Anonymous Employee,When I first got there it was a fantastic work environment. Amazing benefits and people were quick to develop relationships. That's about it.,"Looking back on my few years it was a confused, toxic, unorganized environment. This was due to  a total lack of accountability and a disorganized top down mentality. Simply put the most senior members of the organization were put in place because they had a similar background as the C-suite. However, they had no proven ability to lead an drive their new found careers. Decision making was a nightmare and no one was on the same page. Frankly it was obvious that senior management (especially in sales/bd/hr management was afraid to make a call). Nothing was ever good enough. Now that can be good in some environments but when there are no models, there is no standard, no clear operating procedure and a total lack of communication from senior managers, how can you be successful and learn from past mistakes? How will anything ever work? Sure the environment is dynamic. They are so ""dynamic"" that processes are re-engineered before ""old ones"" are able to be measured for success. In my time at ZD the company went from 100-700 people but we probably on-boarded over 1400. 

My advice: 1) Bring in a team of proven managers and KEEP THEM, don't chase them out the door. 2) Focus on development by individual growth not by hiring 10 more people to a team monthly (that's not efficient growth). 3) Stick to a process: Considering when I handed in my notice no exit interview was conducted and HR was too afraid/lazy to come say goodbye. 4) Don't try to ""make it all better"" and squash employee concerns by hiring a catering service to scoop lunch onto my plate."

They know how to spin and lie about practically anything. Things like "" Were only going to sign up 5 doctors in this territory and then Close the market so we don't dilute any account"" and then they sign up 10 in that territory. 

The is a crazy amount of favoritism. They use new hires to warm up a territory, then once they cant meet their quota they completely abandon helping the rep and fire them while having the more experienced guys take over their territory. 

You CANNOT make a lot of money here, nor can you expect any sort of job stability. If you have 2 months in a 12 month period of not meeting your quota, it doesent matter what you've done,  you are fired. That means that the longer you work there, the larger you odds are of getting fired. 

The managers also give a half attempt at actually helping you. They will spend the most amount of time with their top performers, but people who actually need the most help are disregarded. This practice seems very systematic and it is clearly seen based on the turnover rate at the company.

Literally everyone from the recruiters who first get you hired, to the sales trainers, to your own managers lie to you. ""We only hire 1% of the people we interview"" - When I was hired there was 15 new hires, so you mean to tell me you interviewed 1,500 people in one month?!

""Once you are hired  we will do everything to set you up for success"" - They set quotas that are unreasonable and then when you are struggling, you get no help. 

There is a reason why they only hire young kids. You will rarely see anyone there over the age of 30."

Company seems to favor a specific age range when hiring most employees seem to be mid 20s to mid 30s. NO more unlimited vacation. Weird pay period, get paid on specific days of the month that don't always line up month to month leaving gaps in pay greater than two weeks apart.

We are a data driven company and engineer decisions are very well respected. We self organize in a pretty flat structure and we keep being very agile.

Pretty much all the department-wide processes can be opted in by any engineer wich makes very easily for each individual to select the path in which they want to develop and grow.

344,Zocdoc,FAKE REVIEWS,2015-10-08,2.0,Inside Sales Executive,Great food great people. The CEO Cyrus is some what interested in letting employees know what the company is up to.,"80% of the reviews here are totally fake I remember while I was there they had a really tough time with these kind of reviews and they were making a lot of efforts to try and correct a lot. I would not be surprised in the least if all of these reviews were all written by the recruiters.

Speaking of recruiters they are the biggest salesman of them all, they painted picture of Zocdoc like it's heaven on earth with free snacks and ping-pong tables. 

What they leave out is the huge disgusting infestation of rats crawling all over the office and their turnover rate is actually closer to about 60%. Say goodbye to all of the people that you started your hiring class with because in a few months about half of them won't be there anymore. Also, don't get too attached to anyone because chances are they are looking for another job or are going to get fired.

This is easily one of the hardest cells in the New York City start up space. The sale starts when you have to get past the receptionists. Then actually keeping the doctor on the phone for more than 60 seconds and then actually getting into without his credit card and sign up for this. 

My advice, don't work here. Find another job there's a lot of companies out there like this but at the recruiters are painting a really vivid portrait of what the places like to work for chances are it's too good to be true."

The engineering team is made up of really great people.  I continually am really impressed by my colleagues and enjoy coming to work everyday.  This is the most important thing to me given how much time you spend with your colleagues day in and day out.

The discussions we have around implementation details, brainstorms, planning, etc. are all very thought provoking and I find the conversations to be very engaging.  

We have a good balance of meetings and programming time that allows me to feel pretty productive.

Fantastic product and a real revenue stream.

Nice perks: Decent snack room, free lunch everyday, free healthcare, flexible hours

Awesome retreats.  No one does a hackathon like ZocDoc.  The hackathons are multi-day retreats where you get to work on anything you want with anyone you want (as long as it has some relevancy to zocdoc).  On top of being a time to work on fun projects, this is a really great time for team bonding and getting to know people you may not work with on a day-to-day basis.

Pretty good career growth opportunities, although I have some cons around this topic as well.

Overall, a really great place to work.  I am very satisfied here and have no intentions of leaving any time soon.","I have a bunch of things that I would list as cons, but I want to be clear that I am very happy here.  I am just a critical person and always think there is room for improvement!

The tech stack is pretty old and sad.  Breaking out of this is difficult, but it's often met with more red tape than necessary.  Introducing a new technology becomes such a big ordeal that it never happens!  Sometimes you just have to set something up (elasticsearch, redis, whatever!) and let the engineers figure it out.  It doesn't have to be perfect, we can afford to make mistakes and it will pay off in the long run.  Basically, I wish we would adopt more of a ""Move fast and break things"" approach, because currently it feels like we are moving incredibly slow.

Pay is good, but could be better.  Same with equity (although that's pretty much impossible to value).  

Career path isn't always super clear.  Teams promote at different rates and seem to have different thresholds.  Many managers are really lacking in experience, both from a technical and managerial perspective.

Development environment has a ton of room for improvement, but some decent projects are in flight here already."

-You work so much to meet your quota, that you don't get to use your ""unlimited"" vacation. 
-They hire young people for inside sales/telemarketing; they are not very professional. They have never sold to doctors and they are very unfamiliar with the medical industry. These kids would do or say anything to get the doctors on the phone. Including calling them on their emergency line. NOT PROFESSIONAL. It gives the company a bad reputation.

-Micromanage you through Sales Force
-Car Sales mentality
-People are let go if they don't sell anything on their first three months 
-Commission structure is a joke and confusing. You have to bring in 4 doctors every month; you start making money on the 5th doctor. Then you have to wait three months before you get paid a ""third of your commission"". It does accumulate but still, you don't get paid until three months and only a third of your commission. You'll get the other two thirds but it's broken down the following two months. If you quit, you'll only receive whatever is coming for that month. The remaining lag commission is lost."

Constantly changing start-up company experiencing rapid growth. Very competitive sales department (great if you're looking for that. Opportunities for upward mobility if you are willing to put in the time and hours (and if you get a decent territory),"Constant employee turnover, absolutely no job security if you work in sales. I was there for 7 months, and at least half of the sales staff that was there when I was hired was gone within the first 2 months. By the time I left 5 months later only 3-4 of the original employees remained. The company seems to think that rather than offer further training to their current employees and fostering and building talent, it is much more efficient to fire/hire constantly. Also, the commission structure is somewhat misleading, do not count on making the commission. Also the metrics for quotas can be very difficult to meet, and they are non-negotiable, have a bad 2 months and you're out."
389,Zocdoc,DONT DO IT!,2015-05-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,You will make great friends and eat low calorie snacks/drink free alcohol with them....,"Where to begin... TO BE CLEAR: No one wanted to work for ZocDoc more than me. I also didn't get fired if that's what you're thinking... The metrics for the sales people are often unattainable, you can work here for 2+ years but if you have 1 bad month you are put on a ""PDP"" which essentially is your 30 days notice. The sales floor changes every month when people are fired on the last Friday of the month at 4pm. Metrics run everything at ZocDoc from recruiting to sales to finance. The recruiters are taught to sugar coat/gloss over the pay structure. It is not a 60k base or guaranteed, its a 40k base and if you sell 6 doctors then you receive 20k which is commission (taxed). Make sure you ask about this over and over and over. The managers who interview have no clue what they're looking for. They reject candidates because they're ""not a culture fit"" which is code for 'they don't want to drink/eat/share their space with you'. ALSO the recruiters will tell you the average salesperson is closing 13 doctors a month.... that is only applicable for an established territory which you will not receive for about a year... if you make it that long. This is about the last place anyone with any sales/recruiting skill should ever work... There, You've been warned!!!! (and yes, there is sexual harassment and rap poop everywhere)"
390,Zocdoc,"Do NOT work here unless you are an ex-frat guy, not GIRL",2015-05-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"fresh energy, amazing benefits, growth in a short time., great work environment and an amazing product to sell.","This job is a huge disappointment, you interview with a bunch of other young people who tell you about this amazing training program that seems as if it is a benefit to working there, that is what I thought anyway. The training program was like daily hazing back in a frat house and if they don't like you bc you aren't one of them, you won't advance past training. They will wait to either fire you or taunt you so you quit. This isn't just my perspective, it's an obvious tactic that everyone is well aware of. Another example-if a guy books one meeting, he will be recognized, I set multiple on my first day and wasn't even acknowledged. As I transitioned out of training and got to know more sales staff, I learned this is how almost all of the women feel there. Unless you are an ex frat guy who is going to play up to their egos, you won't move forward. In fact, if you are anything different, you will get fired.It's tricky bc when you first interview and start you think this is a culture that embraces your differences, it's all a sales pitch. I see people get fired almost daily, some times they are for legit reasons. You are only a temporary, glorified telemarketer until they find a reason . This company has an amazing vision and future. ZD says  their people is what defines them but their people are why this company has been such a disappointment. Their managements methods are terrible. Even if you are THE BEST sales person and put in 13 hour days, you will not move forward unless you become one of them. My advice to anyone who wants to do well here is be the best GUY you can be, put in lots of hours, don't waste time, suck up to everyone around you and be as arrogant and cut throat as possible and your bosses will see you as an asset and you will succeed. People DO move up, there is a huge growth opportunity and you can make a lot of money but you will only do so if you play by the rules I have listed. This information is not meant to bash ZocDoc, rather give you a realistic view of what it is like to work here and proper advice so you can succeed from the start. BE FRATTY."

Everyone is great about helping each other out and there's no such thing as a dumb question. It's an extremely friendly workplace and I've made tons of close friends.,There is no financial transparency and a slight lack of direction for the company's very long term goals
401,Zocdoc,Great but limited opportunity,2015-03-31,2.0,Inside Sales Executive,"Free lunch everyday, amazing health care, on going training provided, reimburse just about anything that can be considered a company expense.","ZocDoc has a great service but they're trying to grow faster than the medical community will let them. 

They want to be available in 48 states but all that does for the sales people, is provide them with horrible territories to call on. My territory was all of california minus the whole LA and SF area. Most cities I had to call consisted of 2,000-20,000 people. We were told that patients were using ZocDoc in these areas but no doctor that signed up in any of those cities would see more than 1 patient every couple months. However, you will still be held to the same standards as those who have a territory in the heart of a major metropolitan. All this means, is that you will be working much much harder than someone in the same position as you and most likely getting paid less in commission and have more stress to just keep your job.

Most of these great reviews come from the ops side, where the culture is entirely different. I can definitely see ZocDoc as a career for someone who is pursuing an ops position. As for sales, its a great place to learn as much as you can, get some doctor appointments in with your amazing health care, but keep other options open."
402,Zocdoc,Sales team is an entirely different beast from the company itself,2015-03-27,2.0,Inside Sales Executive,"At first glance, there are many great things about this company: Amazing benefits (100% coverage for health insurance for employees + dependents is awesome); office hours offered with leadership within the company; reimbursement for recommended business books; passionate user base; good employees; great diversity. 

Outside of the local sales team, employees generally seem pretty happy with their roles and their day-to-day contributions even with long hours involved.","If you're considering a position on the sales team, know upfront that your work-life balance will be terrible. You will be expected and pressured to hit very high metrics on all fronts, which most companies would reward with much better pay and advancement opportunities. If you have a background in solution-selling, check it at the door. 

While everyone in the company works pretty hard, know that on sales, you'll be spending a ton of hours actively trying to swim upstream. You'll hear a lot about the potential and the changes they're trying to effect, but it's not particularly comforting when you're ending a 12-hour workday at 8 p.m. and have been repeatedly told that your worth depends entirely on your performance over the last 30 days. ""Nothing you've done outside of that time counts - even if you were top rep last month, you can be on a performance improvement plan in a week or two"" and ""everyone here is expendable"" are phrases that have repeatedly been tossed around. 

The commission structure is also very poorly described - almost misleadingly so. Success is almost entirely dependent on your territory, and many of the reps who are hitting OTE earning potential are doing something somewhat against the rules. Lots of favoritism, lots of pre-determined success or failures for many new hires before they even have a chance to prove themselves. 

The employees the company has promoted from within over the past year or so are overwhelmingly living off of their $35k base. You don't earn any commission for the first few closes each month, and whatever you do earn is paid out over 3 months, even though clients pay upfront, and you will also lose close to 50% of your commission if a client churns within half a year of beginning their contract - even though you, as the sales rep, have almost no control over the client's experience once they sign up - that's entirely in the hands of the account management team, who are comped on different goals from your own. 

Several leaders in other departments have also confessed that the opportunity for sales reps to be promoted into other departments is extremely slim compared to other employees of similar or even lesser rank who come from other teams. 

While the company overall has great diversity in both gender and race, the sales team is overwhelmingly homogenous. Infer of that what you will about the culture within that department. 

Morale has been steadily decreasing for some time, with a lot of top talent opting to leave for better opportunities and many, many reps being fired on the down-low. Turnover has been ridiculous, especially within the last 6-8 months. When upper management has been asked about this, the response is almost always ""It used to be so much worse.""

One of the best tips I've ever been offered about sales is ""Ask how many of the employees are actually hitting performance quotas."" This company has done a great job of skirting the real answer, because anyone who doesn't hit quota that month is put on a performance plan, and has to hit 15-25% higher than quota the following month in order to keep their job. And if even if you're at quota, you don't actually make more than ~$60k before tax unless you're hitting about 150%+. That's very tough for city life. (Remember, though, you're already making almost double what the internally-promoted sales executives earn)"
403,Zocdoc,Inside Sales Executive,2015-03-24,3.0,Inside Sales Executive,"Above average salary starting as an Inside Sales Executive, great free lunch, totally free insurance, located in Soho cool area to be in.","have to dial over 100 #s a day to get any access, a lot of differences in territories as far as the ability to succeed in a specific territory your assigned, not much training on SalesForce, When doctors come off of the service they cut your commission so its hard to make $ consistently (doctors often discontinue the service), if you don't bring in a specific # of doctors they put you on a Performance plan which is almost impossible to get off of and if you make it off its eminent you will not make it 2-3 months afterwards. Constant pressure  and monitoring of your call time and dials somewhat ""micro-managed""."
404,Zocdoc,Great place for engineers,2015-03-23,5.0,Software Engineer,"The software engineering team at ZocDoc is one of the best places to grow technically and professionally.  The company has a lot of projects going on and the team is large enough to accomplish much, but also the team is small enough that each contributor is making a big difference.  Though parts of the code are on the stale side, there's plenty of areas where one can play around with the latest technology.  Most importantly, there's a good mix of junior and senior engineers, so there's plenty of mentorship and exchange of ideas.  The engineering directors really care about the work environment and building a team that is satisfied.  I've made a lot of progress in delivering big projects and getting promoted while here.","The engineering team is isolated from the rest of the company in some ways.  This isolation is a good thing, because the rest of the company can be a little aggravating.  Executives will micromanage their way into projects they don't have the time to fully understand.  The ginormous sales organization has terrible employee retention, so you never really build close bonds with them.  The company is getting better about communication, but there's also a lot of secrets about strategy and direction."

406,Zocdoc,FUTURE SALES REPS TAKE NOTE:,2015-03-19,3.0,Inside Sales Executive,"If you're lucky enough to get hired, ZocDoc will give you the sales experience of your life. Think ""Wolf of Wall Street"" (minus all the crazy profanity) meets ""The Apprentice"" (you're fired!).  Notice that many of the rave reviews you read about working here are written by operations associates, account executives and managers. It's no accident that honest reviews of the most common sales positions are pushed to the back pages of the site. ZocDoc desperately needs to hire sales associates right now because the vast majority of their seasoned reps have left (hence, the bribes for cash and i-pads in exchange for employee referrals).  So, if you're considering a sales job at ZocDoc, let's get a few things straight: 

-the people here are incredibly driven and talented individuals

-there is no such thing as ""unlimited vacation days"". Taking time off is extremely frowned upon and grounds for removal.

-the healthcare benefits are the best in the nation. You will never receive better health coverage anywhere else

-you cannot attain their commissions until you have 5 or more sales per month in most territories. If you miss that quota in any particular month, pack your bags.

-most territories have been aggressively worked over by previous reps. When you call the doctors office and say the word ZocDoc, you'll hear the phone slam down.

-the 'make work fun' slogan is a facade. only new hires and management actually play ping pong and take breaks. All other sales personnel are viciously fighting for their jobs instead of messing around.

Remember that should you choose to work here, you will become stronger in sales than you ever could have imagined. On the other hand, your ZocDoc journey will likely be short-lived (less than 1 year) unless you politically position yourself into management (near impossible to do). You don't need to feel obligated to believe everything management tells you. They're fantastic salespeople, keep that in mind. A good rule of thumb is to reach out to seasoned reps when you have questions. These people are doing the same job as you and have managed to keep from getting fired, so assume that their advice is valuable.",See above review in previous section

437,Zocdoc,ZocDoc Provides Opportunities,2014-11-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"ZocDoc has always been incredibly supportive of me even from day 1, which is why I have stayed at ZocDoc to develop my career. This was my first job out of college, and I had no idea what to expect from the workforce. I walked into an incredibly welcoming and encouraging environment, which surprised me. I had always thought I would end up in a different industry, but after being enveloped into the warm culture and being surrounded by awesome people, I knew I had found a gem that I couldn't give up.

Since my time at ZocDoc, I've had the opportunity to change teams and even develop a team of my own. My managers have always been incredibly supportive of not only me as a person but also my career. They see opportunities for me to develop and have brought them to me to see how I feel about them. I know this is an incredibly rare situation as most people have to ask their managers for a raise or a promotion. I'm very thankful of the support system I have here.

I also feel very supported by the Leadership Team. I know that I can voice my opinion and Speak Up to them, and that my voice will be valued and heard. Because of this, I've had many opportunities to suggest changes to processes or to implement new ones. I know this is also incredibly rare. 

Like I mentioned above, the people are incredible. They're smart, interesting, creative, innovative, caring and just plain fun. From the outside, I think people get scared by our Work Hard mentality, but it's mostly because we're enjoying what we're doing and we're surrounded by awesome people while we do it. We're having fun while we work, which again, is extremely rare.","There's always something you want to be doing/developing/brainstorming, but there are only so many hours in the day. I'm prioritizing and re-prioritizing my day, and that can be a little stressful. ZocDoc is challenging and pushes you to be the best. That's what I wanted in a company/career and what I signed up for, but you definitely have to have that mind set and be ready for it. Otherwise, I think people can be overwhelmed if they're not ready to be challenged."

440,Zocdoc,Very unrealistic expectations,2014-11-10,2.0,OUTSIDE SALES,Good innovative product that is changing the way new patients interact with medical professionals. Fun office to visit in New York and the CEO is a very smart visionary. The company is well-funded by prominent Silicon Valley investors and will probably incorporate new product lines down the road.,One of the worst sales cultures I have ever seen. They are constantly firing sales people. Churn for sales people is very high. By the end of my time at Zoc Doc I was the last person left from my initial training class. They are well staffed in the recruiting department because they always have open positions to fill. Doctors make jokes about how many different outside sales people they have seen and are aware of the high turnover.    If you don't hit your monthly target you have 2 weeks to make up the deficit or else you are fired. It's tough to make commission regularly because sand bagging helps you to just keep your job. You will probably never feel your job is safe if you work here. They put restrictions on certain doctors you can sell to in order to prevent saturation. It's good for the business and doctors but  it becomes harder to sell and your target does not change. Most of the comments you read about the company culture will in be in reference to the New York office. If you don't physically work in the NY office you will not experience this culture.

Free Lunch and Snacks
Casual Dress Code","MY EXPERIENCE WORKING HERE WAS IN THE SALES DEPARTMENT and I can't give an honest review on any other business unit. The person that said ""everyone writing negative reviews has been fired and couldn't cut it,"" may be true in some cases but not mine. I was the only person to actually close a deal in training and had been successful in inside sales for years before coming. 

This was the worst place I've ever worked and I was purposefully mislead from the start when a recruiter contacted me. Shortly after being hired, I realized the many issues with the way this company is ran. As a successful sales rep throughout my career and an immediate standout in their training class, it was obvious that this position is only appropriate for someone right out of college. I left this company after 2 weeks. I realized that there is no opportunity for growth at this company and anyone in the world can do this kind of work. Any evidence that you may know a thing or two about selling,inside sales, prospecting etc. will be seen as a threat by the sales trainer and his boss. 

I made a mistake leaving a job to come work at ZocDoc. However, I would advise anyone fresh out of school or with little sales experience to look into the opportunity. If you have any kind of experience or have achieved anything in sales, please stay away. It's hard work and you need to grind out calls but that;s EVERY sales job.

The company is committed to developing leaders internally, making sure that great people can find new challenges here across departments. The leadership team sincerely cares about its employees and seems to spend a lot of time thinking about how to make ZocDoc even better. The people here are amazing - sharp, humble, collaborative, challenging, and caring. 

The business model actually works and the service we provide is honestly a great one. The vision of the company is much bigger than online appointment scheduling, and I believe we're just getting started.

For people who want to build something, try new things, and pave the way, they shouldn't hesitate to climb aboard. For people who want to do the same job day in, day out, clock in, clock out, maintain the status quo - probably better to go to a big corporation without any fire in the belly.","Much of the staff - especially Sales - is pretty green and they have no idea just how good they have it here! The company is definitely still learning how to operate at its size, but Leadership seems to be invested in getting it right, hearing how they can improve, and learning as they grow.

-Best culture.Smart team memebers encouraging talent.

Zocdoc India has engraved the same culture of Zocdoc,NY and has even decorated office space to match the themes

464,Zocdoc,Do yourself a favor and do NOT work here,2014-07-24,1.0,,"Benefits... yep, that's about it.","Training: The training program consisted of five straight days of management shoving as much info as possible down the trainees' throats. After these five days, you are shoved out into the ""bull pen"" to make upwards of 100 cold calls a day.

Unrealistic expectations set during interview process: During my final round interview, I asked whether it was possible to switch into other departments from sales. This was greeted with ""everyone loves doing sales here, so most people don't switch, but of course it's possible if it's something you're interested in."" That turned out to be total BS- once you are on a sales track, there is absolutely no room to move to other departments. They also don't tell you during the interview that if you don't perform/close enough doctors after 5 weeks, you are put on 10 days of what is essentially probation- and if you don't do what they say in those 10 days/they aren't satisfied with you, you're gone.

Favoritism: A HUGE facet of the culture here. Most managers/team leaders are not directly involved with their teams- I barely saw my team leader after training was over- but those that are involved absolutely play favorites. I would give examples, but they're almost too degrading to write. Also, different SOAs are assigned to different territories- and although certain territories are easier to sell in, everyone is held to the same quota requirements, regardless of territory. 

Management: Sucks. Literally, they do not care enough about new hires to get involved in the day-to-day learning process- and those that do get involved are not nice (see favoritism section). Also, I joined ZD because I thought it was a cool, cutting edge company. We were promptly told ""Most of you probably started here because you thought it was a cool, fun place to work. You thought wrong- there's no such thing as cool here. Expect to work 12 hour days..."" etc a whole saga of how our expectations- which were largely framed and formed by recruiters/the interview process- were wrong. We were also told ""Most of you won't last here."" Company morale isn't really boosted by such a high turnover rate- and such a blatant disregard for individual employees."
465,Zocdoc,Challenging but not very rewarding,2014-07-14,3.0,Operations Associate,The best company culture I have experienced in my career. Management will mould you well so you are better prepared to take on the future challenges.,Slow career growth has caused a lot of people to leave the company over the past year.

466,Zocdoc,"It's a grind with a lot of pros and a lot of cons, huge peaks, huge valleys",2014-07-14,4.0,Inside Sales Executive,"First off, I would take any reviews from a SOA with a grain of salt, unless you are looking for experience specific to that role. They are essentially a training program with training wheels,

Product truly is the next natural step in healthcare, I don't think it's hubris. I LOVE my coworkers, they are the best and my reason for coming in each day. Free lunch, great healthcare benefits. Happy hour on Fridays is usually a lot of fun. Tons of attractive people (seriously, lots of good looking individuals to the point that it is a legitimate positive), good atmosphere, nice office in a beautiful location in New York City. Stocked snack room, team events, lots of cash competitions. 

The company truly cares about its employees, and is truly passionate about their mission. There is a lot of access for upper management, and some really great people here.","LONG HOURS. 8-6 at least, but you are expected to work after hours as well, especially if your territory sucks.

They are growing so fast, and are not doing a good job of managing this growth on the sales team side. 

I don't know why this myth of all territories being equitable is pushed on us. Maybe when the Salesteam was 20 people, and there were huge areas for each rep. But not now. Somewhere like St. Louis shouldn't have the same quota as North NJ. They are losing good people over this. What's even more puzzling, is I've heard that management is actually devising an algorithm to come up with more realistic quotas, but nobody on the actually sales team knows about this. Why would you not tell the salesforce about this?

This companies strategy at this point seems to be solely to cover the continental US as soon as possible, which seems to be tied to going public as soon as possible. As a result. some of the territories are absolute garbage. It doesn't feel good when it seems like the advice of outside investors is pushing the company's strategy.

A symptom of this focus is that SOAs are being pushed up to SAs and ISEs WAY TOO FAST. The top reps cut their teeth learning how to get access (one of the hardest parts of the job). When I got hired, most SOAs stayed in their role for 6 months or so. Before I was hired, it was nearly 9 months. Now they are being churned out in 2-4 months. Yeah, this might sound great if you are reading these reviews to become a SOA, until you get promoted out of the SOA role and fall flat on your face and end up getting fired or hating your territory (have fun in Rest of State South Carolina) so much you are quitting. 

Sales (not SalesOps) are treated as disposable. You can kind of trace the reasons for this just by looking at the LinkedIn profiles of the SalesOps vs Sales team. SalesOps are Ivy Leaguers and Investment Bankers, while sometimes it feels as though Sales are just the smooth talking idiots who get it done."
467,Zocdoc,A fantastic place to build a career in sales (if you work hard at it),2014-07-11,5.0,Sales Origination Associate,"ZocDoc is unlike any other place I've worked. The culture is great, the perks are even better, and the people here are among the best and brightest in New York.

Yes, there are hard quotas they expect you to hit, and yes, sometimes management isn't always helpful, but we are warned of these things before we start. Reading other reviews I'm not sure why people are surprised. The quotas and expectations are no different than other sales positions in the city. You will be on the phone for most of the day, cold-calling doctors, and trying to sell them on ZocDoc. Some regions are harder to sell in than others. All of this was mentioned in the phone screen with my recruiter, so none of it came as a surprise. Those who fail do so because of a lack of will. However, if you are good at what you do, there is a ton of room for growth, and a lot of SOAs move on to more senior roles before they've been here a year.

-Free, catered lunches every day (we use a couple dozen restaurants as vendors, so the food is never boring)
-100% healthcare covered, paid for by ZD
-Unlimited vacation days (no one is keeping track of when you take off--just have to make sure that you're not leaving work unfinished)
-Super casual environment (sometimes I wear sweatpants and no one bats an eyelash)
-Young, creative, fun company culture
-Great team events
-Sales contests to win cash prizes
-Tons of opportunity for growth
-Weekly, all-hands happy hour on Fridays
-Great snack room
-Laptop and cell phone provided for you
-Bright, open, multi-floor office in SoHo","-Growing pains typical of a start-up
-Raises often only come if you ask for them (and aren't guaranteed based on tenure, etc.)
-Hours vary depending on workload, but that's true for most jobs
-If you don't like to work hard, this isn't the place for you"

The people are amazing and were what made me want to come to work every day.,"The upper management (executives) don't put their employees first. As much as they say they do, there are a lot of situations where they make decisions without consulting the people it will impact which is why they can't hold on to the great people they want ."

Great people- what's left","Be ready to work 9-10+ hours every day.
Unobtainable goals, 60 dials min 2hrs of Talk time. 
Must close 4 docs every month and don't earn a penny until your 5th doctor. 250 bonus on your 5 doc, but then if a doc ""churns"" the deduct your commission? Haha why are we penalized if the doctor doesn't want to stay for 6 months? I did my job and made the sale, not my fault the doc doesn't like your service. 

Then the cycle starts over again next month.  Every market is different, not one higher up seems to understand that. 
Earn 850 every two weeks? Can you live off that? 
Might as we'll stay a SOA setting a min of 3 meetings a day is more obtainable. There is a high level of mid communication.
 
And finally - the ""rules"" on sales: if YOU sell a doc and he practices in someone else's territory it goes to them? Haha... Us before me is a core value- management will tell you to ask the other rep if you can have it and the other greedy reps take it.. Free sale for them 0 numbers for you. In my life in sales...

This is a place for someone who just graduated college and has not worked in any other workplace.  The management at ZocDoc creates a college-like environment in which there is a cafeteria with free lunch, free beer, and ridiculous expectations and work hours.  For example, in the Operations group, work is from 8AM -5PM and THEN, there are meetings for different domains starting at 6:30PM.  So, not only is one doing Customer Support all. day. long.  Then, one must do Product  Development/Training/Marketing after hours.  They even encourage weekends to get (full-time) projects done.  And sometimes, you have to skip lunch and eat at your desk to do stay logged in because that's what your team decided.  Social events, which are scheduled nearly daily, are not exactly optional.  It's a circus-like, frenzied, all-nighter, college-like environment.  They even asked us where we went to college so they could put up pennants in the main conference room.  I mean, really!!

This environment is cultivated by their (stupid) mottos of ""work hard"", ""make work fun"" and ""speak up!"" The latter is taken quite literally when employees with less than 2 years of work experience shut down the brainstorming process and don't know how to listen to other ideas/opinions.  Furthermore, it is a culture of unsolicited advice, lack of manners and etiquette, and bullying under the guise of ""teamwork"" and speaking one's mind.  

The leadership team encourages this behavior but manages to keep the young employees star-struck by their  hubris (""We are transforming healthcare!"" seriously?) and pedigree.  In fact, ZocDoc does not hire upper management unless they went to a top-tier college/university even if someone has extensive and impressive work experience.  All I kept thinking about when I was there was this: this is an oligarchy!  More evidence of this is the turnover.  ZD claims to put people first, yet you will see employees fired (yes, fired) on a DAILY basis.  They dispose their people and move onto the next innocent lamb, er, 22 year old NYU grad...

In summary, I would not recommend anyone to work at this place."

The biggest pro is working alongside a product that is TRULY changing the world and the healthcare industry. ZocDoc demands a lot from you, but they give you an opportunity hardly anyone else can. As Sinatra said: ""If you can make it there, you'll make it anywhere."" Expectations are high, but if they see you work hard, work smart, and truly care, sales promotions are handed out in 3 months, and not a few years at other, ""safer"" workplaces.","Pressure. You need to perform. It is, most definitely, a ""what have you done for me lately"" culture. However, this culture gives smart people who can see what is needed a great advantage to come in, work hard, and move up within this amazing company.

Territory Management - Not a lot of leeway when it comes to getting a good territory. But that's any sales position really. The only problem with that is that they expect reps in rural areas to perform the same as metro areas. Vastly different markets, same expectations.

- Prepares you to perform extremely well in another company's sales role interview","Overall the feel for ZocoDco is very fake. They sell you on a lot of things during the interview, but think about it- you are being interviewed by recruiters, and recruiters have hiring quotas to hit - they need to fill spots in order to keep their job so they will sell you on all the positives of the position w/o really explaining to you what really goes on..

Both inside and outside sales roles have an extremely high turnover rate. I truly felt bad for new people coming in - and having left great jobs, and having no idea  what they were really in for. No matter the territory, everything goes by strict quotes - you can hit quota for 11 straight months, and on the 12th if you dont- youre fired. There is no job security.

The best way to evaluate this company is to look at those who even have been very successful in their roles - management tries to sell you on what you can become one day if you stick it out - but even the best performing people decide to leave due to how much they disliked the culture. 

Ive seen the best inside sales execs, business development directors, sales managers, area sales managers, sales directors - ALL LEAVE b/c of there being no job security / and not liking the fake culture that exists."

Plenty of upward mobility and opportunity for growth.

Free lunch, ping pong tables, and positive environment.","While I understand the benefits of having a data-driven approach to sales campaigns, there are some serious flaws with building a company this way. When you remove the human judgment from the processes it prevents any kind of flexibility, thus hamstringing the sales reps.

Also, if you get assigned a poor territory, or are placed in a territory that has been burnt to the ground by a previous rep, good luck putting up any kind of quality numbers. However, with a little bit of luck and a LOT of hard work, you can be successful at this company."

Paid company training in Phoenix or NYC 
My regional manager is awesome and my trainer is a passionate enthusiast who helps facilitate my success 
Lots of talent on the mid-management rung 
People in the company do genuinely wish for you to succeed, and there are caring people and resources available to you to ensure that you do","The problem isn't the product itself or the people, it's almost entirely the upper executives and the myopia that they've created. 
Despite what they tell you, your success will in fact be largely market-dependent, and the guys at the top are too arrogant to understand that not all markets are created equal, so instead of changing their tactics or devising intelligent, sensible strategies reflective of marketplace dynamics, they try the same tired approach but switch out their reps who quit or get fired. In that sense it's no different from any corporate American enterprise, so don't be fooled by the superficial ""start up"" perks or the ""company values"" 
If you're in a big city where ZocDoc has some traction, you will have a much easier time stating a compelling case to a doctor because your numbers will be a lot better, whereas if you're in a more rural, older environment, you're fighting for scraps, with the same quota, and without company support to do anything other than what hasn't worked for the rep you've replaced. 
Inflexible price structure and refusal to negotiate is a total disaster in certain markets 
You'll be given scripts and talking points to try and cover for gaping holes in the ZocDoc value proposition instead of engaging management in meaningful conversation about how the company can improve itself 
It's difficult to have a real conversation with medical practices because ZocDoc has burned so many bridges with ineffective growth strategies aka call, call, call, call until you get a yes. 
In that vein, you'll probably call on practices that have been called on dozens and dozens of times before. They don't address that in training.  
Upper management will do everything in their power to ensure that your Salesforce activity is micro-micro-micro managed, as if it's the only determinant of your success.  
Everything is measurable through Salesforce, except for their own hubris--that's infinite.   
The recruiters lure people in with the prestige of ""medical sales"" and fool them into believing that ZocDoc on a resume will somehow be a career game changer. in reality you're often regarded in the same light as a Yellow Book ad salesman. 
If you ""speak up"" past your regional superior with whom you've developed trust, you'll get swatted down like a fly

working in sales, you are treated like a piece of machinery, and rather than fix a squeaky wheel, they just replace the machine.

I didn't have insurance, the company didn't have a maternity policy, etc.  I told my boss I was pregnant. I was totally dreading it.  He gave me the biggest hug, congratulated me, and the very next day, he brought me onto the team full-time with full benefits. As my belly continued to grow, I was the first pregnant lady at ZocDoc.  Everyone was so excited for me!  Chris (one of the office managers- he is amazing) would bring me a yogurt everyday, John (recruiter) would get me lunch everyday, and they had a huge surprise baby shower for me where they bought everything left on my registry.  Now, if these people don't sound like family, I don't know what else to say.  Every single day, I am grateful for the opportunity I was given at ZocDoc.  My son was born April 5, 2013.

Every day I look forward to going into work even if I know it's going to be a tough day or a busy one. 

Management from Team Leads to the Executive Team is approachable, excellent, and demands excellence from everyone around them. The opportunities to take on projects and develop professionally/be promoted are only limited to what you can manage to take on. 

It's an indescribable feeling knowing that the people around me, continue to help each patient and each doctor because they genuinely want to make a difference in healthcare and set a new precedent for customer service in the health industry.","Many of the most exciting and important projects have to be worked on outside of coverage hours. This means that if you want to really excel, you likely need to work on your own projects in the evenings or on the weekends. The hours are already pretty long, and I know that as we grow more, there will likely be more opportunities to do project-work during regular business hours, but for the foreseeable future it's going to remain on your own time.

-Unrealistic goals.  I understand wanting to have consistency in implementing the same monthly sales goals for everyone in the company, but other markets/cities are very different from selling in New York or a large city.  Management won't even consider this.

-Turn over is extremely HIGH: Have a great 8 months of selling and hitting your numbers and then 1 bad month?  Well, that doesn't really matter.  Automatically you are on a unattainable plan and may lose your job pretty quickly.  They honestly do not seem to care about the high turnover rate or losing quality sales reps; even the reps that have been with the company for some time.

-the unlimited time off policy is the biggest lie ive ever been told. they email out a PDF about how to take time off. it needs a months notice, manager approval and can be vetoed due to performance. most people are too scared to take it off since this is a hire em/fire em opportunity. with the amount of resignations and firings the company doesn't have to pay anyone for time off they didnt take if there was a real policy. 

-turn over is very high. people leave after speaking with managers about their ""career trajectory"" and would rather quit than be fired, people are fired with good performance but for not being outgoing and bubbly enough. (fact) 

-sales reps on the outside quit everyday. 

-territories and calling hours change on a whim. just start rebuilding the pipeline

-there is no adjustment for sales goals  every city, every time of year and every type/amount of sales rep per BOA is evaluated identically. a BOA in new york city has the same goals and targets as a BOA in delaware or ft. lauderdale.

507,Zocdoc,"Great Benefits, Great Concept, Terrible Execution",2013-06-18,2.0,Sales Executive,"• ZocDoc has created a product that makes receiving healthcare easier for patients. With so many problems in healthcare, it’s refreshing to be part of a solution. 
• Healthcare/dental/vision/etc. coverage at 100%; a very unique benefit that is difficult to find anywhere else.
• Generally speaking, flexibility and independence within sales isn’t half bad and if you have good lead-generation support your job will be easy.","Expectations/Concerns
When my recruiter pitched me on ZocDoc, I was told stories about reps that closed 7 doctors in a day and how reps claim 80% close ratios. The downside was that much of that business came from cold calling, but how hard could it be to ultimately sell the idea of new patients to a physician? I was slightly apprehensive about the business generation side and I now wish I had listened to my instincts.

Pay Structure
I was offered a 50k base and 240/doctor. As it turns out, the real base is 40k with a 10k draw on commission. Over time, the commission structure changed multiple times, even one scenario when reps were not paid for their first 6 doctors each month. At the time, 6-7 was the average number of monthly closes. While the [insane] standard was previously 14 doctors/month, there is no real quota and requirements have changed. You need to close 5 doctors to keep your job, 8 to receive a commission check and 10+ to keep people off your back. Don’t allow any of your accounts to churn or your commission will be clawed back at a rate of 700/doctor (whether you were paid for that account or not).

Territory
Your territory will have an incredible impact on your performance at ZocDoc. Rural areas are terrible; downtown areas are great. If you are downtown, not only will your doctors perform better on the service but you will experience fewer churns (i.e. you actually get paid) and it’s easier to reference other doctors. 

Business Origination Associates
Reps are paired with BOAs (ratio is usually 3-5 territories per BOA) for lead generation. They call and setup appointments for you. If you have a good one, enjoy it while it lasts because he/she is soon to be moved into inside sales. Bad ones schedule few appointments or worse, schedule low-quality appointments. 

Culture
At first, the culture seems incredible; mostly because you are flown in to the NYC office and you are able to experience the really cool side of ZocDoc. If you are working in NYC, congratulations! All other markets do not have offices and the culture(s) are vastly different. In NYC, it’s all smiles and free lunch. Everywhere else, you find sales reps struggling to make numbers and negativity running rampant. When I go back to the NYC office, I can hardly believe it’s the same company.

Healthcare Sales
When I entered into this position, I was attracted to the prestige of healthcare sales and I assumed that ZocDoc would stand out as this healthcare-revolutionizing product. Not the case. I am treated like a Yellow Book ad salesperson more often than anything else. I also expected this to be a resume builder; not the case.

Rep Churn
Reps churn daily and so do clients. I have worked with about 15 reps in my area and only 2 of them have been around since I have. Reps with 2 years under their belts have been fired for missing a single weekly quota. If you’re closing at least 2 doctors a week, you can stay. Everyone else should pass on ZocDoc or sign-on ready to continue their job hunting. 

Client Churn: Management will not reveal the extent to which client churn damages revenue but it is a major, major concern. The product simply does not perform for far too many doctors. I have brought on doctors who have not seen a single patient from the service in almost a year.

Management
Sales Operations and Sales Management have one responsibility; micro-manage the heck out of Salesforce. You will find far more former Salesforce Consultants than you will former Salespeople in management. If you create opportunities and report accurately in SF, you are doing your job. If you don’t, you’re not. Leads in ZocDoc’s SF are littered with duplicates and other issues. 

Requirements
Management requires you to meet with doctors and cold call from 8-5, then go home and log all your activity, create/edit opportunities, prep for next-day meetings and perform extensive daily planning for the following day. This becomes easier with time but expect to put in an additional 3 hours for the first 3-4 months. Given that the average close ratios are actually in the area of 10-20% (according to Sales Ops), you need to be going on 4-5 meetings per day. Good luck with that.

Unlimited Time Off
One of the coolest-sounding benefits of working at ZocDoc, but it is not real. If you are not on-track for a favorable number of closes for the month, it’s not going to be approved or you will have enough sense to know that leaving town might mean losing your job.

Growth
I have no doubt that ZocDoc will grow and it may eventually earn a more respectable place in healthcare. Career outlook for the right position (i.e. not sales) is great! If you are in NYC, work hard and you will earn career advancement. Outside of NYC, good luck."

They treat those who work there very well in terms of providing ample food, beverage and social engagements. They reward people and do well on the recognition front.","Its like high school except cut throat. I can say that they treat their employees with disposable attitude. They have no problem with hiring 10 people and only keeping 1 after 2 months in the field. 1 week of training and its off you go. Cant get traction in the begining? too bad. Uprooted your whole life to take a position across the country? not my problem. I saw them let go of a lot of talented sales profesionals just because they couldnt quite get it within their time frame. Next to no seniority. The job sounds great on paper but in application, you either get it or you dont. If you dont get it in their time frame, too bad. This approach has screwed a lot of really talented people. In the short while I was there the dozens of sales people i saw will now have to explain themselves about zocdoc on any interview. Also its a very cult like environment. some people may view that as a pro or a con."
509,Zocdoc,"Great 1st job,, if you have a sales job, DO NOT LEAVE for zocdoc",2013-03-31,1.0,Sales Executive,Awesome product that actually makes doctors $ if given proper expectations. I've used it to book doctor appointments and its so easy and helpful.,"If you have a job and are earning more than 40k, I wouldn't leave for the ""opportunity"" to sell for zocdoc. Regardless of their rhetoric, this IS NOT like medical or pharma sales. You have to give doctors very unrealistic numbers to get them to buy the product, this is why over 70% churn and hate zocdoc. If you are in medical or pharma, be prepared to lose those relationships you've worked so hard to gain. 

Quota of 16 each month is unattainable unless you lie to doctors. Most reps capture 6-8 monthly.  You won't make 100k unless you close 16-20 docs a month. The very top rep, #1 closed an average of 14.5 per month last year. Do the math. Average reps (8 per month) earn 60k per year."

You won't build up your knowledge and skill fast enough to succeed.  Management is focused on building a business and your expected to join in.  That's what this organization is about.

They fail to mention, however, that about 10-20% of people consistently hit quota monthly, and that the commission structure is bogus, since you need your doctor to stay on for 3 months in order to get paid, or you lose your commission. There is an insane amount of turnover, leadership/management is a joke, and if you're not up to speed within your first couple months, you're out - plain and simple. 

As most reviews have mentioned, quota is 4 sales/week, but the MAJORITY of the sales team (inside/outside) are closing between 1-3 each. Therefore, you should expect, if you average 2-3 sales/week, to make around $65-80k. This is a 100% cold-call role, making a ton of dials to doctor's offices that want nothing to do with you, and you will be prospecting every day, so expect to work a few additional hours each day after work. Not that this is a bad thing, as this is necessary in some roles, but it's not what is pitched to you throughout the interview process, so keep that in mind."

The SEO for ZocDoc is incredible and is what drives 1.8M people to our site every single month.  Considering it only takes 1-2 patients per month for a practice to be profitable with ZocDoc, it's a pretty easy sale.  The people who write bad reviews on here are obviously not good sales people -- you are selling patients to a doctor.  He/she *needs* patients to keep the practice strong, so it's a no-brainer.  That being said, not everyone is polished enough or confident enough to deal with the doctor demographic.  Just because you were awesome selling widgets to someone in rural Kentucky doesn't mean you will automatically be a swift salesperson dealing with physicians.","They have had some transition at the management level, bringing in new voices and changing philosophies several times since I started 6 months ago.

If you want to work 9-5 and then turn your phone off, forget about work, and then sleep in....Not the place for you.","ZocDoc is one of the best start-ups in the world (If you do not believe me, just do some research), and with that comes a high level of expectations and a quick ramp-up period. If you cannot sell something unless you have a name badge with a company everyone knows, or someone to hold your hand when asking for payment...this is not the place for you. ZocDoc is a place for quick thinkers, leaders, those who adapt to change quickly, people who hunt, mentally capable folks who do not give up when they hear ""No"" for the fifth time in one day."
542,Zocdoc,Best Job I've ever had!,2012-02-17,5.0,Senior Sales Executive,"Great vision, culture, product, and comp. Only product on the market that do what we do. Definitely not for the person who is comfortable in an account executive role. If you are a top 10% sales executive with experience selling in the medical field you'll do well here. I came from pharma and got tired of buying lunches and dropping samples for signatures. This is much more rewarding both personally and financially. Made 90k in 8 months last year and should hit around 120k this year. Great Benefits as well. Middle managers are not horrible like someone previously said. It's Sales 101; you hit your numbers and you're left alone to do your job. You don't work and you are micromanaged or let go.","It can be stressful at times, but what job isn't. If you are results driven then you will love it here."
543,Zocdoc,Awesome Company!!!!,2012-02-17,5.0,Sales Executive,"If you're a true Sales Rep who doesn't need their hand held and can work on your own hours and motivation, then ZocDoc is a Sales Rep's heaven....managers are never micro-managing as long as you're at your # and are only there only to help you when you need something....the company benefits are great and your Medical/Dental/Vision are all covered....the Service team is on call 24-7 to help any of your clients when they need something taken care of or a question answered, as a Sales Rep that's very important to know that your accounts are being taken care of....there's plenty of potential and opportunity for growth and management is always open to talking about that, as well as things to improve, and any concerns you may have - overall an absolutely GREAT place to work!!",Base pay is too low compared to other companies and needs to be based on cost of living in the reps respectful city
544,Zocdoc,Best Sales Position I've Ever Had!,2012-02-16,5.0,Sales Executive,"Great Concept, Incredible vision, wonderful growth opportunity, family environment, great people to work with, and highly driven employees.  Get off your butt and work hard and they highly compensate you.  Doctor are ready for this!  They get the idea, they see the value, and they ultimately buy.  We truly do provide a great service to the public.","You will work many hours, cold call lots of doctors and you must be self-sufficient.  Once in the field you must learn quickly.  They best way to learn and get up to speed is read medical articles and updates on your own.  If you can't relate and speak to doctors in their language you will struggle.  4 doctors a week is challenging.   I cold call at least 20 doctor's practices a day and I usually set 1 appointment from this.  I close 70% of the doctors I get a meeting with.  Work hard and you must BE MOTIVATED TO WORK ON YOUR OWN."
545,Zocdoc,"Best place I have ever worked, Period!!!!!!!!!!",2012-02-16,4.0,OUTSIDE SALES,"I am a pretty independent person, always have been. ZocDoc is a place where sometimes you need to figure stuff out on your own. So that is one of the things I LOVE about working here. I do not have a set schedule, I work when I want to work. As long as you meet expectations (weekly sales quotas, log all of your activity in salesforce, communicate with manager) you are pretty much left alone to do your job and SELL, without a lot of hand holding.

 I like the short sales cycle, which allows for lots of opportunity every day. ZocDoc is a  very team oriented environment, where people are always willing to help in any way they can. 

Its a brilliant idea and someday ZocDoc will be a household name!","Every Monday you are back at Zero, so its a bit of a grind in terms of making quota.

 The company is still in its infancy so there is some uncertainty about exactly where we will be in 5 years as an organization. 

Some of the people at HQ in New York are a bit out of touch. Because we are somewhat restricted in terms of specialties to sell to, I had to turn down a 10 doctor practice to come on the service.  (That's $30,000 in annual revenue, enough money to cover 75% of my base pay, from one customer). When I explained  to the customer as to why I could not sign them up, their response was,  "" I have NEVER worked with a company who has said NO to new customers. The person making that decision at your company should be fired""  I don't agree they should be fired,  I just think the people on the street ( Reps and ASM's) should have more control to make exceptions to go outside of the belt system."

547,Zocdoc,"I work hard and do well, this isn't working at the pretzel shop in the mall though, obviously",2012-02-16,4.0,Sales Executive,"With this job you will definitely be given help from your AE(Account Executive) and your success depends, in part, on your ability to communicate effectively with them as a team.  We honestly have a wildly relevant and easy to sell product that is easy to purvey to doctors anywhere.  I am in New York and am selling in a territory that has been sold in literally since the inception of the company, so there are differences in territory management than in a new market.  I would say that the way you handle this is paramount to your success ratios.  Your AE will do their best to set up meetings and it is 100% on you as a Sales Executive to sit down with the doctor and help them understand the value.  People do well when they are able to connect with the doctor and effectively show the value to them.  The value to them is a great amount more profit than the doc was previously experiencing as well as streamlining their practice.  This isn't easy but if you are a gregarious, smart, and an good communicater then you should be able to succeed.  All of this being said, your AE is NOT your whipping boy/girl.  They are doing their best to create an atmosphere of success for you as well as them.  I always bring opportunities to my AE and work with him to move the process along but absolutely never take them for granted.  

Now on the subject of compensation let me address the base salary.  40k sucks, yes, boom there it is.  I come from the world of finance where i made a ton more money, base wise, than i do here.  However, there is a reason for this and it is directly tied to your motivation.  If you can work hard and just learn how to talk to doctors then you can hit serious numbers.  I am in my first two months and if i continue my current, very new learning curve stage, production, I will easily make between 130 and 180 this year.  This is not the type of job where you can just sit on your butt and expect free sales to jump through the door, but if you can learn the game and learn from your managers(who are young, but very good to reference for sales advice) you can ramp up quickly.  The key is to just become a student of the game and work well with everyone around you.  There is support, but they will not baby you if you are not going to work and try to get better.","40k is a crappy base but I get why it is all commision slanted pay scale.  Now, haha, earlier i was very put off by this.  
The managers are young:  get over it
You can get fired easily:  very true, no beating around the bush.  ZocDoc is getting better at developing their salesforce and are investing in them greatly as we speak, but this is a very new firm and they are doing the best they can.  Remember that this company is growing like wildfire and they have a lot of options to choose from.  That being said, people i know have been fired and it sucks.  Just take it upon yourself to become better and they will see that and know you are trying.  Honesty and transparency goes a long way with the management staff  because they are just trying to do the best job they can to help you reach your goals.  
Would i like the pay to be like insurance where you are payed on a residual since ZD gets paid residually, absolutely!  This would be awesome and would incentivize the sales force to be more invested"
548,Zocdoc,Exciting atmosphere with lots of opportunity.,2012-02-16,5.0,Sales Executive,"The two main reasons for working at ZocDoc are the opportunity and the culture.  ZocDoc is in an accelerated growth phase right now, which means that there is ton of opportunity to advance.  If you can produce for the company, you will be given opportunities.  ZocDoc has never hired someone from outside to   become a manager in the sales organization and I hope and expect this to continue.  As for the culture, it is a very refreshing place to be especially if you come from somewhere ""corporate"" .  While it is growing and there is more structure now than a year ago, most of the ""small start-up"" culture has remained in tact.","The biggest hurdle you need to deal with at ZocDoc is the fast-paced, ever changing atmosphere.  While some thrive in this, you must know that you are getting into a fast growing company.  Things changes everyday.  If you are not prepared for this, ZocDoc may not be the place for you."
549,Zocdoc,This is the first job where i was compensated correctly for my effort and the organization appreciated my input.,2012-02-16,5.0,OUTSIDE SALES,"I've never worked with a closer group of guys here.  I moved here for the job and its great to have a strong helpful group around you.  I work hard and i feel im being compensated very well for it.  I trained for a bit over in week at the corporate office in New York.  They prepared me well.  Ive hit the ground running and ive never looked back.  Cyrus, the CEO is from West Palm, and since i moved here for the job he offered me at seat with his family at their Thanksgiving table.  Although i booked a last minute flight home i thought that was really cool.  When something like that happens, how can you not feel lucky.  Its the best job ive had.","We work hard.  Some people think this is a job where you just walk into an office and make them successful.  We work in medical.  Nothing in medical comes easy.  You're dealing with a client that has diminishing returns and see more salesman than any other industry.  So, if your not a hard worker, this job isn't for you."
550,Zocdoc,Everything that was told to me at time of hire came to fruition faster and with more enjoyment than I thought possible.,2012-02-16,5.0,Account Executive Manager,"You are surrounding yourself with consummate professionals; who have the added quality of being extremely nice and fun people. Across every department you find people that are smart, talented, focused and engaging to speak with.","The downside to working with a diverse group of people all focused on one goal is that it involves hard work and long hours, sometimes without recognition. To qualify that statement; it is hard for someone who works 14 hours a day to acknowledge or praise someone who works 12 hour days."
551,Zocdoc,Working at ZocDoc has allowed me accelerate my career by demonstrating company values as my own in my day to day activ.,2012-02-16,5.0,Account Executive,"We get to work with intelligent people. You come to work with new challenges and the resources to conquer and achieve new goals. As long as you work hard here, there's a tremendous amount of growth opportunity into new leadership roles. The free food and lunchs help too!",We are dealing with doctors who aren't used to ZocDoc and the changes it takes to implement a new technology in the healthcare sector. We are actually changing the way healthcare takes place each and every day.

At the same time I am making good money and working with people that I like.,Things are very fast paced and change quickly. Sometimes you can lose focus on a very important task that you need to accomplish.
553,Zocdoc,I look forward to coming into work everyday.,2012-02-16,5.0,,"Amazing culture and people.  Level of talent is remarkable.  Respect and genuineness from your peers is refreshing.  The benefit package is the best I've ever seen/had and the comp. packages are quite competitive.  The opportunity to work on something that actually matters is great and working with those who share the same drive is contagious.  

If you're looking for a fast paced, exciting atmosphere and challenging career ZocDoc is for you.","No tip toeing around the fact that it's a challenging workload and often times just down right hard hard work.  To be honest - it's just not for everybody and that's a shame.    Hiring so aggressively sometimes is hard to interview so many excited, energetic people who ultimately aren't the right fit - it's tough you can't hire everyone, but it just part of the process."
554,Zocdoc,"Great product, Great Culture, Great People, HORRID Middle Managers, Cut Throat Expectations",2012-02-13,3.0,Sales Executive,"As someone currently working with ZD, a top 20% performer, and truly believes in this product I'm going to give it to you as straight as I can: The product is easy to sell bc it is fantastic, the company culture is amazing, they give you a lot of tools to be successful and overall treat their employees well. Recently training has been revamped to create better structure. Now on to the bad.","EXTREMELY CUT THROAT. I am saying this in the most respectful and sincere manner so that some of you considering coming to work here understand what you will be getting into. The previous reviews about getting fired for under performing are spot on. I had a fairly large training class and out of all those people there are only 2 of us left. They don't mess around here. The base is $40k no matter where you are. Don't let any of the recruiters tell you that hitting quota annually is a cake walk. It's not. If you are young, weren't making much to begin with and they are asking you to come on to launch a new market then do it. Those who launch new markets are like kids in a candy store. They get the best Account Execs to call for them to set-up meetings, they have tons of resources launched in that city to get attention. HOWEVER, if you are being asked to come into an existing territory then understand that there have probably been many, many, many reps before you who probably sold out of desperation and lied their tale off in terms of expectations to the doctors. This in turn creates a culture where there a bad things said about ZD. Look, bottom line is this. This is a great company with great people but this is a job that will have you stressed out of your mind every week.Your job is on the line week in and week out. They recently had a conference call that set these expectations even higher and stricter than before. My advice to any of you is this: if you need a job this is a great company to work for. If you have a good job don't leave it to come here unless you like playing with fire. This job is for those who understand there is little to zero job security and are willing to take a gamble hoping you make it long enough for the IPO rewards in 3-4 years."
555,Zocdoc,Great Idea - Poor Management,2012-01-30,1.0,Sales Executive,"Working for an ambitious start-up company to create access for people in need of healthcare was highly alluring. The four employees with whom I initially interviewed were young, highly energetic and painted a wonderful picture of rich company culture, success and advancement opportunities.  Visiting the home office in Manhattan was highly impressive.","Training was poorly organized and the consensus among everyone in my class was that we were presented with too much information to fully grasp within five days. Most of the difficulty centered around navigating the cumbersome portal used when signing up new practitioners and setting up their profiles.  We were told we'd have assistance with it in the field upon returning to our territories, but that was not the case. After training, you are on your own. Management outside of  New York is practically non-existent. I flew up to New York again for the yearly conference, and outside the confines of the home office almost every single sales person was complaining about some facet of the job. Since I had just started, I naively dismissed their complaints and tried to stay positive about the company. It took about a month for their complaints and stories to be confirmed to me through my own experiences. I was mislead about the pay.  There's very little - if any - transparency from management on the regional level to management at the corporate level which is unfortunate unless you're a rep at the corporate office in New York. Though inexperienced outside of the organization, most senior reps and managers are too egotistical to learn new reps' names let alone assist them with development."
