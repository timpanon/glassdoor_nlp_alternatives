Good compensation","I have worked in Zomato for a year. Whole year, each day was a deadline. on average you will be working for 10 hours each day. Sat/Sun are off officially but you might be working on weekends too. It affected my health badly. Sometimes you will get a new task out of the blue and the same week will be the shipping date. We had late night meetings (2 am too). 

There is no organized work. Once you are given a task, you will own it fully. You will be scheduling all the meetings (with BE/FE/UI/PM) and making sure other teams complete their side of work on time so that you are unblocked for shipping on time. Also, you can not delay the shipping date even if you have to work 24 hours.

All the teams suffer from hectic work culture.

- Competitive salary structure 
- Good annual leave policy on paper 
- Head office is a great workspace to work","- Biased culture highly appreciated for promotions and side stepping. Eg: You’ll find random guys from sales in Product with zero PM skills etc.
- Hierarchical in nature, people often wear an attitude with their position.
- Weekends are often working, no work life balance. Even if you try to maintain it, someone else is working extra to earn superior bias which is well appreciated. Company lives on WhatsApp communication, should just stop wasting money on slack.
- Mid management is quite below average market standards, significantly needs qualified people.
- All PR announcements about employee benefits you hear as an outsider are literally a scam. Fathers taking a paternity leave of more than 3 weeks have been frowned upon, period leaves for girls are often taunted upon in office etc. 
- Groups of older people have made forts in the mid management. Top management acts oblivious to this fact, encouraging this nature. This is why you’ll probably have to please these people. 
- Work ethic is a sham in certain functions - CX, Sales, Ops. Certain leaders are constantly abusive, detrimental and more yet actively appreciated by the founders at forums.

498,Zomato,Marketing and PR stunts blanket the internal truth,2021-05-27,2.0,Anonymous Employee,People you work with are great,"2 years back Zomato used to be a great company to work for. The environment, support and values resonated really well with the culture and company they were building.

The team still have an amazing bunch of people who are super talented. The only pro to working at Zomato I would say is the team and learning to constantly work under pressure. 

Hats off to the marketing team. They do a brilliant job of portraying the company to be one of the best places to work at, but in reality that is not the case. 

Giving the period leaves, and other PR stunts blanket the entire truth. If you remember the 2020 news where the company announced giving a 10 day off to all employees because they value mental health, that was not the case. Most of us were actually working. Once again, Zomato has a great marketing and PR team. 

If you plan on joining Zomato now, you will have no work life balance. That term is thrown out the window. The company does not respect their employees well being. 

Over townhalls, and other internal calls employees are very openly told that they can be replaced if the changes do not suit them well. The targets are absolutely insane. Foul language over group calls and texts by the founder is very common and has become a cultural norm. 

The communication and work assigned is absolutely all over the place and there is no structure. Each and everything is on excel sheet which takes you back to the stone age. The company puts pressure on deadlines, and you're asked to work over weekends giving you no comp off. Even if you're on an off, you are expected to work. 

The concept of work timings left the building years ago. You work atleast 10-11 hours everyday. 

The company increased salaries a few months back. Despite the increase in pay, it does not justify the amount of irrelevant work thrown at POCs. After the increase in pay if an employee questioned something, the go to response was ""we're paying you enough"""

I had worked for Zomato for more than a year and all throughout I had tried to keep up with the company expectations wrt to my work. But it was all in vain as there was no appreciation for the work and pointing fingers was a regular gesture at the company. I had been asking for promotion (with 6.5+ years of experience till then) for over a year and was denied the same for no justified reason. Tried really hard to cope up with this but I lost my patience when my Manager decided to scream and shout at me for no apparent reason and behaved rudely over multiple instances during meetings in the past. “NO ACTION WAS TAKEN FROM THE MANAGEMENT” on this issue. I was told things like “he has certain expectations from you that he was trying to convey”, “you need to have a thicker skin if you want to survive” , “you don’t have to get emotional over this” and so on. The higher management refused to take any action against my Manager even after I reported it to the higher authorities. I tried talking to a lot of people in the higher management and address this issue but there was NO POSITIVE RESPONSE. I was already in the phase of taking therapies because this kind of environment was giving me anxiety to a severe level. Finally after multiple encounters, I decided to resign and leave the organisation. Workplaces are supposed to be employee friendly but this one was surely not."

They were always willing to teach you, give you feedback and help you grow. The onboadring program was good too, we did a full week of learning then another week of shadowing before going to meetings. Even when we did go to meetings our managers came with us for the first few ones to help you out when needed. 

I think this is a good company to work for if you are a graduate fresh out of university, you learn a lot here. 

The CEO has created a lot of great work benefits this year such as full paid parental leave, no matter what gender you are.","The reason I say this role is better for a graduate is because if you have years of experience, you get paid more at other companies, working at jobs that are less stressful too. 

The reality of working at Zomato is that your phone is constantly going off even at 9:00 pm at night. Clients are always getting in touch with you during annoying hours and the managers expect you to reply to their messages straight away and get issues sorted, no matter what hour of the day or day of the week it is. While you do have flexibility with your schedule, you may have to work late or during weekends. I felt like I had no work life balance in this role. 

In terms of pay, it is not good. They don’t provide you with a work vehicle and don’t pay for wear and tear of your personal vehicle. Commissions are constantly changing, making it harder for you to achieve them and are often paid months later."

- A very strong emphasis on integrity and honesty, this is a very crucial part of the culture here
- Very, very employee friendly organisation and the CEO himself drives employee policies and deeply believes in these
- One of the best products and tech teams in the product industry. The constant hustle is what makes it great!
- Fast paced and dynamic environment, an employee can grow very well with a lot of exposure across teams, immense scope for growth - horizontal and vertical. Lots of young managers but good care is taken to hand hold them and make them successful along with their teams
- There is a lot of potential to try new things, fix issues, solve real time problems that impact business, it is up to each employee to grab that opportunity and make the most of it
- Loads of transparency, communication reaches everyone and great care is taken about this. An environment that appreciates frankness which can be mis-interpreted as being rude, but honestly I'd rather take the bluntness over talking in the air.   
- Great commitment towards the society and can be seen through the Feeding India program, the UCO recycling initiative and HyperPure business

They stress a lot on the word ownership which simply means be ready to sacrifice your personal life in general. Even on that one weekly off you may have, you are expected to be absolutely active on your phone/laptop attending to internal issues/queries and/or client related issues. 

No job security whatsoever ( In the vertical I was working for at least ) 

Sheer lack of product structure and process. Almost never having a definite answer Sales and Account managers are constantly to change the way of working.

Your opinion never matters:

The company time-to-time engages you in some fun activities, free lunch and snacks and this company is best for Sales or Marketing folks, you will be rewarded moolahs for even 'just existing'.","I worked with Zomato for over an year. Now some people out there may be seeking some ""challenging environment"" thrills and if you're planning to join this company with that passion, mind it, your passion is up for a major toss. This company will never ask you to punch in or out and if you enter a minute later than 9 or try to leave before 7:30, you're are next up for a one-on-one discussion with your manager. The work load is crazy and a major imbalance b/w your work life and personal life is inevitable. The canteen food can make you sick, that is, if you even get time to have a proper lunch. I wouldn't ideally recommend this company to any of my friends. For sure."

Once you have found that, this concept of 'work life balance' really loses importance.  That doesn't mean it isn't important to disconnect and recharge your batteries. As human beings, this is extremely important in all aspects of our lives.  However, I don't think the solution is to 'work' in a role where you merely clock in/clock out each day.

- The culture at Zomato represents transparency and positivity. People are extremely approachable and ones views and opinions are always heard. When we're spending a minimum of 8 hours with the people we work with, we need to ensure we feel comfortable and happy - this happens pretty organically here. 

- It's interesting to see the how every step taken by Zomato is to reach closer to it's vision of providing better food for more people. It's not just a statement that is formulated to build its identity but its what guides all Zomans. Everyone here works towards it, and we can see that from our varied initiatives and business verticals.",Can't think of many cons but I feel building processes and making sure we stick to them is very important - discipline needs to be ensured at each step of development.

1363,Zomato,Amazing company for techies,2019-01-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Zomato runs on the fuel of culture. It places high stress on ownership. You may have two yrs of experience but you would get opportunity to design systems from scratch and manage/maintain them. CEO/CTO is directly accessible for any discussion, any problem solving. Best part, CTO leads by example.

Having said that, Zomato is not for everyone. If you are used to getting tasks from your seniors, solutions explained, heavy process mgmt run by seniors and project managers, you will struggle here. Zomato places lot of emphasis on ownership and introducing processes only if they are absolutely essential. So there are discussions between engineers and then every one owns their deliverables. Engineers commit to timelines and everyone comes together to deliver it. You don't have product managers for backend API systems so you have to determine your own contracts, design, request/response etc. So you own your own success and mistakes. If you make bad decisions, your systems suffers in the longer run making you inefficient.

Devs write code, test it, get it peer reviewed and then it is pushed to production. No QA members (some teams have set up CI/CD so that helps) so you have to test your code. If you feel that repeated testing is slowing you down, you have to set up CI/CD. Ultimately business expects execution @ speed. You have to decide how to give it to them. 

One of the values of Zomato is that if you make mistakes ask for forgiveness rather than blame game learn and move on. Business understands that if you move at speed, there would be mistakes. But they expect that you learn and don't repeat the same mistakes and put systems in place to prevent it.

One common thing amongst nearly all team members is passion for Zomato. Everyone exhibits it in the work be it highlighting product misses, sharing external feedback. Without inculcating that passion you may feel out of place in the company.","These are not cons but some improvements that need to happen in the company

Company has an experimental culture but because of this some businesses don't have long term thinking. So too many short term decision making mean that progressively systems are not built for longer term

As happens in any fast paced company, code is a mess and in order to work you need lot of contextual knowledge from previous devs. This slows you down but then you have ownership so you have to clean it/document it to make it better.

""Lesser mgmt"" philosophy has impacted some areas. People exits and transitions are not planned so there are systems where the developers have already left and you have  to read code to understand the system.

Virtually no one in senior mgmt to provide mentorship wrt design, coding standards etc but company is looking to hire so that should change in near future.

Company should now look to how to setup for next phase of growth. Those who have been around feel that there is no growth for them, learning wise, in the company, it is the same set of work in last three years. Hopefully with new seniors coming in, that should change."

- Gave a lot of new perks during the beginning of the launch (probably to attract potential employees) but after two to three months, 80% of the BENEFITS WERE REDUCED.

- DOESN'T DELIVER PROMISE. Expect 6-days work a week. Promised to regulate to 5 days 1-2 months after launching but after 1 year, they asked us to work for 5.5 days a week.

- Gave a lot of good perks in the beginning but in two to three months, HQ in India started to reduce 80% of the allowances.

- HQ in India are not willing to spend money to make the app more competitive in Malaysia. At that time, there were many startups and to reap in profits, you have to first allocate an amount of budget on marketing. But the HQ in India stupidly believed that the app was going to do super well with word of mouth (with around 20 and below staffs doing the free publicity). Sure enough, it didn't.

- Basically UNREALISTIC STANDARDS SET.

- After 1.5 years of launching the app in Malaysia and constantly assuring us that the app is doing well, HQ in India SHUT DOWN THE MALAYSIAN OPERATIONS OFFICE, LEAVING AROUND 20 LOCAL STAFFS UNEMPLOYED. Luckily they still gave us salary for the following 3 months, but honestly? WHAT A WASTE OF TIME."

3. This company is run by a gang of 6-7 people who all sit out of the head office in Delhi. They are an elitist group of people who think of their propaganda before their employees.
4. It is a very known fact across the company that they indulge in sick tactics where their competitors are concerned which includes planting stories regarding other companies.

1524,Zomato,Below Average Software Development,2017-09-03,2.0,Software Engineer,"1 Tremendous learning curve, both in terms of product and tech for the first six months (mostly for a fresher).
2 No count of number of leaves taken. Organization is mostly supportive if you have to go for long leave due to any urgency/personal work.
3 Ownership of the work is high.
4 Good people around.","1 Projects are handed over to tech, before the design is approved, and thus, iterations takes place after the product is ready to be released from tech. This is the time when the senior management doesn’t likes the product and asks for iteration. This is okay, but without giving extra time to tech to make the changes. During all this, it is the developer who has to spend sleepless nights just to get the product out on the previously decided timeline.

2 Non flexible timings : You have to get in by at most 9:30, until you get a mail from the senior management mocking, that pushes you to come as early as 8:30. You even may be penalized for not coming that early.

3 Poorly written and unmaintainable code. No design patterns, documentation followed and everything written is “public static” in a procedural way. This though is a repercussion of the fact that every product is shipped in hurry(hustle), and thus no one is given time to do it in a proper manner. People even think that there is no need to document for a product/code until it is sure that it will be working for the customers.

4 Alternate Saturdays working. This accounts for 24 extra working days(equivalent to an extra month) in a year.

5 Incompetent managers, who do not take the ownership of any bug which goes into production, and it is the developers who are asked to move out of the company.

6 Non-structured pay scale, salaries of elite colleges (IIT, DTU etc) pass outs are way more than off campus/lateral hires for the same job role.  7 No proper timelines of project, which leads to long working hours, thus not giving any room for a developer to enhance
his/her skills through work.

- Layoffs - a major layoff resulted in demotivated employees, they didn't mention the actual reasons but blamed employees for non performance. The actual reason as most people know is that they were running out of funds and they had burnt a lot of cash. They also employed a lot of people from overseas when they could have just employed local folks who understood the market better. 
- Lack of market research of the environment they were selling in. If something works in Delhi it may not necessarily work in Dubai. 
- Lack of perspective - Its one thing to be patriotic towards your company, its another thing to support every nonsensical or unviable idea just because you were one of the first few employees in the company. They have a cult like culture. 
- No work-life balance.
- Force you to sell products in regions/restaurants that clearly aren't the target market. If you are unable to sell, they think you're an under performer.

Do not work here! I started working here a few months after it opened. It started off great until I quit  6 months later after falling into a deep depression which I am still suffering from 2 years later. People are manipulated to believe that this is dream job! Lured in with free transport, paid phone bills & Apple computers. Its all a game and everyone is competing with each other, people are fake and will lie to get to the top. Everyone is illegally overworked, nobody is appreciated. It starts from the Management in India who are ruthless & is carried down to Management then staff. Its all fake, its all a lie. At a staff meeting everyone was asked to log on to glass door and write fake reviews on how its a great place to work and we would all get free drinks on friday night as a reward! (I was not one of the people who did that) We were manipulated in every way possible! Staff were given promotions and told to keep it a secret. Constantly being pitted against each other. You're basically told, if you do not want to work overtime, believe what they believe as a Zoman (as they like to call themselves) you can leave. I could go on and on......

- No dress code in the office.","- The MANAGEMENT (Delhi & Mumbai offices) are a bunch of useless know-it -alls. Product changes all of a sudden on the whims and fancies of the Delhi Senior management and the Mumbai management of course follows it with both the eyes closed. In the end the thing gets shoved down the throats of the junior sales staff who have to again and again explain to their customers that the product has again changed.

- Constant fear of being laid-off
- My immediate senior was a big joke. The guy could not close any deal and actually ruined a couple of my deals and then blamed me for them. 
- Too much Micro-management
- Working Saturdays ? Really? (officially every second sat. But the load of meeting clients makes sure that you have to work almost all the saturdays). Personal Life goes to ZERO while you work here.
-A lot of boot-licking goes on in the office.
- You have to LIE through your teeth to the poor restaurant owners about their monthly results.

For example, some leadership staff which have come from India and UAE, do not understand the Melbourne market and have a hard-sales approach which is absolutely not effective. This means that more often than not, the hospitality market is burnt.
Their temptation to micro-manage the staff has lead to many resignations and insufferable moments. 
Lastly, the processes between the Australian and headquarters offices are constantly under miscommunication. Admin staff in Melbourne are given incomplete instructions which take too long to complete, content team in Philippines are often contradictory and unhelpful and sales operations in India is atrocious.

Awesome product from a user's point of view that I still use it myself, and encourage friends to use it.","Zomato is probably the most unorganised company I have ever worked for. 

Training: 
Training was rash and unorganised, in which the training team remodified the training programs almost every week. It was good that you get to learn about the product and some useful selling tips, but you're pretty thrown into the field and expected to perform like a seasoned expert as soon as you're out of training. 

Supervisor: 
You'll be assigned to work under a key account manager, and depends on your luck -- you may get a supervisor that will provide all the support you need, or someone who will provide limited or no support. My team's KAM micro-manages the team, provides no support when individual team member requested the KAM's assistance, and blamed the team when targets were not met (not to mention the use of inappropriate language right in your face). 

Management: 
Constant micromanagement from India over Australia operations means not all strategies implemented (including human resources) are necessarily suitable for Australia. Management executives in India do not take into account the cultural diversity in countries other than India, and insists to run the same management model across offices in other countries. 

Work/ Life Balance: 
There is a certain flexibility to work at home if you have scheduled meeting with clients outside the city region away from the office. However, this is no 9-5 job because you are working with clients from the hospitality industry. Depends on your clients' availability, you may be cold calling from 6am and holding meetings on the weekend. Either way, you will be working long hours. 

Others: 
Never received any of my reimbursement"

To sum it all up:
- Zomato is a great place to learn
- Great culture
- People always ready to help each other",Some people in small market don't feel they are really heard and appreciated which makes it harder to get promoted and grow in the company.
1648,Zomato,Bastardising The Market,2016-08-15,1.0,Sales Associate,"My time in Zomato was great, the usual common denominator was the people, the staff in the Sydney office were amazing. It felt as if you were working with friends who supported you in every day rollercoaster that Zomato was. By was I honestly think Zomato will not have an office Sydney this time next year.","Management had two sides, one style management had University education and understood the market, commerce, business integrity and other forms of business. The other wheeled and dealed there way through their careers, which is perfectly fine and they deserve to be where they are. But that type of mixed management in an office causes little to no consistency in regards to strategy, market positioning and constantly changing ideas, changing direction and never sticking to it. Which showed a lot as from the outside looking in, that was the cause to the constant changes and a lot of office tension.

The excuse of “We are a start up” is one of the worst excuses ever, Zomato bought Urbanspoon for roughly 60 million. We just bought a database and nothing more, no start up can claim that they just bought a company for 60 million so please stop using that as an excuse. The “Its not a 9 to 5 job” is cool because it’s the hospitality industry which works around with long hours so doing the hours did not affect me but its something that needs to be highlighted in the initial interview process. But transiency, honesty is a concept that upper management still struggles to get a hold of. 

Now lets get down to the meaty bit (You like my food pun this one is for content team whoever is still working there). Return On Investment such a tricky grey area. In the beginning ROI was the deal breaker, the bread and butter, the knight in the shinning armour, this is where the “real” strength of Zoamato came into its own, but did it? In reality all that the platform provided was Impressions, clicks maybe if that, yes some restaurants got plenty of bookings through the dynamic Zomato phone number and it worked for some of my clients but fort some it didn’t."

1657,Zomato,The Hunger Games,2016-07-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Zomato breeds agility, only those with supreme powers to adapt to and accommodate change will survive and thrive.

As all other reviews state, the people at Zomato are the key asset to the business. They are intelligent, driven and enthusiastic. They’re eager to learn and are craving training and development to up skill and further them in their careers. 

The ASM’s that remain are dedicated and have a stron rapport with their teams. New BDM’s or KAM’s looking to be engulfed within the crazy world of Zomato would be truly lucky to be mentored by them. 

If you’re in Marketing you’ll become a multi-tasking King or Queen and learn exactly what you love about certain elements of the Marketing mix and other elements that you despise. If you like deep sea diving this is the workplace for you, you'll be thrown in the deep end and commanded to swim (without flippers or a life jacket might I add).","Zomato is kind of like the Hunger Games, you need to fight to the death for success, then once you succeed, the blood, sweat and tears you’ve put in to kick goals are irrelevant as you’re thrown into another match. Zomato induced me in a state of workplace bipolar. You can love work one day and go completely rogue the next.

Whether you put in 200% or 20%, you receive the same recognition. I put in far too many hours and learnt this the hard way. Strategy changes within seconds and months of hard work becomes obsolete as the allure of shiny coin syndrome strikes again and again. I really hope this changes for the two Marketing girls who remain as they are working really bloody hard.

You can have an opinion, just be sure that it isn’t too strong that it bruises the egos of those in charge. And whatever you do, don’t ever challenge anything, challenging means you’re being negative and going against the almighty values that are set upon you. By all means, show passion, but only be passionate when speaking optimistically about the company, Zomato is no place for a realist.

Marketing is void of any guidance or leadership, and seems to be immune to addressing the fact that there are no real KPI's or incentives to reach targets

For me personally, I grew tired and completely disengaged. For the sake of food, you could say I was a rare Zomato steak, ready to hit medium-rare and thrive. Instead, Zomato chose to keep me on the fry pan; the company burned me beyond repair."

1660,Zomato,The worst company I have ever worked for,2016-07-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Honestly, the cons were so saturating that I can not think of one pro. 
The company was constantly calling itself a start up, it wasn't. We slaved away while new processes were constantly being rolled out and then scrapped within 24 hours. Too many chefs in the kitchen. One of the worst companies I have ever worked for.",Too many to list because the whole business model/structure is flawed. The culture was toxic.

Do not even think about working here.",2016-06-23,1.0,Business Development Associate,"Met some amazing and unbelievable talented people at the start, mid 2015. My first managers were great leaders who actually had something to offer in a mentor sort of role who taught me a lot.
Friendships that are still continuing and contacts for future employment are at a premium.,","The place is an absolute zoo. Originally the place was a buzzing hive of activity in mid 2015. Although shortsighted, the recruiting was on point with an array of different talent from different places making up a harmonious workplace that was an exciting place to come in to every day and learn, work and achieve. Unrealistic expectations and poor management coupled with no recognition to high performers and below par average salaries turned the place in to a fractured office where the first generation of employees, self declared ""first gen"" became jealous of the newer people achieving greater results. Office culture became undone which was the first step of an incredible six months slip in which saw the company go from 140 employees, to now an odd 40.

Pay - you earn more working at McDonalds. The HQ in India don't understand how expensive it is to live in Melbourne, it's rectified when you ask for a pay rise. Adding 5k to my salary was the BIGGEST deal ever and took three months to do so after performing highly.

Unrealistic expectations, added by all the good managers leaving due to Big Brother in India watching over their every move led to poor managers, especially from overseas, one in particuar from New Zealand, being appointed and having absolutely no empathy or general social awareness. This one persons team is now almost gone due to the fact the manager couldn't take on any criticism as it was always someone else's fault that targets weren't met. They may know everything about the product, but if you don't know how to manage people you shoudn't be put in a position of power - mistake number 1 when trying to rebuild - tick. Mistake number 2 - getting a  bunch of 20-25 year old, arrogant, non worldly, over privileged Indian staff from headquarters - tick. The ability for these people to know the local market, which is extremely fickle, was always low. Bringing them to meetings sometimes was an EMBARRASSMENT due to the way in which they operated.

The product is an absolute joke. There is no correlation between successful  campaigns and investment. Having to go to clients and talk to them about their crappy monthly statistics and then have to try and get more money out of them, completely ripping them off didn't sit well with many people. Charging a take away joint in the outer suburb $700 for online advertising that no one views - day light robbery.

Career progression. Hey, you might get promoted to an Area Sales Manager role, but don't expect to be reimbursed until 6 months later after you've proven yourself. At this point in time, there's no point doing it as the joint won't be around by the end of the year."

You get to work with the best sales team ever! This company has the best of the lot when it comes to sales, these guys can sell sand in desert.","The leadership at Zomato Hyderabad is pathetic. The Area Sales Managers are naive, arrogant and inexperienced. None of the Area Sales Managers have worked any where else except in Zomato. There is no motivation at all, they suck the blood out of your veins and leave you out to die. The managers are ""yes men"" and may be thats the culture thats set in Hyderabad. You have to be very close to your bosses in order to survive in the company. Performance is given the last priority when they decide to fire you. Its a dishonest culture thats prevailing currently. 

I worked at Zomato for close to an year, i can say with authority that the company has no vision at all. They dont have a plan. They just hire a bunch of folks and fire 90% of them within a span of 6 months. The worst part here is, everybody is proud about this. ""Hire Fast, Fire Fast"" is the motto across Zomato.  The entire power is vested with the city head and he can use it the way he wants without any discretion. To sum it up, its going to go down the drain soon enough. Its destroyed lives of a lot of people."

1668,Zomato,Worst career move,2016-06-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The Sales team not inclusive of higher management.  The sales team are so driven and motivated but it's wasted talent at a place like this.,"The most unprofessional, poorly run company i have ever worked for. The  higher management have no idea what they are doing and make decisions with no thought process or consideration to customers or sales, who are having to go continue to be beat down as Zomato's brand continues to become the most untrusted digital platform in Australia. You are forced to lie to customers about results, India where HQ is, lies and will not actually show results of where searches are coming from, and they change the prices on customers and zones with no reason or justification. They use  fear management  on all sales members and management to try to pull unrealistic results from the team just based on no other reason but investors want their money back. They lie to the team and hide things important to team members because they don't have the guts to face the team with the reality that Zomato is going down in Australia, and that once again, they have made a poor decision. The amount of times commission structures were changed without notification or warning was ridiculous and unethical.

 HQ sends 20 year olds from India to ""fix"" the problems when the reality is they have no idea how to operate in Australia or how to abide by the laws within the workforce, if you want to complain they don't accept anything you have to say or support you in difficult situations, instead senior management try to avoid confrontation and basically blame HQ. Zomato management expects people on 45k a year to part with sometimes up to $600 worth of travel expenses and doesn't pay it back until 6 weeks,  and that is if they want to pay you. Pay is not always paid on time and there is no communication or warning in regards to what is happening until you arrive at work and complain and then, only then does senior management admit that pay are delayed. The worst of all is that senior management loves to gossip and spreads rumours about everything they hear with sales members, then have a discussion with everyone else about bullying and rumours spreading.  The best part is all the bad decisions made and customers that cancel are never ever because of their poor operating of the business or strategies , it's always the sales team who is to blame. They take no accountability for any mistakes and continue to say they are a ""start up"" to justify their poor business management. 
This will be the worst career move you make so don't make it."

That is if there is nothing urgent going on(there is always something urgent going on). Even taking a weekend off is a problem. Working on Saturdays is mandatory.

1674,Zomato,The worst job EVER!! RUN for your sanity!!,2016-06-01,1.0,,"Pros
• My co-workers are generally nice & decent people. I think it’s also a function of the local leadership who I think really cares about me. Jerks are not welcome here
• Great product","Cons
• No trust to local management. This company is very India-centric. They would send hordes of Indian all over the world, thinking they know the local market better. Imagine the kind of money spent on flying all of these people around. It could have been invested for operational or marketing activities
• Very centralized. The CEO, Deep,i still runs this company as if it was a 20-employee India-only operations
• They LOVE micro-managing. If you love having someone breathing down your neck all the time, this is a place for you.
• They don’t value people as assets. People are dispensable like an old underwear. Hire and fire policy is very much alive
• In short, the leadership is TERRIBLE. Deepi, especially is RUDE. If only he shows a little bit of compassion and empathy… If you want to see how brazen he is, just Google him. What you read in the news about the guy are all true. And that's how he runs the company too.
• There is no work-life balance. They’d ask you to do your work during regular work hours, and PLUS demand you to do more in your spare time (holidays and weekends). For example, I was asked to interview people on weekends. Trainings are also done on weekends. Our office manager was asked to shop for office equipments also on weekends, because doing it during regular office hours was considered a waste of time. Before you know it, all of your weekends are gone! This is in addition to long work hours. Ask yourself if this is worth it, no matter where you are in your career!
• They get rid of people without any respect to local labor laws. They’d pushed people out and asked staff to resign themselves. I think these staff need to get together and hire a good lawyer to drop a class-action suit against Zomato!
• They have no planning at all! One day, they’d rent a huge office and the next day, they try to downsize it and ask for a refund from the building. No.. don’t blame it on the changes in business conditions. It doesn’t change THAT fast. The same goes for their spending spree in the US. How much money went into that? And Deepinder got the balls to say publicly that it was worth it because it gave them access to Australia and NZ markets. Oh dear, who was he trying to fool?!
• They seem to have difficulty getting funding. I think some of the investors are getting wary and started to realize the true value of the company and the incompetence of the management. Google HSBC’s analysis on Zomato. As an ex-insider, I agree 100% with their view. Read also online how Zomato’s CEO reacted to that analysis.
• Their previous CFO quit after only being with the company for less than a year. I'd start asking some questions about Zomato’s financials too...
• Check this out too: in the course of 6months, more than 50 people quit (or asked to quit) in our market! There’s gotta be a story behind this flight of talents
Deepinder is surrounded by incompetent people who just suck up to him like there is no tomorrow. Interestingly most of these are women, and they are called internally as the Witches of Gurgaon. They gossip and would target individuals they dislike to be pushed aside. If you want to survive there, cling yourselves to these women and don’t cross them ever. They are vindictive and have a long memory. They will appear nice in front of you, but would stab you in the back the minute you let your guards down

I would rate this company, the CEO and the management 'minus' if I could. Unfortunately Glassdoor won't allow me :P"
1675,Zomato,Get new CEO,2016-05-27,1.0,Business Development Manager,Bunch of colleagues that were honestly amazing. Perks of knowing restaurant/nightclub owners. Timings are flexible. If you are in to excessive and unnecessary drinking then that'll be a pro too! App is useful for finding restaurant info (reviews are all made up).,"Low pay. Incompetent senior management. Banner ads we were selling were hugely over priced with little Roi for customers. So I was basically selling something I knew wouldn't benefit the customer. And the prices were constantly changing, usually going up. Cashless, table booking and delivery all failed. Constant lying. The Ceo says something today and will say something opposite a month later.  Even investors dont know the reality. Company is losing so much money they have to fire staff. Only way to be secured about job is to suck up to mgmt and say things like when you go to the moon you dont ask Nasa for weekend off!! Actual good work doesnt matter here."

Freedom to Choose Attire: Zomato is pretty liberal in the way you dress up, as long as you are doing your work, no one is bothered
Work directly related to market: For most of the people, their work would start reflecting soon in real life which is good - for others not so much (Backend analytics etc.)
Letting Go is a common phenomenon; I am writing this in pros so that people who have been let go don't feel bad since this is a part of ""Zomato Culture""","Claims to be a startup: Zomato is atleast ~2000-2500 employee strong and blaming all the things which are not there to them being a ""start up"" doesnt either solve the problems or is even a good excuse
No Planning: If you enjoy not having to know whats happening next, this might be a ""pro"" to you else, you will go mad working for one thing which doesnt go through and then running after another
Lack of communication to the working level people: Senior management (aka Founder) makes some decisions and communicates after everything is finalized which means you'll come to  know either when entire world is spreading rumours or if you are involved in it being busy getting your role changed.
No value of employees: Zomato has a ""Hire Fast Fire Fast"" policy which literally translates to ""Hire Fast without putting in any brains - realize that candidate doesn't fit in or we don't have enough work for the candidate - make some lame reason and fire the person""
""Zero"" Role of HR: HR is there only for processing payrolls, absolutely nothing else.
No Culture except Work, Work, Work: Founder does want to inculcate some culture which is given a try in the communications which happen but its more like ""work more"" or ""be prepared to get bad news""
Role Change is frequent to meet ""Organizational Needs"": You can be given ANY role irrespective of your experience/education etc. which can be either very good or can be very very bad and when you want to change it, you'll be responded with a standard answer of ""organization needs you so manage"""

Met some cool people who were fun and smart. A good bird's eye view of how Indian management likes to operate but thats it.,"Horrible management practices, if you can call something that changes week on week to be a practice. Hq. in India is terribly self important. The arrogance starts with the CEO. As managers we were expected to buy-in in to any nonsense they fed us and then pass it on to the KAMs and BDMs. Since traffic did not increase as they expected but our prices did returns for advertisers became limited. But hq. and investors don't understand and want quick money. Beg or lie but get them to sign!! The sales team felt frustrated and most performers left early. Such an attitude might work in third world countries but not in Australia. The brand is mostly ruined and restaurants don't want to even speak to Zomato. Pity the guys still out there and trying to close a sale. Wouldn't be surprised if there are law suits filed against the business. Many unhappy customers / employees. Very bleak future for it at least in Australia."

The atmosphere used to allow you to get a lot of experience in different areas really quickly but that isn't much the case anymore. Depending on the team you worked with, you could have absolutely amazing mentors.","The cons far outweighed the pros:
- Office became hyperpolitical, where you would get passed up for promotions or better projects if you weren't a brown noser. 
- The work became routine and boring. Even if you expressed interest in doing something else and you were capable of doing that, getting a chance of reassignment largely falls on who you know. 
- There is 0 work life balance. You are expected to eat, breath and sleep Zomato. There was a lot of down putting if you chose to take vacation time. Even taking a weekend off was highly frowned upon. There were plenty of people who would end up working on Sundays as well. 
- For being in an environment where you're realistically working 60hrs plus, your salary rarely matches that. 
- Transparency is lackluster, and communication between higher management and the rest of the employees winds up mainly relying on who you know. 
- Struggling business model: Zomato began as an online ad space and developed their transactions based model later. While that is helping bring in revenue, it isn't exactly king as people make it seem. The HSBC report that downgraded Zomato recently brought up fair points and honestly aligned the company better in a sense of how valuable it was. 
- There is absolutely zero organization, with things changing on the whim of higher ups. Often it felt more like it was being run by a bunch of capricious children being given unlimited funds without any hold on them."
1682,Zomato,Good for Experience; Bad for Mental Health,2016-05-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"-The ground-level content teams in every city I've been to were great and there was always a good chemistry. Because the teams suffer through a lot together, they were able to build a great bond and learn to support each other. Each city's team consisted of mostly hard-working individuals who have great personalities and sense of humor. I've built great friendships from working at Zomato.

-You get a lot of opportunities for grabbing experience and to travel. You do a lot of things that normally wouldn't be in your job requirement, which forces you to grow. My advice: think of a job at Zomato as a short-term gig. Go in and quickly get the experience you need as a launchpad for a real career elsewhere. But don't invest too much time or get attached. This way you can be in and out without affecting your mental health.","-Local upper management (the operation team) in most cities was mostly a joke.They don't understand the teams they were supposed to manage, whether it's the sales team, the marketing team or the content team. And they also don't understand the Zomato product because they are out of touch and don't ever interact with the end-users or the clients (the restaurant owners). All this equals to bad management. They don't know how to handle the local market and teams, but they are desperate to prove themselves to India. 

-The management in India doesn't know what they're doing. Their business method might work in India, but it doesn't translate to Australia, Europe and North America. The way these continents conduct business is completely different. You cannot force workers at these places to come in on Saturdays and expect them to be happy with it. We don't buy into the ""Zomato is elite"" attitude that's been forced down our throats. We know the users and clients have more (and better) choices. We just simply won't drink that Kool-Aid. 

-It's a joke that they still think they are a start-up. You know what this means? It means they are cheap and won't shell out the money that's needed to keep the business growing steadily. It also means they expect you to work 10-12 hours a day, six days a week. Great work-life balance there. 

-One of the values of Zomato is Transparency.  Maybe they're using this term ironically, because you can expect to have no transparency at all. Most of the information is on a need-to-know basis, and basically almost no one qualifies for that basis. They don't value their lower-level employees to let them know the truth about the direction of the company, new projects or changes. 

-Zomato is one of the most disorganized companies ever. For a company with over 2K employees, they're still using Google Sheets to organize tasks that essentially build their product. They also don't develop solid business plans before starting new projects. Most of the time they don't know how to achieve the end goal. It's almost like they think they're smart enough to wing it, but they really are not. Take the Urbanspoon acquisition and North American launches for example. Nothing came out of that except for clogged toilets thanks to all the money they flushed."

1684,Zomato,My truth about Zomato,2016-05-12,2.0,Operations,"The people are the best part, but most sane people leave in frustration, get fired for speaking up/disagreeing with senior management, or get laid off due to poor financial planning. This turnover does give you a fantastic opportunity to take on a lot of responsibility you might not be given elsewhere. The management also likes to move people or gives the option for you to move to different functions somewhat frequently, which is good if you like trying new things or get bored easily. You establish really close relationships with your colleagues because of how much you experience together, not just in terms of time spent together but in terms of what you accomplish and witness in a (almost decade old) startup. Everyone is naturally hardworking and like minded in ambition and millennial values. If you can wear blinders and focus on just what you need to do, you are certain to accomplish a lot.","Most of the people who have been around for a long time and have the authority to speak up don't do it. I'm not sure if this is just an aspect of respect in Indian culture. Maybe it is that they have tried and tried, but they know it doesn't matter what they say. Regardless, when the CEO's advisors and leadership team are all ""yes sir"" types, bad business decisions are inevitable. The guys on the bottom whose managers can't advocate on their behalf are left with the brunt of the work and reality of the market. The company is good at hiring smart people at all levels, but they don't know how to manage these same people who ask questions and make suggestions. The management assumes they know better and then at times treat low level employees like robots. It is really painful to watch a brand you love and work for waste opportunities."

The company has issues on all levels right from HQ in Delhi down to ordering stationary in an office. Not your usual issues as well. Higher management often twisted truths to the point of lying, all the while quoting how amazingly 'transparent' they are, yet practice the complete opposite. Practice what you preach, is the saying that springs to mind. Having management manipulate targets, figures and projections was almost beyond believable, but nonetheless this was a normal occurrence. Which begs the question- are investors receiving factual figures? Also, the business practices are very questionable. I do not know of any other company but this one, that has contracts so weak that any client can leave without any repercussions whatsoever. Once again, this happened numerous times. How can you be sustainable as a supposed $1billion company (*$500mil according to HSBC now). I guess the icing on this disastrous cake was the fact that mass redundancies occured due to the most idiotic business management I have witnessed. The company even admitted to having taken their eyes off revenue and growing too rapidly. I myself was told that I need to resign and when I stated this was illegal, I was told that they will find a way to get me out and dismiss me. Why? Because a person in management was told in full confidential confidence that I was considering at looking to leave. Bearing in mind that within 4 months we had gone from 72 in our office to less than 30. We had a person or more resign literally every week since the start of this year. The place is a graveyard."

- Local execs, although smart, very bullish and close minded. We could have been successful without advertising if we were given the green light to reduce prices to REASONABLE levels. 
- Technically, the local execs are probably why Zomato didn't work out in Canada. Outside of the fact that HQ in India handcuffed us from products and marketing. 
- Compensation was a joke, every other tech company in the country pays more for less work.

Macbooks :P","- Absolutely no career direction: You receive a half-assed response if you seek it from your higher ups.

- Jobrole is a joke: Anyone with half a brain could do this. The ""challenge"" with this job is mostly the unnecessarily long hours and trying to give yourself a good enough reason why you're doing this.

- Favoritism / Politics: You're completely overlooked if you don't kiss your seniors' bottoms.

- Very short-sighted

- No transparency: Changes in the product, or even the internal tools, were the kind of things you would see randomly out of nowhere, no imitation given whatsoever. Sometimes even my TL didn't know wth was happening.
Also, being in a city office (i.e. not the HQ), my higher ups had no real knowledge of how things are in the city offices and feedback was purely based on word of mouth and their distant judgement of you and your work.

- No security: I worked here for years before being let go, out of the blue, without any notice / clue whatsover. I was told I'm great at what I do but things are changing (""as you know, we're a start-up and we're evolving to bigger things"") and me and my working style are not a fit anymore. I was asked to serve my notice period during this conversation, but then told ""So today is your last say"" the very next day. So in a window of 20 hours I went from ""no care in the world"" to ""no job"".
Also, fun fact, every single feedback cycle, even the one a month before being let go, did not at all mention me being a dis-satisfactory employee. It was always ""keep up / great job, could improve time management / fine-tune proactivity but overall great work"". (Feedback by the same people who decided to let me go).

Hierarchy is a joke: Salary packages and promotions are not consistent (amongst peers) and there's no protocol to measure this. Only the higher ups know how these work.
The promotions were based on your seniors' discretion and feedback which was purely in the form of people's opinions of you. If you aren't pally with your highers ups, you're doomed.
If you didn't get a promotion you were expecting, and you questioned about the same, the answer was ""We'll take it up next cycle, dont worry"".
At the same time, your feedback said everything is hunky dory.

Low Pay: This is a joke (if you're in Content)."

Came into melbourne guns blazing and as a consequence have completely burnt most restaurants in one way or anyther. As a salesperson you are given leads which have been called 10+ times in 9 months. No opportunity to realistically hit numbers. Commission rates are a lie and never written down for you (means you're going to be lucky to see anything). Expenses claimed are never paid in full. Huge office feels like a ghost town because all the staff have left (made redundant or resigned because they saw it coming). Sales staff mostly paid $45k or less, told they can earn heaps but never will because targets are crazy and leads are all exhausted. Promised reviews and pay-rises when we interviewed but this has been completely finished. Good luck getting a raise even if you're great at your job. Most managers call meetings at 8 or 8.30 and then you're expected to go to client meetings after hours like at 5 to 9 pm and sometimes later. Everyone especially BDA's (junior salespeople) works more than 38 hours a week (which is all you're paid for).

Check.","We all like to hear about the pros but sadly, this is where the fun part ends. The product is great for users but unrealistic for most business owners.  As a user it's a great platform for research. Most restaurant pages provide updated information including menus, reviews, contact and even an estimated cost for two. For cafe owners and restaurants, its sadly the opposite. The product was not offering a real solution but instead, it came off as ""money hungry"" and greedy. The prices are skyrocket high with no actual guarantee of ROI or real customers. There have been instances where business owners have laughed in the face of Zomato employees because they are so outraged at the price and offering. Now that's mildly embarassing. Acquisition and renewal teams were trained to keep pushing even when the product was unlikely to work for certain businesses. This burnt relationships and tarnished the image of the company.

You'll get to meet incredibly hard-working and talented people, who are trapped in a dead end job.","Product - 
There are little to no viable leads left, as they've beaten the city dry. You'll constantly be told you're under performing and not giving enough when you can't perform with the 10 viable leads you have. You'll be asked to go to tiny cafes and restaurants hardly breaking even and ask them for entry level banners starting at 700$ a month, when they can't even afford it. Huge cost to commit to a cost to when it guarantees sweet nothing. 

Client success team constantly under pressure trying to retain unhappy clients who are getting no traction. They want out, they've most likely been sold the dream by some poor sales person who was to scared to go back to the office when they've had a bad sales cycle, and now this dream is crushed by the reality that the prices will never give ROI. Sales management got greedy, they made prices too high to support the ridiculous expenditure by the company and now no one can actually afford the banners.

Management -
Where to begin. Do you like being yelled at? Sworn at? If you ask for help, would you like to be put on a performance plan instead? Managers will constantly complain about their own team members loudly in front of staff - these messages float all around the office so everybody knows everyones business. There are very few ASMs who actually know how to conduct themselves as professionals and keep their team properly managed and motivated. Managers constantly reveal private information then act shocked when it gets thrown around the office as public knowledge. If management is in a bad mood, the whole office is; ripple effect. 

Expenses
Never in my career have I been asked to go out of pocket to up to $900 just to get to meetings, mobile data, office needs; because the company does not provide their own cards. They've hired a bunch of 20-somethings who are dipping into their savings just so they can make it into meetings to get their work done. Expenses are rarely paid on time, if ever. You can be left in the dark with no idea if you're being paid or not because theirs no formal procedure on how to actually be paid. 

Constant dishonesty seems to be a reoccurring theme. You'll promised all kinds of growth, potential to learn, and grow in your career. No. You'll take about 8 backwards steps and pray that the next company you interview didn't see the hit-and-miss marketing Zomato attempted.

New commission structure every week. Very little people making target, those who are have been given warm leads. Very hard for new people to prove themselves/make a name for themselves because all their doing is sweeping up the mistakes that other sales members have made. 

Training wasn't great either; felt sorry for anyone who hadn't been in sales before. Sink or swim, most are drowning."

Too many changes and mostly bad ones made from India HQ which didn't suit other markets. Absolute 0 career investment/development. Stupidly long and unproductive work hours/culture which leaves intelligent staff becoming burn out drones. It's not a start up anymore so stop pretending it is to cut corners. HR system is a mess.

1760,Zomato,Zomato is the one to watch,2016-01-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Despite reading some negative reviews - and honestly being disappointed with the negative comments written by former staff, Zomato has gone through an immense growth spurt in the last 6-8 months in Aus.  People do not realise that every business has a teething period, and it isn't always going to be easy - you need to work hard as a business and as an individual within that business to succeed. 

The team is an absolute Pro - the staff and culture of Zomato is very community based and the team is Sydney are an absolute asset. The sales team, content team, marketing staff member, management and sales support are an incredibly hard working bunch of people who are determined to see the business grow and succeed in Sydney. When it is challenging they are all supporting each other without fail. The product itself works, and the teething period I mentioned above has made any recent changes in strategy and also services on offer more successful and stable when it comes to business growth. 

It is a place people should want to work and a company you want to be a part of, I think in 2016 it will become a market leader and the hard work being put in now will pay off.","In comparison to 6 months ago, budgets are tighter when it comes to office supplies, team building exercises, team functions etc which was an adjustment to staff. 
The sales team is also facing challenges when it comes to their leads - the market is more saturated then it was during the initial start up phases.

You do not get paid your expenses, if you catch a taxi or an uber you will not be paid. You HAVE travel to your meetings on public transport with an OPAL card. 
HQ does not care about the customers, basically they want you to rip off you customer and get as much money from them as possible (in advance) whilst not actually providing a valuable service."
1762,Zomato,Let good sense prevail and NEVER join this company!,2016-01-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Great product (including the discovery tool and beyond!) and lots of good talent (at the base level),"The only saving grace about Zomato is that the product is fantastic and they have a knack to seek out and hire good talent. Their product is what has lured a lot of middle management and senior management to join the firm. And obviously the salaries that they can offer on the back of investor money.

However, it's all downhill from here. The top management is the pits - Deepinder Goyal, frighteningly sharp is also frighteningly deranged. He hires and fires people at will, with little or no explanations given. Constructive feedback and two-way discussions don't work here. Everything flows from top-downwards and even senior talent has no room to challenge any decisions taken. People who do have the gumption to challenge are either shown the door promptly or quit in frustration. They completely discount your past work experience and treat people with even 10+ years of experience as minions. The churn at the middle and top management level is appalling to say the least. The only people who can survive here are 1. A group of yes-men who joined the company at the inception and have grown through the ranks quickly, often with limited to no talent and experience 2. People in their first job who are willing to suck it up and make do with a poor work culture and horrible working conditions for the brand name. 

All the bad press that they have received is completely true and justified because every single printed word is true. The most appalling part about this company is that even with the bad press, the so-called top management has become even more brazen and egoistical. They haven't bothered to fix the situation, instead they are blaming 'errant' employees and media houses for the same!

Anyone with 3+ years of experience - please don't even bother! There are many brilliant start-ups out there who could do with your talent and work experience."

This company has little to no idea on what it is actually doing. 
To begin with, the CEO still believes that they are a 'start-up'. A company that has been around for almost 10 years, is no longer a start-up, and therefore you cannot blame all your mistakes; for example, expecting to bring in the same or more revenue in all countries, despite their vast differences in culture and economy.
Then, when ridiculous promises to investors are not met, send an email out to every employee single handedly blaming them for said results.
You are expected to do everything yourself at this job. You're given a week of training, and then expected to get out there and sell thousands of dollars of overpriced advertising that doesn't do what is promised.

Growth- Promised opportunities for growth but their lack of planning ended up costing them to let go of many employees, and it just shows that they didn't plan well."

1791,Zomato,"Over promise, under deliver",2015-11-11,2.0,Content Associate,"- The local teams are very good people - intelligent, hardworking and committed

- The working space is relaxed, no need for suit and tie, and there's free food regularly delivered

- You can take the work laptop home (so long as you return it)","Zomato treats its entry level employees very badly, having intelligent graduates do monotonous jobs for long hours whilst not investing in them to grow professionally. It's a waste. As a result, staff retention rates are abysmal - I was the second longest serving member of my team when I left, and I was only there for just over a year. Middle management often promise the earth, but end up doing very little for their employees. This can be attributed partly to not being kept in the loop by the Indian HQ and partly because there's a knowledge gap and they aren't able to train employees. 

Hours are very long, 8:30 AM - 7 PM minimum, often later and almost always creeps into your weekend. Managers are bad at managing this workload. 

Communication is poor across the organisation, especially with the HQ in India where functions like HR and Finance are based. Additionally, senior management is very poor at communicating changes, taking and giving criticism, and motivating employees.

 If you need confirmation of their arrogance and disregard, search for Deepinder Goyal's (CEO) email to his sales team which was leaked to the media. This was ultimately the final straw for me - I didn't want to contribute to that man becoming more wealthy."
1792,Zomato,"Avoid at all cost! Do not apply for this company, do not respond from recruitment and if you're already employed, run!",2015-11-09,1.0,,"Not many pros to be honest only pros would be meeting a minority of intelligent, hard working individuals who could do so much more with their careers if they left Zomato.","Where to start.

It begins with selling the role.
Zomato tell you how great the company is by selling you this dream culture, you get tools of the trade, great commission structures, opportunities to travel, training and career progression. 

Lies. The culture is far from what is to be desired. The place is a complete zoo, absolute joke and here's why.

No dress code policy so ultimately females are wearing low cut tops, stomach/abdominal areas showing, mini skirts and denim shorts. When addressed to senior leaders the response was ""nothing we can do"", ""if you have it, flaunt it"" and ""no policy"". These people represent the company and they're out meeting clients with more than half their body bare. There is a fine line between smart casual and beach/clubbing attire.

Unprofessional behaviour by staff but most shocking, senior leaders. Examples include sales head asking if candidates have children saying he prefers them not to, he also talks openly about his team to other staff members.

Now time for tools of the trade. What they ""forget"" to mention is that you actually have to use your own money for transport (cabs, trains, uber, etc), mobile phones and Internet hotspots. At the end of every month you can claim all the incurred cost by a system and then the great part is you have to wait nearly another month to be reimbursed yay! Oh wait, the fun part is sometimes you don't even receive your expenses after months and have to send up to 3 emails to your manager, the national office manager, maybe the hr manager or the office assistant (you just don't know because there is no clear communication in place). I've known people to have been out of pocket because they had to wait 6 weeks to be paid and in the mean time they would have to burn through their savings due to using their own money for transport or even calls. Commission is quoted differently from other people. Sometimes you don't even receive your commission. (Side note, if they can be bothered you might even be lucky enough to receive a monthly payslip).

Training is usually up to 3 months in more establish organisations, at Zomato it's one week and then see you later, go get a sale. The product is online advertising space. Hmmmm overpriced banner ads for clients to give them ""exposure"". Clients pay up to $9000 a month to be visible to Zomato users, no guarantee of extra customers just exposure. Poor sales staff are so pressured by sales targets that they have become unethical and sold these advertising spaces to clients who they know will not get any benefits from the product. Eg: selling a $1200 ad space to a small cafe in the city which probably only profits under $1000 per month after bills and wages. But again no ethics, no care for the client and the sale leaders only cares about banners so don't even bother telling him you were trying to be honest. 

Opportunity to travel interstate was given to some people but also taken away while they were in the other state because of poor decisions expanding into the Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide markets too soon. Potential employees and current employees were told during May - August that the company is doing so well they're expanding interstate, only to be told that all operations in those states have ceased months after.

Career progression is out the door, the company is broke and won't be able to provide pay rises. Staff are being made redundant across the globe and what's sad is that they have forecast the restructure months before notifying staff. 

If you're looking to join the sales team  think again. Products are useless, favouritism is what will get you off a performance plan and being told from the ceo that you are pathetic will definitely motivate you! If not, don't worry weekly sales meeting involve numerous swear words from leaders. Oh and if you like working long hours, APPLY NOW!

If you're looking to join content, you'll be one of the hardest working teams and the most underpaid while working long hours. Not to mention the first team to get cut (facts from Zomato global redundancies). Due to head quarters being in India you may have to work at night to accomodate the time difference <-- this also applies to sales admin/support team too.

If you're looking to join recruitment please remember that you have put in the hard work to hire, grow the team and then head office will tell you that the recruitment strategies are to blame for operational inefficiencies therefore thanking you for the effort in volume recruitment but Bon voyage because they need to reduce costs. But don't worry the company got what they needed in hiring numbers so you can leave now. Okay thanks bye.

I had a lot of faith in this company and believed it could have grown into an organisation like Google. Due to poor decisions made by India Zomato Aus is going down and taking its employees with it. I urge you to stay away from this nightmare.

Fun fact:
Employees bought toilet paper, spray&swipe, paper towels, salt, pepper and tissues with their own money because there is no office manager and no process in place for something as little as office supplies.

We were also told to move furniture from one office to a new office, paint the office and build furniture because we are 'zomans' when in reality the company was too cheap/broke to hire tradies."
1793,Zomato,Horrible,2015-11-06,1.0,,Fun for a bit and got a Mac but they ended up letting go of over 300 people.  It seemed to good to be true and it was,Everything I felt betrayed as a person to be let go in such a cold way. No warning or reason just letting go an entire country's worth of people.
1794,Zomato,100% done with these con artist. STAY AWAY!!,2015-11-05,1.0,Content Associate,The only pro about Zomato would be the great people I became friends with on the content teams across the US.,"Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time working for this unethical company. Read all of the negative reviews on here and realize all the positive ones are fake/scripted because they're having a PR nightmare.

Not only does the company lack transparency but they also will lie straight to your face. Either the management is highly incompetent and can't do a basic financial forecast or they intentionally mislead over 200+ new hires in the US. Looking back it's obvious they had no intentions of keeping the content teams long-term in the US after we finished all of the legwork launching the major cities.  They didn't even acknowledge letting go around 10% of their company either publicly or privately, it's like we never existed to them. Shows their true colors and company culture.  

Brags about being a 'billion dollar' company but when team members ask to rent a booth at a festival to promote the company via field marketing gets shot down by higher ups because it's not in our budget.  They claimed the reason they let go all of the US content teams was because they weren't getting enough traffic to generate ad space sales like they anticipated.  How did they honestly expect to break into the US market with established competitors like Yelp without doing any kind of  marketing?"

To any potential/prospective candidate that has the luxury of reading this message pre/post your interview please take my advice. This is not me venting or wanting to retaliate, it is simply a business that has NO care factor for their employees.

Further to the above, if you want to work for a business that does not pay you on time or pay your expenses... then join Zomato. 

Heard the saying ""thrown in at the deep end""? if so, be prepared to drown...you will not be SAVED!

Management posses zero vision for the future or grasp on reality. In my training, I was told how terrified Yelp, OpenTable and Groupon are that Zomato was going to put them out of business. When I went out on my own, I quickly realized no one had heard of us (or was interested in yet ANOTHER app at this point in their phone storage), and I was stuck trying to sell a product that couldn't even perform basic search functionalities. 

The apathy with which almost 200 employees were laid off is astounding. I didn't even hear from my direct supervisor until almost six hours later, and at no point did he say, ""I'm sorry"". And in a memo to the remaining employees, not once did the CEO take a moment to address that there even were layoffs -- just a supposed change in strategy -- and he happily signed it, ""Cheers!""

Finally, there was absolutely no structure or accountability in place. There was one senior manager whose employees openly said she wouldn't answer any of their emails, and only spoke with them twice in three months. I was one of the lucky ones, and I spoke to my manager maybe twice a month."

I truly enjoyed working with all 20 of my coworkers; it's rare that you find a group so cohesive. Also, working for a food company is enjoyable because it's relatable and tangible in a tech industry that's often not...everyone loves to eat, so it's an easy thing to get behind. Pretty good benefits as well.","No office, just a coworking space which we were scheduled to move 3 different times in 3 months. Terrible organization. The leadership is unaware of how to effectively spend money, so they get a lot in funding, tell us we all don't have to worry about our jobs because we're well-funded and secure, and then boom, less than a month later they realize their ""strategy for the U.S."" isn't working and lay off the entire US workforce, around 300 people. No warning. In hindsight, it's clear that Zomato lacked the necessary leadership and business savvy, and they were simply bleeding cash.

- Really shocked at how manual everything is. Everything is done with people thrown at them, not smart technological solutions. This is a technology company?
- Very short-sighted and apparently can't do basic financial projections - in the span of less than a year, Zomato bought Urbanspoon for ~$50 million, then hired 200+ people in the U.S., then laid all of them off and completely retrenched. Couldn't have figured any of that out earlier?
- One of the recent blog posts tried to spin a negative NPS from employees into one where only the ""hardest working"" people could work at Z. What that really means is people work and are expected to work INSANE hours.

1815,Zomato,Zomato = Horrible place to work,2015-10-17,1.0,Content Associate,I seriously can't think of one good reason to work at Zomato.,"Simply put, Zomato takes advantage of people. Their business model is to open in countries with depressed economies and little to no labor protections so they can underpay and overwork their employees. This why they failed in the U.S., and it is why they will fail in Canada, Australia, and the U.K. The CEO/Found, Deepinder Goyal, thinks he can run his business like a sweatshop in Mumbai. But when he has to pay decent wages and conform to labor laws that protect employees from being abused, he falls flat on his face. In January of this year (2015), he spent sixty million dollars to purchase Urbanspoon so he could gain a foothold in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the U.K.  Urbanspoon was a much beloved and profitable company with millions of users. Within the span of less than nine months, Deepinder ran it straight into the ground. Tough lesson, kid.

Zomato is a sinking ship. The Urbanspoon debacle looks absolutely terrible for Zomato and seriously calls into question Deepinder's business savvy. Investors will take serious note of this epic blunder.  The well will run dry soon and their plans to make money are naive and unrealistic (nobody is going to buy their idiotic ""white label"" app. It's utter rubbish). If you currently are employed by Zomato, the clock is ticking. Get out now while you still have a job.

So cliche. 2 cycles of declining employee culture surveys, and Zomato execs tried to spin it as a positive (even posted the spin on Facebook). Zero direction from leadership. The execs in India (if they stay around more than a few months, article about this too) keep things very hush-hush and there was no leadership in the US from VPs or TVPs. No transparency in Zomato. For example, things on the tool (internal systems for updating information on website) would either be broken often, or something would be added or removed with no warning or input/explanation. You had to ask why, and then wait a day with the timezone change. There never was a clear direction how to move up in the country (career-wise).

1830,Zomato,Crazy,2015-09-09,1.0,,Crazy amount of work to do,"A lot of inefficiencies. A lot of do this and that from one extremes to another. No budgeting, no control. A lot of waste."
1831,Zomato,Not at all good,2015-09-04,1.0,Content Associate,"The management is really bad, for them you are slaves and they can use you anytime and can ask to do anything at any point of time, if you denies for any of the thing, they ll make your life hell and at any point of time they start firing people giving silly excuses, just for cost cutting. I have an experience of 3 years, here I worked for 7 months and this was the worst job I had.","Management is bad.
Work environment is not good.
Nobody listens to an agent, they just listens from seniors.
Your job is not secure at any point of time in this company.
They do not pay the notice period salary."

1833,Zomato,Not for Lateral Hire,2015-09-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The company is good for freshers and young professionals. People ready to live in office and spend most of their time in it would enjoy it the most,"The company cannot be called a startup anymore. Startup is used as an excuse to disguise inefficiencies and unprofessional attitude. While the company preaches open culture and the office seating arrangement would depict that, but reality is completely different. Senior management is completely unapproachable. It's my way or highway... that's the attitude. No insurance, No leave policy, No benefits (free snacks are not benefits for some), no work life balance, Saturday's working (not officially though), No HR processes."

1842,Zomato,"It's not for everybody,but it's been my dream - Australia",2015-08-04,5.0,,"Work culture. I feel like everyone I work with at Zomato is a friend of mine. If you are career-driven and want growth this is the place for you. 

If you are looking for a basic 9-5 where you tick along and do a 'job' this is not for you. If you are looking to challenge yourself, get involved in cross-department tasks and grow with a company that challenges the norms, the tremendous amount of opportunities at Zomato will give you all the tools required.

I have recommended Zomato to a lot of my friends with most of them applying and getting through.","I have no personal cons for working at Zomato. If you are after a basic 9-5 however, this is not the place for you."
1843,Zomato,STAY AWAY (Australia),2015-07-29,1.0,Key Account Manager,They'll make it seem like a dream job. The bright office (Melbourne) is full of bean bags. All staff receive a brand new Mac book air and get their phone contact paid for. They'll promise great commissions and fast acceleration. DON'T BE DECEIVED.,"This company is a joke. They're knowingly breeching Australian workplace law and copyright law and they don't care. New staff members must engage in some serious binge drinking as an initiation (literally having spirits poured down their throats). The job titles mean nothing - sign up as a business development manager, and you'll really be a junior sales assistant. Management is a joke. You must work exactly their way or that's it, you're out. They give zero feedback, zero opportunity to improve. They are never honest with staff. The commission process is shrouded in mystery. During interviews, junior sales staff are told they'll be making $20k commission annually. So are senior managers. But there is no clear process for how that is actually awarded. The CEO (India) is actually proud that the company has a 25% staff retention rate over 2 years. Just 25%! He says it shows they have such high standards that only a few people are able to meet those high standards over a long period of time. Wrong. What it shows is they have a serious culture problem, that only a fraction of new hires can bare to stick it out. Look at the company reviews from India - if you think Australian workplace law will protect you from that sort of rubbish happening here - you're wrong."

1855,Zomato,Get Ready,2015-05-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Overall: 
The ride is awesome.  If you are interested in sitting at a desk from 8-5 and then going home, this is not that ride.  The US hires will be in start up mode for a while and we are all wearing a few different hats to get things done.  

If you want something that is very consistent and bland, I urge you to apply somewhere else.  If you want to do something fun and exciting like start up the US operations of an already global organization, come be part of this.  Every position we have posted demands some outside the box thinking and working.  

Benefits:
Company pays 90% of the Medical costs and only passes on 10% to the employee premium.  You can have a PPO medical plan for $100 a month.  Company paid Vision/STD/LTD/Basic Life Insurances.  3 weeks of PTO in the first year.  

Compensation: 
Fair market compensation for all positions posted. 

Growth:
Personal growth plans exist for all hourly level positions.  Personal growth in salaried positions tend to focus on success in the role and impact on the business.
Company growth is underway and the only missing piece is great people who care about doing a great job.","This type of environment is not for everyone.  I am sure at some point in my life I'll want something super consistent and predictable.  But that's not me, not now."

The management of the company is incredibly ambitious, and that shows throughout the company.

- Heaven for perpetual learners and workaholics
- Less protocol, more freedom
- Transperant culture","- Too many culturally unfit (hence dissatisfied) employees
- High rate of involuntary attrition
- Younger team = Lack of maturity"
1858,Zomato,Content Associate,2015-04-29,3.0,Content Associate,"They give like $30 USD each day for your daily expenses and food; you also get to learn a lot and embrace efficiency as a key factor on a daily basis, everything is based in english and the fact that it is a pretty international team, makes you understand others cultures and ways of working.","The working environment it is really Indian, it does not balance work/life and if you are slow they will soon kick you out, it is pretty stressing at times.

The seniors who believe that they are the only good working people, will make you feel that any busy can reach the top level, if you are ready to sacrifice your own private life. They hire people in abundant, then throw you out when they know that nothing can be done with you. First they give you a weeks time, and make you work like donkeys. And when you deliver the work more than expected, they fire you at the end of the day by  taking the days work i.e at the end of the day. And 12 hours working in a day....on the average day. Imagine that."
1864,Zomato,Best learning experience anyone can have,2015-02-11,5.0,Key Accounts Manager,"- You're given tremendous responsibility, so it's for you to try to shoulder it in the best possible way
- This process really separates the boys from the men
- It's still functioning like a startup - high energy levels , which means extremely high paced growth
- It's a value-driven organization
- Haters will always hate","Most people are doing things for the first time (even the CEO is a CEO for the first time), so some mistakes happen sometimes. If you can't understand that, you aren't cut out for a startup. Nothing against you - you're probably awesome, but not for a startup."
1865,Zomato,It was a good experience working at Zomato,2015-01-11,3.0,,"1. Good infrastructure,
2. Good food
3. An opportunity to work with some of the best minds in the industry
4. A Global Brand with a presence in 60+ countries ensures that all we get is good amount of growth.
5. Your seniors tell you not call them ""Sir"", instead they treat you as peers provided you work well and don't just come to the office for time-pass.
6. The culture at Zomato is very impressive and hence is very helpful for our growth. People are friendly and help you work in a much better and productive way.
7. Excellent growth opportunity because it's a startup & if you work really well then you can reach the heights of success within LITERALLY- A short span of time.
8. Fun at work but no fun WITH work!","- Improper shift timings: We know the time when we need to reach the office,but we don't know the time when we can leave. This applies also to the girls. It's not at all fixed!
- Too much work load and no space for people committing mistakes even for the first time... i.e Intolerance towards errors & not giving opportunity to improve.
- No incentives for working overtime. On an average we work for 12 hours a day and during launches it's even more.
- Parties? Well yeah... once in 3 months (Maybe)
- No privacy
- A culture of firing people too soon! Ever wondered why the Zomato website says - ""We're Hiring"" for all the 12 months?"
1866,Zomato,Best start-up company hands down,2014-12-24,5.0,Business Development Manager,"- Fun
- Young culture - feels like you're working with friends
- Lots of opportunities for growth and advancement - you get out what you put in
- Hard work and success is encouraged, recognised and rewarded","- Long hours - you can leave at 5pm, but if you want to grow and advance you need to take initiative and go the extra mile, i.e. late nights
- Balance - you need to actively work on maintaining a work-life balance, and yes, it is possible

2) Young crowd to work with, hence ensures fun at workplace.
3) CEO has a vision","1) Very very very low quality of work. If you want to ruin your career, this is the place to be. Except sales no good profiles are available. 
2) They make graduates from top colleges do a copy paste job. 
3) Peer quality is very low and there is no learning watsoever. Makes it difficult to switch.
4) Salaries are so low that you will starve.
5) Erratic working hours and no set expectations"

- The culture is fantastic.
- The product is amazing, working on improving it is genuinely fun.
- A lot of room for growth.","- Start up, so that means long hours and not an exciting paycheck.

1876,Zomato,Erratic!,2014-04-20,1.0,Anonymous,"Lot of young people, recently out of college which makes me feel comfortable as I'm also one of them.
High attrition- so you can refer your friends & get a bonus ;)","Erratic - that's how I'll define working at Zomato. Work & management plans are decided on the fly, no proper planning. 
There's no one who encourages your work here, are you doing well or not - no one tells! Besides there are just a couple of seniors in the team, most of us are freshers so learning is restricted. No one here cares about what I learn, what only matters is the outcome. 
I read a few articles on the internet & newspaper talking about the 'flexible work hours' policy, still don't know what that means. The top management including the CEO keeps a check on the entry & exit times of employees.
Zomato also publicises about having a chef in office who can cook various cuisines on request- yet to come across the cooks who'll take my request! (It's a small, regular canteen, nothing more)"
1877,Zomato,The company had tremendous potential but it lacks a work-life balance and hence i was not satisfied while working here,2013-12-12,2.0,Sales and Marketing Manager,Tremendous growth potential if you are very career oriented.
