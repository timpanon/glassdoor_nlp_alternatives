Didn't find any.","There is lot, if i will start writing it will take approx 10 days or more.
1. Lies start with the first day of joining, In offer letter leave policies, it was mentioned as discussed with HR. HR said 1.5CL and 1.5 PL. as for all Employes.
But after 3-4 Months I got sick and applied leave for 5 days on Portal and approved. Finally Salary day came. I had received a Salary with Deduction. After enquiry HR told 6 Month Provisional Period and you can have only 1 Leave/Month.(BIGGEST SHOCK).
After that i had asked for previous months leave. They told Leaves will be collapsed after every month. What a ....
This was the First Shock.
2.
3.
4.
You sholud have to ""Chatu"" For approval of Leaves and any ather  work.
Else your leaves will not get approved and your approved leaves get canceled.
Managers dont care how typical situation is there for you.
They Dont care if someone got admitted to hospital and and Dead.
May be Your Best Friend Wedding, even if you have informed senior management 1-2 month Before. Your approved leaved got rejected.
And the .... Replay from managers==>>
""Ask them to change the date of Hospital Admition, OR Dead OR Marriage""
Now You Guys only think what type of Managers are there and what type of Management is there.
The Same Day I had Resigned. And Resignation Approved - Next Day Releaved.

:) Really Happy...
.
.
.
nth. This is the Last Shock.
While Resignation They had told for 40-45 days for Complete Full and Final.
Its almost Many months has gone, they are not able to complete my Full and Final.

FINAL CONCLUSION:- Dont try To work to hard, as many people works 12-14 hours a day.
Just Work  for Hours mentioned in Joining. and follow the Joining Letter Terms.
and if some thing Miss happens, Just axcillate the Matter and Mail to all and dont forget to keep your Personal ID in CC.
Because You Office ID can BE blocked Any Time."
