4,Zulily,Poor leadership - no funding - poor growth,2022-03-16,1.0,Engineering Manager,People can do essentially whatever as managers often are spread so thin they can’t focus,"- Reorg done without any input
- so much tech burden that it takes ages to do anything- but people only care about delivering “new”
- HUGE attrition on the order of 40-50%. Each week further people leave and leadership has no intention on investing to solve this.
- product essentially does whatever marketing & merch want unquestionably- and Eng is treated as disposable resources to shift projects at their whim
- terrible bonus due to continuing decay of the user base
- stock is in free fall
- everything is tied to QRG and all compensation goes through them who don’t care about decay brand so no funding or resourcing to tackle any challenges
- every team is over burdened and burnt out leaving poor communication and no sense of a turn around
- even best people get “successful “ - leading towards further mediocrity"
5,Zulily,poor managment,2022-03-10,2.0,Maintenance Technician,benefits and frienship between employes,upper managment show very low respect and understanding of hard work employese

Upper management straight up does not care. Benefits ""adjustments"" were made a couple years ago and requests to bring things back have fallen on deaf ears.

3 weeks combined PTO / sick, very below similar companies in the field.

Piss-poor sales last year translated to horrible bonuses."

11,Zulily,Great Company!,2022-02-17,5.0,Executive Assistant,I love the culture at Zu. Everyone really cares about you and helping you grow. The PTO is good and ramps up the longer you work there. Life-work balance is really the major plus.,Benefits leave some to be desired but overall it's a good company and I think the culture and work life balance cancels this con out.

18,Zulily,Management in Disorder,2022-02-07,3.0,Digital Marketing Specialist,You have a lot of freedom at Zulily to shape your own position. Coworkers are generally supportive and helpful.,Zulily has suffered greatly from the Great Resignation. So many director level employees have left and it has made things very difficult. There are always changing expectations.
19,Zulily,"Fun projects & great team members, but consistent turnover",2022-02-07,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Best team I’ve ever worked on with open and friendly management 

Great health insurance options with low deductible options

Love the wfh benefits! I’m tired of companies with a butts-in-seats mentality but so far Zulily hasn’t implemented any in-person requirements. Hopefully they don’t go back on this!","Leadership is facing some turnover right now which is unsettling but so far it hasn’t directly impacted project goals for the year.

Most teams are shrinking right now due to turnover, but I think it’s more of a result of the Great Resignation than anything else."
20,Zulily,Good company culture,2022-02-04,3.0,Recruiter,Leadership does a great job of fostering a positive company culture and putting employees first,Compensation leaves much to be desired

22,Zulily,Love zulily,2022-01-31,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"Literally everything. Management is great they really care about their employees. Zulily is like a family, everyone is willing to help, guide and educate you to be the best. They are involved with their employees and truly love their customers. This company is best that I’ve worked for this far! I just wish my position wasn’t seasonal this company is a great opportunity especially to move up!","Only con is the pay which that did increase from 13/hourly to 15. Also the call handle time should be longer. Majority of the calls are chatty women that love to talk and shop, and for us to keep them happy we have to engage."
23,Zulily,Great Place to Work!,2022-01-29,5.0,Warehouse Associate (Temp),"* As many hours as you can physically handle on the up-swing to Christmas
* Training came in the book, tool and racecourse runs. Perfect for learning how to do even the most complex jobs. You could repeat any class you wanted.
* Great lunchrooms - microwaves & gadgets, TVs, tables, and FREE Coffee, tea, hot chocolate, water and apple cider for the Night Crew
* Amazing vending machine dispensers for essential tools - box cutters
* Tons of fun giveaways throughout the season
* the Assembly line was brilliant and well laid out
* A moveable workstation with everything your heart could want for boxed shipping
* Fabulous Zulily employees
* SMX employees were gentle, carrying, and even did lovely ceremonies for Veterans with gifts and yes, I did receive a medal from my tribe for my service, but Zulily was the second nicest gift I've ever been given. I still have it, the photo, and the card they ALL signed.

* Adorable Robots
* Fun community pep talks and stretch sessions before you started
* And the DISCOUNTS, if you wanted to shop Zulily, were Totally Fab! If you saw it on the line and wanted the same item, they had computers set up for you to go buy it.

* If you made it 4+ months you got medical benefits

* Probably the BEST features they provided - outside their facility - were shuttles too and from the facility. They were so comfortable many slept on the way home AND 2 convenient pickup locations by major bus stops.

TRULY, I ENJOYED working there. 

You work hard, sweat a lot, but it was fun and interesting. At Christmas, I definitely felt like Santa's Elf, One box was truly fun to fill with mini-white boxes - like a jigsaw - and a plush toy kitten. I place it looking up like a surprise to whoever opened it. Little did I know that 30 employees were called over to see what I did and how pretty I made it for their customers. It was FUN!","* Warehouse sometimes got hot...but they were quick to make adjustments.
* You can't take your phone with a camera on the line. This is because the conveyor belt system is a trade secret. But even at my advanced age and techies found I had to buy a watch to tell time because I MISSED my phone
* If you took your phone/camera on the line, you would get fired
* While you could take lunch anywhere outside. However, if you wanted to smoke, you had to go into a caged area for fire safety.
* If you chose to drive, it is extremely dangerous due to wild mustangs roaming the country.
* Even though the shipping-prep desks were on rollers, they still weighed 300 pounds. I accidentally took them off the tracks 5 times and it took 4 big men to put them back in the groove. :)
* You definitely have to have your nutrition dialed in like a marathon runner. i ate - no lie - 1/2 a rotisserie chicken a DAY. Straight up, you must hit your calories and protein to do the job correctly and without getting faint or starving and losing weight.

* You have to protect your workstation from other, non-SMX contracted workers. Sad but true. Zulily and SMX great, others not very ethical.

* Also, sometimes 25 people would quit during a shift and you would still want to give Zulily your best and make up for the quitters.

* It was REALLY hard to go permanent"

I have a toddler so that was a challenge. Before the job became easier, I struggled getting assistance with calls. Some of the Tier 2 employees (Zupport) would keep asking me to research answers after I told them I already did. There were a few who were kind enough to answer.

Great co-workers,"Things have tanked the last few years when we started hiring heavy into ex Amazon employees to take leadership roles. These leaders pride themselves on total delegation (of everything) to teams but fail to realize, they are so far removed from internal processes and the very foundation of our business. Also, whoever thought spending hours on end on weekly doc writes, clearly doesn’t understand the pace of our business and how much stress the teams go through to run events at this frequency. We don’t have time for this. Simplify the process, return leaders to help in the trenches and get over yourselves. This company is losing people left and right. It’s widely discussed how Amazon practices are ruining employee experience. People work here because they don’t want to work at Amazon. Pay attention - people don’t leave companies, they leave leaders."
51,Zulily,"Toxic environment, leaders don’t listen",2021-11-05,2.0,Associate Buyer,The freedom to try new things,The culture has shifted to a high school or a classroom environment where the loud voices got all work credits.

The work/life balance is decent and the environment overall isn't all that stressful. Other than on call, I rarely put in more than 40 hours a week. You might put in more if you want to get noticed.

My experience with the (engineering) management was mostly positive. Don't expect them to stick around for long though.","Cons include uninspired leadership and an antiquated tech stack.

- improved efforts to better cross functional projects
- If you're lucky you'll be paired with a great mentor, I've been fortunately to have 2 - this is not true for all leaders in the company though","- COMPENSATION is ridiculously low for anyone lower than a Senior Position (Sr. Prod, Sr. Buyer, etc)
- Tools never work, they continue to build on broken tools that cause work blockages
- They're *currently* allowing remote work, but we don't have as much freedoms to work in outside states as other company counterparts 
- Execs seems to constantly avoid speaking on attrition rate its been constant for the last few years and not solely due to pandemic resignations"
58,Zulily,Failing Leadership,2021-10-19,2.0,Project Manager,"Zulily is the best place to meet people. I have met some amazing, creative, and smart individuals at this company! Zulily is also great if you want to grow FAST they will push you through roles. In the almost 4 years at the company I’ve had 3 different roles. Learned a lot.",Leadership never knows what they want. They promote individuals who are not qualified and have no experience in the department. There is a lot of talk and no action when it comes to actual process changes.

66,Zulily,"Great Place for Experience, But Quick to Burn Out",2021-09-05,4.0,Merchandising,"Great opportunity to learn multiple retail and ecommerce skills. Depending on area, peers are great people to have on your team. Ability to manage vendor portfolios and build your business. Opportunity to work remote for some roles.","Enormous work load, lack of support help and constantly changing directives. Upper management delegates tasks and projects down to merch team without concern for their current workload or bandwidth. People are burning out quickly and leaving the company. When surfaced to management, some listen, some don't and just tell you this is how it is and it won't get any better. 
Management won't acknowledge the issue, except to replace person who left. Recruiting, hiring and training process can take 6 weeks-3 months depending on how quickly candidates are hired. Many buyers have been without support help for months and expecting other teams to help, which adds to the burnout. We are bleeding people heading into our busiest time of year."

I'm working remote and getting used to the time difference between working with co-workers 3 hours behind.
81,Zulily,Keep this place at the bottom of your list,2021-07-29,2.0,Copy Editor,"Until this company realizes the value of their employees at all levels, they will continue to lose great team members, especially in the creative department.

Pros:
- one of the best teams I've gotten to work with. Great people, gear direct manager, no real complaints on that front.
-if you are based in Ohio they are fully remote for the copy team, no office to work at there. This is easily their only good perk.","-upper management suffers from a severe disconnect between the results they see on the site vs. the amount of grind and burnout it takes to get the site where it is every single day. They also have a disconnect on how little they pay, with the CEO once casually bringing up $200 jeans as though everyone buys apparel at those prices.
-the pay is a joke compared to the other retailers in the same city who offer similar jobs. Other places start at 20/hour minimum for copywriting, zulily started me at barely over 15/hour and I'm pretty sure it's not much better by now. Might as well work for target or Costco at this point since they're starting around the same pay and don't require a degree.
-no sick days. You must choose: longer vacation, or save up time in case you get sick.
-the level of responsibility and consequences for the merchandising team is not nearly the same as what's expected of copy. Merchants are able to ignore or rudely respond to our simple questions with no consequence from leadership. If the copy team acted the same way we would be reprimanded. This overall imbalance creates a somewhat hostile work experience for the copy team.
-whatever they tell you the goal is, expect to only do that for 1/3 of the year or less. Most of the time it's elevated. Why? Because people keep quitting and the company can't ever keep the copy team fully staffed for all the reasons listed above. The amount of work also keeps increasing. The team suffers from burnout on top of the low pay. Other places pay more for a more sane workload.
-there is not enough diversity on the merchandising team, leading them to try to push to sell offensive items with excuses like, ""this is a best seller"" or ""this wasn't an issue in the past"". Copy ends up having to possess legal knowledge, IP knowledge and cultural/racial sensitivity knowledge all while being underpaid."

When ""Scheduled Overtime"" is called, the Area Managers are still continuing to work their normal hours instead of being around every day their crews are supposed to work.

This situation creates discord in the teams that these Area Managers lead.

As has been mentioned before, Area Managers seem to be only interested in their team's work output, but not really interested in how that output is generated, and will not take an active role or perform the effort required to learn this so that they can manage their teams better.

It seems that the only reason that Area Managers are doing their jobs is in the hopes that they can get promoted to Operations Managers, who are just as toxic to the teams they oversee to the point that these levels of management are dysfunctional."

The female leaders in place are either just as toxic, or don’t have the voice and influence to enact a cultural change. 
This company has sucked the life snd happiness from a lot of people.

143,Zulily,dysfunctional and not worth the drama,2021-03-19,2.0,N/A in Marketing,"- IC level employees are often amazing and you will form genuine relationships
- Lots of people really care about what they are doing","Over the last few years, most of the leadership team was replaced with ex-Amazon employees who all operate with the same cut-throat and dishonest mentality most of us purposely avoided by not working at Amazon. So if you'd like half the pay and benefits for 100% of the drama, this is your spot.

PAY and BENEFITS:
- Most orgs outside of tech do not pay market rate or level people appropriately, particularly in Marketing, Merch, Studio
- Benefits are subpar, particularly for mental health, and PTO is not good at all
- We were not given any additional PTO during the pandemic
- They only let us WFH when it became mandated due to COVID. Their version of WFH expects everyone to be on video calls for 6+ hours a day which is fatiguing and intrusive to pandemic home life (particularly for those of us with children at home)

CAREER GROWTH:
- Very little training or onboarding happens. Employees are expected to sink or swim, on many teams.
- Promotion paths unclear
- IC roles are constantly redefined, workloads drastically increase, with no change in job description, title or salary.

DIVERSITY:
- Not enough women in leadership roles outside Merch
- Diversity and inclusion program seems to really be more of a PR play than anything, people are asked to film marketing videos to say how great it is here instead of asked how to improve the circumstances of working here. It would be nice to see the authentic changes before marketing campaigns go up..

OTHER NOTABLES:
- PIPs are common and designed to usher people out and meet quotas, rather than help people improve, a la Amazon
- Company culture encourages gossip and negativity over constructive feedback and support
- Many mid-level managers gatekeep to control the narrative, to the detriment of the work and their teams. Unnecessary games of telephone and gaps in understanding what should be simple is pretty commonplace. 
- Reporting issues to HR goes nowhere, and often makes things worse.
- Meeting culture is bad. It was heavy before COVID, but now most ICs average 6+ hours of meetings every day, are expected to execute their real work outside of that without additional pay if they are salaried and you will get messaged at any hour by management. Sister companies have No Meeting days, but Zulily has yet to adopt that.
- Most ICs feel insecure in their position, largely due to a history of leadership not being upfront about coming changes.
- There is no centralized process or tool for much of anything outside IT or Facilities. Everyone seems to be winging it and only focused on their own team, with poor communication beyond that bubble. This makes collaboration harder than it needs to be."

The better you do the more they want - but you get nothing back. Maybe a raise but not likely. No bonus. Definitely not a promotion, even if you hit all of your deliverables year after year after year. You give and give - work 10+ hour days and the work/life balance continues to be nonexistent due to the things that are continuously added on top of an already full plate. If you don’t get everything done then you are looked at as not capable of doing your job well. There are ‘fires’ every week and you get added asks and tasks that need quick turn around on top of trying to execute and do your daily job, it can get exhausting and there isn’t a why, there aren’t enough hours in the day.

Consider your options with competitors carefully.

- Good pay
- Relatively flexible hours
- Seems to be great for beginners and bootcamp grads
- The kind of job that's not really hard at all to just get by at with good pay","- Very poor vacation policy: it is metered, and not dispensed when you leave
- The work environment has a very fake ""supportive"" feeling. You can tell it's fake because if you push them enough on any issue you will see that they're really... _not_ supportive in any way.
- There's a lot of traditionalists who make many aspects of the company feel quite old and deprecated
- Heavily junior focused. If you are senior, you might find yourself on a team with 4-5 junior engineers with nearly free reign, leaving you to kind of pick up the pieces.
- Poor code quality standards. You will see things here that will make you do a double take (related to the above)
- Culture often rewards arrogant behavior that make it a not fun place to work. I've had people explain how the library _I_ wrote _to me_ without an ounce of irony. If you point out someone is verifiably incorrect about something, they will often gaslight you and say that you, and every source you bring, are actually wrong. It definitely doesn't help when these individuals could have significantly less experience than you while making such bold claims
- This kind of arrogance and free reign combined gives a feeling that you're herding cats. You really can't get anyone to agree to do anything in a consistent way. Alternatively, you get a feeling of people fighting for control to do everything their way."

It’s better to deal with the irate customers mad because Zulily takes months to deliver items for which they already paid than to deal with the annoying managers. Also, low pay for the work. You have to be tech support and CSR. We can’t tell customers how to operate their phones when we can’t even have our phones near us. And manadatory overtime."
212,Zulily,Great for Career Growth,2020-07-29,5.0,"Program Manager, Analyst, Project Coordinator","I came to Zulily after having been passed up by the company I interned at simply because of my low college GPA. Luckily Zulily did not ask me about my GPA. Given all of this I came in with quite a chip on my shoulders eager to prove my worth and prove my old co-workers wrong. Zulily gave me this chance. Many of the employees at zulily have a relaxed west coast work mentality so if you prove yourself to be a hard worker that is eager to learn you can find opportunities to advance your career. I started off a a project coordinator in vendor ops, moved to an analyst role in customer Finance, to FP&A, and to finally a program manager role in marketing. This all happened with less than in 4 years at the company. I highly doubt that I could have gotten this much career development and diversity at many other companies. It was truly a wonderful experience and I got to meet a lot of great mentors along the way. This experience was exactly what I was looking for.",The major con at zulily is salary. For me this was fine since I was at the start of my career just looking to get some experience for my resume. That said many of the great employees you come across eventually leave as soon as they have gained the knowledge they were looking for and are offered more money else where. I really was sad when I told my manager I had accepted an offer but the truth is I couldn't justify staying at a company that is paying me 80k when another company is offering me 100k in a city that has a slightly lower cost of living. Lastly try to avoid the merch org. Luckily I was never a part of it but most of the negative sentiment on glass door is from former merch employees.

The VPs will force you to work on tickets and bug fixes, and she(/he/they) will get really mad if you look at data and suggest some meaningful changes. She (/he/they) had a couple of favorite PMs who will run around, reporting dissent who will later be publicly disciplined and shamed. If you are a manager and this gang find that you have some independent opinion, they will ""push you out"". 

All this is when the company is going through severe revenue drop, pre-COVID. To me this is plain dishonesty."
221,Zulily,A lot of misery and very little pay,2020-05-29,1.0,Copy and Print Associate,A lot of the people there were really nice.,"Pay is far below the industry standard. Management across the board are passive-aggressive and slow to respond. A caste system is in place that rewards negging. There is no pride in work that is fussed with to this extent by people who just want to put their fingerprints on things. There is no real room for advancement since even managers there are just basically retail managers at an off-brand dollar store. I mean, who wants that job?"
222,Zulily,Ask the right questions when you receive an offer,2020-05-28,2.0,Software Engineer,"- Nice people
- tech education budget $1900 per yr
- you'll have a $1000 equipment budget for your first year of employment, which isn't much because it's not vested in 5 years
- Sounders sponsorship, so you can get good tickets for cheap","Company policies are a way less than ideal.

I'm going to take this space for the candidate who's interested in working at Zulily:
Ask the right questions before you accept their offer. Here's what I found during my time here:
- Company doesn't give yearly bonuses
- You'll have to pay for healthcare from your own pocket, it'll be literally deducted from your own salary. And the amount you pay for it changes based on how healthy you are.
- Ask to review the ""Employee Handbook"". You'll see the that you won't be able to quit your job immediately because there will be a lot at stake for you to peacefully leave. Employee Handbook states that you can quit your job any time you want to, but you also can't quit it before saying you're going prior to 14 days.
- You can't cash in unused time offs, and you can't use them during your last 14 days of your employment
- The company's 401k contributions are vested once a year, which is the beginning of the year. You will not be eligible for those contributions you've worked for the year unless you stay until next year
- your sign on bonus is vested in 2 years (this is typical especially with Amazon as well)
- you are only eligible for stock awards after 3 months of your employment date and you'll have to wait for a year to wait for your stocks to get vested, so for your first period of vesting is actually 15 months, not 12."

225,Zulily,Zulily: Not even once,2020-04-30,1.0,Software Engineer,"Waterfront location, Sounders tickets, work/life balance","No one at Zulily cares. There are no code reviews, no design docs, no tests, no best practices. All management cares about is having a feature out when promised, doesn't matter if it's riddled with bugs.
In my first couple weeks as a level one engineer, I was able to push changes directly to master without anyone batting an eye. I've seen interns break things in production multiple times due to the lack of guardrails.
The leveling system is meaningless. There's plenty of nepotism. We were very used to rolling our eyes at the promotion announcement emails. When I gave notice that I was leaving, my manager asked if making me a senior would change my mind (I had less than three years of experience).
As soon as I switched companies, I realized how much of a mistake it was to stay as long as I did. I am working nonstop to unlearn the bad practices and unhealthy mentality towards work that Zulily instilled."
226,Zulily,Friendly people and working environment,2020-04-29,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,Friendly people who supports each other. Work is chill and has decent level of flexibility on technical stack.,Since everyone is spoiled by Amazon's shipping speed. The long shipping window which is the inevitable side effect of the business model scares customers away.
227,Zulily,"I mean, it's a job.",2020-04-13,3.0,Product Copywriter,"This is a super job for fresh college graduates. Not all of my coworkers were that young, but I was worried about job prospects and was unemployed for a little while after graduating college. From my perspective, it was refreshing to be in the Zulily interview and for people to recognize that I wasn't a worse writer than others just because I had no full-time professional writing experience.  Too many companies turned me away because I was ""less experienced"" than the person who graduated a year before me, and having Zulily come in and say they liked my writing ability was very confidence-boosting.

The pay may be way beneath industry standards, but I was still happy to have a job in my industry of choice (and frankly, I was still living above my means with what they paid me).  This is an entry-level position that seriously helped me with my transition into the professional writing world, which I'm happy to still be in after leaving the company.

Other pros are definitely the work from home, although I honestly liked my coworkers so much that wfh more than half the week and not getting to interact with them in-person more  was kind of a bummer. I appreciated the casual dress code and the (more) casual culture. My team leads and supervisors were spectacular too, some of the best leaders I've worked with from any job I've had so far.

Make sure you're working there during Halloween. They go all out for Halloween it's freaking sweet.","Okay so yes the pay is low. Nice for someone who's coming out of unemployment, bad for pretty much anyone else. 

Other than that, the work gets to be pretty monotonous. If you get creative with it, you can come up with other side-projects you can work on, but management has to approve it, which can take a while and still end in them telling you not to do it.

It'd be one thing if I got to take my time on a description and spend all day writing a few dozen descriptions, but no. Nope, it's a pretty high-stress workload. Some days are better than others: if you're writing 140 graphic tees, you can get your work done before lunch easy. But if you've got like, 80 technical footwear items, 40 jewelry pieces, and 20 watches... good luck finishing without going into overtime. It's a total crapshoot and you really can never predict how easy or difficult your day will be before you clock in. In contrast, my new job has me on a handful of projects that I can plan for and schedule out work for so I know how busy or slow the rest of my week will be. 

Also I didn't like working in a room with no windows when I was in the office :("

244,Zulily,Homelessness might be a better choice...,2020-01-10,1.0,Assistant Buyer,"If you are looking to get tons of experience working in a toxic work environment, this is absolutely the place for you. 

There are work from home days offered to full-time employees, but based on your team, as in your “manager” and “VP”, those can be taken away at any moment. They're used as a tool to try and get employees to work massive amounts of overtime. 

The benefits of WFH? You can use your free time to apply for other jobs. That's how most of us who left,  got to here, and can now finally write these genuine and completely factual reviews. 

The only is getting a front row seat to see how a company digs their own grave. From “leadership” placing blame on others to get ahead, and do whatever it takes to save themselves; to a work environment that used fear to generate results…This company is the perfect example of how to fail in the tech world.

But most of all, you’ll learn your worth. You’ll be thankful because you survived, and got here to tell the tale.","Where to start.....

The work environment was one where managers took credit for their assistants work, used intimidations to get employees to get projects done as quickly as possible, and allowed others to pester and tormenter others into doing tasks that were almost impossible to complete. There were complaints to upper management,  on multiple occasions in regards to the mistreatment of others. There was massive amounts of employees who were mistreated and disrespected on a regular basis. 

The workload was absolutely  insane. It’s instilled in us that to get promoted, you have to prove this by working a minimum of 60 hours a week.

Most assistants are shuffled from team to team, and told they’ll be promoted, and each move is dressed up as a new exciting opportunity, when in reality, it only will add stress and probably get you no where further to moving up.

From each team, there is a different list of new things expectations, new tasks to accomplish to prove myself. It became clear that most assistants are strung along, given false hope and promises. Some figured this out sooner, others aren’t so lucky and figure it out much later.

All in all, this is the worst company you could ever worked for. The high-stress and chaotic work atmosphere, lack of transparency from “leaders” who have no idea what they’re doing, insane workload, the extremely low pay for the amount of work being produced, horrible benefits, toxic work environment, and tyrant mentality, made the decision to leave this horrific company an easy choice."

The kitchen had really great crunchy ice.,"Zero work-home balance, you're not adequately compensated for the work that you do. You're expected to work after hours and on weekends. They've created an environment in which it is impossible to use the PTO hours you've accrued (by the time I left I had over 100 hours in both floating holidays and PTO with no options to pay out, no opportunities to use these hours - these were hours that I had earned and had them stripped away). This is a mean girls, toxic, forced fun office. I was in my first role for about two years, consistently leading in productivity and had to claw and scratch my way to a promotion. Speaking of promotions, you won't get one unless someone else leaves that role. And a raise or bonus, never. Rather than being compensated or rewarded for a job well done, you're given more work. There is literally zero path to advancement. Let's talk about the new CEO. In the beginning it was like a breath of fresh air to have someone younger and vibrant and it genuinely felt like a good fit, he seemed interested in getting to know the ins and outs of each role. Nope.  Nope. Nope. This approach was used to figure out who could be eliminated and whose work could be outsourced. Obviously the goal of a business is to make money. But the way in which this was done was disgusting (it felt like the Hunger Games) and the following day his attitude regarding layoffs was just flippant, insensitive to the fact that he just let go of people who had dedicated years to the company and its growth. As roles have been outsourced, merchants feeling  like they have no other choice, portfolios being moved to the home office in Seattle, it's clear that the only position they're planning on keeping in Columbus is customer service. There is zero collaboration between merchants and the studio team and marketing and PR, between Seattle and Columbus. The Columbus office is often treated like an afterthought and not receiving the same quality of anything. Don't expect to be working with systems that aren't convoluted and actually functional. With so much money and time being sunk into the development of these systems, work became more difficult, more time consuming. As a merchant, your entire work area will become overrun by samples. Samples from your vendors, samples from vendors that worked with laid off merchants that were never reassigned. I stayed with the company for years out of devotion to team members and knowing that putting my workload onto someone else would be a huge burden but after receiving another offer to be paid more for less stress and more recognition and appreciation. I loved the fact that we received paid time to volunteer (eight hours/quarter) but those hours were revoked, now down to one paid volunteer day per year and it had to be taken as one full day. The new rules around volunteer hours and workload/attitude towards doing anything other than being chained to your desk kept me from doing things like spending a few hours in the morning volunteering at the animal shelter, helping pick up trash at parks, and helping set up for events around the office. I realize this is a small thing but having those hours was a really nice gesture and made it possible to give time. I can't express this enough, please look for employment elsewhere."

Especially considering this role is basically on call 24/7 - you’re getting on at 8 PM, waking up at 5 or 6 AM on weekdays and weekends.
Growth opportunities are non existent - mostly due to favoritism. Don’t be fooled by the job description that says it’s meant to be a training role to become an Associate Buyer - this is rare and really only given to favorites of upper management. There is no clear growth path, it’s just luck of the draw.
Management is the main reason I left. They’re not properly trained to help develop the people that work for them. The most common answer when asked what you need to do to grow is I don’t know. There’s a lot of favoritism in management, and a lot of managers that shouldn’t be managers but will never get fired. I’ve met more unethical and unprofessional managers at this company than anywhere else I’ve worked. Bullying and inappropriate/abusive language is prevalent here.
In general, the company has no clear path or transparency for people to grow or even to voice their concerns. Those that deserve it are being overlooked for promotions, and managers aren’t trained to help us grow."

253,Zulily,TAKE OWNERSHIP,2019-12-11,1.0,Studio Associate,401k. Health Benefits. Direct Peers. PTO.,"Leadership: 

Almost no one in studio management comes from a creative background. Or if they do, the experience has zero relation to the department in which they manage. Leads who are supposed to be ""subject experts"" are young with no management experience and little to no industry experience. Leads are messengers for upper management and kept on a very tight leash. Example being that Supervisors sit in on image quality reviews. Babysitting and stepping in to conversations that they do not belong. 

Leadership shows up only to deliver bad news. Otherwise, you will not find them because they are hiding in conference rooms, achieving nothing. ""I finally have 30 minutes haha! (Watches Youtube).""

Day to day duties that are performed by Leads in Seattle are handled by ICs in Ohio. Leads are uninformed and rely on their team for information that they then turn around and use as if they are on top of their job. 

If you bring up concerns, you are labeled as problematic. Regardless of the solutions that you may also offer. Why? Because you are seen as a direct threat to how the show is ran. It is a shut up and shoot culture. Management favors a few and they push them up the ladder. If you are not part of their group, you will not succeed past your current role. Promotions are pre-determined. Bonuses are pre-determined. All to justify the inevitable. Promoting their friends. 


Company Culture:

Every few months, Zulily continues to find ways to strip joy from their employees. Examples being: Making photographers hourly from salary with no explanation, Cutting lunch from 60 to 30 minutes, Removing after hour studio access for personal development, forcing SALARY employees to track hours and makeup that time if they came in an hour late due to a doctors appointment, stripping away standard yearly pay increase (cost of living) and redistributing the money under a label ""Pay for Performance""...ultimately hurting a huge chunk of employees and cutting bigger increases to their favorite employees. 

Studio management does not support their team. Company creative is driven by Assistant Buyers (ABs) in Merchandising. Most of which worked at the mall before on-boarding in Merch. The majority of the creatives in studio have more experience than management and the ABs that dictate creative direction. SO...if you want to shoot the same products every other week and be told how to do it by someone who uses Pinterest for everything, Zulily is for you. If you want to try something new or cool, good luck. Merch will shoot it down and Leads will not back you up. Secondly, the schedule is so absurd most of the time that you couldn't even if you wanted to. 

Seattle studio hoards every strong portfolio. All major brands and quality product. An in-house wood shop team too. 5x the head count. However, Ohio (while shooting non name brand shoes from China with twice the workload) are being held to the same standards and are belittled when they cannot. ""LOOK AT WHAT SEATTLE IS DOING!!"" is something you get used to hearing. Killing your creative drive."

Also, they recently rolled out allowing 2 WFH/week. This was not widely embraced by most buyers, MM's or directors. In fact, out in the open on the merch floor directors and buyers were complaining. I think with a 40% post lay off attrition rate managers need to ease up on their controlling and micromanaging strategy. The new Head Merchant seems to be aware of how unhappy people are, but he's only gotten a mere glimpse of how actually toxic the environment is for assistant buyers.","AB duties include: curating events, negotiating costs with vendors, piloting markdowns,  hanging samples, organizing samples, managing multiple vendors and strategically finding opportunities to grow their business while simultaneously working towards reaching their buyer's monthly demand goals. AB's work weekends, they work every night and sometimes early mornings (before 6 am). AB's ARE PAID ROUGHLY $45k for all this work. The 2 WFH's that our Head Merchant promised, well sad to say that most buyers and mm's are making it near impossible for AB's to use them. This company keeps bad managers. They allow poor behavior and ill-treatment of their AB's. It is a verbally and mentally abusive environment. The way AB's have to walk on eggshells and are afraid to ask for WFH or PTO day is ridiculous. I think the only reason this company hasn't been sued yet is that they're paid so little that they can't afford to retain a lawyer to represent them."

The office has a beautiful view overlooking Elliott Bay, and has a laid back, casual vibe. Dress code is casual so you can wear whatever you want. The office is open with no cubicles which I personally enjoy for the social aspect but which some may not.

There are tons of talented people working at Zulily and it’s cool to see their work.","The pay is probably the worst thing about working here.

-Politics are status quo
Workplace politics stunt your growth here. Managers aren’t held accountable as long as they drive business results. Entire teams can leave a manager more than once and it never raises any eyebrows... attrition is a problem. Hiring good talent is hard here. Leadership has asked managers to post reviews in an effort to improve reputation at least once during my tenure. When you can’t replace those who are leaving by choice and you’re laying others off, you aren’t growing.

-Not progressive 
The office is not configured for working remotely and people who WFH are judged and met with a lot of (inappropriate) skepticism that’s typical of a toxic workplace. It’s policy now, but the culture hasn’t evolved. Distrust of your workforce is not a great indicator of respect for your employees. Zulily is a website for women that was created by and is staffed with men in all the highest ranks. The vast majority of key decision makers are men. You can tell by the maternity benefits that they are more interested in women’s wallets and spending habits.

-Not inclusive
Arbitrarily deciding the new brand is inclusive doesn’t actually make it inclusive.  A director once asked me why I thought I belonged here when I was seeking growth. A grassroots black employee network was met with pushback. They ignored Pride in Seattle for a decade. Straight people were photographed in rainbow double-headed “love is love” sweaters for PR. Women executives have left the company. Sponsoring soccer teams because you have difficulty hiring with your reputation is not social responsibility.

-Serves bigots
Zulily panders to empty nesters in the Midwest on Facebook. This customer is Zulily’s bread and butter and they are chained to them for better or for worse. Merchandising managers know this. No savvy shopper is paying $6-8 in shipping costs for low quality junk that takes more than 3 weeks to arrive. Zulily is too afraid to stand up to hate in fear of alienating their customer. Lack of integrity doesn’t bode well for the company’s longevity.

-Not good for the environment
Zulily’s business model is irresponsibly selling cheap junk to moms. Do you think Zulily is just trying to keep the lights on and units moving, or do you think they really care about sustainable products and reducing negative effects on the environment? Zulily isn’t in a place to be selective of what they sell. Supporting fast fashion and the sale of literal junk amid the climate crisis and greatest existential threat to our planet is to our detriment.

-Under-developed leadership
Managers are quick to criticize teams without providing adequate support, vision or strategy. A low support/high expectations environment leads to inevitable longterm failure and burnout to the severe detriment of employees’ confidence and self-esteem. No thought/care, logic or philosophy behind people leadership. Several individuals who shouldn’t manage people are stuck with teams because of politics, departures, and rash decisions.

-People don’t get promoted
Varies, but people generally don’t get promotions. There’s an abundance of complacent middle managers who are comfortable where they’re at in a highly political environment dictated by reputation. Their comfort and reluctance to move on, coupled with their inability to move up, means little to no mobility for the teams beneath them. Teams are often merged or flattened when people leave, making internal upward mobility a rare occurrence.

-Not a good place to work
You must be data-driven to work at Zulily, so look at the data on their reputation (consumer and employee reviews) in aggregate, and draw your own conclusions. Go with your gut and do not ignore red flags. In a city teeming with opportunity like Seattle, the opportunity cost of working for Zulily is too high, unless you’re a manager who wants to chill or you have little experience. Other employers may lowball you after Zulily with the common understanding that Zulily does not compensate well."

There is barely any room for growth unless you’re someone’s favorite and promotions have been on hold in merchandising  for almost a year. Even if you’re a high performer, the direction always changes and you constantly have to prove yourself. Because of that morale is down and almost everyone is trying to get a job elsewhere that’s all everyone talks about now .

As a senior engineer I have been prevented from interviewing candidates or making recommendations on candidates for over a year with no explanation given.  Management has allowed SDE 1 and SDE 2 employees to conduct interviews and recommend candidates even though they had been at the company less than 90 days.  As a senior engineer, management does not ask me for feedback on the work of SDE 1 or SDE 2 engineers.  Instead management asks SDE 1 and 2 employees on how much they ""like"" me.  As a SENIOR engineer management says that they and the ""lead"" will be the arbiters of any disagreement between myself and any SDE 1.

As you can tell things are extremely messed up here with recent management changes.  Zulily does not have the organizational capacity respect their own job titles but will expect you to.  Part of this is continued influx of management from competitor Amazon and failing ecommerce company Groupon.

Want to talk about HR about it?  Good luck even determining who your HRBP is.  Zulily maintains a secret promotion policy and procedure and racist directors work in secret with engineers on secret projects they want to promote.  Zulily practices discrimination in their tech hiring and promotion."

Cafeteria in the building","-This is the type of company that will work/stress you until you have a mental break-down/cry, I saw it happen to many people
-Low pay
-Sorority-like culture

Honestly, I have never been treated so badly by leadership/a company as I was here. The way that members of my team were talked to and treated by leadership in meetings was shocking. Contractors are treated worse than anyone - and are removed from the company with little-to-no heads up. The high turnover is a complete reflection of the company and the toxic work environment it puts its employees in. They are ALWAYS hiring (just check on their website, ABs/Buyers/MMs/Directors, check again in a month and another month if you don’t believe me). This high turnover is seen across all teams, copy, FC, etc. 

ABs and above are salaried and are expected to take their laptops home every night and on the weekends. They are expected to check their emails at all hours. Let’s call it what is it - you are an on-call employee - do not take a position here unless you are okay with being exactly that. If you take PTO you are still expected to respond to urgent emails (like 15-20% of your emails). You are required to be in during “core hours” and then if leadership wants to throw in something for tomorrow, you are expected to work after you leave the office & until it is finished. This happens not occasionally but whenever leadership feels like it, which on some teams can be pretty regularly. You are also dependent on other teams to get things done and you have to wait & work to get things done at odd hours. I received 1 am emails on many occasions.

There is no work-life balance. Leadership (at least the leadership that my team worked under) want “yes” people. If you question or push-back on any of the late/last minute/after work hour tasks that are thrown at you, your job is not safe here. This is not the type of place where you can vocalize your concerns if you do you will not make it far in this company and they will work to build a case to let you go. They try to act like there is, but at the end of the day this company is a numbers game, if you have to leave early because of something personal and they need to add something to the calendar, you figuring out how to make it work is not leadership’s priority. The goals are some teams are completely unrealistic and leadership does not care that you work 60 hour weeks to make it happen.

The favoritism is so apparent on many teams and in how some people are and aren’t promoted. 

While my view of my time at this company isn’t going to hold for every team there if you take my experience and look at the general consensus among the many other reviews on here you can start to get a picture of what this company is like and how they treat their employees. (The cons amongst many of the reviews are pretty consistent). You may get lucky and be the 10% that end up well supported, not on an over-worked team, and with room to grow here - but that doesn’t happen as often as it should. You decide if you are willing to risk it. If you are interviewing here and are debating if you should work at zulily I would say if you have any other good options at another company TAKE IT. If this is your only option and you desperately need the experience take it, get the experience and GET OUT. Ask to meet with the team members (not just leadership interviewing you) before you accept the position and see if you can get open and honest answers in how the team culture is, how the people you report to are, how the work-life balance has been on the team for the last year, and why the last few people on the team left. The insight can really help you better understand what you are getting yourself into and if it would be worth it to you. Leaving zulily with work-related PTSD is a thing. Your mental health is important and being treated badly and talked down to at work each day can take a toll on your mental health - and that’s something to consider when taking a role here. There are so many amazing companies in Seattle where you can truly be respected and treated fairly. 700+ reviews with a 2.8/5 rating - take that into consideration that this isn’t just a one-off experience."

I had an senior engineer tell me that he did not have time to address issues that came up (during his oncall week), because he had more important things to do. For clarity, on this team, when you are on-call there is no sprint work allocated for you, you are expected to only focus on on-call duties. 

There are pockets of boys-clubby people. I've had ""Principal"" level engineers talk over me in meetings, ""he-peat"" what I said verbatim and try to take credit for my work.

The kind of people that stick around are those that can't leave, or people who don't care. I have some friends still at Zulily who show up at 11am, take an hour lunch break, then leave at 2pm.

Which brings me to my next point: promotions. Zulily, you are not doing yourselves any favors in your approach to promotions. You have to be a huge self promoter, or a ""squeaky wheel"". Never mind if you are an actual high performer who is talented and an expert in the business, if you laugh at all your incompetent director's jokes and do a bunch of worthless ""exposure activities"" you'll get the promotion.

There are seemingly infinite solutions floating out there in the ether that just need to be identified, developed, and put in place. Never have I worked somewhere where so many people are open to change and new ideas. However, you have to be willing to do the hard work and carve out the time to make the magic happen. It really takes effort. And you have to have the ability to create definition in a highly ambiguous environment. 

Along the way, you'll meet some pretty amazing, genuinely nice, and highly intelligent people who are all in it together to make it a better place. And having a new CEO who seems to care about the right things, has injected a lot of optimism as of late.","Things can be messy. Things can change too frequently. People can move too fast. There can be a lack of planning and strategy because the teams are so scrappy. It requires a lot of intentionality and discipline and resilience and resourcefulness to work here. It's an environment that can be great for early-career professionals because of the opportunities to learn and grow, but it can also spell certain doom for those early-career folks that really need direction, training, and supervision to keep them on the right track. The ambiguity can be overwhelming.

So, make sure you're up to the task. It can be the greatest or most frustrating of careers moves depending on what you're looking for.

HR will ignore your valid and verifiable complaints. Your exit interview will be wasted. Every major complaint that was presented was met with “yeah we know”. Helpful. 

Benefits are a joke. There is no PPO plan and only an HSA plan, which if you are 18, never had a health issue and can predict your future health with 100% accuracy, is fine.

415,Zulily,Amateur Hour,2018-03-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"* Cafeteria is convenient and has pretty good food. Some people complain about the prices, but the cost is below average for the neighborhood (unless you prefer fast food chains).

* Laid-back dress code.

* Office location has nice views.

* Lots of kind, creative people work here. They deserve better.","* Pay and benefits are far below what is competitive for the Seattle market. Pay is barely above minimum wage for many Studio employees, regardless of what prior experience they have. Healthcare benefits are basically nonexistent. Only high-deductible plans are available. If you get injured or sick, be prepared to pay out of pocket for almost everything (including prescriptions).

* Job descriptions are constantly changing and expanding. If you get hired, read the job posting carefully, because chances are you'll be asked to take on multiple projects that aren't mentioned there. These supposedly let you ""go the extra mile"" in your job, but they're not really optional if you want to be successful at this company. Sometimes you will be asked to take on a task, and you'll wonder, ""Don't they already have an employee for this?"" Sometimes the disorganization is astonishing.

* The micromanagement can be intense and make the job feel like high school. Everything you do is tracked and tied to a dollar amount. Expect to receive some kind of evaluation every 1-3 months regardless of how long you have worked there. You'll get asked a lot of questions about what you eventually want to do for a career (wait, shouldn't it be this?), but career development opportunities are largely few and far between. It's unsettling to be an adult at work and then be asked something akin to ""What do you want to be when you grow up?""

* In Studio, some managers and supervisors lack experience in the areas they oversee. Some of them previously worked as district or store managers for Starbucks or mall chains. If you are a creative employee, consider yourself lucky if your supervisor or manager was promoted from within the company or actually has experience in your field of work.

* The merchandising division appeals to the lowest common denominator of customer. If you want a metal sign with a picture of a dog that says ""The grass is greener closer to my weiner,"" a blinged-out concealed-carry purse, or a Dallas Cowboys wine glass holder shaped like a hot pink high-heel shoe, this is your place. Despite the efforts of creative (and marketing) employees to prevent questionable or tasteless products from seeing the light of day, the almighty dollar prevails. For example, merchandising ran a sale of products featuring recently deceased celebrities the day after Carrie Fisher's death, despite warnings from multiple employees in different departments who said it would be in poor taste. Creative employees regularly catch borderline (or even overtly) sexist or racist products, as well as products that are not licensed. It is a daily uphill struggle.

* So many people are unhappy about their jobs and are looking for a way out. Turnover is heavy. It can be a depressing place."

Ability to work from home.

If you are a self-starter and go-getter you will love your time at zulily. If not and you need tasks lists, supervision and  tiered-style of development - zulily is NOT the place for you.

Greatest part about zulily is finding a way to make your own path. You have to ask for what you want and know what you are asking for. Nothing will be handed to you at zulily just because you show up. For some of us, that is where we belong. 

If you have ideas, can collaborate effectively and lnow your way around retail, you can find a place here.

Some fun company sponsored events, but also seem to be getting cheaper with those too.","Low pay and poor benefits are a huge reason people leave. They also leave due to poor management styles and a seriously lack of incentives. The training is sub-par & different for everyone. People move around a lot or leave after short periods of time. 

Company uses contractors and they tend to be a pretty negative bunch after a couple of months. If they are converted, there is already a bad taste and their attitudes seem to reflect that. 

The lack of understanding between upper management and the reality of what is going on in the day to day is pretty awful. The basic assumptions made about the business based on one of the ambiguous, and often different, reports, is laughable. Seems to constantly miss what is actually happening downstream.

The knee jerk reactions to EVERYTHING. We joke on our team as each “problem” makes it’s way through the cycle month after month -  Rinse & Repeat. WHAT is the overall strategy for each divison/team/brand that is NOT just based on demand????? How is zulily going to build successful partnerships?

Lack of communication amongst tech teams and having zero idea how one roll-out will affect another team. Systems break every.single.day. 

zulily has “Values” but don’t adhere to them in a way that builds a cohesive and innovative culture. Instead, it feels like they rely on new people’s energy until they burn out and leave - often taking their knowledge out the door and leaving a gap."

The fullfiment center in Bethlehem is run worse than a prison.  Most of the mangers are prior Amazon employees, including the general manager and human resources.  Managers belittle and are abusive and disrespectful to employees.  Human resources is too lazy to do thier jobs.   If you report a manager to human resources for anything,  it will come back at you 10 fold, and human resources will tell that manger who reported them.  

The company is very unethical, human resources creates double standards, and will fire you for the most petty and rediculous things, even things that are untrue and they do themselves. 

The company does not pay any unsued PTO after you leave, so be sure to use it all before you leave and don't bother giving this company any notice once you decide to leave.  


The company re-hires employees who were fired, which makes no sense what so ever. 

The benfits are horrible, and the pay is a little below par.    

I would love to know how many lawsuits this company has from former employees.  I bet they have many.  I won't be surprised to see this company in a class action lawsuit sometime in the near future based on all the crap they pull with people."
440,Zulily,Only worth it if you can't get hired elsewhere,2017-12-03,2.0,Copywriter,You can build up enough experience here to go somewhere else.,"I don't have much great to say about this place. I did manage to advance from 
someone with no experience, to being hired at an ad agency two years later. However I felt that even as I was advancing, I could see the rungs on the ladder falling off beneath me. When I started there was enough time for leads to help coach me on copy best practices and improve my writing. By the time I left the product department, the pace of work no longer allowed time for that.

At one point an opportunity arose to fill in for a higher level position while that person
was gone on an extended leave. I and one other person interviewed for the position and I was selected. I then asked for a temporary pay increase commensurate with the position. My manager was unhappy and told me I should be grateful for the opportunity, insinuating to me that if I kept pressing, they would simply go with the other person.

However, when I talked to people on the actual team I would be joining, they said absolutely not, they were not going to simply go with the cheapest person regardless of qualifications. I got the pay raise in the end, and I concluded that my manager had been lying to me to bully me into not asking for a raise. 

At a department-wide meeting where people were pressing for higher pay, the department leader pretty much came out and said: ""We're paying you in job experience, not money."" And true enough: I doubled my salary by leaving."

I also really enjoyed the people I worked with directly in IT and don't believe my pains and issues with the company came from the IT side of the business. So I think, from an IT perspective, it's a great stepping stone to advance your career.","Working directly with Operations was a horrible experience from an IT perspective. Operations doesn't care about following IT processes, there was no change management, there were no project management frameworks such as AGILE in place at the FC level(I'm sure there is further up the project management chain, but there is almost no accountability and no management at the working level). There was no understanding of how IT works from the Operational team perspective and they never seemed to care to try to work together, they just wanted it their way or the highway. I would love to say this was just a 'me' opinion or a biased outlook, but it just simply isn't true. If you work directly with Operations, be prepared to throw processes and expectation setting out the window because what they say goes, regardless of how unrealistic or counter productive/intuitive to the IT process it may be. If you try to fight back and establish a common ground to follow actual business processes, like any professional corporate business does, prepare for backlash and most likely them slowly removing you from their business. I really... really.... wish this was only my opinion, but this is the common understanding and common opinion of almost everyone I worked with and almost everyone that I'm still in touch with that works there now. I have people reaching out to me on LinkedIn that are in IT management positions and Lead or Supervisor roles begging me to share with them my experience when I worked there because they are so frustrated with their currect position and how things are ran that they can't believe it. People that don't even know me personally... reach out to me out of frustration. Unfortunately, this is the common opinion at ALL FC locations across the country. I would never recommend working here and think it may be the worst company I personally had ever worked for in my long IT Career."

Even if you're a top performer, no one can give you a straight answer on what you need to do to be promoted, yet they will continue to pile on work if you're efficient and good at what you do. Turnover here is astronomical! Prepare to be the senior person and SME on your team within a matter of months. Some employees give 150%, some give 50% and that's accepted here. Top performers ultimately burn out and leave, leaving the teams in a state of chaos with no direction.

They will become a second family to you.","zulily is a company that claims over and over again that they work for moms everywhere. They do not. The only people zulily works for is everyone on the executive level. Employees are severely underpaid when compared to like jobs in the area, no matter what department you wind up in.The work isn't hard, but all the executives do is put pressure on everyone below them to churn out an absurd amount of useless products day after day, no matter how off-brand it may be. They will even go so far as to run Princess Leia merchandise alongside David Bowie t-shirts days after the death of Carrie Fischer because one of the executives told everyone to despite complaints from dozens of employees on every level. 

Your skills are sacrificed for the sake of making goals every day, and no matter how busy your department is, everyone is expected to make sure that they can still drop everything because 100 pairs of toddler shoes just have to be on the site in less than 12 hours despite everyone already being over their daily workload and it being 4:45 PM. If you even say that it may not be possible, someone will throw a hissy fit or send one of many passive-aggressive emails until they get their way. Other departments have control over an area of the company they shouldn't be in control of, and competition and headbutting between departments is encouraged by the CEO as opposed to each coming together to work like a well-oiled machine.

It's also very funny that zulily claims over and over again that they are a company for moms, but their parental policies are pretty terrible. You would think a company like this would love having family-oriented people working for them, but most people that work here have no kids or are planning to any time soon. 

All of this though boils down to executive-level management that is so out of touch with almost every area of the company. When employees rally together for more benefits, they take another away to offset the cost. Employees are treated as numbers. I understand a company is around to make money, but the amount of upper-level greed at zulily is disgustingly palpable. It's a company great for young, recent grads for a couple of months, but it burns out people quick. Before you ever begin to realize it, you're incredibly unhappy with how your time and talent are being spent and begin to question your abilities as a person."

Parties--but don't be fooled. The parties usually pose as smoke and mirrors for the web of lies that is zulily.","Racism and Bigotry with a Side of Disrespect

I could go on for days about my horrible experience at zulily, but I will try to keep it concise. Management is awful and the positions are used for sheer tyranny. The only point of my manager's employment is for health insurance for her kids while she moonlights as the owner of crossfit gym. Her day job consists of stand-up comedy bits about her utter ignorance of the English language. This is particularly unfunny because she manages editors and writers. She went out of her way to harass me from the day she started. She and the upper management are out-right bigoted racists. 

Deets

The pay is whooping $15.38/hr. No one ever gets the bonus--which maps out to be $200, so don't hold your breath. Micro management is at an all time high--especially from the premature balding, old-school vest wearing management. If you're not a Catholic straight white man, forget about it! The team lead is a community college grad with an associates degree who doesn't know the difference between compound and complex sentences. She's a joke. 

Don't bother talking to HR. They're liars. They will claim there's an open-door policy only to document everything you say and report it back to your boss. Ironically, a couple of my colleagues reported the mistreatment happening to me, yet HR never tried to stop it or even ask me about it. 

If you get this job use it as a stepping stone to get in the industry. As soon as you get hired update your LinkedIn and immediately start applying elsewhere.

My department was paid well under the average for similar jobs in Columbus, despite the fact we were doing an insane amount of work.

Don't bother complaining, though; you'll be called ""unprofessional"" for not being a team player. Speaking of teams, I hope you enjoy incompetence; because the merchants have it in spades. There were a few bright spots scattered throughout that side of zulily, but by and large, it was clear that the creative types were expected to pick up the slack of the higher-paid merchants. 

The CEO is clueless. We'd be trotted out to listen to him address the company, as he spoke on how zulily was competing with ""that other e-commerce site in Seattle"".

I realized that my sanity and self pride is much more than what Zulily has to offer. From day one the team that I was put onto barely helped me integrate into my role. Essentially they said ""good luck"" (on my first day) and focused on themselves. I found only a few individuals welcoming to Zulily, the majority of the employees I met at Zulily were looking for jobs & other opportunities elsewhere. I want people to know and to really grasp that this company should be avoided at all cost. 

Competitive pay where it caps to $15? Pushing workers to not have an equal work life balance? Or how about the Assistant Buyers working day & night for little recognition?

I also liked the job itself.,"The higher ups do not care about long term solutions. While working there, most internal issues were never solved, more of a band aid to keep employees content while over working for small salaries. A lot of internal gatherings to build company moral."
553,Zulily,Cannot quite put a finger on what's wrong...,2017-01-10,2.0,Senior Buyer,"Unlimited creativity - if you can dream up a merchandising idea for the site, then you have the ability to bring it to life. 
Not held back by red tape - the company is teetering between being a 'start up' and a 'billion dollar company' in its mentality. One of the refreshing things is that they do not have a lot of layers or red tap to get through yet.
As stated in the points above, these are the most refreshing and empowering things about working at zulily. 
Also, wins and losses are short-lived, and you are always on the the next (which is both good and bad.) The vendors are truly great - a group of professionals who are invested and excited to work in this unique business model. Not a ton of unnecessary meetings, which is nice. 
The Assistant Buyers are incredibly smart and driven. I have never had the pleasure of working with so many devoted and hard working Assistant Buyers in my career. Each one I have had the opportunity to lead was truly passionate about their work and responsibilities. 
CEO Darrell Cavens is outstanding - he is open, candid, more honest than any CEO I have worked under. You can see he pours his heart into the business, and is the part of the company that I respect the most. I would follow him to any company he would ever go to - inspiring and well-intentioned.","Mudslinging politics - Having worked in corporate environments before, politics is expected. But at zulily. this is taken to a level that borders (and many times crosses the line) of being corrupt/toxic. I have seen some of the strongest merchants that I have ever worked with, have their career growth completely halted due to not participating in idle gossip with management. You are encouraged to speak your voice, but if your opinion differs from the company in any way, then you are told your input is not valued. This goes with raising normal business concerns - if you have a different way to go about something that anywhere else makes normal business sense, and it does not match the view of the day at the company, you are told you don't understand how business works. 

Unqualified and uninspiring leaders - There are some leaders who are great, but just like people getting held back by one persons opinion alone or not participating in toxic gossip - others see the opportunity to take advantage of it and get promoted way too early. This leads to a management team who lacks basic people leadership skills and also do not have the business acumen or backbone to stand up for what is right. Middle management just do what they are told and do not stand up for their teams. Many are praised by senior leadership saying these middle managers 'get the job done' - but there is a difference between being a leader and a boss, and for such a young, vibrant culture, you would expect they would take the ""lead by inspiring"" approach versus a dictatorship. I have seen so many buyers cry regularly by being berated for their work ethic, even though they surpassed plans and stretch goals. 

No bench strength - instead of recognizing the talent they have in house, they look past those who have the ability to really move the needle and drive the company forward and drive those ones out because they have opinions (and the opinions are not even presented in a negative way - they are just different or practical). They prefer to have those who will use their creativity at a superficial level only - like the unlimited creativity I mentioning in the ""Pro"" section above. They want you to feel like you can impact the business by allowing unlimited creativity at the level that they forget about in a weeks time. They want people who only want to impact the business to a certain level (or who are so cut-throat and will do whatever they say, no questions asked- those are the ones that get promoted.) If you have deeper creativity, its like you are overstepping and you are pushed aside. They are left with a high turn, negative-attitude merchandising environment. 
While I am not an Assistant Buyer, the talent in that position is so high, and pay is so low - they are incredibly driven but kept in a more clerical capacity and yet required to shoulder the load of the work."

2. The people you get to work with are amazing in general
3. The vendors are typically awesome to work with (with a few exceptions of course)
4. You will learn how to juggle so much at one time that going to any other place of employment will feel like a breeze
5. If you like being creative, there are lots of opportunities in the day to day work that allows you to do this","1. The pay and lack of raises is so awful. They try to make up for it by giving away trips to a few people a couple of times a year, but the chances you'll get picked for that are so small and don't make up for a dismal salary. The gap between AB's can be as much as $10k so someone might be at the top of the range around $45k, whereas you might be at the bottom scraping like $35k for doing that exact same job.

2. AB's typically carry the majority of the workload doing everything from unpacking boxes of samples, pricing inventory, selecting the creative images, phone calls and emails with vendors, following up on PO's with the operations team, and more while buyers just have to plan the calendar out and run some reports here and there. You'll feel like you're drowning in your workload while your buyer is leisurely chatting and taking long lunches while you never get to leave your desk for lunch. The work is never done and you're expected be available 24/7 by your computer and checking in on emails nights and weekends. Having a life outside of work is frowned upon, and they don't respect people who have a family to tend to when they are not at work.

3. Management is constantly in meetings and running around like chickens with their heads cut off. They are so busy with meetings that they hardly have time to be there for their teams for questions, responding to emails, or checking in. They also seem confused by the millions of changes that roll out every week and the only way to explain the initiatives changing is by picturing our execs throwing wet noodles at the wall just trying to see what sticks. There is NEVER a method to the madness and you will leave work feeling like your head is spinning on a swivel. Not once or twice a week, but every single day.

4. The culture is actually toxic. There is constantly someone leaving the company and people are always whispering in the kitchens or the hallways about some office gossip which makes everyone else start talking. We were actually called out by one of our VP's in a company meeting for not being enthused by her pep talk and it's because everyone is SO CHECKED OUT. I can't even count on my hands how many people told me they were ""looking"" and were trying to leave as soon as something better came along. That is NOT the kind of environment that anyone should want to work in. It's draining, uninspiring, and ridiculously stressful, so if you enjoy those things, come work at the zu!"

Their training program was excellent, informative, and did a good job of preparing new workers to get on the floor and get working as quickly as possible (this was customer service).","In short: zulily does not appear to value its employees, nor its customers. Over the course of my employment there, zulily did their best to convince employees across many departments that $12 an hour, with a salary cap at $15, was a ""competitive wage"" for their industry. When employees organized for better wages, we were told ""this job is a resume-builder"" (it's not) and ""if you don't like it, you're welcome to leave."" (That last was said to a roomful of employees by Darrell Cavens himself.) Toward the end of my employment there, it became clear that they were allowing/encouraging attrition by tenured and experienced employees, in favor of new employees in another state that would be paid an even lower wage with minimal training. This management tactic runs directly counter to zulily's purported mission of providing ""magical"" customer service."

601,Zulily,"Disrespectful, Racist & Misognynistic Company",2016-07-25,1.0,Copywriter,"It's a good way to start at the very bottom in the copywriting world. Just to get your feet wet. You'll be asked to to juggle unrealistic production goals and timeframes - it'll look great on your resume.

When I was there you could work from home two days per week after training. Not sure if this still flies or not.","The copy department/studio was always treated as the lowest of the low in the company. Management made it clear that our work didn't really matter, while at the same time, placing upon us such unrealistic demands that it sorta made you wonder. They force you to pound out copy and make it seem like quantity matters more than quality. However, if you didn't meet certain quality standards you could be penalized for it.

Management consistently lied to and misdirected our department as well. At the start, most of us were hired as Copywriters, full-time, salary. We were then taken from salary to hourly, and stripped of our titles as ""Copywriter."" We were given the title, 'Production Writer"" which makes no sense. We had to fight tooth and nail to get them to change the title back to Copywriter. It was a poorly thought out decision on their part to even consider the the switch.

More than one time I made HR aware that some of our team members were being treated differently and I felt it was based on race (I'm not personally a POC) and absolutely nothing was ever done about it. Racist comments and actions were tolerated and not corrected.

Also, as a company that employs mostly women, they opted to choose a healthcare plan that provides the very minimum prenatal care allowed by law. Which is basically that you have no coverage. They do not care about their female employees - if you get pregnant while working here you better hope your spouse or partner has insurance because if not, you're out of luck as not even 10% your delivery is covered, no prenatal vitamins, only one ultrasound, even in a high-risk pregnancy. 

And yes, it was suggested to me by a member of mid-management that I write an inflated positive review on Glassdoor to boost their score."

You are pretty much entrusted to do the work you have to do. In my department you get to work from home twice a week. Good place to start for entry level post grads",Pay is low for the amount of work expected and there is not a lot of room for creativity. The programs used to write and edit copy are slow and unreliable. So much is expected to get done yet hitting save makes me cringe at the thought of losing my work because the program could easily crash. The internet connection is terrible as well. Ethernet connection has been down for a month and nothing has been done about it so I have to rely on the terrible wifi. On top of everything it's retail even if it's based on the internet. The company is a retailer and with corporate principles and black out dates during the holidays. The turn over is high for a reason.

Not to mention, the merchandising team was a nightmare to work with. They looked down on studio and felt above everyone else — which was rightfully so since that's how they were treated in the company. I've never felt so disrespected at a job.

610,Zulily,Great place if you can swim in the deep end,2016-07-10,4.0,Director,"zulily is a great place to work if you deal well with ambiguity, a fast pace, figuring out problems and are able to embrace change. It's still a young company (6 years old) and some processes, policies, etc are not as evolved as other companies. This can be a double-edged sword. It can be frustrating that some things aren't built yet but it's a unique challenge to be able to build them from scratch.

zulily is still small enough so that everyone (and their opinion) matters. If you don't like something or think there is a better way to do it, go to the leader(s) of that area and chat with them about it. Darrell (the CEO) has an all-hands company meeting every week. During that time he always asks for questions and sticks around afterwards to chat with people and find out what they're thinking.

If you like to learn by doing and aren't afraid to jump into projects and figure it out along the way, zulily is a great place. Most of the career development you will experience is on your own and by doing.","Because some of the leaders have been here since the beginning or towards the beginning, they are used to doing much of the work. They have a hard time letting go and giving the responsibility (and accountability) to the team that they have hired. This has the potential of leading to distrust and frustration."

My peers are great to work with and are very supportive.","During the recruiting process, everyone made a big deal about how wonderful the work/life balance was.  Unfortunately, working nights and weekends does not fit in with my idea of work/life balance.  I wouldn't mind working nights and weekends if that expectation had been made clear from the beginning, and if my pay was commensurate with that expectation.  The problem is that I was told that zulily doesn't pay as well as other companies because the work/life balance is so much better.

The benefits are a joke.  You have to be employed for a year before you're eligible for a 401(k) match, and then the match is done once a year at the end of the year.  If you're not there at the end of the year, then you don't get the match.  On the plus side, it vests immediately.  Zulily doesn't pay for short-term disability--it's 100% paid for by the employee.  There are only 15 days of PTO (that includes sick time), and it doesn't increase until you've been there for seven years.  Of course, the company is only six years old...

The company is ridiculously cheap!  I hope you enjoy unplugging your monitors, power cord, keyboard, and mouse every time you go to a meeting because docking stations are rare.  The only chance of getting a docking station is if you can snag one from a recently departed coworker.  Given the rate of attrition, you might only have to wait a few months.

I asked about the poor Glassdoor reviews when I interviewed (as do a lot of candidates) and was told they were mostly from people in the studio and entry level employees.  In hindsight I've realized that's not true.  Furthermore, people openly talk about leaving and the different job opportunities they're considering."

If you were to break down the salary and divide it by how many hours you work, it would be well below minimum wage.
Management will hire brand new employees externally and compensate them FAR above what the tenured employees are getting paid. Doesn't it seem like you would want to pay the people more who have stuck with the company through the years and have helped it grow?

""I knew someone who just hated his life while he was there."" 
""The management will just lie and lie, and it all starts with the CEO."" 

But I needed a job and I wanted the experience, so I took the job anyway. Since then, I have seen those stories happen. Coworkers ask me casually, ""So where are you looking for a new job?"" It's an open secret that this company can't hold onto their employees - everyone is looking. I know people who just quit without a job lined up. I have seen multiple, talented people who have put their all into this company but receive no training, no help, and are just demoted when the workload is too much for them. The other managers are there because no one will hire them. You will learn nothing from them. 

When the holiday season comes along, kiss your life goodbye. There will be immense pressure to put in extraordinary hours. You'll hate Thanksgiving and Christmas.

zulily is a place where you can own your development.  If you are waiting for someone to hand you a promotion because you do things outside of your job requirement, it's likely you won't get that promotion. Just because you put in your time also doesn't mean you may get that promotion.

Take time to understand your role, others roles, the bigger needs of the business as a whole, and how to elevate yourself and your team to success.

-comp
-jaded personalities

One of the biggest down sides to zulily are the employees who don't want to let go of the past.

Yes, we used to be a hip start up with very little in terms of rules/regulations. Yes, everyone has had their hand in innovating and trying new things and didn't receive individual credit for it. Yes, work life balance used to be crazy because we had not yet discovered the tools we need to balance workload against head count. Yes, you used to be able to work for 6 months and then move into another position with little to no experience. Yes, it's easier to talk about how much you dislike this manager, that supervisor, etc. but it's really unfortunate to have to hear.

As long as people keep looking backwards and not forward, you'll always see negative reviews.

Talking about pay...
everyone is aware of compensation. If you do your research you'll know it's not quite there yet.. but with the benefits packages available and 401k match you can easily live comfortably. Just because you can't go out to happy hour every night doesn't mean it's the company's problem.

It's now moved on from that altruistic approach, and should adjust their mantra to reflect that they now work for Gordon Gecko in an effort to separate ""Mom"" from her $$.

And god forbid you be critical AND offer solutions or ways to improve things.  

Also, it should not take 4 years for someone to move up in the company.  The company should be looking for ways to leverage an employees experience, rather than sitting back and waiting.

Usually you only get promoted because of sucking up to the managers and supervisors but there isn't any opportunity for those that have been there longer to go anywhere. They spend so much money on useless things instead of investing more money in their employees. Turn-over rate is high due to the lack of desire to even come to work. It was an ok place to work at at first, but the more you are there, the more you see how often management covers up things and makes decisions without even asking or considering their employees who are actually doing the work.

681,Zulily,Cronyism. High Stress. High Turnaround. Low Pay.,2016-02-16,1.0,Photo Editor,"I worked at Zulily, at the Columbus office, for a little over two years.  Saying that, I have a very solid understanding of this business and the leadership, as most employees do not last this long.   **I also waited almost 5 weeks to write this, so that I would be honest and would not come off as merely a disgruntled ex-employee.**

I can honestly say, with complete conviction, that I can not think of one redeemable / positive aspect of working within the Ohio office, namely the studio.","1. High turn around. - In the two years I worked for Zulily, I had EIGHT supervisors. (four full time and four stand-ins from other departments.  Two of which were located in Seattle).    In the past 12 months, my entire team of approximately 14 people had a complete turnaround.

2.  Studio leadership has no creative background.

3.  Pay. - The offered ""non negotiable"" salaries, are at the very bottom of the spectrum compared to others in the same field / same positions at other companies.   *Research average salaries for similar roles.  The salary offered by Zulily is always at the bottom of those averages.    You will however be told that they have had a ""third party"" do extensive research on pay scales and they offer the ""in the middle salaries"".  This is a blatant lie, as the irrefutable facts and numbers do not lie.

4. Quantity over Quality. - There are predetermined arbitrary numbers of images, copy, photographs, etc. that each employee to expected to achieve daily.  Essentially a quota.  If this number is not met each day, it is seen as not producing and can lead to disciplinary action.  This forces studio employees to hastily produce rather than take the time to get it right.  Quantity and numbers are valued over quality.

I could continue this list.  However I believe the point has been made."

They will make excuses and will avoid answering employee questions truthfully. HR is the biggest joke of all! HR is home to the mother of all bullies at Zulily.

Constantly changing environment with high turnover meant improvements were never implemented. Very clique-ish environment. There was a very apparent ""trample and claw your way forward"" mentality. 

Compensation and advancement are due to cronyism. The review process is a joke. Management who never interacts with you writes your review and determines compensation blindly. My review also happened to be when my manager was being promoted to new a division, so absolutely no thought or effort went into my review. 

Although I was a full time employee it was clear, temps are treated terribly. Temps regularly feared the axe as dozens were let go a month however underperforming full time employees remained employed despite horrible attendance, accuracy and ethical issues. The least competent employee received multiple promotions and eventually trained new employees.

High performers are rewarded, and increasingly, low performers are let go.","Growing technical debt from hacked-together systems. On-call rotations that only seem to get worse. Deployments that break everything. You’ll be shocked at the code and processes you’ll find here.


The leveling system is over-hyped, leading people to minimally satisfy a list of bullet points to get promoted. However, our tiers don’t map to other companies’ - I’ve seen it play out - so we’re left with middle and senior tiers promoted/hired far beyond their level of experience, expertise and motivation. This is a real problem that breaks engineering teams. There was a lot going on where I sat - absenteeism and coasting, and a general culture of arrogance and disrespect - that you’d just never see at the best companies and engineering teams. Culture isn't an actual thing here.


Poor project planning and execution. I saw several expensive projects span many months and end with no retrospective or adoption.


As others have pointed out, the IPO, acquisition and $250M stock repurchase (using 75% of the company’s cash) points to a model that was more about short-term profit for some than about building a great company and sustainable offering (the same thing happened at Blue Nile)."

Being an Assistant Buyer at zulily is not like being an Assistant Buyer any other company. You will not learn about or perform the duties other ABs do, you will be doing data entry almost exclusively. Sure, you can do what most do and stay for a year or two to get the title and go elsewhere, but you will feel very inexperienced once you get there. To make matters worse, the environment in certain departments can be really toxic. My advice: go to Nordstrom or Amazon and work your way up from Merch Analyst or other entry level roles.

I also got a paycheck so that was good... And decent benefits.,"I honestly don't even know where to start on this one. I was there for three and a half years and it was never a good place to work and it only ever got worse. I worked in the photo studio but from what I can tell, most problems are consistent through out the company. While the work itself was a little mind numbing and soulless, it was a dream compared to dealing with the insane corporate politics within the company. The real problem stems from the fact that they hire management that has zero creative background and expect them to lead a group of creatives. Most of these managers came from Starbucks stores and restaurants. These a business-minded people who, for some reason, are deemed able to work with and understand creative minds. It just doesn't work. They end up stifling their employees and completely devaluing their profession. Rather than understanding and acknowledging any ounce of talent I had or even could have in my chosen field, this company practically destroyed my career and made me feel like I was in the wrong profession by picking parts of my personality they didn't like and using then against me any time I applied for a promotion. And they did this to countless others as well. I watched some really incredible and talented people torn apart by Zulily. It's heartbreaking. The worst part is they don't even know they're doing it. They don't have the capacity to understand it because they are business people who don't know the first thing about any creative field. In my exit interview, I expressed all these concerns to HR and they didn't know how to fix that and asked me how I would do it (which is a really inappropriate thing to do. It's your job, not mine). I told them they need to completely restructure the studio and hire art directors to lead the team. They told me art directors were too expensive and that would probably never happen. Cool, glad you value the happiness of your employees, Zulily."

718,Zulily,Not as good as it once was,2015-11-11,3.0,Customer Service Team Lead,"I started at zulily in 2011 and it was a good place to work- awesome people and opportunity to develop new skills. We all wore many hats and if you were willing to learn something, there was always someone who needed help and was happy to teach. As time went on and the company grew and eventually went pubic, all of the things that made it a fun, cutting edge start up were lost. There were still some great people there when I was leaving, but many had gone on to other local companies who are very lucky to have them. zulily offered good benefits if you don't have dependents. There is lots of room to grow and try new things, if you are one of the chosen ones. I was lucky, but I saw many coworkers who loved the company become jaded and bitter as they were passed over again and again. They eventually moved on or were let go because their performance began to suffer. I appreciate that zulily gave me many opportunities as a recent college grad just starting in my career, but it is not that place any more, and I would be very reluctant to recommend this company to anyone I cared about.","I waited over a year after leaving zulily (voluntarily- moved on to much better things!) to write this to make sure that I wasn't just venting. But after 18 months, my negative feelings are just as strong. Here are just a few of the negatives. Management is just out for themselves, as evidenced by the massive amount of money some of them made selling their stock options while other employees struggled to fund their monthly passes. Going public was the worst thing to happen to this company. It was demoralizing and totally destroyed the awesome culture that had been created. For a company that says they are for mom, they certainly don't care about the moms in their workforce. Surprise firings of whole departments have been known to happen. Pay is terrible (zulily employees can barely afford to live in Seattle). Management are generally incompetent. There are a few good ones, but many people are promoted way beyond their level of competence. Feedback is asked for, but rather than use it to make necessary changes, it is used as a tool against people. Requests for reasonable accommodation for protected classes was dismissed as too costly and never acted upon. Generally a soul-sucking place."

734,Zulily,"Work Hard, Learn Lots, Move On",2015-10-18,2.0,Merchandising,"-FAST career growth (if you came at the right time). What you experience in zulily time will get you the experience that other retailers will get you in three times as long. With a go-getter attitude and an understanding of basic retail metrics, zulily is a GREAT place to jump-start your career in merchandising.
-Amazing coworkers with a varying breadth of experience. You will meet people here who are super green and have fresh ideas, all the way through people with loads of experience who can better predict and anticipate peaks and valleys in the business. There is a large pool of strengths in the stronger merchants that is very cool to see mix with and work off of each other.
-Relaxed work environment; show up to work in shorts, sandals and a tee shirt and no one bats an eye (again, great if you're into that kind of thing).
-Not a lot of red tape; lots of room to try new things, and if you fail, you fail cheap, and you learn from it. This is great for those who deal well with ambiguity, terrible for others who like rigid structure. The systems are built so that you can execute an idea quickly and get it to the customer at lightning speed.","-No communication between business units. Each division comes up with its own goals which loosely go back to the CEO's directives, but since each BU is going in its own separate direction, the organization can feel unwieldy and disjointed.
-No incentive to perform. Zu never takes the time to properly recognize or compensate wins, and similarly there is no reprimand when buyers do not make their targets. Because zu moves so quickly, it so often feels like you don't have the time to take pride in your performance and that there's no reason to work as hard when your failures are just as quickly moved past. 
-Compensation is below par, and extremely uneven. As a result, it’s hard to build a bench of promotable buyers or assistant buyers, as top talent can burn out quickly and move laterally to other retailers that compensate much higher for similar roles. In turn this makes way for a bloated group of mediocre merchants that occupy their chairs far longer than they reasonably should.
-Lack of true long-term focus or initiative. It felt as though there is little emphasis or focus on creating business plans that do not extend past the following month or quarter. Division focuses change more often than they should and decisions are not always explained. This leads to lots of confusion and frustration, and buyers are often shifting their strategies due to the break-neck-speed changes in direction given from top level.
-Little sense of teamwork or camaraderie. The different business units spend most of their time fighting with themselves or one another. Often times it feels that the decisions zu makes are not for the benefit of the customer, but to elevate the perceived performance of that particular team or person. 
-Stagnating career opportunities. Zu likes to position itself as a “start-up” at heart focused on “tremendous growth”. However, as the company has matured, the need to hire and promote merchants has stagnated as well, and many assistant buyers who were brought in under the pretense of moving up quickly through the organization are stuck in their roles at a very low pay grade. 
-Overwhelmingly unhappy employees, poor moral. Between the lack of communication, bad compensation, lack of long term initiatives, inter-departmental fighting, and a feeling of being stuck in their roles, many merchants are growing increasingly disgruntled and unhappy; these emotions feed off of each other and have a nasty effect on any positivity that is happening in the office. Zu in turn prefers to sweep problems under the rug than address them head on, which brings more frustration to the mix."

Coworkers have your back even if management doesn't.
-Subsidized Transit: But only because employees demanded it
-Work-from-Home Privileges: Again, an employee-driven perk 
-Nice view of the Puget Sound from the building, unless you get stuck in a dark corner in the basement like many of the creative teams","There are too many to count, honestly, but here are a few highlights:

-Substandard pay with an unreasonable workload. My workload quadrupled in the 18+ months I was there, yet my paycheck only went up because I got an internal promotion after 8 months. In addition, raises are paltry and there's a Hunger Games-esque system for bonuses that pits coworkers against each other for a measly $500 a quarter. The pay is ludicrous given the cost of living in Seattle and well-below the industry standard. 

-Creative teams are measured by metrics, primarily by people who have zero creative experience themselves. If you don't meet your daily ""quota"" - an arbitrary number that doesn't take into account the creative process - or the equally ridiculous quality metrics, you will be put on any number of demeaning ""improvement"" plans by your manager and HR. 

-Middle-managers are either ex-Starbucks or ex-retail store managers with ZERO creative experience. Out of five managers I had - all of whom were quickly promoted through the ranks - I had one manager who would construct a grammatically correct sentence. 

-Personality is valued over talent. There's a big emphasis on something called the ""zu-fit,"" a personality type that's somewhere between a desperate sorority girl and a can-do cheerleader. I had a manager tell me I was too ""passionate"" because I raised valid concerns in a meeting about taking on additional work when half our team had just left. An introverted colleague was forced to ""ask more questions in meetings"" to seem like she was participating. 

-Creative teams are at the mercy of the merchandising ""partners."" Buyers and merchandising managers have the final say on creative decisions despite having no real understanding of the studio side of things. Most of your time will be spent trying to appease them instead of doing your best work."

Upper management - CEO, COO, CTO - very removed from the common man. Have no idea who is truly preforming the work. Managers are taking blanket credit for successes they had nothing to do with the execution. They are getting promoted and moving up leaving behind bitter angry soldiers.

The pay is considerably lower for all employees based on industry standard. As a result of this, you get what you pay for. I worked for buyers who have never been buyers, a person who didn't know anything about technology or how to turn on her computer, and a person who throws all of their workload on the assistants while taking long lunch breaks and coming in at 10 and leaving at 4 every day. Since there is is not direct role assignments, bosses can easily say they are ""training you"" and have you do 100% of the job. When people quit, they are not being re-hired (possibly because the company was bought out and may close locations) which forces everyone to take on those roles as well. You work 24/7 never a day off, even on the weekends. You are expected to be on call no matter what as a salaried employee. With the company not being able to bring on new employees due to lack of funds, they force their people to do more and more work to accommodate for all the people they have lost. Some experiences may differ, if you are given a manageable category with a good boss, but it is rare based on the hiring and what the company can afford."

I am older, and found it rather uncomfortable, you definitely feel like an outcast.  I was interviewed and hired over the phone, and had I been interviewed in person, I'm not so sure I would have been hired.
The training was terrible.  I was put in an extremely small room at a table with other new hires where there was not enough room for all of us.  The room was extremely hot and we practically sat on top of each other.  The trainers talked behind the back of each other during the training sessions. It was very unprofessional. There was one trainer in the room at a time, so if you got stuck or had a question, you would just have to sit and wait for someone to become available.  There was a lot of wasted training time just sitting around waiting for someone to help you.  Once training was over you were on your own.  It was impossible to do your job without stopping and getting up to ask a coworker a question.  I would not recommend Zulily, at least not in Accounts Payable, as a company to work for.  Also, the pay is not competitive and from what  I was told the benefits are not the greatest either.  I was only hired as a Temp. so I was not eligible for benefits.

Generally great co-workers and friendly people. Catchy company name with public recognition - nice office - lots of parties. Like many others, I was lured with good pay, future stock options, and promises of greatness... some people did win the Hunger Games to receive these things. Daryl the CEO is a super nice guy in person.","Total disorganization results in chaos - deadlines, sales goals, processes, EVERYTHING changes at the drop of a hat (or your manager's mood).  When you ask for a plan you may be given one, but expect it to be changed in an instant with no notice (and perhaps a reprimand for not being a mind reader). Good luck trying to do your job under those circumstances! It's like trying to build a house on quicksand.

Buyers are pitted against one against the other, as all are competing for the same limited vendors - so you get nasty, underhanded scrabbling among colleagues who *should* be working together as a team. Assistant buyers are overworked and under paid, and completely stressed out from the work load. Creative teams have more work than they can reasonably get through in the time allotted - but the fast pace means they'd better put out, stat, OR ELSE. Say hello to massive overtime with no extra pay, for pretty much everyone. (How does that salary look now?) Very poor work-life balance for everyone but the CEO (who seems to spend plenty of super fun happy time with his family).

Enthusiasm for growth led to over-hiring and expansion into a new office in Ohio, which resulted in layoffs and/or firings as the company struggled to cut overhead. ""Promotions"" in name only were given to junior employees so they could fire the more experienced, higher salaried staff - while loading up the juniors with double the work. Again, say goodbye to your life, kids... it's zutime!

Challenge - Many of the processes and technical infrastructure are either non-existent or not scalable.  You have the ability to take ownership and help make zulily grow.

Visibility - The size of company allows you to have visibility into all elements of planning and access to executive level leadership on a frequent basis.  I enjoy being able to influence the COO and CIO regularly.

Professional Experience - With all there is to do, you will be stretched far outside of your comfort zone.  This helps you grow as a professional while obtaining skills that will last your entire career.

- Easy and fast to get promoted, or move to other departments
- Decent location in Belltown
- Good cafeteria","- Terrible communication between departments (notably between creative and merchandising)
- High turnover at all levels leads to constant change, always in training mode
- Understaffed, at least in creative. Management has now started hiring at the lowest level possible and then having lower-paid workers take on the work of the departments higher on the pay scale (as a ""special project""), all the way up the ladder. Rather than hiring at the appropriate level and training/compensating workers accordingly, they prefer to hire part-time or temp workers at minimum wage.
- Generally paid poorly compared to other companies with comparable jobs
- Company values double as a way to exploit workers (Embrace Change=do not express concern about negative changes, Make the Impossible Happen=work overtime, meet unreasonable quality/productivity expectations, and so on). Workers are praised, though not compensated, for exhibiting these values.
- Work/Life balance is poor for many departments
- The nature of the business (brand new homepage/sales going live every morning) is directly tied to the stress level of creative/production jobs. Sometimes departments can get ahead by a few days, but if your department falls behind (due to poor staffing, tech issues, etc) there is no stopping the presses, so to speak. This naturally leads to periods of major overtime, stress and lowered creative quality. Just something to be aware of when considering this company!"

Merchandise discount
Generally fun atmosphere
Extremely passionate customer base
Instant gratification for merchants - negotiate a deal on product, see it on the site within days, see real-time sales results","Where to begin - as many have stated, work/life balance is pretty much non-existant. In most departments (merchandising in particular), you are ""on-call"" 24/7 and can expect many interruptions to your evenings & weekends (and even middle of the night - yay!) dealing with both internal and vendor shenanigans that come along with this particular business model.

Regarding senior management, it feels like amateur hour. For the most part, those that were brought on in the very beginning quickly rose through the ranks, and are now woefully inadequate and/or unqualified to hold such positions in what has become such a large company. For this reason, big decisions get made on a whim and company/department objectives and priorities change so fast your head will spin.

Unfortunately for some, there is no system in place to either reward top performers or weed out the duds. Many employees with the exact same job title have drastically different workloads and performance expectations - not to mention salaries. You will spend your time either feeling bad for the unappreciated or wondering how in the heck some people even still work there. For both office locations and at all levels of the division, employees are underpaid vs. market value.

Speaking of overworked & underpaid, good luck trying to get any real effort out of cross-functional partners like Creative, Operations, or Accounting. They're in the same awful boat as Merch, but since their work isn't front-and-center on the internet 24/7, they really couldn't care less what you need and when you need it."

You are expected to be on-call 24/7, and yes that includes nights,weekends,and holidays. Responsibilities are constantly added to your job without formal notification or pay increase, especially with the added work load from lay offs. The company claims that there are no lay offs, but there really were which has lead to even more distrust of management. With recent company performance, the flaws of the business model are showing but instead of reevaluating practices, band aids are thrown at the problems. Many employees are very under paid and jobs are being moved to the Ohio office to avoid minimum wage increases in Seattle. Recruiters exaggerated and lied to many of us and now we're in positions that are very different than how they were described. The company hired so many young and inexperienced (aka- cheap) employees that it feels like high school all over again.

Very little chance of you getting stuck integrating an off-the-shelf product, and there is always momentum of refactoring away the legacy stuff.

""If you're not making mistakes, you're not moving fast enough."" Within reason, you are genuinely allowed to make mistakes, i.e. cause production outages, and not be punished for it, which fosters an aggressive, non-bureaucratic dev culture even as the company grows. The conversation is a mature ""How do we prevent it from happening again?""

Still a small tech org, relative to Amazon, Facebook, and Google. Your voice can be heard, and your work will have measurable impact.

If you're a technical person reading these reviews, you should parse the tech reviews from the merch, studio, and reviews of non-tech positions. Tech is very much a culture within the culture, and our pro/cons differ from non-tech.","Stock price is low at a time when competitors' stock price seems to be growing. The company is making legit moves to keep the handcuffs golden but they aren't as golden as they were a year ago.

Product Manager/Program Manager hiring hasn't kept up, which means that devs and dev managers are often pulling requirements out of the business and shepherding projects. Some amount of that is normal but at a certain point, devs shouldn't cat-herding as much.

Some devs don't tolerate being oncall as well as others. Worth asking about frequency of your oncall week."

It's like survivor, nobody knows who will get laid off next. Everyone is underpaid. Rumors of people being treated horribly by the company include: Entire departments getting shut with little notice to their employees. A woman got pregnant and expected a raise, until she got written up for taking time off work to have the baby. The companies motto is ""We work for mom"" yet not if ""Mom"" is their own employee!! 
For a temp worker, you may possibly get hired but some have been there for 6 months before becoming an Employee. 12/hour no benefits. Transportation is a giant pain and is very expensive especially if working for min wage. 
""Sample Processor"" means very boring work (they made it sound much better than it was) its folding clothes, packing boxes, moving boxes, hanging up clothes, and entering numbers in a system database. Fulfilling quotas. 

I can't say enough about how badly I hated this environment. Offers to advance within 6 months are empty promises for 98% of the people at the company with the lowest wages possible.

The managers were mostly morons who had risen through the ranks, and were trying to emulate google's workplace.  Other ""real"" zulily employees were pretty rude to me as a contract employee.  Overall not a great place to work.  Also forced overtime arbitrarily, and did not offer employment after the contract ended, just extended it."
817,Zulily,Immature Company,2015-05-27,2.0,Software Developer,"The environment initially feels exciting and fresh.  As a software engineer, you're given new equipment right away which is cool.","The company is growing so quickly but still trying to run like a startup.  No one wants to follow process or structure which hurts them in the long run.  Pay is below market value, and the benefits are lacking."
818,Zulily,Find a job elsewhere,2015-05-26,1.0,Software Engineer,"The office space itself is a nice one, the sample sales can be fun, and there are a handful of employees here I really like.","Unfortunately, I think things have changed for the worse.  When I joined, a lot of people here prided themselves on making sure the company ""wasn't Amazon"".   They meant culturally- we wanted an atmosphere that was collaborative, not aggressively competitive, supportive instead of threatening, and now I'm constantly hearing managers and upwards saying ""we need to be more like Amazon"".  It's concerning.
I personally feel that the engineering world here is a mess- it seems to be a sinking ship, with most of my colleagues contemplating every day whether or not they're going to move elsewhere, I'm sure a lot of them including myself will be moving on soon.  There's a real lack of leadership among our managers, who I think are nice people, just either not great technically, or not great at people management.  We have a handful of openings for new managers and there's a reason for that.  There has been lots of instability since I've joined zulily and lots of managers moving around, moving on, or being let go.
A lot of it comes from the CTO, who by all accounts is not the right person for his job.  I don't know what the vision is for our department, and beyond that- it's very hard to get things done.  I've heard multiple people complain about going to him with a problem, getting a ""yes, we absolutely will work on that"" or ""this will get done"" and then he tells someone else the complete opposite or never does it.  He seems like he wants to avoid conflict and tough decisions at all costs.
The pay is also completely out of whack.  They want to hire like a Google or Amazon, but want to pay like a retail company.  
I was also sold on there being lots of impactful, technically challenging problems here, but I'm just not seeing them.  
And lastly, I just don't have a good feeling on where the company is going financially based on what I've seen over the past year, and that may be the scariest part.

I don't think anyone here is a bad person, I just want to offer my advice for anyone considering joining zulily in tech; and my advice is: Don't."

Overheard one of their meetings and all they did was gossip and talk about their lives then talk about improving themselves and the work flow. They would be in these meetings all day and would never be around when we needed them. Management in our team allowed the so called buying team to down grade us. We were treated like scum to them. The buying team could never do their jobs right and would tell us to put leggings with everything.

- Partially subsidized a transit pass by raising benefit premiums and cutting PTO payouts.

- Lack of strategic vision among Sr. leadership; lack of leadership experience across the board. Throws cheese like ""let's do it in 'zulily time' "" to explain often knee-jerk reactions. Company doesn't realize that agility isn't about throwing darts and hoping they stick.

Of course, that's because they're looking to hire inexperienced college graduates who don't know enough to demand decent pay or treatment.","In the course of nearly 2 years there, here are just a few of the things that have happened:

- Unpaid weekend overtime was REQUIRED for my team for nearly a year. This resulted in some people working upwards of 50 days in a row. Interestingly, that practice stopped just before the company went public ...

- Creative work that is supposed to be measured by quality is instead reduced to a numerical goal. One time a colleague asked if we could get raises based on the quality of our work, and the answer was that our work quality doesn't matter because it doesn't create more sales.

- The divisions of the company are essentially silos that don't cooperate with one another, despite depending on each other for their work. This has resulted in a complete lack of interdepartmental respect and professional courtesy. One memorable interaction was when a man from another division stood over my petite female coworker, who was seated at her desk, demanding that she do HER job to HIS specifications.

- A supervisor with NO experience in the field of my department (they were one of the many Starbucks cronies) was brought in and then unceremoniously displaced the acting manager who actually knew what our department did.

- The Creative division promised to revamp our promotion path and compensation. They delivered ""improvements"" such as a Hunger Games-style competition among the ENTIRE division for a paltry bonus of a couple hundred bucks once each quarter, and the news that NO ONE could get a raise after 2 years in their position.

- As part of that revamp, I was told that the next step in my ""promotion path"" is a job that literally DOESN'T EXIST (I asked the manager if it would be - the answer was no).

- In general, the message from management is ""we want you to stay here and develop your career,"" whereas colleagues in exit interviews have literally been told by HR that the company has no intention of providing professional growth opportunities.

- The entire customer service department was fired without warning, just told not to come in to work the next day. This is after the company promised that it would NEVER outsource their jobs.

- Darrell spent the bulk of an all-hands meeting describing how he martyrs himself by spending soooo much money on our benefits and ""perks"" such as free (crappy) coffee. I weep for his pain and hope he can dry his tears on his pile of $100 bills.

- The positive reviews you see here? Planted by HR. My department lead was sent an email from HR telling him and the other leads to write positive Glassdoor reviews to offset all the negative ones."

Bad work-life balance. In merch, you were pretty much on call 100% of the time, whether that's proofing a sale at 10 pm the night before it goes live, or being up at 5 am to double check on pricing. However, if you work ten or eleven hours one day, don't expect leniency on taking off an hour or two early the next.

The environment skews early to mid 20-somethings, which makes for an extremely playful atmosphere. Sometimes there's beer. Sometimes there's free food. Often there are pot lucks and celebrations within departments.","Hands down the worst work experience I've ever had. Getting ahead, getting a raise and being respected as an employee is hard unless you drink the Kool-Aid. Dozens (no exaggeration) of capable people walked out the door for nearly 2 straight years and others were passed up for 'promotions' time and time again for questionable reasons that didn't always have a lot to do with performance, ability or trajectory. It took management more than a year to ask why a particular department was a rotating door. When asked about the chance to make a living wage employees were told (by upper level management) to 'work harder and take on more projects'. Many employees work two jobs to barely make ends meet in Seattle's over-priced region because there are no annual merit increases—which zulily tries to spin into a good thing—telling employees there's more chance for a raise than at other companies where you only get raises once a year. *If* your manager thinks you're meeting goals your name gets thrown into a hat and you compete against anyone else in your department for what amounts to a few hundred dollars of additional income rather than anything close to an annual cost of living increase. Everyone is a salary employee and expected to work extra days and/or late hours during the holidays or peak seasons to get everything done. I've never felt like a company could care less about their employees, but watching people break down in the office, having coworkers constantly panicked about paying bills, having food to eat, and watching people's health deteriorate because they're so stressed out about their job is a horrible, horrible thing. Attending company meetings to hear about the millions of dollars zulily is making was terrible for morale. Employees get pulled aside by mid-level managers to discuss important things like smiling, have 1:1s where they're given the run-around about making goals and taking on new projects if management doesn't want them to progress. You won't know it's happening till you find out someone else was given a role or a project that you'd originally asked for. People get promoted (without a pay raise) to management positions when they have zero management experience and therefor have no idea how to manage a team or put out fires or make the environment a better place for everyone beyond saying ""you're doing a great job. Thank you for all of your hard work."" Actual performance feedback is often subjective and can be dependent on whether your manager likes you rather than your ability to actually do the job. No discount or reimbursement for transportation or parking. Parking garage monthly fee is well over what most employees would be able to afford anyway. I wouldn't wish working for this company on my worst enemy."

It's a rapidly growing organization where people are smart, work hard, and have a lot of fun. It's bustling with creativity and innovation, yet it is highly data driven and strives for optimization. The company is still new and (relatively) small, so there is plenty of opportunity here to make a substantial impact in contrast to a massive conglomerate where your range of influence is very small.

The atmosphere/dress is very casual and people are not wound-up in their titles. Senior leadership is very approachable and not interested in micro-management. Your manager will not know or desire to know every granular detail of what you do--they allow you to own your workload and execute within your own judgment. 

When you come up against challenges, there are resources available and you just need to leverage them appropriately. People are generally very helpful and willing to make time to collaborate on cross-functional projects. 

You will be expected to demonstrate flexibility and adaptability. You will be expected to take ownership of things if you want it to change. You will be asked to do things that don't always seem possible. You will need to be resourceful. Your hand will not be held.","There are always going to be cons. No place is perfect. If it was perfect, it would be boring and there'd be no complex problems to solve. 

Sometimes the ""To Do"" list gets really long. Sometimes things move too fast. Sometimes the infrastructure isn't there. Sometimes people are still figuring things out. Sometimes you have to listen to millennials moan about how they paid too much for their art degree. Sometimes you have to put your headphones on because there's a crying baby on set 5. Sometimes the elevator takes FOREVER because they're moving samples. Sometimes the coffee machine is broken, so you opt for the free Tazo tea. Sometimes you have to come in early and go home late.

I was also probably lucky to be paid higher than average (but still less than my previous job for a lot more work). 

I was there for less than a year, but in that time, I averaged about 80 hrs per week, working late into the night, and every weekend. There wasn't a shred of work life balance and when I expressed my concerns to upper management, I got the standard ""take it or leave it"" response. My tipping point came when my manager worked for several hours from home on Thanksgiving day with barely a complaint, like it was just expected. Oh. No. That's just not happening for me.

I left and never looked back. Too bad too, because with less greedy leadership, that would have been a fun place to work. Sorry, but I have a life."

Company has been raising benefits costs, and lowering PTO amounts for new employees.  Most positions are paid 30% less than the market rate.  Hourly positions are paid less than the new minimum wage, and below the minimum cost of living threshold for the Seattle area.  

Terrible leadership.  Managers are hired w/ little to no experience in the fields they are supposed to lead.   Despite all the talk of ""promote from within"", most management hired from outside the company, and new management oftentimes has no retail or ecommerce background.  If you are lucky enough to be promoted from within it's not due to merit, it's b/c you would have sucked up and kissed the right managers butt.   Company does not value there employees and they do not care about retaining or developing there employees.  A recruiter told me verbatim there job is to hire ""young, fast, and cheap.""

The technical team is terrible.  What's that old saying, ""you get what you pay for""?  Well that certainly applies to the tech team here, as systems are broken on a daily basis.  Literally every day stuff breaks, sometimes multiple times daily.  Not surprising as the tech team is mostly made up of Amazon, Microsoft, and other companies rejects. 

Merch thinks they run the show, and they do not care about the #1 complaint of customers, which is the shipping times.  Merch leadership oftentimes at odds w/ Operations leadership, despite what they ""say"", and implement policies that negatively impact the Operations teams ability to reduce customer ship times.  Merch only cares about how much ""demand"" there sales generate.  They do not care about cancellation rates or late shipping times to customers as long as there ""demand"" looks okay on paper.  They also claim we offer ""new and exciting products"" every day.  That is true to a small extent, but more and more the merch team(buyers), are getting lazier and lazier and oftentimes run the same items several times a week.  They do not want to take the time to actually go out and source new vendors and goods to offer new, fresh, and appealing products for the consumer.  They just recycle the same sales and styles over and over again so they have little to no work to do."

They do not have art directors so merchandisers were giving the 'art' direction which leads to confusion, laughter and tears. The pay for Stylists there is a joke, under 20 per hour, Hair and MakeUp get less than the assistant stylists. Photogs start around 40k but that number has been dropping steadily as people catch wind and the talent pool dries up. I thought stock options would have been decent but I was mistaken.

- Depending on where you work, you can occasionally get more ownership and control over what you're delivering and how you're delivering.","- Work/life balance is a challenge.

- The total compensation package is lower than many of its competitors. That's somewhat appropriate for a growth company and the assumption is that you'll make up the difference as the company/stock grows but right now it's not clear that the reward really will be there, as a detailed review of the stock price indicates.

- Lots of chaos and ambiguity, with lack of clear direction, tenets, and goals from the top. This is an opportunity as well as a challenge, of course, but then it depends on guessing right, not just on what to do but on guessing what upper management thinks is important and will reward. Get it right and the sky's the limit. Get it wrong...

- Lack of well-defined roles, which gets in the way of achieving and being recognized for the growth opportunity you wanted/got/seized.

Depending on your team, the Merchandise Assistant/ Assistant Buyer role is actually very enjoyable most days (although always chaotic). You stay busy and the days go by fast.","In terms of pay, young college grads are taken advantage of. I made more money as an intern in college. Some Assistant Buyers make 10k more a year than other ABs even though their jobs are EXACTLY the same. 

A lot of buyers are young (mid 20s) and have absolutely no previous management experience. Things move too fast here for them to actually have time to be coached on how to manage. In turn, these buyers do not know how to give credit to their assistants (who do most of the work) and they're only looking out for themselves. The buyer gets all the recognition even if the assistant does all the work or comes up with a creative idea.

There's not enough communication between merch and creative. Neither side knows exactly what the other side's job truly is, so merch points fingers at creative for timeline issues, and creative points the finger at merch.

It was a downward spiral, however. I just want to give a word of advice for creatives out there looking for work--especially those of you who may be looking at zulily. Try very hard to find something better. Seriously. Heed my warning in conjunction with all of the reviews on this page. 

Zulily's creative managers, at least the ones I dealt with most often, had no idea what the creative process is. It has an ebb and a flow that was incorrectly measured by how much work one can get done in a day. When I first started, all of my managers knew the ins and outs of copywriting & editing. By the time I had to leave, the manager of the department was a former coffee shop manager who had no clue what we did despite sitting in on shadows with her team. In fact, while working on special projects, I was consistently belittled when offering my expertise in the writing field, often with passive-aggressive attempts from my manager to get me to agree with her inexperienced opinion.

The pay is low. The creative employees are expendable. This was iterated to me almost verbatim, even from HR. 

If this is what you have to do, I wish you luck and godspeed. The professional experience and potential resume boost is worth more than they value your contributions. The company values in place at zulily only provide management the excuse to overwork you without paying you more for your time, ironically disguised as fun phrases in an attempt to make you buy into their corporate culture."

There are a lot of people in middle management that don't have e-commerce backgrounds and are in way over their heads. There's been a lot of chaos and turnover, and a lot of their issues are probably the result of growing too fast and not giving any thought to managing the growth in a smart and sustainable way.

Work/life balance is really good when you consider how fast the company is growing. Significantly better than Amazon.

There are really smart people here and you can learn a ton but you have to be open to change. The company is still very much in growth/evolution mode and you have to be ready to speak up and ask a whole lot of questions. Not a good place for you if you like structure and definitive direction.

Compensation and benefits are middle of the road relative to other companies in the industry. Equity upside is competitive for certain areas/roles. Quarterly comp discussions are encouraged. Opinions vary widely depending on your group, direct manager, etc. (as you can see from the other reviews). Have heard a lot of complaints for hourly positions. Seattle cost of living has been increasing rapidly which has been a big challenge for a lot of jobs in the area ($15 minimum wage requirement in 3 years should help!).

Executive leadership is really strong but doesn't seem to trickle down. There hasn't been as much focus on leadership/development. They are working to improve this - tons of new training programs, hiring in HR, but you still want to maintain that ""start-up"" feel - it's a delicate balance.

When I spoke on how the trainers told me that I was doing great, they said that perhaps I heard only what I wanted to hear or that they just wanted to be encouraging.

- even though a lot of talented people work here, a lot of UNtalented people work here. A lot of people who are completely unqualified for their positions. This is not an exaggeration - they are incapable of performing the most basic responsibilities associated with the positions they hold.

- Organization is horrible. While this may in some parts be attributed to the business model (many people there will claim ""how organized can a flash-sale really be?"") but there are countless instances of poor communication as the root cause for many problems. If people had follow through and integrity, much of this could be avoided. 

- there are virtually no raises. Don't even think about a cost-of-living increase yearly

- people will be promoted based on who they are buddy-buddy with far more than they will be promoted for their skills, talents, or anything else work-related they bring to the table. It's all a popularity contest. 

- directors will flat out tell you that they are only interested in cheap, replaceable labor. They don't care if there's a 1 year (maximum) shelf life for employees before they get fed up and leave. 

- The CEO was compensated 27 million dollars last year, yet refers to the company as a ""startup""

They definitely low ball and make it difficult for you to get raises.  The work load is high too.  There's also little direction from management in developing skills.
911,Zulily,If the walls could talk,2014-07-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Your peers - non-leadership peers.,"The compensation is horrid. The ""raises"" are insulting. This is not getting better. In fact, its actually getting worse. If you come in at the bottom, you stay at the bottom of the pay scale. Parking is almost $200 a month. For those that take public transportation, it's about $90. When you aren't making much, this can make a huge dent to your bottom line. 

Management - TERRIBLE. No direction. They make decisions on a whim and your entire day can get turned upside down at any moment. We spend more time writing useless recaps on things instead taking a deep dive into the business and actually impacting change. It's useless busy work and does nothing to change the pattern of how we do things. The current group of ""leaders"" in place all talk about each other negatively. In all my years in this industry, I've never seen such behavior in a professional setting. 

I haven't even been here that long and I've already seen 4 or 5 of my peers leave. People are leaving from all over the company. People are burned out, the morale is BAD (and again, management doesn't care), the compensation is a joke, - there's really not much left for people to want to stay. There's a lot of people who were here when the company started that are jumping ship. People aren't even waiting to stay until they get their stock. That says a lot. 

We took a survey to give the company feedback. The solutions for compensation and recognition that came out of that survey are ridiculous! No zulily, we do not want to work day and night and our reward is ""lunch with a member of leadership."" WE WANT MONEY!!! Or BONUSES! Or money for parking/transportation!!! Or if you can't afford any of that, a simple day off would be terrific! 

Recruiters are also incredibly active on this site. You can tell which reviews are done by them. That's all I will say.

Also, if you are planning on having a child and working here, do yourself a favor and walk away now.

They take advantage of writers who don't have other opportunities and pay them very little. Turnover is high because, once the writers realize they are worth more, they find better jobs. Management has been constantly changing and hesitant to change anything or try new things.

Advancement is nigh impossible, as only 4% of the company is eligible for a raise each quarter. Every raise has to go through the CEO and get his approval. For how much this company makes, they sure can be stingy with their lowest rung."

To be fair, they don't really get training or coaching to help them along and that's the company's fault.","zulily is like hell on earth. Okay, that's an exaggeration. But I hope I never, ever have to work at such a terrible company again. Literally every single person who sits around me pings me every week about how much they hate working at zulily and how badly they want to leave. It's an open secret that everyone is looking elsewhere. My team has an after-work study group where everyone gets together to work on resumes to submit to other companies. I have known people who quit with no job lined up because they hated it so much, they couldn't take it anymore. And these aren't just from my team - they're from departments across the company. I think the only really happy people are the developers. 

Why do employees quit? Because you're treated as expendable - ridiculously low pay, ridiculously long hours, and no appreciation. It's an open secret that in most departments, they only want you to stay for two years because it's cheaper to hire you cheap and throw you away. I know someone who was talked to about this two-year rule and then handed a book on applying to new jobs. Talk about employee appreciation!

The company will also make you work long, long hours, and make you come in on holidays without any compensation at all. I'm not even joking. When they asked me to come in and work a full day during a COMPANY HOLIDAY that most departments get to take off, I asked whether we would get extra pay, or a comp vacation day, or anything of the sort. They told me that because I was salaried, I would get nothing at all for coming in to work a full day during a holiday that they've promised employees would have off. Some of the jobs are only salaried because they figured out that it's cheaper to overwork you to death on a salary than to pay you overtime.

The CEO seems nice at first but then you realize he's out to suck people dry. There is very, very little opportunity to move up or to different departments because they hire outsiders and you're racing so fast to get everything done, you have no time to learn new skills. You'll also be lied to multiple times by the company. They'll claim they're forced by the city of Seattle to take away your sick days, they'll claim their health insurance forced them to start charging employees for their plans, it goes on and on. Don't buy any of it. It's sad to have to be so suspicious and question your company's every word, but that's how it goes when you're working here.

If you're thinking about coming to zulily for the experience and then leaving, forget about it. 1. I've watched multiple people get demoted because the company puts no effort into helping their employees grow. 2. zulily is gaining a reputation as a terrible place to work, and as a place that hires ill-qualified people because they can't get anyone better. 3. All of your coworkers are frantically trying to leave, so that position you applied to? At least three of your peers are probably trying for the same place."

Nobody wants to be on call, and some of the software that we support was, frankly, written when the company was 5 devs working 20 hours a day. We're re-writing that, but the process of replacing it is slow.

There aren't a whole lot of the little free perks that startup folks tend to expect. There is no free soda, we all pay for our own parking / bus passes, the locker room doesn't have towel service. It doesn't really get me down, but I wouldn't mind a bit more of that stuff."

-Product studio Management has no idea what they are doing.
-No real career path.

-Self induced high turn over rates.
-Defeated employees
-New people are training new people because of high turnovers. 
-Project studio manager is very intense, new, and power hungry to the point of intimidating to get what she wants. 

Here are some examples...

       --- They spent over tens of thousands of dollars on something that may not work, and bought $400 chairs to sit in for a special project (a project that i initiated), but couldn't be bothered with the idea of giving an employee of almost 2 years a 40 cent raise who had been utilized and praised for their hard work over and over. They truly do not care about their employees  i and i can not reiterate that enough.

       --- The CEO has even had notes left on his car about how poorly treated the employees are (from different departments), basically pleading for something to be done about it and not once was this ever again mentioned.

       --- Now, if  you are are just wanting to work at zulily for ""experience"" and to throw on your resume i'm just going to stop you now. In no way has it actually helped me to have zulily on my resume. In fact, its actually made it harder for me to apply for jobs as a stylist because of how poor the quality of the product looks on the site.

       --- I was told that the reason that i would not be getting a raise was that the new guy (someone hired from starbucks headquarters,  hired to be in charge of the entire studio), told my fellow employee that as a stylist he EXPECTED a high turn over rate, because stylist are considered entry level. So instead of investing in the employees and promoting them and giving them a 40 cent raise, it would be more cost efficient to just let us go and hire more people at the same terribly low rate. 

Honestly after 2 years there i could write a short story that would eventually turn into a novel about why you shouldn't work there. The problem is, you are looking for a job, and they are hiring (always). Hopefully now you know why, its not just because they are ""such a fast growing company"". Its partly due to the fact that they have to hire to grow, and have to hire to replace all the time.

So go ahead and go through the motions, but don't say you where not warned."

This was ok when the company was truly a start-up and the business needs were changing rapidly, but then it started to waste resources, distract employees, and push customer needs far down the list of priorities. Inevitably, someone at a higher level is hired from the outside and announces that they will now focus on X as if it's an entirely new revelation. No one ever seems to mention that we used to focus on X but then the CEO (or VP, or whatever) told us to stop wasting our time on it. There is a lot of passive-aggressiveness and general unwillingness to rock the boat at team leadership levels.

Promoting from within is non-existent. Which furthers the reorganization company strategy.

It is wonderful to work with such energetic and motivated people in merchandising, studio,  fulfillment, and engineering. All groups contribute to creating and improving internal systems and process so regardless of where you work you can have big impact.

zulily has also been an outstanding place for females in technology to work with very low turn over. I am proud of zulily for finding and retaining so many outstanding females in engineering and at all levels in all of the other company departments too. We are also a diverse bunch in all areas and this contributes to our strength and creativity as a team.",Your job is important and it can be stressful. The company has grown so fast and there have been definite growing pains but things have improved dramatically with project management and work loads. Things move very quickly but we have slowed down.

On my first day my new manager didn't do so much as show us around the department, then head back to her desk and had the co-workers train me. Self reliant problem solving/always new changes being made and this got frustrating sometimes because you took the blame for things that were not your fault. Also, my department as a whole got little to no recognition at team meetings.. Other manager was completely bizarre and passive, and would contradict herself. Extremely poor management skills. She had no idea what she was in for and relied on the team to carry the weight, then became VERY micromanaging almost to the point where it was pointless, and for reasons that didn't matter. She didn't ask for input from the entire team but from an individual few, and our team was less than 20 people..

 You are expected to work long hours for little pay, and this can get old. Weekend required work can be asked to happen overnight. Coworkers can be extremely cliquey and out to get each other instead of respecting each other. If you aren't a suck up or a favorite good luck.

This is a decent job for someone just out of college, but there's no room for advancement, pay is ridiculously low and the amount of work expected from each member of the team is insane. 

The merchandising department controls everything and copy really gets no pull in regards to what works for the site. There's also little to no transparency in terms of what's working/what sells, so copy has no way to know if they're doing things right or wrong.

This company is a mess that tries to excuse itself by being a ""start-up,"" but its starting its fourth year and nothing's changed. The company went public & was worth millions, but there's nothing trickling down to the people who work 50+ hour weeks to make zulily as successful as it is."

Managers are severely incompetent and provide no clear direction on career growth.  There are way too many great companies in Seattle to work for then zulily - amazon, Boeing, Microsoft, Nordstroms, REI, the list goes on.  The writing on the wall is that the company is just trying to grow exponentially fast, and cut margins whatever way possible(i.e. employee pay and benefits) so that upper management can sell the company(and the company's problems) onto someone else like Amazon.  Again, unless your just trying to pay the bills and get very basic health/dental insurance, stay away and dont waste your time.  Pay raises are unheard of, you are rewarded with a gold star, and the stock option benefit is a scam to make people believe that the low wages are compensated for by stock options.

The recent IPO has been exciting and a wonderful experience to be a part of. The opportunities for growth are pretty good. If you work hard, promotions are available. These promotions usually don't come with a big pay bump unfortunately....","The pay is horrible. There is a general sense of frustration and under-appreciation across all levels and departments, with the exception of upper management and the executives. The imbalance between what the execs are raking in and the pitiful, poverty level pay that lower level employees are making is pretty grotesque. After the recent IPO, and seeing the press releases of the ""IPO winners"", we all now know the worth of those individuals, and while we appreciate and admire the work it took to get where they are, it is very discouraging when many employees are making below $25k a year. A livable wage would be nice.....especially considering the insane amount of hours that employees put into this company to ensure that the site continues to run with new product offered every day. Extreme under-appreciation."

960,Zulily,"You are replaceable. Run, run far away!",2013-12-18,1.0,Creative,The people you work with are the only thing that kept me there as long as I stayed. We bonded over the poor working conditions and made the best of it together. Without the employees this company has nothing to offer.,"Compensation: This is quite literally a joke. I was brought on told that I would be given quarterly evaluations and raises; lies. After 6 possible reviews I was only given 3, which were all glowing and telling me how valuable I was, however not a singe penny was given. Even after our supervisor gave a presentation about how we were being paid 50% less than industry standard in any other company, they were told there would be no raises or bonuses. To solidify my worry of never making any more money,I asked some people that have been with the company from the beginning and to my surprise they have also never seen a raise. For a publicly traded company worth over 5 billion dollars, this is not only disgusting but proves how lowly they think of their employees that help build their multi-billion dollar company. 

Management/structure: Laughable on both accounts. Management is as clueless as anyone else there. They don't know what's going on everyday just like the employees that they are trying to lead. When you can see the fear and stress in you supervisor's eyes because they have no idea how we are going to get done what we need to, one starts to understand that after 4 years things haven't changed. Upper management does NOT care about structure. Even after numerous employees have tried to make a system of structure for training, job roles, etc... our upper management would never go for it because they were not interested in paying for things to change when they were making plenty of money and growing the company. 

The worst part is that certain creative management in very high positions, tell employees that come to them for raises that if they are unhappy that they are replaceable and that if they continue to ask for more money they could be put on a Personal Improvement Program to deal with not being a team player. I don't believe in telling the hard working employees that they are replaceable simply because they want to be fairly compensated for their hard work. 

I want to make it clear that I am not a disgruntled employee, I chose to leave. I chose to leave because I was told I would not see a raise anytime soon if ever. I was tired of being so stressed and doing the job of 4 people daily and never see any improvement. This company has so much potential, it's sad to see the company culture take such a drastic downfall simply because they are cheap and don't care about their employees. 

Finally, this company may be a good starting point but if you choose to work there understand it is a joke to other companies. While interviewing at other jobs I was laughed at when I told them I worked at Zulily because they are known for their lack of quality, not having any standards and the poor quality of training given to new employees. The only thing that saved me was doing work outside of work to build a real resume and portfolio."
961,Zulily,Smoke & Mirrors,2013-12-17,1.0,Assistant Buyer,"Great co-workers. If you are going to be with people 60+hrs a week in the trenches, you mind as well like them.","Poor management is by far the greatest downfall of this entire organization…perhaps, even more than the lackluster compensation. If there were qualified managers in place that actually knew how to lead teams, have a global understanding of the business, and knew how to use a computer, we might actually be able to keep people here longer than a year. The ""leadership"" team spends more time in meetings arguing with each other than actually investing any energy into finding out why the company is losing employees left and right, why morale is incredibly low, why no one has a career path …or cares too at this point, why none of the employees trust management and why we can’t hire quality people. It is embarrassing  to watch Merchandise Managers in meetings argue with each other over minuscule problems while the rest of the department sits there watching the antics go down.  All I can think is,….these are the “leaders” that I’m trusting my career with….People who care more about their ego than building a solid organization. 

Low Compensation is a huge reason why people leave. In my current role, I make about 35% less than my friends at Amazon & Nordstrom. There are no bonuses. There is no prize if your team makes their month. The buyer doesn't see any percentage of the dollars they bring in….therefore, if you are in a supporting role, you also will not. There is also no plan in place for this structure to change so if you are thinking about waiting for a respectable wage, you might want to just skip the interview process at zulily and apply directly to Nordstrom. The people that we have here from Nordstrom have made it no secret that they are simply trying to get the title of Assistant Buyer so they can leave. 

ATP Program = a program that Assistant buyers can apply to and move up to become an associate buyer. This program has become a joke. If you are a class favorite, you will get in. If you do not get in, they will put you in a “mentorship program.” This program is basically everything they teach is the ATP program. It’s a holding pin for those that were denied so that they do not quit."

If you are just out of college... and need experience this may be a good spot to start, but have an exit strategy in place and know that you will learn everything you need to know in 4-6 months, anything over that is just a waste of your time, because this company has zero strategy on how to compete in the marketplace. Also don’t trust anyone, just learn and keep quiet, Open door policy is a lie and HR is not there to support you, if anything they are 100% not there for employee support..anyone I know that went there got fired pretty quickly after... for some random reason.

Everyone in that place will stab you in the back to make themselves look good….and do it smiling, just take the movie Mean Girls and insert adult women… times that by 100…= zulily

There are teams that are awesome there, but you won’t be getting on any of those teams because those employees don’t leave. It’s the teams that are a mess that have super high turnover; this is where you will be going... Fun ride? NOT

Management is beyond incompetent (at best)... it is a revolving door... the cheaper employee takes the place of experience, management somehow finds this a good idea and promotes complete team break down and destroys employee morale.. Think circa 1980 for management style… no real flexibility but you will be working 90+ hours a week… no doubt…they will tell you that isn’t true... but it 100% is.. What makes this the worst is its unnecessary work, but management cannot figure out which way is up so this creates complete chaos and extra time sucking meetings so they can buy time to try and figure out what they are doing. They are clueless.

Go in with your eyes open, even though this company is now public doesn’t mean they don’t run it like a startup... and remember why companies like to be called start up’s... because they can get away w under pay, mismanagement and toxic behavior – they call it growing pains. I call it BS. It’s just a cop out to not fix the underlying issues, any company that covers up so much mess and acts like it’s the “norm” is not a place to start or end a career… My best day was the day I quit."

Lack of experience, lack of empathy, lack of overall knowledge of what it takes to keep your employees happy. FAVORITISM. If you are a deemed ""favorite,"" you will have what you want - raises, team moves, promotions. If you aren't, you will be denied the opportunity to move forward, and you will have absolutely no say in what your career path looks like.

Associate program - a 3 month program that allows you to be promoted from Assistant Buyer to Associate Buyer. This is a very hand-selected process where, as you could guess, all of the ""favorite"" assistant buyers are accepted. 

HR - Do they even care about the mass exodus happening currently? Everyone is currently leaving for better opportunities or applying anywhere that will take them. Quite alright I'm sure - they will just bring in a college-grad and pay them 20% less than the previous employee.

Don't be fooled.  The start up culture, weekly pep rally meetings, and alcohol in the office are all a part of management's thinly veiled attempt to keep severely under pay people.  You can drink the Kool Aid, I did for awhile, but it doesn't get you anywhere.  People are leaving in droves, the IPO has came and went and the only people any richer are Darren and Mark and other people in Senior Management.  Work here if you enjoy working hard, politicking, not being appreciated and being underpaid.

If you're used to tons of guidelines or formal processes you may not feel at home. Constant growth also means that your role or scope may change regularly, so you can never rest on your laurels - there's always some new challenge to tackle on the horizon. You'll work far more than the ordinary 40 hours a week in almost every job - but it's because you'll be creating something extraordinary. Pay for some roles is lower than market - but what we lack in $ we make up for in a really cool environment and potential growth opportunities."

The people I work with at my level and below are very talented and genuinely decent people.","The pay is well below market and most people tolerate it because they were relocating to the area and needed to take something, anything- at least, that's h ow it is in the group I joined. I knew from reading these reviews that taking a job here was a risk. However, it wasn't until a few weeks in that I realized all the problems behind the scenes. You'll hear a lot about people being empowered to lead projects and move ideas forward, but I haven't seen that. Projects that get approved are ones that fit the narrow vision of leaders. Don't expect strategic planning and reviews- things seem to be prioritized in silos with no regard to the impact on other parts of the business or long-term plans.

Awesome HR department
Warm PBR on Thursdays","""The pay is incredibly low,"" I said when I started. ""But it's a start-up. As the company grows, the salaries will too. Besides, the health insurance and paid vacation days are awesome!"" And then I started working longer hours, doing more work, week after week, until I was doing twice the normal workload for the same pay. I then went ""above and beyond"" like I was told I had to do for a raise.... nothing happened. 
""We're a start up,"" they said. ""We can't afford to give regular raises,"" they said, as the company made headlines for its successes and opened up a UK office.
""Well, at least I've still got all this vacation time!"" I said, until I realized I couldn't afford to go anywhere and  couldn't really leave without screwing over my team. I continued the long work days, taking the occasional day off just to get caught up on errands. ""At least I still have awesome health insurance!"" I said, until I realized I'd never NEEDED health insurance more in my life because I was so stressed.
Then they made their employees start covering part of the ""awesome health insurance,"" even though the company continued to grow and thrive. Then they worked our sick time into the ""paid vacation days."" Then I woke up, stopped drinking the kool aid,  realized I was working long, hard hours and couldn't even pay my bills...and I moved on to bigger and better things. And unless they get their act together and realize that true success comes from happy, productive people who want to see the company succeed because they feel valued, many qualified people will too. 
I hope things have improved since I left, as it has been awhile, but from what I am hearing this is not the case."
983,Zulily,sw engineer,2013-05-05,1.0,Software Engineer,Stock could be woth something if it makes it.,I definitely should've read the reviews before I took a job at this place. Extremely clique oriented company. First level management totally ineffective. Turnover rate high.
984,Zulily,Oh... Zulily!,2013-04-25,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"They have a knack for hiring young, smart, vivacious people that really have a passion to help the company succeed.  When you first start it's easy to drink the juice and get caught up with the extreme growth and ""incredible"" milestones.  It's a good learning opportunity for a recent graduate not quite sure about what they wanted to do.  If you do well with the ""high school"" mentality - lots of pep ralleys, cliques, and the like - then Zulily can be perfect for you!  It's not an evil place, but it is definitely not for everyone.","To give Zulily credit, I hear it's gotten better. However, be careful what you wish for. Working at a startup means that there are no set processes and things are changing all of the time. Yes, this can be exciting, but some jobs need process to be successful.  Management is ok.  There is a lot of passive agressive attitudes with the motto that ""the door is always open"" but the reality is that any feedback is likely meant with a defensive attitude or icing out afterward.  They like to tell you that there is room for growth, but that is iffy at best.  As someone who has moved on to better and brighter things, I think you should seriously consider what you're looking for.  Really try to read the people you are potentially working with and if personalities seem like a good fit, then your time at Zulily may not be all bad. Is the company going to be the wave of the future? Perhaps.... But do your research before committing. If you wonder why people have been there 2+ years... they may not be happy but they are waiting to cash out."
985,Zulily,I joined Zulily despite the bad reviews... kicking myself now.,2013-04-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Start up company, Some people are cool.  CEO is cool, schedule can be flexible, great mom focus, seeing the smiling kids is great.  Great products, sample sales, office parties... but wait... look closer.","I read the reviews before I applied.  I decided like another poster suggested to ask ""real people that work at Zulily"".  I asked the recruiters and those interviewing me about the concerning reviews.  I believed the lie.  Or maybe they lie to themselves.  I wanted to believe that ""zulily is not for everyone"" and ""if you're not a hard worker, maybe you should work elsewhere"" or ""its a startup"" and all the other spins they try to give it.  

But the bottom line is this.  They ""woo"" you to get the position filled.  Great first day orientation/overview (unless you are hired on as a contractor. In that case forget it you are just thrown right in). Everyone smiles and makes you feel welcome. 

It is not real.  Because after the first day shininess wears off... you look around and see the smiles were fake.  They don't talk to you.  You are ignored.  Unless you get invited to join a clique.  

They hire a new batch of peeps every week.  That same week... another batch is fired or quitting at the same time.  Zulily likes first day hello's.   They don't do well with goodbyes.  So when you leave it's kind of hush hush.  They don't like to talk about it. As.if.you.never.existed.  Kinda eerie.  Sometimes if you make a friend they disappear and you aren't really ""encouraged"" to focus on where they went and why.  Or you WILL be next. 

I'm amazed everyday at how much the bad reviews really are real.  I was optimistic.  And that was an error on my part.  I am a hard worker.  I like fast paced.  But I like being treated like I'm human with value a lot more.  

I'm here now... but not for much longer.  I know this review will disappear like the other negatives ones and will be slowly replaced with the glowing reviews orchestrated to boost the company image to outsiders. I'm not trying to bash zulily.  I honestly really love the concept and I love Darrell's leadership.  I don't blame Darrell for not knowing how bad it can be.  He hired management to handle things and sadly, if he could see the ""real"" behind the scenes I think he would be shocked and appalled.  Quality customer service should be given to the employees as well."

We want this company to be the biggest thing out there, and i will deff be a part of this as 2013 is gonna be huge! We want you to leave the same way you came in. Our motto is "" Safety is my obligation to myself and to others"". We have a modest turnover ratio because associates point out (attendance). You cant force people to come to work.

Im excited about what lies ahead for the company and so should you.","I honestly cant believe some of this negativity thats being said in some of these reviews.Yes we work alot of hours but we dont force anyone to apply here. People want overtime and complain. Then we are on 8 hr shifts and people complain because theres no overtime. I guess the reason employees dont stay is because they dont have the patience to continue to see us grow. Alot of people think everything can change overnight. Sorry folks, doesnt work like that.

989,Zulily,Best place I've ever worked,2013-04-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"So much opportunity - zulily is growing very quickly. While that does mean some growing pains from time to time (and outgrowing spaces), it also means that every day is exciting and there's always something new around the bend. All of this growth is happening because we're building something great. 

Leadership  team - all of the most senior people at zulily are incredibly smart and great at what they do. They're also humble and accessible. 

Unique copmany - I'm not aware of another company that's so strong as a retailer, an online presence and a tech company all at once. zulily is a great place for people who want to work and grow in a variety of roles, from developers to buyers to marketers to analysts to photographers.","The company is still only three years old.

Otherwise, it's an incredible place to work with a fun work hard/play hard culture."
991,Zulily,It depends...,2013-04-03,4.0,Marketing,"I am a current employee in the marketing department and just read through all of the reviews for zulily on glassdoor.  Lotta haters out there and a few people who love the place.  So who do you trust?

I still work at zulily so you shouldn't trust me, but here's my best attempt at an unbiased review to provide another perspective to anyone who is looking at zulily as a potential workplace:  

I don't think zulily is for everyone.  

It's a great company and has experienced hyper growth (which is a little addictive), but with that hyper growth comes alot of growing pains and can result in some ""misses"" (which are pretty well documented in reviews here).  I think that the extreme negative comments are valid and fair because people who wrote them likely had a really bad experience and feel pretty jilted; however, my observation *on the whole* is that people are pretty happy and excited about what's going on here, flexible in dealing with issues that come up and creative about figuring out how to resolve problems, and hopeful to see where this thing goes.

Personally, I have been here for 2+ years, have experienced a lot of growth (both professionally and as part of the company), and have learned more here than at several past companies combined.  I get to work on interesting projects with really smart, motivated people who share a common goal of creating a fun user experience and making zulily a preeminent brand.  That's pretty cool.

On the flip side, this place can be tough.  With hyper growth comes big expectations and stress, and for people who aren't passionate about owning and driving something forward it can be overwhelming.  You are expected to hit the ground running and be smart about how you prioritize your work and spend your time (at least, in marketing), and I (and a few others I know) tend to be my own worst critic feeling like I have never quite accomplished enough.

But that's the type of person that I think will do well here.  Someone who is hungry and motivated by a challenge and who wants to be part of something bigger.  I've worked at a couple of jobs before zulily, both big and small companies, and never really felt like I had the ability to impact the bottom line.  Here is much, much different.  I've probably never worked as hard as I have here, but I've also definitely never had as much fun, since I know that I'm making a difference.","I shared both pros and cons above.  Don't box me in, dude.

I will say, though, that if you're trying to find out what zulily is really like, don't rely on anonymous postings on glassdoor.  Look up the company on LinkedIn and talk to a real person."
992,Zulily,Don't believe the negative comments - not real,2013-03-28,4.0,Warehouse Associate,"Growing company that is providing a good solid opportunity for those employees who have a strong work ethic.  We do work really hard, but we do it to make the customers real happy.  Sure there are challenges, but you have the chance to make things better each and every day.  People should spend time making things better instead of complaining all the time.  I will work here as long as they will have me.  I also get my exercise in each day so that is an added benefit.",I have no cons about working here.

Some upper management is from other very successful companies from the Seattle area, of both past start ups, but also large existing companies.  

A creative atmosphere of folks both young and old.","Severe lack of structure.  Lack of true managers/leaders.  Often found that leads/managers who have no idea how to truly lead people and get the best out of them. Positions based on tenure and not qualities and requirements to meet the stated position.  

Until this year, lack of paid maternity leave from company (from a company that promotes children/moms).  2013 brought maternity leave but cuts in other medical benefits.  

Overworking employees.  They are growing quickly, and instead of hiring ahead to keep up pace, they over work staff until they quit.  Often being quickly replaced with entry level employee with lower salary and lack of experience.  Waves of temps come in, only for them to only last days or weeks and find yourself working 50-60 Hour work weeks, and 6-7 days a week.  No compensation for this additional time worked, even for employees in lower level jobs that HR states does not require these additional hours worked.  

Employees are treated as they are disposable.  No on-boarding program to set up new employees for success within the company.  Trail by fire often causes huge issues and rely on coworkers to resolve issues . 

Pushing changes out before realizing repercussions company wide. This happens both at a tech level but also process level.  Only to back peddle or rush to find another resolution causing continuous delays and headaches."

1007,Zulily,Seeing the dream vanish into thin air.,2012-09-16,1.0,Associate,The company is still in its infancy so there is a great amount of potential for business establishment and ideas. The volume is increasing exponentially so there is definitely hours to work. No one is getting laid off due to lack of volume. The CEO's of the company seem very personable and are humbled each and every time they enter a distribution center and see their dream become reality.,"The company is lost. There is no solid management structure and there are too many executives hoping to get their claim to fame from their past experiences. the business is completely ran from previous experiences and mentorship from Amazon.com. The general manager operates from a desk that has semi-visual through still shot cameras that feed live in various parts of the building. There are too many meetings and not enough floor time. The Zulily supervisors operate in a manner that they are holding up a desk and not managing their people. each Zulily supervisor has their favorite person or group and spend the entire day socializing and treating those individuals as first-class cistizens. They ""deserve"" not to have to work like the rest of the crew and spend a good deal of the day not working and B.S.ing with their management supporter. 

Programs such as the ""lead program"" were put in place in January and were implemented before the program was created. Leads did not have to go through any form of interneship or qualification panel. They were chery picked by the operations and general manager with no notice to the rest of the crew. This created huge animosity and resentment in the building and Intellisource (the consulting counterpart of Zulily) was left holding the baton of poor employee morale. 8 weeks was promised to these leads and then they would receive a raise. Almost 40 weeks later management decided they made a mistake and chose to implement a new lead program that announced advancement opportunity to everyone and put the current acting leads in a pressured and difficult position. Only two of the 8 acting leads actually received the position and the others were forced to step down and received no compensation for their 40+ week efforts. This shows poor management and organizational implementation.

Intellisource is extremely improfessional. Zulily can be excused for their shortcomings for many reasons but the biggest one being that they are only 2 1/2 years old. Intellisource has been around for 13 years and Zulily is not their first client. You would think they would know and understand what it is the client is looking for and hire based on those needs. No. Intellisource clams to hire people that fit in but have fired numerous of their associates with no warning for not ""fitting in"" regardless of their contribution to both companies. They act like every HR responsibility is a brand new thing and they have never done it before. They can't pay people right, benefits are retro charged three and four weeks out to employees even if they sign up for benefits before their seniority, they can't keep track of simple attendance measurements, and they are constantly finding other reasons to not engage with employees in a genuine manner. The one HR supervisor they had that was doing these things right they fired because management was intimidated by the work ethic of that individual. I will never feel the same about either company. They get rid of the people that do the job and keep those that don't."
1008,Zulily,Worked in FAR worse! Zulily is AMAZING!,2012-09-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I read a lot of the posts that have been posted on here and coming from a strong management background myself, I would say that most of these issues are about the employee not the employer.  Zulily provides incredible benefits! I was hospitalized recently, and not only was Zulily incredibly understanding and overly compassionate, but my HUGE medical bill was chopped down to $350 with my benefits!! Not only that, but I pay NO monthly premium for my benefits.  That has been unheard of in my previous employment....especially since one of my ""dream jobs"" had no benefits what so ever.  

Zulily is only 2 1/2 years old, so they are STILL a start up.   I think people get the impression because of it's size and how many people are employed that they are a well established company when it comes to their processes.  They are still developing those systems and those systems are in constant development.  What is so nice about those systems being in development, is that you can give feedback and that feedback is ACTUALLY received.  If any of you have worked in a large company before, you know that those kinds of changes do NOT get heard.  

 I think to be successful here at Zulily, you need to be an entrepreneur  yourself.  You need to be a self-starter and someone who knows how to ask questions, find answers and also find solutions.  If you are expecting someone to hand you a to-do list everyday and have things be the same day in and day out...well then Zulily is not for you.  And when I say an Entrepreneur....I do not mean a business owner.  Just because you at one point owned a failing business does not make you an Entrepreneur.   Zulily has the potential of having a large pay off for it's employees...but that doesn't come easy and without a HUGE amount of hard work.  Do you think the first 500 people of Microsoft had a work life balance?! The answer is most likely YA RIGHT!!   There have been PLENTY of people who have been promoted here at Zulily....so that statement is false.  But like any company, they have a budget and only so many positions so not everyone can be promoted.","I do agree there can be clicks here at Zulily.  But the company does try it's best to through social engagements to help people get to know each other.  But remember people, this is a BUSINESS not a HIGH SCHOOL! You do not need to be besties with everyone you work with! 

I also know that there are departments other than my own that work extreme hours.  I do think those departments NEED help to allow them the same work life balance that some other get.  I do believe the company is working on hiring in those areas.  

Too many people are too passionate and think they have ULTIMATE say over a situation. This is both a positive and a negative, but it just means that people need to communicate and work things out....which for the most part I think people do."
1009,Zulily,"Clearly not ""Zulily"" Enough",2012-09-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Zulily continues to grow at an exceptional pace and there are opportunities for recent graduates that are hard to find at more established companies - if you get in at the right time. If you are looking for something that adds to your resume, Zulily can be a great opportunity. The workforce is young and smart, and yes, drinks a lot. I found most people to be really friendly and willing to help and answer questions. There are a lot of people that come from some of the most successful and established companies in the Seattle area, and having their wealth of knowledge at your fingertips is remarkable.

It is a ""cool"" place to work if you want to be free labor and model for their website or take photo shoots with your coworkers. Also being able to do the employee sample sale is amazing.","As most of the reviews before have mentioned Zulily workers are stressed out and under paid. You do have opportunities in a start up that you won't have other places... HOWEVER most of those opportunities have already passed.  Make sure you're going into a really small department or else you'll just be stuck on the bottom rung of the ladder no matter what they promise you. The pay is a joke, and if you're paid hourly you have to work tons of overtime to make a living wage. If you bring this up to management they just talk about how great the benefits are (which are ok if you're young and single).  

There is no structure - right when you think there is a system for doing something they change it up and you have to start over from the beginning. No one keeps track of this, so everyone is running around as if their heads are chopped off.  

My experience was different as I felt like they never fired anyone, even people who were completely incompetent.  Or if they didn't like someone, they would drown them with work until they were forced to quit for their own mental sanity. They keep temps on forever, even if it is clear that they are not working out.  

It is VERY cliquey and if you are not part of the ""In-crowd"" good luck moving up. Even if you are a part of the ""in-crowd"" despite promises, you probably won't move up either. 

Overall:  It was a decent job to have, I hear other departments (like customer service) were much worse than the one I was in.  Don't stay for the stock benefits - just find a job that pays better and within a year you'll probably make the same amount.  

ALSO NO GOOD FOOD OPTIONS NEARBY AND PARKING IS TERRIBLE, METRO IS NOT REIMBURSED."
1010,Zulily,The worst company around.  I hated this place.,2012-09-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you just got out of college, are having trouble finding another job, need a little work experience to pad your resume, don't mind not having a life outside of work, want to see no professional growth in spite of the many hours that you are spending at the office, and enjoy drinking beer/wine/hard alcohol at the office, zulily might just be your place.  The only redeeming thing about zulily is that there are a number of great people who also somehow ended up stuck there that you will have the opportunity to work with.","I had no intention of every writing a review about zulily until I read the ""These are tough reviews..."" review.  But now I must.  ""[R]eferences to management - may not be perfect, but they have incredible integrity, work incredibly hard and are talented""?  Things that I saw happen on a regular basis at zulily:  a) employees being terminated with little or no notice practically on a weekly basis, b) employees being grossly overworked and underpaid and employees not being paid the overtime that they rightfully deserved, c) before new buyers came on board existing buyers would claim vendors, seemingly with the blessing of management, ensuring that new buyers could not contact them [making it more difficult for new buyers to be successful as the pool of new vendors was depleted], d) blatant favoritism, e) vendors being asked to produce items specifically for zulily events, only to have the event cancelled and be left holding the bag on all of the specially produced merchandise just days before the event was scheduled to start.  One day when I went down to ask a question I actually witnessed a director level employee on another team access his previous employers internal/vendor website, which he had somehow retained access to, and copy and paste information from that site to a document that he was producing for zulily.  I can tell you with total certainty that the management at zulily is anything but a group with ""incredible integrity [who] work incredibly hard and are talented""

I could go on and on about the terrible benefits, awful"
1011,Zulily,Terrible management,2012-09-03,1.0,Picker,It's a start up so you would think that means plenty of room for advancement. Benefits are alright if you are single.,"Zulily outsources it's manpower for it's warehouses in Nevada and Ohio. First when you get hired you don't actually work for Zulily not directly anyway, but the department supervisors do work for Zulily so there is a disconnect there. We all feel like we are just a bunch of temps even though after your three month probationary period you are ""hired on permanently"" everyone feels like they are pretty much expendable and can be fired at any moment. When we have mandatory Saturdays all of the intellisource employees minus the hr department are all required to show up. However the management take turns and operate on a skeleton crew. When I asked why they didn't do this for everyone they said it was because we are paid hourly and they are on salary. That's just not right  to me. There are plenty of double standards to go around that apply to us that do not apply to the management. One example is cell phones and food/drink on the floor. I agree with both policies but they should apply to everyone in the warehouse. The management can bring both on the floor whenever they want but the rest of us can't. We can't even have our cell phones in the break room while we are on our lunch break we have to go outside to use them. Like I said I agree with banning cell phones and food/drink on the floor but it should go for everyone not just peons. The only two people I can see having cell phones on the floor are the general manager and the operations manager. 

Leadership is pretty nonexistent I doubt any of the supervisors or managers know what the word means. Instead of the supervisors actually taking care of the people in their departments they take care of their favorites and try to find ways to fire people who challenge them. One person was fired because the supervisor sent him home for the day then told HR which is intellisource that he walked off and abandoned the job. The HR department which is intellisource the company which supplies the work force except for the managers isn't much better when you ask them a question you get the feeling that they are just bsing you to get you to leave them alone. 

The benefits are alright if you are single or don't need insurance for your family then it is really expensive. Most of the people can't afford insurance for their families because it is almost half your pay check every week. I don't know what the 401k is like because it doesn't kick in until you have been there for a year.

As far as family or a personal life goes they don't seem to care at all there are a few months in the year that are ""blacked out"" meaning the only way to take a day off or leave early for say a doctors appointment or an emergency is to take a point. Once you reach 8 points you are fired. I have always prided myself on my attendance but the fact that we get punished for having any kind of life at all and taking care of ourselves and our families is just wrong to me. I understand they are in the business to make money and I don't fault them for that at all but it seems to me to have a successful business you need to 1') offer a service or product that people want to buy and 2.) take care of your employees. The employee turnover rate is horrendous I know sometimes you need to hire 10 people before you find one good one. But you also want to retain the good ones not alienate them. Everyone knows that every company runs on the people at the bottom that do most of the work, that doesn't mean they are your slaves and you can treat them like they don't matter."
1012,Zulily,"Hired, fired, and everything in between",2012-08-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great coworkers, nice insurance benefits","I though this was an amazing company to get in with at the ground level. As the months went by however, it seems the mask fell and zulily showed its true face. The turnover and reasons for the company firing people are astonishing. Coworkers were walking around paranoid that it was their job on the line at any given moment, thus resulting in an unsatisfactory and uncomfortable work environment. I was personally told by HR that I should volunteer to do any extra projects that were talked about, no matter the time limitations of the day. If my work was not completed, no worries, ""That's why you have a laptop, take it home."" I read recently that they claim to have 5 million members, funny I think they have just as many former employees. I've seen almost all of them come and go. 

They brag that they are a friendly, easygoing company with a stellar work environment. Gym, kegs, and hard alcohol are all a part of everyday life at zulily, just ask them, better yet just read the employees facebook posts! Interestingly enough, I had a health procedure that required medication. My boss told me that coming to work with pain killers in my system was not professional and would not be appropriate (reminder:desk job requiring no heavy machinery) , despite a written doctors note. It was however, acceptable to have hard alcohol and sip whiskey at my desk. I did not understand that one at all.

 If you are ""in"" with certain management you will be safe on a day to day basis, but this can change in a heartbeat if someone higher up decides they don't like you on a whim. And whatever you do make sure you have the CEO's P.A. like you, or your job will end up on the chopping block. The vacation time is a joke. Everyone is so paranoid about getting fired, and the upper management acts like you're asking them to chop off their own foot when you request time off, that no one who values their job, will take it.  

If I had it to do all over again, I would have never applied here in the first place. Bad management, bad environment. Worst career move I will ever make."
1013,Zulily,You must drink the Kool Aid,2012-08-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"So many meetings you'll only spend about 28 hours a week doing work.These meetings are where the Kool Aid is dispensed, bring a big cup and a set of blinders so that you only see the things they are telling you.","Because of the number of meetings you have to attend you will never have enough time to complete the work assigned to you. You'll fit right in though if your complaints are that your team is understaffed, and no one has any time to complete work. These meetings are typically recorded and could be watched later, when time allowed, but management would never OK that for anyone without the title of manager or above. Management also tends to lack effective communication skills, for example they will send e-mails littered with misspellings, yet complain about properly worded and punctuated replies to other employees in the company. It is an absolute mess there."

HR was very upfront and honest about the fast pace of the company during initial interviews.","60+ hour workweeks are the norm though the pay doesn't reflect this. Expectations are really high but priorities are always changing. No matter what you do, you feel as though you are always behind. Middle management provided little support and guidance.

The weekly company meetings felt like more like pep rallies than actual constructive discussions. While all of my coworkers were tremendously friendly and always appeared upbeat, I've never seen such a drained workforce. 90% of the time if you ask a coworker what their weekend plans are, they'll reply with ""Sleep!"""
1018,Zulily,The culture is great.  The pay not so much...,2012-05-18,2.0,Not In Merchandising!,"Working at zulily is a top-notch learning opportunity.  This is my first ""real"" job out of school and I learn so much every day that I think working here is going to end up being far better than going to grad school in my field. I really enjoy my co-workers and sit in meetings wondering how I got to be in a room with such knowledgeable, approachable people.  Things are evolving so fast that I get to morph job functions about every 8-10 weeks, which has been just great for the development of my professional skills.  You can't get that anywhere else, folks.

Overall the culture is fun and relaxed, but people work hard.  Most people in other departments work longer hours than my position requires.  I should note that many of the reviews on here were written just before a major internal restructuring in the merchandising department that seems to have improved morale.  Everyone in merchandising seems a lot less stressed these days.","Given that I don't seem to be experiencing the same drain on my personal time as everyone else, the pay is really the only drawback here.  I was shocked to log on to this site and see how much less I'm making when compared with people in comparable jobs throughout the company.  I really, really want to stay here and see this place get built from the ground up, but I just don't know if I can now.  Definitely do your research and bargain hard in your salary negotiations if you're coming to work here."

Mysterious firings and mass lay-offs. If you are in the buying team and don't make your quota then your head may be on the chopping block. One can be management's best friend one day and then the next day fed to the sharks. Please read the other reviews because all that are/were dissatisfied have really written pretty accurate accounts as to how the place is. What is puzzling are the glowing reviews when misery is day to day at the company. Sure, management tries to cheer up employees but in form of hard alcohol instead of benefits, pay raise, and incentives. The thing that is really disturbing is when a very close team member is working right next to you and then minutes later they are gone forever. Don't let the cuteness of the company fool you into a ""fun"" job."

It is so much fun to be a part of history in the making with Zulily.  Is it hard work?  Yes!  Long hours sometimes?  Yes!  This place is not for people looking to fly under the radar or someone who is looking to kick back and not make an impact.   Zulily thrives on driven, talented and creative individuals who are passionate about their roles and LOVE being a part of a dynamic group of individuals.   We are a start up, so there are going to be growing pains and bumps in the road.  If you can see the forest beyond the trees, you are a visionary and we want you!!  
Leadership is an talented group of people with backgrounds from all different companies.   They are open to ideas and support their team.   Nothing takes very long to come to fruition.  Change happens and often things don't stay the same for long.   We roll with the punches and get the job done.
I am SO proud to be a part of this company and to be so openly supported by leadership and the team I work with.   It""s not perfect, but it's the perfect place for me.   I truly look forward to coming to work each day.  There is so much happening, the days and weeks just fly by.   Never a dull moment and always a fun surprise around the corner.

Zulily is an incredible company.   Come share in the fun!",Sometimes there are long hours and working from home.  Working on a work/life balance is a top priority.
1023,Zulily,Pay is low. There is no growth. There is no work life balance,2012-04-18,1.0,,Great place for experience if you are fresh out of college. This place hires a lot of young people many for whom this would be there first serious job.,"I said above that Zulily is a great place for experience but please don't confuse experience for growth. This company does little internal promotion or employee development. I took a significant pay cut from my old employer in exchange for a promise of growth. Growth that I am not receiving even though I exceed my expectations every single day. There are a lot of people here who have a lot of potential but instead of vesting growth opportunity, Zulily's attitude seems to be that they don't expect you to be here for ever. Why would any company want that?

Pay is low. Not even median for the city. 

There is no work life balance. Everyone seems to work 60+ hours a week in the office and you go home and work some more. If you are not at home you are checking your email on your phone. I even check my email when I am on the treadmill at the gym and sadly I know others who so the same thing. Not because they are workaholics... no we don't want to be. Zulily seems to keep hiring people so they can do more. Instead they need to hire people to help take the load off of there underpaid and overworked employees."

I have flexible working hours - coming in when I need to for the core hours of the day and leaving when I need to pick up the kids or go to a T-Ball game.  I love having the opportunity to manage my own day.","The bar is high here, so if you are not used to managing your own efficiency, it may take a little longer to hit your stride.  We have grown extremely quickly (which is a GREAT thing!) and are now at the tipping point between the ""Mom and Pop feel"" and the structuring needed for a mid-sized start-up company.  The ""mom and pop"" feel is something that is hard to give up, especially for the folks who have been here from the beginning.  Currently, everybody seems to be on the same page with our growth and the needs for more structure.  Now is an excellent time for opportunity with the implementation of a new layer of management, which has created smaller teams, offering more focus along with more effective leadership.  Maybe knowing that we all really do have a voice at zulily has not been properly communicated in the past, but it is absolutely being proven now, especially with our most recent initiatives."

An ignorance of sensible operations practices craters most good intentions.  The chaos you'd expect at a start-up is not leavened by a smart, young management team, since low pay ensures low performance in most areas.  The reviewer who states 'these people are the smartest I've seen anywhere"" really hasn't worked many places is all I can say.  Managers often make decisions for the purpose of self-promotion, rather than the good of the company or their teams.  Basically, this place is silly.

Which is fine if your work and your time are appreciated. There is no work-life balance. You are expected to put in 60+ hours while being payed for 40 hours. The turnover is scary high. People are leaving left and right - both voluntarily and involuntarily. It's not unusual to see a long term employee - both directector/exec level and entry level - get squeezed out by someone new who is more concerned with their own success than the success of the company. Zulily is a potentially great company and it is growing so fast, but the execs seem to be more concerned with growth than anything else. I could easily see the company falling apart from too rapid of growth without focusing on the bigger picture. The quality of their products seem to be faltering as well. The complaints from customers about unexplainable cancelled orders and ill-fitting or poor quality products is becoming a really large problem. I hope they can pull it together and get good quality managment in there to turn some things around. This isn't a very happy place to work.

Compensation seems pretty competitive and benefits are pretty good (unless you're married or have a family- get ready to pony up the cash for them!!).  The CEO is fantastic and makes every employee feel valued.  Weekly company meetings (lead by CEO) to review growth & new business ventures make you feel really in touch with what's happening in the company.  Growing very fast, and seems to be heading towards a financially solid state.  The teams are packed with phenomenal people and you will fall in love with all of your co-workers.  The overall vibe and culture of the company is fun, fast, a little chaotic, but enjoyable nonetheless.","Overall company morale is LOW!  They sell you on this amazing idea and get you super jazzed about your job and then completely flip the script on you.  Although the CEO seems like a really amazing guy, it's hard to understand why he has the Senior Leaders in place that he does.  It seems that many of them have absolutely no clue how to manage people (especially the size of the teams they are required to manage).   They recently hired a VP of HR, so hopefully she'll be able to remedy some of these management problems, but I wouldn't hold your breath.  A zulily mug/jacket/t-shirt is cool to have (while you still work there), but I'd much rather hear a ""Good Job"" or ""Here's what I think you should do differently to be more successful.""  

Employees are consistently dropping like flies and nobody ever seems to know why since there is absolutely no communication around the status of your fallen comrades.  One day you'll be working with somebody fantastic and then you literally turn around and they are no longer there.  If you ask your manager about it they react as if you just clubbed a baby seal.  (""You should be more worried about your performance and stop focusing on other people"").  Way to create a positive team atmosphere!!  Managers definitely play favorites; It might be you on Tuesday but watch out because you might be canned by Friday.

Expectations are HIGH and constantly changing.  You might think you're doing a bang-up job, but you're most likely wrong.  Odds are you'll never know because they seem to believe in the policy of ZERO feedback:  Positive, Negative, Constructive…nothing.  They might tell you if you're wearing a cute outfit though.  (Gee, thanks!).  

You can also forget about training.  It seems they firmly believe in the ""sink or swim"" philosophy.  That's totally understandable in the start-up world, but onboarding is absolutely terrible.  You can likely expect your first few weeks (or months) to be filled with mass confusion.  Most of the other employees are fairly new as well (or still don't know what's going on) so good luck with getting any answers from them.  If you ask your division leader questions (if they ever find the time of day to speak to you) chances are they will act as if you're wasting their time.  They are really good at one thing:  making you feel stupid (believe me, there ARE stupid questions).  I understand they are busy - but as leaders a big part of their job should be to make their employees feel valued.  

My best advice:  Avoid at all costs.  Don't drink the kool-aid.  Get out before you get in.  If you do end up joining, take a look at the person to your right and then the person on your left.  Chances are they're looking for a new job too.  (Or will be without one fairly soon)."
