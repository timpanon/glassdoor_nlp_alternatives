3,eBay,Work here if you want to commit suicide,2022-04-06,1.0,Software Engineer,"Compensation, Nothing else, Nothing else, Nothing else, Nothing else","I gave one star for the compensation, but eBay makes sure every penny you get paid is earned by you by draining you with work, without even letting you to finish your on boarding. I was asked to finish my on boarding training after business hours and was asked to provide an estimate on tickets on my first week at work. 
To summarize, toxic environment, bad work culture that doesn't care about employee's personal life, negative work life balance, discrimination, unnecessary escalations and design meetings everyday that run for hours and nothing productive during those hours wasting developer's time. 
Manager has no clue about any projects and only wants to finish the projects before the timeline cutting short the development process. Every manager wants to be a hero in this company by making the managees work extra hours day and night and during weekends, taking away time from family."
4,eBay,Opportunties to be realized with good leadership team,2022-04-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,eBay has lots of opportunities as an ecommerce platform.,Teams are not really very good at execution.
5,eBay,Good company - difficult role,2022-04-05,3.0,GCX Risk Teammate II,Good salary. Great team mates. Management are approachable. Good benefits and bonus structure.,Very busy call centre with mostly angry and frustrated customers. Repeat contacts and being unable to solve most queries makes your day long and draining. Micro management of every second of your shift is not the role you are sold. You are not a specialist but a drone and you need thick skin. Stats are insanely difficult with calls being cold transferred to you from all lines of business. No time allocated to raise escalations or even try to resolve queries. Soon you start to dread your day but have to face it as you need your salary.

Was required to cover other departments without immediate notice or training 
Unrealistic expectations set which caused several burnouts with employees"
12,eBay,Toxic environment,2022-04-04,1.0,Account Manager,"To be very honest, the pros are minimal.","The company attempts to advertise itself as a forward thinking modern place of work. It has strived to create an image that goes along with what companies seem to think employees want. But what is that?

Well, if we take Google as the pinnacle, we can establish that people ideally want to work for a company that promotes:

- Work life balance
- Communication
- Great Benefits 
- Trust
- Room for growth
- Inclusivity

And maybe most importantly, an erasure of the idea that you will end up on your deathbed realising you spent your days in some kind of a drab, grey office cubicle punching numbers til you could punch out.

eBay promises all of this. But, trust me, the promises are baseless. Sure, every document your sent will be coated in bright primary colours. Sure, they send you a 'goody bag' when you join - but do you really need another tote bag? Sure, they'll offer you a four week sabbatical after four years of work - go you! Ignore the fact that other companies are adopting four day work weeks and introducing unlimited holiday days. Never mind them. Look at these bright colours. Sure, you'll get healthcare, but not *really*, and no dental, and not too much, you're not sick are you? We're really busy this week, I don't think we can afford you being ill?

In reality, working for eBay may once have been a dream job for some, and sure, it looks fun, have you seen how they advertise to their customers? Everyone looks so happy? But the sad truth is, eBay has never taken the time to invest in the creation of a progressive work environment that can can meet the needs of a modern workforce. 

They're too big now. They don't have to. Believe me when I say this: You're a number, you can be replaced and they know it. But not only do they know it, they laud it over you at every opportunity available to them. 

Requesting time off becomes an apologetic chore. You can't just *take* time off. You need a reason. And, when or if it's approved, it's done so as 'a courtesy'. But, I mean obviously they do this, you *should* feel guilty for taking some well earned holiday days off. Shouldn't you? You're leaving your team to finish the already unachievable workload without you. How dare you? 

The freedom to be creative, individual and autonomous is a lie too. You're timed. Everything you do is timed. What do I mean? Well, there is a little stopwatch type clock that appears for every task/email/project/call/break/lunch, heck, I wouldn't be surprised if they knew how long you took to go to the bathroom.

Every single thing that you do is timed and sometimes your screen will be sporadically recorded so that they can monitor the exact goings-on. You will not be notified when your screen is recorded and you won't even be notified if they request to record your screen 100% of the time. Which they do if you they believe you're not working 'the eBay way'. 

Whats the eBay way? Well the eBay way is their way of saying you're not popular enough amongst the team. Because oh, yeah I forgot to mention, your ability to do your job with any kind of competency is irrelevant. You just better have a smile on your face at all times, your zoom camera on, and your undeniable love for eBay on display at all times. 

We don't want your opinions. We don't want to know how you think things can be done better. We don't even really want to know if you've witnessed some kind of not-okay sexually aggressive communication by another member of staff.

Which, unfortunately, I did, and I reported it. And I was ignored. And ignored. And ignored. And then told, that it was probably already looked after... sure, okay.. then why is the message still visible to everyone on the team? Why do I have to go to HR alone? Why did you lie and tell me you've already done something about this? You should help right? Am I going mad, or is that not apart of your job?

Whether you're male or female, no one should have to bear witness to any kind of unapologetically misogynistic behaviour and, no one should have to watch their management team ignore it either.

No one should feel like they have to deal with something like that on their own.

This place, its great if you can sacrifice a lot. Your morals to customers - it'll be implied to remove negative reviews for top sellers. Your dignity - each team is a club, teams are small, your manager expects to be treated like a God and if s/he doesn't like the cut of your jib, not only will you hear about it, but you'll feel it too. You may even be punished for it. All those bonus' you're promised? Well they take into consideration your 'enthusiasm' for the company. What does that mean? That my friend, means it's a cult. And you'll be isolated just like a cult. Your not introduced to other teams or managers or anyone really. The hierarchy is kept purposefully ambiguous. 

Okay, your not gonna be asked to drink any cool-aid. No. That would cost money. Buy your own cool-aid. Better yet, say your going to buy some cool-aid and never come back."

It's great at first, then the members constantly angry at you because of misinformation given to them or promises made to them that are not followed through and the stress of trying to get other lines of businesses to do their job just to be met with hang ups and disconnects catches up after a while. 

The lack of advancement opportunities subjects you to the issues I mentioned above keeps you in a cycle of the above mentioned day in and day out.

Only thing is that if you are not working as frontline inbound then micro management may be is less. So try to get a role in commerical department however dont expect high pay either.,"1) Pay is too low . When you tell somebody you work at ebay and they realise what we do and how much we get paid. They get shocked. I was told we are doing a slavery for so little pay.
2) Neoptish and even only favors Irish. They dont give higher grade or even better role to foriegners . They say they are muticultural but it is not true.
3) If you like to go for another role it may need 10 tries even to get an another role and it is possible that it would be same pay for the new role too. They dont give pay rise if you get a new role in same company. 
4) In commerical department there is less micro management but any other department specially front line its too much micromanagement. 
5) If you need a loo break if you spend more than 10 mins in whole day you will be draged for 121 to explain. Now i was told once by TL to take potty or loo breaks only in give breaks as per schedule of the day. 
6) No free food or drinks as other tech companies provide outside there.
7) They give odd times chocolates box sent out from Dealz . Yes you heard it right . Once i showed my friends what I got from my company they started laughing. Start up comanies sent better gooddies.

So many sellers we’re screwed over. Great agents started getting fired for silly reasons. People who were crap, got higher positions because they “knew someone” and outside people filled positions that some of our internal people were next in line for. Eventually eBay made it impossible to follow through with members, we put up with overseas agents lying and promising to customers and we take the fall, we have no time or opportunities to follow up and make sure things we promise get done. We are micro managed by “leaders” who are completely policy based and can’t think outside of the box, they micro manage top agents and then try to get them fired, if they think independently and do what’s best for eBay and the customer. The very thing they will hire you for at first. There is agents meanwhile that have constant issues while working from home, they will abuse leaves etc… but those people are never let go. Instead we have leadership who is insecure about teammates that are good enough to threaten their jobs and we harassment that goes unreported because we’re being intimidated by someone in power. It’s not a good place to work anymore. Just wait…. The downfall is coming."

202,eBay,Generally good product management experience,2022-01-10,4.0,Product Manager,"Some things I like about being a product manager at eBay:
- Culture: I generally like the culture; Collaborative, mean people are discouraged, I believe the leadership genuinely wants to help buyers and sellers; Lots of people have been here for many years; Global brand
- Comp: Base salary is pretty good; RSUs are low compared to other companies (although stock price doubled); 5 year sabbatical is cool
- Working / locations has gotten very flexible during the pandemic...nice
- Trend towards managed verticals (sneakers, collectibles, motors, handbags, etc) is good
- People who work for the local biz unit (i.e. UK, North America) report high job satisfaction and seem to have a good quality of life
- Short term biz outlook: Good, lots of 'found money' from advertising and managed payments","Some things I don't like:
- Shipping code: OMG things move so slowly; Lots of old legacy code
- Operations: This company needs a COO to fix things; API dev sandbox doesn't work; Quarterly planning bureaucracy is ridiculous; Small changes require way too much discussion
- Very poor diversity: Staff isn't representative of our buyers and sellers; There seems to be a huge bias in product and eng towards hiring people from India (usually by managers who are from India)
- Many of the eng and product team don't use eBay and therefore don't understand customer needs
- People who work in product and eng report lower job satisfaction (not terrible, but lower than local biz unit) indicative of work load + pain in shipping code
- Product mgr turnover was high in 2021; Lots of people I know left
- Long term biz outlook: We need more buyers...losing the youth market"

207,eBay,"Lots of promises, no delivery",2022-01-06,1.0,Customer Service Representative,The ability to work from home.,"The company constantly promises growth internally, including with pay. I have been promised a promotion 4 different times in a year with no differences. My performance has been praised, with nothing but a ‘nice’ to show for it. Very demotivating. 

When reaching out to management for questions or concerns, if you are lucky enough to get a response, it is often responded with a false promise to follow back up. 

They rave about their amazing benefits, when I have had much much better benefits at every other company I’ve worked for. I’ve never paid so much for Dr visits in my life. WITH insurance. 

They do not care about their employees, unless you are management and allow no sick leave without dipping into your paid time off. If you don’t have enough- they will put that in the negative before they just let you be sick, so your time away from work is minimal. Colleagues have had to miss their own fathers funeral due to this. Otherwise they would have lost their job. 

We also been promised for over a year that we would be able to change our schedule to a different shift start time or days you work, which is also has never come to fruition.

This company has nothing positive to offer, aside from the work from home option."

So you regularly do not do your own ""line of business"" and spend your day being abused on calls and chats.

Since going to the WFH environment, management used the disconnect between them and the staff to increase the work load by adding new lines of business to you daily skill set and not telling you in advance until you got a contact from that LOB and you'd be told ""they're struggling"" or ""it won't be for long"" when it fact its just the start of daily, weekly and in some cases permanent changes that you are never consulted on.

Work life balance does not exist in eBay, if you want time off good luck getting it approved! Once WFH hit departments found our holiday allowances on the company calendar turned to zero so you had to basically beg for time off or early leave. If you want any time off you better request it months in advance and even then you aren't guaranteed to get it approved and be given the old excuse of ""just get a shift swap"" which is nearly impossible too. Oh and a word of warning they are open 365 days, yes including Christmas Day, so they will have you working on Christmas Day ""just in case people need to call us"".

You work shift work in rotations (including lates(9pm) and Weekends too), they have split days off which is horrible and recently added a second week of lates ""cause we need to support our line of business"" and then you discover you are not supporting your own departments LOB but everyone elses.

They champion mental health however work their employees to breaking point as getting time off is near impossible and then if you are off sick with mental health or other reasons they hound you for daily updates on your progress and weekly sick notes (if your doctor issues a two week note, you'll be made go back and get two weekly ones).

The majority of management are just there to get experience to leverage better offers with other companies and don't actually care about the staff behind them (bar a couple) and have almost no people management skills and cannot offer any kind of development coaching or advice.

Your bonus is based on whether the customer likes eBay and it's rules or policies or not, so if the customer is angry regardless of what you do to help them they will leave a negative cause they do not like the company policies/procedures and this effects your personal bonus pay out.

Advancement is next to impossible as any position that is non-customer facing quickly finds everyone on phones applying for the role as the call taking is pure hell.

But don't worry you'll be bombarded with emails everyday asking you to work over time with the chance to win a €25 One4All voucher!

Unless you're desperate for experience in a customer facing role I wouldn't recommend applying here."

You are not even a human being if you are in QA. The whole company looks down on QA as some sort of second class citizen that they want to get rid of as soon as possible and the executives will say it to your face if they don't know you're in QA.

It's a bad place for development, too. They have a bunch of proprietary technologies they use and learning those is a gigantic waste of time. First, you're learning to use badly written code, poorly designed user interfaces, and tools sets that can only be described as antediluvian. It's madness. The technologies you are learning to work with are used by no other company in the world because it's proprietary. When I was there they had their own version of cloud services for internal use. It was terrible and you need to be using an industry standard platform like AWS or Azure if you want career growth outside eBay.

1. Management does not care about you. You are a work horse for them and will continue to put pressure unless you set limits. 
2. No clear path for advancement.  Literally none. You can ask your manager about this in every 1:1, that is if you’re lucky enough to have the same manager for more than 6 months (see #3), but you will have to be the squeaky wheel to get any kind of traction on a promotion. 
3. Constant restructuring and turnover. This creates a pretty tense work environment when you have to shift your roadmap and working style ever ~6 months because people either leave or there’s another “reorg”. 
4. Roadmap planning is different every year…probably again because of #3, and it’s always rushed. You’ll be expected to start work on Q1 projects and not have a finalized roadmap until Q1 has already started.  This already sets up up for failure and causes you to miss deadlines.
5. Bigger projects tend to lack end to end vision.  Mainly because the planning process is so rushed that design/product/etc is never given enough time to fully explore all the use cases which leads to missing use cases and broken features…and ultimately upset end users."

You will take inbound calls, live chats and emails from unhappy/irate members in the US & abroad regarding the switch to Managed Payments from PayPal. 
You are expected to stay on top of constant changes/updates in policies and procedures on several different subjects/issues, and be able to navigate between several convoluted resources to find answers. 
Initial training is 6-7 weeks in a group, that feels like a fire hose of information. however, ongoing OTJ training and support is provided.
Like any call center environment, you need to meet metrics. Some which are very difficult to control (like customer feedback/ratings).
Very strict attendance/timekeeping policy. Constant IT/App issues make it very frustrating working from home.
Inconsistent access to timely escalations guidance/support when on live calls and chats with customers with difficult issues (that affect your metrics).
You are expected to stay available up to the very end of your shift, making it next to impossible to clock out on time, so overtime is pretty much expected. Schedules offered are to cover 24 hour support, so don't expect a normal M-F/9-5."

The most toxic micro-management I have ever come across, people getting promotions based on whether they've made friends with managers rather than talent, job will cause you a burnout sooner or later. I've seen the smartest, most hard-working people leave the company within their first 6 months there, probably because they saw what was coming. It sometimes felt like they were trying to hire the least skilled people in the company because they knew they would have no where else to go once realising how bad the job was. With the amount of abuse you get on calls plus the volume of calls you are expected to take every day and the non existent support from management, I don't know how they do not expect people will want to leave. Problem is, the smartest people leave, the not so smart...stay. I have come across the most racist, disrespectful, ignorant people on calls and that has been from day 1. And expect no different behavior from some of the management there. Then you get told that that's just how it is and that you have to deal with it. Great! I used to go back home every day after work and cry for a good hour because of the awful time I was having in there. I knew that most of my colleagues were feeling the same way. I could not believe I had just left my previous job for this. No one should ever have to feel this way. Honestly don't make the worst mistake of your life to take a job with them, what they advertise is NOT what you get. And by the way, despite their promising that they are an equal opportunity employer, I have seen 0 foreigners getting coaching/leadership/management positions in our departments in my 3 years working for them. Some food for thoughts for you there ;)"

2. A large number of technical teams have non technical managers. Such managers have a hard time evaluating the quality of the work that their employees has accomplished. Instead, they rely on gut feelings and biases to give promotions
3. The performance review and calibration is so flawed that managers can easily game the system. No one checks the accuracy of performance reviews and managers can easily fabricate the evaluation forms and get employees fired
4. If your manager wants to give your position to his friend or just simply does not like you, there is no one at eBay (including HR) to stop that from happening. There are numerous times that HR assisted managers in creating a paper trail and getting employees fired
5. Although HR claims that they are interested in diversity and inclusion, they do not actually care about such issues. If you have issues related to that, HR puts you in the layoff list.

The job itself is very tough, a very busy call centre with abusive and racist customers, not only towards non native English speakers but also towards Irish. One would think that a place with such a hard job would offer a lot of support and help to employees but NO. The company environment is toxic, management uses bullying and scaring techniques to keep you in constant fear or being placed in some kind of supportive plan or HR warning which would mean you would loose any bonus. Think to yourself what to expect from a company where high management was involved in a big scandal in the US for bullying a couple that said negative things about the company? This is eBay. I have not have one day that I did not have to endure abuse from customers or management itself. There are no career prospects but there are a lot of micromanagement and favouritism, there is always someone watching you even if your TL knows what you are doing, another manager would reach out to go back to calls. Very short breaks and lunch so no time to rest during the shift. I have never had any mental health issues before working here but after more than 3 years I am suffering from anxiety and depression so fo your own sake please think very carefully before joining this place."

Went through a four part interview process for an entry level position which was not as described in the actual job posting or by the recruiter. I was actually pretty excited about working for eBay when I was hired and about 4 weeks into training. Trainers and coaches really try to sell eBay as the greatest company you could work for the first couple of weeks of training. Honestly started to feel a little culty, but you believe them and you feel excited until you realize the training is a joke and it doesn’t prepare you at all for the job. The amount of information that is thrown at you is overwhelming and you are expected to be an expert in all aspects of eBay. Was told everything changes frequently so don’t get too comfortable. Everyone in the training class felt ill-prepared prior to taking calls. The knowledge base is very difficult to navigate. Have to navigate through multiple programs while on a call while trying to understand the member’s issue within impossible time frames and metrics. Unless you actually buy and sell extensively on eBay and know about their policies beforehand, don’t apply. Or do and get paid for training and dip out."

892,eBay,Focused on Innovation,2020-10-30,5.0,Data Analyst,"eBay and its employees encourage each individual to think of improvements and innovations on the product to make it a better experience for the customer. Regardless of what team you are on, from engineering to finance to audit, there is always someone willing to hear you out on an idea and if it has merit to it, directors are more than happy to listen and even push some of these ideas further up. This open mindset fosters imagination and ensures that people's voices will be heard. 

In tandem with the open mindset, the culture at eBay is very diverse and super friendly. They emphasize that work is a TEAM game not just an individual one, which makes it not only fun when you work with others but also more productive. 

Technology, applications and other software tools used at the company are always improving and for the most part utilize the latest resources available. This especially appeals to the younger population who come out of school learning with a skillset using particular tools or programming languages. 

Great company with initiatives to improve the platform in the future through the use of enhanced technological innovations.","Some processes (very few in my experience) leverage tools/programs that are a bit older, however a lot of these processes are being uplifted"

895,eBay,"Unfortunately, very different from what I expected.",2020-10-27,1.0,GCX Risk Teammate II,People that you will meet there.,"eBay is the worst company I’ve worked for. I worked there as a Risk teammate, which in fact is just a customer care role. They come up with these fancy names for the role because they know how bad they are. They also say in the job description that you will be dealing with chat, email and phone calls, but that’s not true. It is just phone calls, loads of them. Don’t expect to have time for anything. You will be getting calls every 5 seconds, and it doesn't take less than that because the system takes some time to connect the call to the user’s account, otherwise it would be every second, it is insanely busy. You need to stay on the phone all the time. If you need 1 min to do something, and I mean, anything, you will need to ask your TL’s permission. If you get off the phone (changing your status on the system from “available” to “proactive” for example), without asking for permission, your team lead will message you asking why you are not on “Available” taking calls, the micromanagement is unreal, never seen anything like that in my 10 years working in customer service. Sometimes, you need to send a follow-up email to the customer (very rare, but it happens), and even for that, which is part of your job, you still need to ask for permission so you can get off the phone for a few minutes, otherwise, you will have to write and send the email while taking another call and talking to a different customer. It’s madness. On top of that, you have only 30 seconds of after call work, so after each call, you have 30 seconds to write your notes and go back on “Available” to get another call which will take 5 seconds as I said before. You get to get from 70 to 90 phone calls a day, with no time to rest, or do anything at all, except for your short breaks and 30 min lunch break. No mention the very tough calls you get from angry customers screaming at you at 8 am. And to be honest, I don’t even blame them because the platform is all buggy, the policies are so contradictory and confusing and most of the time the customers are right, but there’s nothing you can do apart from listening to them screaming at you, and then, 30 seconds to write your notes, recompose yourself and get another call. I was there for 3 months, and thankfully managed to get another job in a different company, otherwise, I would’ve gotten sick. I won’t even get into the targets, short brakes, training, lack of information, lack of communication, extensively and confusing workflows because it’s a completely unrealistic joke. No wonder why people don’t stay there longer than a year, it’s impossible."

941,eBay,EBay,2020-10-01,5.0,Customer Service,Great benefits and possibilities of promotions.,Busy day in and day out
942,eBay,Worst place I've ever worked,2020-09-30,1.0,High Value Customer Support,None. Not exaggerating there is literally none.,"I've worked in various customer support and call center roles over the year I can honestly say eBay is absolutely the worst. I'll try breakdown the specific areas. 

Contract: eBay are very cleaver on how they word their job offers. If it was a product on their site it would be taken down for false advertising. Their ""competitive salary"" is a pittance and not comparable with other companies of similar size. On paper they offer the standard amount of holiday as required by law but when you actual go to take them you see that each day is blocked to only allow a certain number of people off a day. Now this is standard but the system only allowed for 3/4 (out of a team of nearly 50) to be off at a time. There is zero, and this must be emphasized for effect, ZERO flexibility. Need a weekend off for a last minute event? Sorry should have applied for it when it became available 6 months ago. There is no established system to deal with swaps resulting in an email inbox full of requests. Forget all that talk about progression and advancement. The opportunities are just not there to move to a senior role. What you can look forward to is moving to Concierge BUT are these awarded fairly? Are they hell! It doesn't matter if you have been there years or a wet 6 months, if you are besties with the managers you go up. 

Shifts: Kiss your work life balance goodbye. Shifts change weekly and can be anywhere from 8am to 10pm. People are clamoring for a fixed pattern but they will only go to certain people (more on that later). Flexibility? A foreign concept to eBay. You are basically told to put up and shut up. 

Working conditions: As we are now working from home due to circumstances I will outline the experience from before. eBay is split across 2 buildings about a kilometer apart. There is stark divide between not just the buildings but the floors even with no effort to mix staff. They use hotdesking which adds nothing to morale. If you are on a late shift you better enjoy the hunt for a computer where the keyboard screen and mouse all work and meet basic hygiene standards. Worse on weekends when using the main office and technology at least 5 years out of date. I have worked for other large multinationals in Ireland and basic amenities such as free snacks or a free canteen would be laughable in eBay. 

You are constantly being watched in eBay. Your life is dominated by the clock. If you are a minute (and I am talking 10 seconds here) back late from a break on in clocking in the morning you will be called in to explain. The same does not apply if you are delayed taking your break. Your breaks consist of 2 breaks of 15 minutes and 1 of 30 minutes but their is no logic into how these breaks are allocated. For example you could be on a 9-5.30 shift and have a 15 break at 11.30 and then your 30 minute at 12.30. Changing these breaks is impossible and complaining is pointless (more on this below). 

There is someone there whos only job is watch who is not available to take calls. This is expected but due to the call volume you will not have time to do any follow up. If a customers issue cannot be resolved on first contact, which can be the case, you are told to pause it and resolve later but as you are not given the time to resolve this the issue is left. In theory a 30 minute slot is built in to the schedule for resolving cases but it is common thing that this time is cut due to call volume. Requests for this time, or anytime, to work on the growing backlog are ignored. Staff are timed for bathroom breaks and called out if too long is taken to relieve oneself. Even those in prison are allowed go to the toilet when needed. 

Customers and Call volume: I will agree starting off that the company cannot control what is said on a call but they can control what is done when a customer is abusive. In my time with eBay I have been called every name under the sun. I have been threated with violence, sexual assault and yes even murder! I am not thin skinned but they get to you and management do not care. I was once told it is my job to deal with it. The call volume is the highest I have ever seen in a customer service job. Be prepared to deal with 50/60 calls a day. If they could make us take 2 calls at a time they would. You are pretty much left to drown on a difficult call because management are nowhere to be seen. Most will be routine (monotonous) but as expected there will be the difficult call and there will be no help available.

Metrics: You will be a slave to the metrics, most of which are outside your control. Your ""bonus"" is tied to team metrics so you can have top metrics but because the department didn't hit target you get nothing.... no I correct myself you might get a badly done up certificate. Bad review are what they are but unfair reviews have no appeal. If you did everything you could do to help the customer but they still mark you down too bad. Worse reviews with abuse the police would prosecute for have no appeal to be removed and you are told it happens. You are reviewed on recontact rate, so people calling back within a period, something you have no control over if it is 2 separate issues. If you are lucky you might get a pizza lunch or a doughnut as a way to make you think they care. 

Management: I don't know the requirements for hiring a manager in eBay but they cant be that high. The team leaders are the core of the issues. Now I get it they have a job to do but they are constantly in a meeting so when you need them they are nowhere around. When you can get them they don't want to hear your issue. You will practically have to drag them kicking and screaming to take over a call when a customer asks for a manager but at this stage I am not even surprised when they immediately give into the customer and give them what they want even if it is in no way warranted. They just want to get off the call. Managers in eBay play favouritism in a way I have never seen before. Certain staff know they are untouchable and get away with something others would be fired before because they are friends with the manager. The coaches are... pointless really coz there just is no coaching. 

So overall, the place is a disaster. You will face abuse from customers and abuse from the managers while working in conditions a slave would envy."

The Knowledge base they have in place is so expansive that it is extremely hard to find anything rendering it completely useless. Management play favourites - nothing new or exclusive to eBay.
If you have any sort of mental health issues, I would STEER CLEAR of eBay. Management will wave ""mental health first aid training"" around but this is mostly so they can deal with and identify for themselves anyone possibly struggling. This “training” is not helpful for anyone honest and upfront about existing issues. They do not actually help staff when there is a mental health issue.
Prepare to be abused on calls daily despite what they say, these calls are not few and far between. Members will scream abuse at you to try and get what they want, and you will have to get permission from management to end this call if you can get a hold of someone. Management are not on the same page at all and you will never get a straight answer from anyone. Some management will tell you to give 3 warnings and end the call but if you do this and someone else is on duty they'll more than likely tell you this is wrong and tell you something completely different.
Reading though some of the other reviews I am shocked to see that people thought the training was great. This for me was bare bones. Again, you cannot get a straight answer out of the trainers. They will answer questions with the same answers simply different phrasing. You go through 8 weeks training that means nothing other than “read the knowledge base” and then they push you in the deep end and wave from the shoreline while you drown. You only get a breather of 5 seconds in between calls which leads to burnout and stress. Management this 7.5 minute per call is achievable due to 60% of the department hitting it. They do not take into consideration that most of that 60% are in Bangalore and the Philippines where teammates do what they want to avoid the abuse and racism from the callers. This then leads to more abusive calls for team mates following the rules and policies. God forbid you would try and get some offline time for the back up of work you have from the lack of answers.
Expect management to throw you under the bus on escalation calls. They will tell you to advise management will tell the customer the same thing. This is a lie. Management do not want to take these calls live, even though this is stated as process in the KB. 
If you have an issue, again specific to Working from Home, their IT team is less than useless. I had an ongoing phone issue that was fixed by a level 2 technician after a 30-minute phone call AFTER 2 WEEKS OF CHASING EVERYDAY.
Super short breaks. Two 15-minute breaks (sometimes an hour after you start) and one 30-minute break. This leaves no time to really do anything or get some fresh air. 
The recruitment team did a fantastic job of selling the role as a dream, but it is more like a night terror. Customer surveys affect your bonus. It counts for 40% which is disgusting as this is not something within your control WHATSOEVER. Customers give you back CSATs for stuff totally outside of your control or thinking it is for another company and eBay refuse to remove them and you therefore do not get a bonus.
I had to leave this toxic waste pit of a company for my own mental health. NOTHING is worth putting yourself through this company. Work life balance is non-existent. Lots of late shifts and weekend work. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."

Great pay & benefits! I really feel like eBay takes such good care of us.",Making decisions quickly that don't get overridden by more senior leaders is often a challenge.
1046,eBay,They don't care,2020-07-29,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Health benefits and *some* free snacks,"This place is filled with the most negative, toxic, self-centered ""leaders"" I have ever seen. Cliques are a major issue in the Austin location and if you're not with them, you're against them.

Team leads are degrading, only care about your numbers, and lie about practices and policies to get you to fall into compliance. It is clear who the favorites are as they get special unequal treatment and extra leeway in their performance. You have to literally be best friends with your team lead in order to have any possibility of advancement. Trust is non-existent here.

We had a leader that actually fought to keep us supported and developed, but sadly he was alone in his efforts and his peers quickly turned on him and harassed him daily. As a teammate, we should not have been able to pick up on this, but we all saw it happen. We still have a coach who cares about us, but she is facing the same treatment and is being made to look like the enemy. It's only a matter of time before they chase her out too.

Our managers don't care about what's happening to us (the people actually taking the calls and talking to the customers), they only care about keeping their team leads dirty secrets and making sure they stay safe. We can all see what's happening, but nobody is able to speak out as we all need a job, especially in todays climate. I have friends who have gone home and cried after clocking out because of how horrible it is here."
1047,eBay,I would not recommend to even my worst enemy,2020-07-27,1.0,Team Lead,"- Free soda and bagels weekly (had to pay for real snacks)
- Health benefits including free therapy sessions, which is heavily used because of the toxic environment","I worked her for 6 years and the leadership here is the most toxic I have ever experienced in my life. 
The behaviors exhibited by team leads and managers are blatant HR violations, but they are allowed to get away with it because they have each others backs. If another leader did not go along with this way of thinking, they were targeted and attacked psychologically. 
Direct reports are looked at as nothing more than children who are not given a right to opinion or any freedom of expression. As a team lead, I have heard numerous times where leaders bad mouth the people they are supposed to be leading, talk down to them in meetings, and black ball them from promoting within because they (the leader) did not like them. Managers are clearly aware of what is going on, but they fall into the same toxic mindset of ""protecting their own"" because it's easier to hire an entry level agent than hire another leader.
There is no system of checks and balances with leadership which allows them to continue to abuse their power and position. Corporate tries to let people know that they can call HR, but the team leads and managers make people feel as if they will be fired or blackballed for doing so, so hardly anyone ever does. 
Each week, it felt like another person was going on a mental health leave and after talking to numerous people, they all agreed that their leadership was a major contributing factor to their rapid mental decline. I have seen the brightest, warmest people turn cold and careless in a span of a few months and it completely shattered me.
At one point in my life, I would rave to anyone who would listen about why I loved working here and was looked at by most employees as ""the face of eBay Austin"", but things quickly changed as this place continued to progress into a nightmare that got worse each day. The people who are supposed to lead by example and foster growth have dragged this company down to a level I never thought imaginable."

In the past year, management has changed so frequently that we find ourselves not being able to differentiate over who can help and who is as just as lost as we are. We’ve been forced to support departments we’ve had zero training in but get reprimanded for not giving customers the best experience when we truly do try. Our bonuses, our career development and our sanity gets challenged daily over things we cannot control. Higher ups refuse to listen to the literal cries for help. During my time here, I’ve never seen more people need to take leave for being stressed, depressed or both.

Ask different people and you hear different things. You will be even more confused when you come back to the customer.

It definitely creates a strong sense of purpose. Base pay is competitive, and stock grants are common for management level positions. eBay tried to do little things for employees, like donuts and bagel days, or catered lunches during hectic days.","eBay is constantly in a state of transition, going through leadership changes, drastic strategy changes, and mass layoffs nearly every quarter. These seem to be predominately knee jerk reactions vs. long term strategy based off data, innovation, and collaboration. Employee moral was very low throughout most of the time I was with eBay, due to a gross lack of communication and team building during major transition and layoff periods, a constant change in strategy requiring constant pivots, to the point employees are mostly fixing and reacting to changes, and due to a complete lack of regard for company culture. Suzy, the former America's CMO actually told many employees that the last thing she should care about is culture; that instead employees should be grateful to work for eBay. Employees are worked so hard, given tasks that easily make up 70+ hours of work weekly, and while leadership encourages employees to speak up if they can't handle their workload, when they do they are told that ""this is just eBay. Take it or leave it"". During the most recent round of layoffs, eBay randomly put employees in positions that did not at all align with their skill set, previous roles, or career ambition, and actually demoted a good amount of employees with these changes."

1142,eBay,Ebays heyday has long passed,2020-03-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good remuneration package 
Decent benefits 
Good work life balance for most people but honestly its cos no one is self motivated anymore.","The top leaders in the Singapore office were all Korean, and they brought along their very hierarchical culture to the apac HQ of an american company.. The leaders don't really bother to bond with anyone else other than fellow koreans in the office (not surprisingly there is a disproportionate number of them here), some of whom know that they are ""protected"" by management and are therefore plain rude and demanding to others even though nobody knows exactly what they do, or what they contribute.. The leaders are either completely blind to bad behaviour, or they dont care..! They promote people who are clearly not respected by anyone else because of their own bad work ethics and lack of manners... in short the leaders dont care at all about cultivating a good natured work enviroment. Whoever talks the loudest and sucks up most to leaders get to bully others (and i really mean bully....Yelling, fingerpointing etc)

The company has been going through multiple reorganisations in the last coupla years and each time, less and less attention and priority is given to APAC i guess to save its declining US business.. frankly no one can tell what is ebays strategy anymore whether for apac or global..! People in Sg office are constantly worrying for their jobs, and good people are taken advtage by lazy colleagues who cant be bothered to step up..Good people leave while lousy people get so comfortable doing nothing? There is alot of dependency on US to get stuffs done but US people simple do not care about apac and often will simply not bother to reply or turn up for calls so nothing good can happen for apac..

The environment is generally toxic.. so many people have left or are let go so there r very little people in office now. Some managers have double standards and work from home whenever they want or just leave office early but do not give same flexibility to the people they manage.. Managers care more about protecting their own jobs by hitting immediate short term targets and dont rlly care about long term benefit to the biz

Juz avoid joining this sinking ship if you care about your career.."

Training is good. Reality of the actual job is a stark contrast however!","Super short breaks - no time to really do anything or get some fresh air on your lunch break
You are massively undersold what the actual job entails during recruitment and training period. They word the role very well, when in reality you are doing a call center role taking back to back phone calls
The tools and computers are super outdated, slow and unhelpful
The phone calls are tough. Expect abusive, racist and vile language and shouting on the majority of calls. 
Once you complete training you do 'on the job training'. The training during this period is non existent. You have zero support, bar a IM group with a 'coach' who is answering your query plus 10 others and dont give you any valuable advice or help which eats into your AHT and affects your stats. 
CSATS affect your bonus, however the customers give you back CSATs for stuff totally outside of your control or thinking its for another company and eBay refuse to remove them and you therefore dont get a bonus. 
I have worked in calls centres for over 10years in a variety of sectors and I have WFH before but I genuinely mean it when I say I felt so alone working here. Such a pity when its a huge company you would expect standards to be better.
Your stats are mental in terms of achieving them all. AHT under 7.30minutes and they want you to resolve the query, deal with the issues and build rapport during this time. Its unrealistic. 
Hold time is 2 minutes. if you go over this your stats go down, but if you cant solve the query you must bank it and call the customer back later, but you can only call back when approved by a TL or manager which is hardly ever, and this affects your stats also
During recruitment they big up career progression but the reality is progression is based on who you know, not the quality of your work or your drive or enthusiasm. 
Overall - HUGE disappointment. I left as soon as I could."
1172,eBay,Pass on this one.,2020-01-19,1.0,Merchant Support,"By an large your peers are good people and reasonably competent. Individual supervisors can be fantastic. Pay is OK. Benefits are OK - maternity/paternity is great if you use them, fertility is amazing - otherwise it's middle of the road.","Most management above the base supervisor level is disconnected from the day to day functions and needs of employees. Decisions are without a clear understanding of their eventual impact. 

Rapid changes in policy and expectations breed contempt and low morale from the front line employees. 

Unkept promises with regards to work functions and load are taking a toll on employee loyalty. 

Consistently bad resource planning means that, even if you've been 'promoted' into a position where you're dealing with higher value customers you're still getting inundated with general support contacts which then, in turn, lowers the effectiveness of your ability to support your own customer group by increasing wait times and creating an artificial urgency in getting people out of the contact so that you can move on to the next customer.

Apparent disdain for customers in general - making policies that are decidedly unfriendly to the seller populace and not being transparent with the reasons for doing so - providing talking points like ""it's the cost of doing business"" which does nothing to assuage the frustration and anger felt by long term incredibly high value members when they feel that they are being treated unfairly. 

Dramatic shifts in expectations for work performance - going from ""we don't care about your handle time"" to ""You must get your customers off the phone in an average of just over x minutes or else we'll start moving towards getting rid of you."" is frustrating. Making these changes during the holiday season made morale take a nose dive and they're not doing anything to really discuss this, acknowledge it as a mistake, or make up for it in any way. 

The sole value of an employee is their stats - handle time, customer sat, schedule adherence, etc...  There is a growing feeling that teammates are merely cogs in a machine and that anything they do extra  is seen as taking away from these stats and, while lip service is given to their benefit, no compensation or recognition is provided for that investment or engagement. This leads teammates to simply go in and do their work and leave.

There is no recognition for employees that take the time to learn more information about other lines of business and successfully apply that to their customer contacts. In fact, the more you know, the more crap they throw at you, so it's almost worth it to just stay at a base level. The pay is the same anyway. 

There is no differentiation between sick time & paid time off. The standard line given is that eBay gives competitive PTO, which I guess is right, but you can't actually get sick without having the potential for some disciplinary action taking place. Other employers in the area have sick time and have built in policies for exceptionally short term (3 days or so) family care so you can take care of your sick kid. None of those things impact your attendance. With eBay, if you're sick and don't pre plan it, you get an occurrence. If you wrack up 3, you start to lose options for promotions and other benefits. 

The culture has deteriorated over the course of the last several years. At first, this was the most fantastic place to work - even if customer contacts were frustrating, the management team had your back and there was a spirit of cooperation that was present at all levels of management. Now that cooperation is at the teammate level and everything higher than that discourages going out of your way to do the right thing for a customer or a peer. 

What was once a refreshingly positive work environment and a company I could feel proud of is now a mere shadow of its former glory. It's going to take removing some senior leadership and replacing them with a strong leader with a vision of culture and organizational health and effectiveness to turn this around. I don't have high hopes."

Really good benefits like a great healthcare plan, pension and stock programme and a good starting salary with a quarterly bonus and opportunities for raises each year.
Makes sure employees are heard and always focus on the work/ life balance. Of all companies I have ever worked for, eBay are the only company who take feedback on board and do their best to make changes for the better.
Also the first company I have worked for with really approachable managers. A lot of the higher up managers are very approachable and spend time with front line teammates which I’ve never seen in a company before. Very down to earth people who are genuinely working towards the right things.
Lots of support around you. The job itself can be tough at times, customers can of course be difficult to deal with but the support network in place with you direct leadership is excellent, especially with each team having a coach to help you manage your performance. 
Really big push for development and growth. Lots of opportunities to grow your skill set and learn about other roles once you’re doing well in your current position. They’ll always offer advice and help you work on your development plan. At the end of the day, it does come down to what you put into it and your attitude towards the job but the support is always there to help you along.","Inevitably with the majority of roles at the beginning, these are call centre based and the work can be tough sometimes. There are days where it is really busy and customers that are angry but the support from leadership is always there. 
The hours are rotational shifts which don’t suit everyone. The majority for most departments are core working hours with some weekends and late shifts and these are updated every now and again to try suit both people and the business. You know what you are working well in advance and have the opportunity to swap with others.
With such a large company and lots of changes, sometimes the communication of these changes isn’t always the best which can be frustrating in the moment. 
Although the vast majority of leadership are amazing, there are some exceptions and the inconsistency can be annoying but it is rare."

When you first join eBay (like i was) you are excited to be part of such a big company and are blinded by the ""opportunities"" and ""culture"" of the place.  The office itself is fairly vibrant, fast paced and exciting to a fresh victim just in the door.  It wasnt until I had actually been offered a final interview that I found out that the job was just a call centre operative.  They are very clever with how they word things and describe the job.  At the end of the day, it is a call centre.  After a couple of months and 7000 action plans with your coaches and team leaders that discuss your ""journey of progression in the company"" you will begin to realise just what a toxic and horrible work environment the place is.  You are told to build a rapport with the buyers and sellers and to make it feel like a personalised service but then are pulled up on spending too long on calls with customers and should be dealing with the issue promptly and moving on to the next call.  Micromanagement is not a strong enough word.  Every second is scrutinised, at the time I was working there, there is literally a member of ""leadership"" who sits there all day staring at their laptops monitoring what every member of staff is doing every second of the day.  Want or have to go to the toilet a few times a day? Be prepared to have to justify why you were away from your desk for 7 minutes combined throughout the day.  Want to book time off for a holiday? Hahaha good luck with that, unless you are booking it well over 9 months in advance.  Want Christmas or bank holidays off?  It isquite literally a lottery where names are pulled out of a hat to see who has to work.  They advertise the roles with words such as ""quarterly bonuses"",  in the near 3 years i was at ebay, i received a quarterly bonus i believe 3 times?  The bonuses are calculated by a department level and not by individual merit, you could be the perfect employee and the most productive employee in the company but because all the other kids in there are just there for a social club and dont do any work, you will receive the minimum bonus payout if you receive a bonus payout at all.  In my personal experience, my own team leaders and coaches were honestly fantastic people who helped me in more ways than just professionally. That being said however the majority of all other upper management are beyond useless.  They are supposed to be there to support you and offer help, but the second you have an irate customer on the phone looking to speak to management they all seem to magically disappear or be on their way to meetings, this then results in a formal complaint, which you are then pulled up on and asked to explain yourself.  The shift work is horrendous, they blow hot air at you constantly with their concerns over finding a good work/life balance.  You could one day be on an 8-4:30 shift, the next youre on a 12:30-21:00 and then back to a 8-4:30.  Place is like a playground, it has its little cliques and groups and if you are not part of that group then you are completely overlooked and underappreciated whilst all the kids that have bought in to the cliques get away with murder because the management couldnt possibly treat one of ""their crew"" poorly.  Constant changes to the sites functionality and costs are rolled out with little or no notice and you are expected to just roll with it and ""turn customers negative comments in to positive growth opportunities"".  You are told that you are to be your customers go to person and take ownership of issues from start to finish and to deliver a 5X experience.  In reality the buck is passed from one useless agent who doesnt want to be moaned at to another useless agent that isnt bothered doing the work .  Customers have actually been banned or restricted from using eBay if they contact eBay too often because they have been fobbed off and issues have not been resolved.  I could honestly go on and on and on about how negative the place is.  Hard work is ""rewarded"" with a patronising pat on the back certificate that a 5 year old could make on clipart and sometimes a piece of branded merchandise (an ebay cup etc). I left eBay a few months ago as i just couldnt physichally or mentally deal with the place any more.  When i informed the leadership of this, rather than see if there was anything that could be done, they just informed me that i was required to work my 4 weeks notice (i didnt, i walked out then and there).  The second I walked out of those doors i felt liberated and havent given it a second thought until i decided to write this review.  If you are taking a job in eBay, the first few months are pretty great but you will soon realise that you are just a number, they couldn't care less about your physical or mental health and I would seriously think twice."

1329,eBay,Condescending Leadership Team + Employees Throwing each other Under the Bus,2019-05-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,None at all - there is no work life balance.  Please read the cons below.,"Be aware.  You'll sell your soul to the Church of eBay. 

I'm appalled and disappointed by the lack of professionalism and the huge divide between the fat cats at the top (leadership team) and the rest of the eBay employees.

***Beware of the Structure and the Huge Divide***
To cut costs, eBay doesn't  pay benefits to employees like holiday time, sick leave, decent salaries, ebay stock, bonuses, etc...

ebay hires 80% of their workforce on a contract basis and they will overwork you and set unrealistic goals and deadlines and when you do deliver, you will be scrapped so they can save more money.  They see employees as a commodity rather than people.   Because of this there is a huge divide between permanent employees and those on a contract.....  contractors are seen as second class employees and they are often exploited and bullied.  eBay uses a employment agency for most of their contractors but they also have another complex layer of employees.   They outsource their account management team to TTEC who also work on the same floor as other ebay employees and aren't integrated with the rest.  Ebay says they are ONE TEAM which is a HUGE  lie.  

***how to become a permanent employee****
You have either be in a director role or have sold your soul to the leadership team by sucking up to them or 3 years.....they do this, again, to exploit and blind new employees.  They get them excited because they are working for a well-known brand but they won't tell you the truth about toxic culture.

***Leadership Team are Elitists****
The leadership team is clique-y, condescending, and won't listen to any of your concerns because if you have been brought in as an AWF (Alternaive Workforce Employee) you don't have a voice.... you're a contractor and seen as fill-in to get the work done, despite if you have worked for the company for over 2 years or more.  You will be treated differently as an AWF and be seen as second class employee.  There is a lot of talent who have been brought in as AWFs... some are people managers and others have extensive experience within their discipline, but that won't matter.

The senior leadership team will palm you off, ignore your concerns, and will talk about you behind your back before investigating real concerns.  It's high school all over again.  And if you don't drink or aren't a party animal, you will be seen as an outcast.  They will bulldoze you with their huge egos.  

****They Will Use You******
My last week at eBay I asked to hand over some major projects to my boss who is located in Asia, but she cancelled my video conference call.  So I then asked for her boss to be present, but he also cancelled and didn't see me off.  

I've brought this up to HR but they didn't care.  They're not much help either.

Steer away from eBay.  You're better off at amazon or at another e-commerce company."

I felt completely trapped there. It took forever to get out because of the reputation of eBay as a company. This is where a designer's career goes to die.

It was demoralizing to watch every single good idea or good design that anyone came up with be pushed off to the side. “We don’t have the budget.” “It’s too unconventional.” “It’s too risky.” This company is too afraid to do anything meaningful and too afraid of having a perspective or an opinion to survive."

Working here will set you up for success should you move on internally or to other companies as I did. eBay Ireland gave me the opportunity to grow to people leader & manager of several different departments, always learning from all the very smart people around me. 
eBay may not be a market leader when you compare them to their competitors, but that very reason makes eBay a great place to work & grow your career. They are always looking to innovate and compete with the likes of Amazon, so every opportunity to add value to customers or makes changes on site are greeted with positivity and you get the opportunity to work & implement meaningful projects. As a former employee, it still makes me excited to see changes on the eBay site that my customer support team and I conceived, actioned & implemented. 
Another great pro is the people, and not just because they are all nice people, but the talent in different areas of the business is at another level. It’s only when I left eBay I realised other ‘big tech’ companies operate very differently. I currently work in a big name tech company, whose turnover is 10x of eBay’s, but internally, teams only do a fraction of work & innovation that eBay does. Plus, the people in other tech companies are of a different calibre to eBay. You get praise & recognition for driving real change & value. I only see most of the Pro’s after I left eBay.","If you are the type of person that requires constant praise & recognition for ‘basic’ performance, then eBay is not for you. 
If you expect targets not to change, eBay is not for you. 
If you don’t like shift work, eBay is not for you. 
If you don’t like fast paced, eBay is not for you.
If you get easily annoyed when others work harder than you and achieve promotions ahead of you, eBay is not for you. 
If you compare eBay to other tech companies, eBay is not for you.
If you work hard, have a great passion for customer service, and not afraid to take intelligent risks, then eBay is for you and trust me, you will learn loads when you put the work in. Nearly 2 years after leaving eBay and I’m still using what I learnt at eBay in my current company."

Also if you enjoy your week to either be working late during the week and off a weekend or working early and then in a weekend this job is for you.","This is where it becomes interesting, when you start everyone is buzzing this feels like the best place ever you are already planning your sabbatical.. then you slowly get your life sucked out of you by this corporation. 
It all starts with time off, god forbid you need to plan something holidays sit in pending sometimes even if you give a few months notice, people work to be given holiday time off not to be told you need to get a shift swap because you are working on a weekend or you are on a late shift its all down to their bad planning and lack of staff. 
We get punished that the fact they cant have appropriate staff numbers we cant get time off or plan anything. Then while we are short staffed they start sacking people by just bringing them into a room and telling them they are being let go and then escorted out of the building without even getting to say goodbye to the people you have worked closely with. 
Expected to be logged into all systems without pay and then if you are late logging in its then this big massive issue sometimes even if the computer you sat at was faulty because nobody ever has a set seat. 
The list could go on, half the managers are bullies and have favorite staff that get away with everything.
If you loved being in school this is the job for you, because all this dublin office does is gossip and you are managed down to the very second should you go over your unpaid break for the day which is used for toilet breaks or to get water you have to email them to say why you were over your breaks.
While out sick you are bullied by managers and hr about your sickness while awaiting doctor results not knowing what is wrong they dont care at all.
Also never expect bonus either you are based on surveys and while implementing their policies which are completely unfair a bad survey cannot be contested even though you are just doing your job while getting screamed at by customers you sit there and take the abuse and then get told you arent getting bonus
The shift rotation is terrible 1 full weekend off a month.
Let people live there lives and dont treat us like we are school kids.
Im happy that I left my job it had great potential but is being ruined by higher management some of them that simply dont have a clue they wouldnt last an hour on the phones trying to reason with unhappy customers.
Normally I would never go ahead and leave a review but it has been brought to my attention about others leaving disgruntled reviews and I was in shock to find out that i wasnt the only one going through this. The department is a poison.
Also if they want you to go to a different department they make you go regardless of what you ask your requests will go on deaf ears and be told it cant be facilitated even if its something small like to be on the same shifts as a person for travel purposes."

Our day is constantly monitored, a person is appointed to make sure we don't take more than a couple of minutes to make sure we have taken complete ownership, replaced item, sent emails, make pleasant banter....We are expected to be the absolute best and treated extremely poorly which is very demotivating.

The management is atrocious they bully and have favorites. The teams in charge of time off do not give you any PTO or even have any sense of leeway. They are so contradicting in terms of time keeping and being busy. Our services levels could be through the roof but they tell us to make sure we do everything right for our customers and then when we do that we get the head eat off us for taking the time look after our customers and do the proper investigating we were told to do in training. If you are off sick or say no to something you’re seen as a villain. It’s so cliquey as well with certain teams and teammates. If you don’t have a loud open personality you’ll probably make one friend. People don’t get promoted there you get forced to change career paths when other departments need more people. And if you don’t want to go, too bad. They promise good bonuses and incentives but they are never as good as they sound. Nothing in the job does.

Definitely do not get paid enough to take the amount of abuse I got over the phone. The ""3 warning"" system is flawed. If someone is calling you all sorts or being patronising or mentally abusive, you should just be able to end the call or escalate straight away. 
Once, I saw a friend of mine over the phone, cried her eyes out because she was being abused by a caller she was handling, the agent started sobbing over the phone and a team leader present at the time just looked on instead of taking over the call.

The overwhelming bulk of the work was maintaining an incredibly poorly architected codebase in Java 7 written by the acquirer (ebay), exactly as instructed by the US office.
Decisions take almost forever to make. Feedback is loudly welcomed and then promptly discarded.
The state of the codebase is awful -  static initialization is practiced as a matter of course(for instance), and the configuration is tracked through an in house built and maintained system. Agile practices are spoken of and ignored. No real attempts at resolving the issues are taken.

Mission of connecting buyers and sellers around the world is great. But company keeps screwing it up.","You guys are on the highway to hell. And that’s why: 
1) All the company’s real actions are about short term. There is no strategy behind actions in US, EU, APAC except “close the Quarter on target at any cost”. Sometimes it is really funny to see how company tries to hack the top-line numbers burning LOT OF CASH on incentives and subsidies right here right now instead of thinking of how to get healthy long-term growth. 
2) Most of initiatives got killed in politics and bureaucracy. Lot of good ideas appear in different teams but most of VPs/Directors play their career game and want to make a name, bonuses, become more powerful and only after this do something good for sellers, buyers, partners. When they implement something, most of time they ignore end-users and results of their projects are creepy. Most of product development works same way: they release bad product that nobody is happy with and ask marketing to promote it hard, ignoring most of user complaints. And everybody is DAMN BUSY and not reachable for fixing their mistakes.
3)Bureaucracy become bigger and bigger in company every year. Over a HALF of calendar is about reporting meeting or presentations for these meeting. Nobody cares about if you do right things for users, they are worried only about traction of your activity and targets. Real strategic discussions are very long and often end up with no decision. Most of time you do tactical things, then report, then repeat. This process appears on almost all functions, especially finance. Last Ariba implementation caused MONTHS of delays in contract signing and payments. Problem is still not resolved-eBay can not pay in time. Everybody knows, very few cares. 
4)Zero acceptance of critics. Over couple of years many people became “so senior” that you have very limited chances to hear the reply to your asks, feedback, questions. Even organization dedicated to employees feedback is ignoring questions. 

The most disappointing that all these signs of eBay’y eclipse can be carried and changed, but instead of it company tries to make the retouch and keep talking about “we are doing great new eBay, very very soon everything will change, just deliver!”"

I worked at eBay for 6 years, and my immediate team was the always the best part of the work. While John Donahoe and team made mistakes that led to the division of eBay and PayPal, they had a steady hand on the wheel and were unfailingly professional and respectful of the staff. Post-separation, there were high hopes for Devin Wenig and team, but while they have smarts and talent, they're also primarily focused on being technology moguls (veering towards tech bros) and in the news along side other SV leaders. While they talk a good game about eBay's purpose (supporting the creation and growth of small businesses), in the end their profile with media and the stock price are what the focus on (and always in the short term).

It's a casual environment and the immediate managers are completely great, on your level and willing to work with you on anything. We have coaches that help guide our careers and help us grow. There's also great benefits, like I've not experienced anywhere else.","Our entire job performance is now based on customer reviews, and it doesn't matter if it was a policy you didnt write, or if the review was actually for another member who took the call and passed it to you, its then yours. Every day, I come into a job, that is looking more and more like other places I've worked. Moral is low, the excitement to excel has ceased. You come into work and you're confronted with what you did wrong, or a situation a member is upset about. You then get the chance to justify it or explain the situation, but ultimately, its going to be the cost of your bonuses. You and your team, get reviewed together too, so if one person is doing poorly, its everyone who suffers. Furthermore, they fish for feedback from members by sending emails to ask for them to respond, so if someone had a call with an agent and it went poorly, and then we email about their experience and they say it was horrible, and you get that email to respond too, then their experience is then attached to YOU, not the person who took the call.

1782,eBay,Single Worst Experience of Entire Career,2017-11-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Newly-renovated cafeteria.  Free breakfast every morning.  Valet parking.,"The time I spent at eBay was the worst experience of my entire career by a significant margin.  Before I started at eBay, I had heard from friends that when eBay and PayPal separated, all the normal people went to PayPal while all the lunatics stayed behind at eBay.   During my time there, I learned the hard way how true this was.  

I worked for an absolutely toxic manager who had no business managing other people.  She still worked at eBay even though this was well-known around the company and she had a number of HR complaints against her.  Not only was she grossly incompetent, she also was pitifully insecure, malicious and morally bankrupt.  A manager who exhibits even one of these characteristics would already be difficult to work with.  A manager who has all these qualities made for an experience that was horrific beyond comprehension.  If you suggested a different approach on a project, rather than considering the merits of your suggestion, her first instinct would be to accuse you of questioning her expertise and undermining her authority.  She also would do everything she can to try to destroy you.  She once fired a teammate because he had the audacity to disagree with her in a meeting in front of management.  She also was not above making up lies in order to make this happen.  For me, the last straw came when she ordered me to do something illegal because she was mad at one of our business partners and wanted to get back at him.  She also tried to set this up in such a way that I would be the fall guy if anyone found out.

This experience was not unique to me.  I had many colleagues who faced similar bullying, mistreatment and abuse and who left as a result.  In my experience, the culture at eBay was toxic and pernicious across the board.  On an interesting side note - the entire company also seems to have a huge chip on its shoulder.  Employees delude themselves into thinking that eBay and Amazon are somehow competitors.  (For anyone who does not know, Amazon left eBay in the dust years ago.)  I do not know which is more worthless - the Kool-Aid eBay serves its employees or the crap that is sold in its marketplace."

There were significant changes in the upper management as well as a cultural change. The company is now all about innovation, empowering people and leveraging the ideas people from diverse backgrounds bring to the table.

A key thing that changed is also the approach to strategy. Instead of changing the strategy every year and focusing on different customer segments or business areas in different years, there is no a long-term strategy that focuses on key areas. 

Also, the focus on the customer is now really there. Customer Service was leveled up and empowered to really serve customers in an effective way.

It's been an amazing and highly motivating journey is on and I am impressed such an ""old"" company is able to get such a transition done.",The second office location in San Jose at 1st Street isn't as awesome as the main office.

Their official function is to be in lengthy offsite lunch meetings, not to support their employees. Most team leads are unaware of how to use internal systems and are unaware of business practices and policies. Coaches (Jr. Management) are rarely available, and are often equally unknowledgeable. Employees are blamed for staffing issues and lack of appropriate volume forecasting, and as a result queue times are unreasonably high at all times.

- Good work-life balance. Everyone respects it.
- The company is accommodating of your family and health constraints. I have not been in a better place when it comes to this aspect.
- Many team building activities.","- The biggest con is that the mothership i.e. eBay US is an ancient organisation that controls the European division pretty much in every way. EPD doesn't have any real control over things. Many cons I discuss below stem directly from this.
- There is some very good work happening in eBay, but it's all in the US, and some in Israel. UK and Germany usually get the leftover projects nobody else wanted to work on.
- Legacy. The projects you inherit are simply ancient. Those who worked on those are not around. Who owned/owns what is sometimes not even documented. You will often find yourself wondering how anything works at all.
- A lot of in-house and archaic technology. eBay has had a massive case of NIH (Not Invented Here) syndrome. They have their own libraries, build tools, web frameworks, IDEs, front-end frameworks, logging and monitoring solutions, and so on. Some of these are very poorly designed, poorly documented, and poorly supported. There is not much push to switch to open source solutions with large communities and support. It's extremely difficult to deal with this. Much more so than you might think at the outset. 
- Due to the above aspects, the longer you stay in the company, the more you lose relevance in the industry. Many skills you will gain here are specific to eBay's problems and tools, and are not easily transferable to anything.

At other companies, the scope of your role is much more defined limiting your chances to make huge strides in your skill set and career. 

Work life balance is great. Most people leave by 5 or 6 and the work from home policy is very lenient. Work is also very friendly towards parents. eBay offers a paid sabbatical every five years of work and you see people on many teams going on their second sabbatical.

Salary is competitive and the ESPP and 401k program are nice to have.","The biggest con is that there is a real culture issue. There are a ton of unmotivated and untalented staff. You could describe the attitude as defeated. Whether its related to processes that take too long, the feeling of an insurmountable disadvantage to Amazon, or a lack of grit, there is a negative skew to the general attitude of the staff. eBay has been putting more emphasis with the employee satisfaction surveys but there is ways to go.

1910,eBay,Do not come here. It really is that bad,2017-06-29,1.0,E2M,None. There is a gym. A overpriced canteen with the rudest staff I ever had the misfortune to meet. Inadequate car parking. If your not there for 8 am forget getting parked.,Where should I start.. The place is terrible. The department s have been ruined by the changes that have been forced onto the guys on the phones by  Americans that don't have a clue. This used to be a fairly good place to work but  the dept I'm in its gone so badly wrong in there. Its not even just in this dept m2m Concierge buy sell its the same story in all of them. The staff turnover is massive . All the calls are from irate and annoyed members giving out about ebays  changes in policy which have badly impacted on them. I'm dealing with people every day who accounts are suspended for frankly ridiculous reasons. I've seen guys on my team so frustrated and annoyed from being abused on the phones and the useless unqualified TLs don't care. Progression is the same as all these type of places but more so at ebay. If your face doesn't fit your going no where so progression is not fair. One guy in here went for a interview where the TL in  SRM dept  for that team had already promised the jobs to two other people if they applied !!!.  The company say they have your Interests and well being at heart. Absolutely not the case. The coaching for team mates is none existent at this stage and if you raise a concern say like about the unfair survey system which your pityful bonus is linked to all you get is an uneducated responce . they know  team mates are getting bad surveys for implenting eBay policy this in turn then impacts on their progression and can even result in warnings and in dismissal.  There is no work life balance at all in any shape or form. Shift work. bank holidays and weekends .. Forget them they are gone. The renumeration is not good at all when you take into account the hours and the fact you work bank holidays weekends and shifts up to 10Pm. Its safe to say if your an arrogant person you will fit in well here. If you want the life sucked out of you then come and work for eBay . if you have got any sense stay away. Seriously it really is this bad.

1912,eBay,Interview Process,2017-06-27,1.0,,I was contacted by a recruiter and had really great conversation that led to my onsite interviews after my phone screen. I've always wanted to work for eBay so hearing the initial conversation went well was exciting.,"I was connected with a coordinator from eBay who sits in a remote office. She reached out to me scheduled my onsite and I was able to confirm a date and time that week with my schedule. I thought this is quick and efficient, great! The following day I got an email abruptly mentioning the team needed to move things around and had to reschedule my onsite to next week. I thought sure, I can be flexible so I gave her an alternate date and time. She came back with a new generic template with my onsite schedule and document attachment to the email. 

So the bad part begin--normally coordinator would send and attach your interview schedule with your name and who you're meeting with the day of your interview. Because she copy and paste things, I saw another person's name on my interview schedule, so I knew it was an error and quickly google search the name. Turns out it was another person interviewing in the same position as I am and took my original assigned time. Bummer.

It made me stress and thought the entire candidate experience went down the drain quickly at thar point, I felt like a second class citizen to other applicant. I confronted the coordinator and the excuse was there's a bug in the system (no apology what so ever). You don't send other people's info to a another candidate period and don't own your mistakes."

* CEO has vision (but it will take years to change the engineering team culture)
* People recognize it (Although they seem to be sad that you are working there and start asking why you are not working at Amazon)
* Good work life balance
* Some colleagues very helpful and knowledgable
* Free breakfast","* They mostly hire average people. If you are above average, you will have a hard time growing. Your ideas get shot down, you get resistance from low performers.

*Most senior people wont help you learn the process and tools and there is very less documentation about them. I believe this is a way to keep your seat: Do not write documentation so you cannot be replaced easily by a better engineer.

*If you are average or below average you are in paradise. You will get promoted even if you just do minimal work but stay in the company. No incentive to care about the product, the code , or whatever you are doing.

* They don't keep up with the technology at all. For almost every tool, they use a  custom in-house built one which is 3x worse than an open source one everybody out there is using. 

* After spending years here you will learn almost nothing  new because everything is custom made. It is only relevant if you stay at eBay. If you leave, that knowledge is not valid anywhere else. That is why senior engineers are trying to save their seats by politics and not allowing new engineers to learn.

* To write one line of product code, you need to learn about 10 custom build frameworks which do not have API documentation. You just keep asking around, creating help tickets."

Management can (at times) show investment in their employees, and take the time to really get to know someone and what makes them unique.","This happened in 2015, so it is stale information. However, in my time in one department, I spent 2 years in the same position. Management recognized my dedication, and knowledge of the company, and gave me more responsibilities, with a little taste of ""the good life"" I was moved to the 2nd floor, away from my colleagues, with no added pay. I was given an internship. I say good life because I went from taking call after call, to taking a few escalated calls a day, and even spent a good amount of down time shooting the breeze. Some weekends I only took two half hour calls, and sat around for the majority of my shift otherwise, while the 3rd floor took a lot of calls. The management team had better perks and rewards to recognize hard work. Management gave me that internship with the caveat that I should promote how well management treated my old colleagues on the 3rd floor. I was teased with an actual promotion for about 3 months, while I filled the role. I lead by example, and did my best to change the perception of management to a positive one. One day, I overheard a top manager implying a promise to give two other interns a full-time spot on the team one day, and soon after that my time was up. I got along well enough with the manager in question, but I didn't make the manager laugh like the other two agents. Favortism comes to mind, but that can be found at any job, so I'm not bitter about that - just being realistic. In the end, I was sent back to the 3rd floor, and was told to take on my old responsibilities (call after call) and just wait it out. Other agents went through this rotation, some made it, some did not.  I've heard management changed since then, so this could be better."

They have ideas and instead of taking accountability blame the employee. Employees can not give their opinion or they will be viewed as not being a team player.

Too many cooks in the kitchen when it came to getting anything fixed or improved which made it impossible to get it done. Customer experience suffers because it's so hard to get improvement of products and tools. Poor partnership with project/product management and those affected by said projects/products. 
Tool changes roll out prior to being ready(most likely trying to hit a deadline) at the detriment to the agent/customer experience.

Management is so favoritism based it's sickening. I watched people I could walk circles around in stats and knowledge of the company and it's policies, but they were moved up after doing minimal work because they kissed the bosses butt every day. Because I wouldn't play their game of politics you immediately get stuck in your role because they won't write a good referral to you (it's required for most roles), and you don't get any projects that allow you to grow and network. In the department I left, people were having mental breakdowns on a regular basis because not only do you have angry customers, management is the worst it could be with just thinking you're a number. On a team of 20, at that time, 7 of us went on disability because of what they put us through. Management never could figure out why we were all leaving, even though our happiness surveys were all brutally honest.  

Had multiple meetings where team leader told us if you had a break that was even 1 second longer than the 15 minutes, you were stealing from the company and they will fire you on the spot. Also had meetings where management would scream and yell about how awful we're doing with business scores then demand we be the happiest people on earth or they were writing us up because they're tired of the low morale. (This is the best way to make people happy, yell!)

Company can't figure out what it wants to be. When I started we were never going to be a phone company, but after Meg left we immediately became a phone company and every team started to inbound phones and everyone decided we weren't human anymore, but just a statistic that had to have the stats they wanted. 

They started hiring management from other companies and they were making the rules based on what they did at Discovery/AT&T/AMEX/wherever and not based on how eBay's rules were. Went to HR to quote the employee handbook multiple times, but HR basically laughed and said the supervisor gets to make that rule up and the handbook is only a spirited guideline. 

When you tell management about how you're actually feeling about the company, they just stand there and tell you why you're stupid. Example:
""You keep changing what metrics matter on a weekly basis, and it doesn't allow us to ever know what our stats should be until after the quarter and bonuses were assigned.""
""We tell you what the stats should be.""

I could write the rest of the night and not be done, but i'll stop here. I'm guessing you got the point."

Product innovation came to a screeching halt and yet the expectation for 30% + growth was a metric given and used for performance evaluation. Focus is too buyer centric and buyer fraud abounds and is ignored. Sellers are left without common sense options to deal with dishonest buyers. News flash Pierre and Devin - People are No longer basically good when making online purchases. eBay employees including managers have No power to facilitate change or do the right thing for a seller that has been financially taken advantage of by a dishonest buyer. The policy makers are out of step with what really goes on with transactions. To be a powerless drone even at a management level is stressful, negative and unfulfilling.

-decent work/life balance","-Morale is in the toilet since the company split. Most good leaders left, those that remain are sub-par. 
-cost cutting measures are squeezing everything. Now only VP's can fly biz class for international trips; apparently only they merit humane treatment while regular employees get to suffer on a 9 hour flight.
-Fake culture that doesn't ring true. They brag about nobody having offices, not even VPs. But in reality all that means is VP's have a permanent conference room taken offline to be used as their office. The reserve parking spots for VPs, but label them with something random to ""hide"" it from employees - ""delivery parking, logistics parking, etc). Look nobody cares if a VP gets a parking spot, but don't try and hide it.
- HUGE amounts of political turf wars since the company split, since the majority of the leaders are new. The top brass (Devin and his directs) are either blind or ignoring it, so lower level employees are too busy worrying about their future to do their day job.
- Zero career growth. Absolutely zero. Nepotism reigns supreme here. I know it's a common complaint from employees at most companies, and sometimes unfounded.... but here it really is a massive problem.

I was pleasantly surprised when I was informed they had extended the leave and I would be getting an additional 6 weeks off! I was able to bond with my child and feel more at ease once i returned back to work since my son would be just about 5 months old. In total I got 5.5 months off (1 month prior to the due date and 4.5 after)! 

Not only did they extend the leave of time but also pay employees 100% while on leave! It was great to know I didn't have the stress of getting paid less while caring for a newborn.

HR is non existent aside from endlessly throwing out new initiatives without training people to be ready for these e.g. The new performance management system. 

There is disparity in treatment of employees. VPs and above get treated as special class of people e.g. Class of travel on flights.

It used to be focused on bonding together to tackle the challenges and solve the problems. Leaders who listened and inspired. Now it seems to be shifting to a culture led by fear. When the going gets tough, find someone to blame. If you don't like what you're hearing, just reorg and listen to someone else. It's about what have you done for me lately versus trusting the reputation and integrity of the people you hired with the responsibilties you gave them. Planning is short term and risk taking seems to have been removed from the play book. This blame falls squarely on the shoulder the CEO, Devin Wenig. He says he wants to build the new ebay culture, but he has endorsed this negativity by the senior leaders he hired and the behaviors he has allowed to perpetuate."

Work life balance is good, no doubt about it.","Things are too slow for most employee's taste. Me and most of my colleagues shared the same thought. Since the ebay-paypal split a lot of projects were cancelled and that severely effected employee moral. After the layoffs early 2015, lots of people left voluntarily. ebay is not growing as fast as most other companies in the bay area are. Here projects come and go in a fraction of a second. You would be working on something very hard and all of a sudden your boss tells you this project is scraped and start working on other maintenance work. There is no respect/say for individual contributors. ebay is loosing its battle with other big e-commerce giants and is finding tough to retain top talent for the same reason.
After the split. no major initiative has been taken. Entire 2015 went in poor decision making and then remaking. Apart for ebay on mobile being in the forefront, I do not see any innovation or willingness to nurture latest technology and  outshine. Senior management is very proud of the money that ebay makes, but the fact is that all that money comes irrespective of the new work that people do. This is a very stable and trusted platform that people have been using for nearly 20 years.

eBay laid off 7% (~2400 people) in 2015 and then a few months later bragged on LinkedIn about the ""amazing"" batch of 200+ new-hires.  I was a top performer in my role (received several raises, top review scores, and a promotion) but was laid off just weeks after receiving a ""Spot award"".  Within 1 month, I found 2 job postings for my position.  Do not be fooled... Employees are just numbers and a means to an end.

Re-orgs:
Despite the yearly practice of conducting the Pulse Survey, there was little trust amongst the employees that leadership would actually address the identified issues.  Mgmt put a lot of time and effort into selling the ever-changing vision.  As objectives and directions change, departments and team get reorganized. This happened at least 1-2x per year. Leaders are often put in charge of new and/or larger groups than their experience and knowledge would allow them to effectively manage.  Managers then become overly distracted and distant from the work being completed.  This results in leader being so removed that employees don’t have the support they need to get tasks completed.  

Gender Bias:
As many would agree, having gender neutral business practices, affording opportunities to all employees regardless of gender, is preferred.  However, when these actions begin to step into the realm of reverse discrimination, there is a problem.  Although affirmative action efforts are designed to avoid discrimination, it manages to produce the discrimination for the perceived historical majority.  It has been regularly observed by myself and other that under-qualified candidates are being selected for advancement in order fulfill a quota, instead of selecting individuals with the best qualifications."

2418,eBay,Reorg and internal bureaucracy  and just people managers,2016-01-01,3.0,"Software Engineer III, Quality","Good benefit, which includes decent salary, ESPP and onsite facility.  
Still a highly reputable company for your resume. 
Depends on which team you are working with, you may get chance to working on very interesting and innovated project. 
Majority of people working with you are friendly and decent, of course there are aggressive and self-fish people which you will run into in any company.
Company revenue and profit are very good in comparison to the number of employees and other companies in the industry.","1. Heavy internal politics and bureaucracy which get engineers involved in daily life. Things are getting done slowly or sideways , some efforts are totally waste. Every half year there will be reorg on the Director or VP level in almost every department. How could you expect them to improve the product as none of them is being hold responsible for long run for new/old product quality.  
2.  Quite a few managers on QE side play just people manager and non technical. 
Yes there are some mangers are very hands-on and technical knowing the real problems, but they are mainly on the developer side. Quite a few first or second level engineering managers on QE side have absolutely NO coding or design or not even decent level of general industry or software development knowledge.  They have been in the company for 10 + years and were prompted from manual testers. Some of them do not have any outside eBay experience and some even only work for the same product line for 10+ years. So don't expect them be very supportive on innovation or really understand engineering difficulty and solve the real problems.  They are more there acting like project managers but only care you finish it not how you finish it or it is done in the right way.  Because of their knowledge limitation, they also not be able to fairly judge team-members work load , contributions and ability.  
3.  This may differ by team. But most senior QE engineers are self-sustained expect to do lots of manager level job for project & people management (but without given actual power). Manager is almost non-existence and don't care as they are working on ""more important"" project or some ""process improvement"" or ""planning"".

The state of the business is less certain after the PayPal separation, so there are rumors that there are promotion quotas. A bad manager can make or break your experience. A dysfunctional project team can make or break your experience—as is true anywhere. The problem is that it's hard to move to different projects here, especially if your team is understaffed. If you don't work on a high-visibility project, your hard work and contributions aren't seen as promotion-worthy. 
Management and leaders are slow to make decisions and change priorities and their minds constantly. There doesn't seem to be a genuine interest in or understanding of customers at the leadership level. Most of the leadership heads don't use eBay regularly. They old guard used to understand eBay better.
There are reorgs every 6 months it seems, which makes the work environment feel unstable and like leadership is floundering a little."

The corporation really tries to take care of employees.","The facility in Draper, Utah is poorly run and managed.  Promotions are rarely based on merit, but if you're liked.  In my 8 years there I knew 5 or fewer good supervisors.  For the most part they are terrible, have different interpretations of the policies and adhere to them differently.  If a supervisor doesn't like you they will watch you like a hawk until they have enough to get you fired.  (Meanwhile they are almost never fired or demoted for poor performance.)  

The only way to get ahead there is to kiss up and hope you're well liked.  The morale in many departments is very low and people are frustrated but nothing changes.  Many people stick around due to great benefits and OK pay even though they are miserable.  eBay's great benefits make it hard for people to feasibly leave.  

Promotions are very hard to come by unless you take a specific path (even then it's difficult).  If you don't have a desire to become a coach, supervisor, manager, you may be out of luck.  eBay has tons of cool jobs, but it's nearly impossible to get to those without going becoming a supervisor first.  Many people don't want to become supervisors but have great skills in other areas, so they're held back because there's no path for them to get promoted."

Since i was in the Appeals Dept. we were constantly getting yelled at all day and getting calls mistransfered to you and you could get a survey on that. If its a bad survey that will effect your bonus. A lot of teammates would transfer to the Appeals dept so they don't have to deal with the screaming customer and it would not effect their survey which would not effect their bonuses.

Oh i don't even think of missing a day, they will give you an Occurrence and you are only allowed 6 Occurrences. If you are passed they you will be terminated, no matter if you have a family issue, sick, or a funeral.

Also if you would like a day off even if you have PTO, Its a pain to get that day off even if you have PTO. 

Recruiters are a joke as well, they will tell you that they will work with you and your schedule if you had any particular needs. They say you will have one weekend day off, in which none of these were true. They give you false hope and promises. Recruiters are not held responsible or accountable and of course there calls are not recorded, so its your word against theirs."

I knew very few people who were actually happy at eBay and even those who were could see the dysfunction surrounding them.

Really bad senior management. The company’s “vision” is overly broad, making it meaningless. No one wants to rock the boat so the difficult conversations needed to turn the business around are not taking place.

Culture of favoritism. Promotions are based on who likes you enough to fight for you not your actual merit as an employee. It is definitely a boys club with lots of men who do not treat women with the same level of respect as their male counterparts. If you even bother going to HR about unfair treatment, you will end up worse off than before.

Very political. People don’t hold business partners accountable because they don’t want to get negative feedback from them, which would hurt their chances of being promoted. You have people and teams fighting over who gets credit for work. It can be a huge challenge to get people to share information that you need to do your job. 

Way too many consultants. eBay pays big money to have consultants (and the Strategy team), who don’t understand the business, make pretty decks. The company needs to execute well not sit around talking about shinny ideas that don’t deliver."

Politics of a large company
Lack of credibility of higher management

Legacy Java stack with domain specific reinventions of open source libraries that are worse in every way. Attempts to improve the stack get lip service but no competent infrastructure support. There is no serious movement to update the stack and fix things. New libraries and wrappers are written to interface with broken and disfunctional legacy systems so even using the new stack doesn't actually increase code productivity.

Almost all of the smart engineers have left or are leaving so you won't get significant mentorship. As a junior engineer I am actually reverse mentoring senior engineers, architecting the entire project, and implementing a supermajority of everything on my project! Also promotions and wages aren't matching what startups are offering to pay now. Due to constant reorgs promotions are hard to come by while less qualified individuals get hired at higher ranks due to age.

Something which would take you 2 days to complete takes 2+months at ebay due to the stack and process."

After that incident, I was speaking and shedding some tears to a friend privately in the hall after being humiliated and accused of being a cheater in front of everyone. One of the managers passes by while I'm visibly upset and gives a sarcastic smirk and giggle at my pain. No managers were over the age of 40 which causes really immature, High school behavior."

Don't be fooled by fake reviews posted by HRs, look deeper and you will find some really insightful reviews. 
Unfortunately I think that's what the HRs are paid for sometimes.","Good for people who can build trendy stuff for demos just so that their managers can attract attention of others and senior execs and get promoted during the performance evaluation period. 
It's sad to see that managers are considered higher in ranks over software engineers so in the end even when software engineers know the right thing, they are forced to do what their managers want. 
Some managers even micro manage your day, like asking your status 2-3 times in a day, checking on your code commits on a daily basis, and sometimes even being rude by asking what did you do today at the end of the day. 
There's too much technical debt and none of the managers are interested in working towards clearing that mess, meaning it will keep getting bigger and bigger. 
I have also seen some managers reviewing code of the architects and giving feedback as if like peer reviews even though they are not the other person whom the architect had worked with directly at code level. Thus the process of getting the code through all the way to production takes several weeks to 2-3 months"

If being involved in something meaningful and relevant is important for you then eBay does eCommerce rather than in social media etc.","Based upon how you look at it this can either be a pro or a con. eBay pays very high if you consider the RSUs, ESPP, 401K etc. But the work assigned you will be someone with even mediocre skill will be able to do easily. If you are a talented engineer with a desire to learn something new or do something of value run away from here because you will be doing very dumb work and surrounded by even more dumb people. However, on the other hand if you want to just draw a stable paycheck and get promotions by pleasing your boss then run in and join.
Very little solid engineering done here, most people are focussed on making half baked products, doing demos and poster sessions and throwing them out of the door. When other engineers who use your product complain provide workarounds and assurances that the problems will be taken care of in the next release. Of course a re-org or something similar will follow and very soon the problem will fall into another clueless engineers lap. 
Most of the top execs in eBay are moving to Paypal since they think eBay is a sinking ship.
I worked in what was considered as the most technical team of whole of eBay the condition in the rest of the company is even worse and talented engineers are going insane.
Along with technology, the management philosophy and techniques are also outdated. eBay blindly promotes people who deliver half baked products in timely fashion to managers who then force their developers to do the same. eBay still doesn't realize like the other Bay Area companies that strong developers work for autonomy to implement their ideas and creativity and not simply for a paycheck. Being outdated it still relies on paying more money and doesn't do simple things like providing food which is now common in most Bay Area startups. Not to mention that most of the managers are technically clueless or micro managers.
I personally don't know even one developer who is happy if not outright frustrated.
Don't believe any of the 5 star ratings. This is probably given by the HR and it's cronies. Notice how all the 5 star ratings are very short and terse."

It was overall a great job!,"Coming back to eBay after leaving to try out a career change: Hired for M2M APPEALS team. *Worst Job I have ever had* Experience: Customers wait around an hour to speak with you because of high turnover. The majority of the time you then have to tell the already angry customer bad news. Example: eBay made me take a return on a $300 item and the buyer sent me back a box full of rocks! (You then explain ""this is the cost of doing business, we cant prove this is the case"", the seller is now out the money and item). *Transferring Teams: You will not be able to change departments unless the wait time is handled. It has been up to an hour or so wait to call in for almost a year. Even with a posting for my old job open, Im not allowed to apply. *Pay: This team currently starts off at the same pay as the other departments I worked in even though it is a Much harder job by far.

Conclusion: Do not accept a job in the M2M Escalations or Appeals departments, unless you are ready to have hundreds of very upset callers in queue for you. If you love telling people ""no"" this is the job for you. EBAY OVERALL: Awesome company; my first two positions there were absolutely great. Just wait till something outside of M2M is hiring and you will love the company."

Avoid Category mgt teams if that's not for you.

Cross team collaboration... like getting blood from a stone.

Managers are very keen to be liked and want to flash their leadership capabilities, which at times can get tiresome.

Some still yearn for the hi-fiving ""let's give ourselves a clap for being so clever"" days and it can be laughable at times.

Work life balance is a big focus for eBay, though if you want to step up your game on Intl projects, be prepared for a lot of evening and morning calls with anyone from USA to Australia.

eBay marketplaces is represented by a very small team of about 12 employees in Luxembourg. There are also about 40-50 employees from PayPal, eBay Treasury and StubHub. 

Joined eBay few years ago with great energy and motivation to improve and develop our messy processes in billing and finance. This energy and motivation have gone away after a while when I realized:

1. Whatever you achieve it seems like a drop in the ocean because management cannot focus and deliver elementary goals. The culture of management is ""Fire! Let's work on 100 different projects to improve our business""... after debating, long discussions and hundreds of hours of work... guess what? 80-90% of the the projects are cancelled with the excuse ""are not relevant anymore"" and the remaining are delivered with significantly below quality standards expectations.

2. The performance evaluation and recognition of each employee is not based on objective performance of individual. It rather depends on your connections with management. In other words, it doesn't  matter if you have worked very hard and achieved great results for the business. Someone else with basic performance and good connections with management can achieve better performance rating from you. This has a result talented people to leave eBay after few months/years. For the Luxembourg office, more than 8 employees (out of a team of 12!) left the company in last few years - a really high turnover.

3. One of the benefits that management ""sells"" at interviews with potential candidates is the great career development and progression - which is probably another lie. It is really difficult to develop and progress your career at eBay, especially  in Luxembourg. The trainings are very  limited due to budget restrictions for development that we have the last 2 years.    

If you are unemployed and desperate to find a job, eBay in Luxembourg might be a good option. Otherwise don't waste your time - it doesn't worth it!"

2898,eBay,Be careful who you work directly for,2014-10-05,3.0,Customer Service Representative,"The company as a whole has a great culture. They have the right basic ideas for how to manage a large scale call and operation center. There are constantly events and recognition programs that keep the employees engaged and energetic about their jobs. Quarterly bonuses are always good if you do your job, and the benefits and stock purchase program are amazing. Yes, you have to deal with angry customers...but that's true of any call center.

They have a lot of on-site perks at the Draper office too...a state of the art gym with free classes (spin/yoga/etc), two basketball courts, half a soccer field, a nicely stocked restaurant, a morning cafe, a game room, and computers allocated for personal use. They do movies in the large theater they built for company events, and provide food/snacks on days they know it'll be very busy (or sometimes just to say ""thanks"" for doing your job. The soda machines are free (may be a con if you end up drinking too much...lol) You get gifted a lot of swag too, by the end of my time there I never had to wear my own clothes, I always had an ebay shirt to wear! 

They're also super involved in the community, attending events (or sometimes even having booths) to promote support of the community and growth of the culture. They have an employee recommended grant program that allows employees to nominate what favorite local non-profit ebay gives money to. You can tell they really care about giving back to the communities that their employees are from.","If you get the wrong manager it can literally kill your career. Many of their supposed policies are really ""guidelines"" and while HR will make recommendations based on those guidelines, they leave the final decision on any actions to the direct team leader. So if the team lead doesn't mesh with the employee...regardless of how well the employee works...that employee is either dead in the water (you need team lead approval to get off a team) or will eventually be terminated. I watched multiple top performers get transferred to another team lead and suddenly be branded ""bad"" and either demoted or fired within months. 

Also, depending on your department different guidelines are interpreted differently. For example, the attendance guidelines in one department apply an ""occurrence"" for every day missed even with a doctor note for a serious illness. (5 in six months and you're terminated...bad if you get a week long flu) But in another department a week long absence due to a flu would only get you one occurrence. Of course, no one tells you it's different from department to department until they're taking action (write ups/termination/etc) so if you start off in the 1 occurrence department but transfer to the daily occurrence dept you could come back from your illness to a pink slip. They tell you to stay home if you're sick, but you can lose out on the ability to be promoted (or get bonuses) if you actually do stay home since they won't allow those things when you're on write up, and you're written up after three in 6 months (again...really only an issue if you get a serious illness for more than a couple days). They claim to make work-life balance a priority, but their attendance guidelines (as certain departments and/or team leads apply them) don't mesh with that idea."

Self-sustained manager cohort grows, projects could be turned down the ""next day"" they started, the same thing could worked on by multiple independent teams in different departments, rewards are often given to unrelated but favored managers and people in front lines in the actual teams who do the work are ignored - all of this can be found here."

Believes in doing the right thing and shows employees they care in many different ways from benefits, to pay, to quarterly bonuses, to high achievement bonuses, to great amenities on campus.  

*Amenities include unlimited free soda, gym, cafe, Starbucks gift shop, basketball courts, tennis court, shipping centers with free shipping supplies, sell your item stations where you can use an ipad, mannequin and backdrops to take quality photos for your ebay listings.","* Its a call center, which means back to back to back calls, which is not for everyone.  A lot of calls require action and project time, which leadership looks down on anytime spent off calls but you're also graded on resolution.  

* Leadership in my department was not good at all, they were very negative reinforcement and weren't there to work with your or help you. 

* Nobody will help you with your development, you have to take charge of it on your own.  (which could be a good or bad thing) 

* Lots of contradictions such as company believes ""People are generally good"" but department leadership believes ""everyone is up to no good"".  Company invests a lot of time and money on each employee's training, they would rather correct poor behavior than lay off and start over, but when it actually came down to it, all team leads were letting go one (or more) person(s) from their team regardless if they have had sufficient warning.  

* Big corporation claims to value each employee but when it comes down to it they really don't and everyone is replaceable.  

* I was let go for ""excessive time offline"" but my shrink, the number that gauges the time spent offline was within an acceptable range and all offline time was legitimate time spent for customers,  and I received no warnings for it so I had no idea it was unsatisfactory, until it was too late.

* There are opportunities for advancement but hundreds of employees are competing with each other for those opportunities which actually makes advancement very hard to do.  A lot of lateral movement between departments but very difficult to move up.  

* Recently they starting using ""sports"" terms for performance, you're either winning or losing, and for those people who aren't quite hitting their metrics, hearing that you are a loser isn't exactly a motivator, it is actually the opposite.  (I think I already mentioned negative reinforcement)"

In certain roles, attractive travel benefits tend to be offered and the right candidates in certain disciplines will also receive speedy upward oriented career paths.","Shareholders dictate the company's actions, so any negative change in stock performance or stockholder opinion will immediately have consequences for employees. These can range from travel bans and perk cuts to massive reorganizations and layoffs. As previous reviewers pointed out, eBay loves reorganizations as they provide the perfect get out of jail free card for incompetent managers. Another such device is acquisition. They prefer to spend huge sums on buying technology start-ups instead of investing internally.
Note that the company sees itself as a commerce company that acts like a retailer internally, not a technology or internet company, in spite of what they may state publicly. As such, the main focus of its core business is on marketing, not on technology, and developers therefore generally fare worse than their marketing colleagues. The latter also can rely on third parties doing much of their work and thereby get promoted and receive raises much faster.
For eBay management, business expediency is everything, so if your desires cannot be subordinated to any pure market based measure or you do not speak MBA, you will rarely find long term happiness here."

I want practice on call flow or how do i increase my   cmm and decrease acw build my productivity? Or How do I do my 
SR'S classifications? can you come show me how that is done? Yes I will come show you.. I will bring you a sheet for ideas.. I never see it. I have had two incidences where I went to find my coach for coaching and found no email and she had left early. I had my team lead tell me I was denied two carrrt requests only to receive them in a email from another approved. I have been told that we don't have time to come sit with you. I was under so much stress and ready to cave in my first call center job . My team lead expresses job experiences irrelevant to what I am experiencing on the phones. I sent my better calls to my coach for example. she pulls my worse customer experience.  I am trying to destress and use my team mates for learning examples on different senerios between calls to learn from not my team lead and coach.This is when I should be pulling emails to build my productivity. I still do.  Our communication have barriers and I don't play up to people to make my way in a career position. I have said for two weeks my headset has short in it and I am having a hard time hearing on it. Oh Ok.. We will get you one.... Really?  I know now with my own job experience that I applied for probably the wrong position first I have HR and accounting exsp as well as customer serv. . I know that I will have to prove my stats in order to move out of the current position I am in. I want to be successful and meet all expectations of ebay.

The company is so large that there are always opportunities to get promoted if you can add value in some way. Have patience while working in lower level positions, learn the ins and outs of eBay, and within a year or two you will be a very knowledgable asset to the company and a smart leader will be happy to promote and offer you a great opportunity and likely more money.

Once you're in the higher roles, you really need to be able to execute and achieve results. If you can set realistic goals that help the company achieve top-level targets, then you will go far. Be critical to a degree, but not too cynical or negative. If you are critical, try to offer something proactive and helpful in exchange. Be thoughtful in meetings and when working with senior leaders. eBay needs proactive, high-energy, highly intelligent folks who can adapt quickly to changing market dynamics and execute.

I've been very impressed by most of the directors I've worked with and eBay has some very sharp VPs and Sr VPs in place who know what they are doing. This is a company that wants to be around for a long time, not just a quick bump in the stock price. They are passionate about the culture of eBay and laser focused on improving it. I am fully confident in the leaders we have currently and it's very easy to buy in and support them.","Once you reach manager level or higher, work-life balance will suffer. You may lose any sense of family or leisure time as demonstrated by countless managers, Sr. Managers, and Directors working 12+ hrs/day. Most of the time your manager won't be sensitive to it either and burnout is commonplace. I hear the same for Amazon and other tech companies, so it's probably commonplace in the industry. It's a fast-paced and intense culture where they promote innovating and moving quickly to capture market share, but most of the time that translates into very early mornings, late nights, calls from your boss over the weekends, being expected to check email over the weekends, frequent sacrifice of family time, etc.

To be fair, any company where you want to earn a significant financial reward will demand a lot and so some of this comes with the territory. But I find it slightly odd that the company promotes work-life balance so much when it's really non-existent for higher-level employees."

Watching the process, it's shocking to see how their focus on grading to a curve gives them the ability to throw entire teams under the bus. 

This company is the most risk-averse group of people I have ever met. They spend all their time trying to figure out how to catch up to Amazon and think the only way to do this is to copy all of Amazon's features. Innovation is nothing more than a buzz word to this group. 

I've watched Engineering VPs talk about creating a world-class team but then think that the way to build morale is to spend $100,000 buying funny hats for everyone to wear at the office."

      - Management believes in just getting their work done, it doesn't matter how badly one is 
        breaking one or all of the software engineering principles.
      - Even a Sixth grader can do a Product managers job in most of the dev teams. Believe             me as a developer you almost do everything
      - Management is looking to hire candidates who can where multiple hats but will pay you for wearing only one of them ....

3164,eBay,"Nice place to work, except for one thing",2013-09-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"eBay is going through an interesting transition right now, as it tries to bring the old marketplace site up to modern retail standards. There are a lot of projects and various efforts around the company to improve look, feel, voice and tone, as well as modernize the engineering and UX of the site tools themselves. Challenges make for opportunities, and for those of us who enjoy change, this is a cool place to be. There are a lot of very sharp people here working very hard to make things better.

The company seems to genuinely care about employees, which is refreshing after some of the turns I've seen being taken at other companies in this economy (Netflix, I'm looking at you). Fitness centers, cafeterias, ESPP, decent pay and other programs definitely make a difference as far as feeling valued by the company. Work-life balance is there, and while working from home is usually up to your manager, as a whole the company is open to it. The San Jose Hamilton campus is really pleasant, and the PayPal campus, while trickier to get to, is also very nice. Parking is an issue everywhere, but the company has provided free valet services to help with that.","The backbiting taking place in some groups is absolutely astonishing. The first time I witnessed it I was floored - and very uncomfortable. It's as if these folks think that this type of behavior is actually an acceptable way of doing business. I've seen reputations destroyed with the flick of the mute button, as a SENIOR MANAGER mutes a conference call, bad-mouths the speaker to a full conference room, and then turns the audio back on. If you EVER get on the wrong side of anyone who has any influence over your work, you will find it very difficult to overcome the negative trash-talk that will instantly take place and propagate all around you - but never to your face. Your manager will base your reviews on hear-say, and you will be destroyed. If this happens to you, you should start looking for another role at another company immediately, because you won't be able to overcome this here."

It was just extreme at eBay.  That said... 

Constant org changes at all levels, where you can be sure in two months half the people you are working with will be gone or moved to another group, and key management players also. 

Excessive meeting culture means you are literally in physical or virtual conference calls 6-8 hours/day, which means that (if you're not management where attending meetings IS your job) you will have to do your results producing work after hours, on weekends, holidays, and...sadly, during meetings -- where you should be paying attention to what is happening in the meetings.  As you can imagine, that also has consequences for the effectiveness of meetings."

- Flexible work hours (ability to work from home in many groups), 
- They sincerely care about employee welfare (we have groups dedicated to work/life balance and other welfare related areas), 
- Emphasis on mentoring and training (my team has weekly meetings dedicated to furthering our knowledge), 

Work Perspective: 
- Challenging/stimulating projects to work on (every time I meet with a manager I get even more excited about where our platform is going), 
- Intelligent co-workers (I have learned much from my teammates), 
- Entrepreneurial spirit and innovative (we have innovation challenges, skunkworks projects always going on, and promote a collaborative environment where people are not afraid to voice their opinions), 
- We are a customer focused company (in fact all of the new projects I am hiring for are to better the customers experience), 
- The managers I support including my immediate management is encouraging and provide the right amount of assistance without becoming a micro manager.  
- Ability to impact the company - working here you have many opportunities to impact the company as we are still very startup like on the inside - not many processes or procedures to impede you.

Our company is always encouraging us to get out in the community and volunteer.","As a recruiter/sourcer our internal systems can be better - right now they are pretty clunky.  However we do have a team developing a new ATS for us to use.

As a remote employee it would be nice to visit the office at least twice a year.  In 2 years I have been able to visit the main campus twice.

In the sourcer chair the only career growth I have is to move into a manager or recruiter role (neither of which I want).  With that being said there is not much career growth in my role.  I know my management is working on improving this and feel confident it will improve."

- Relatively risk averse.  New, interesting ideas take a long time to get off the ground because many groups that need to sign off have no incentive to support new improvements - they're there to support the status quo.
- Mostly a hierarchical organization with power for decision making concentrated at the top.  Depending on the project this can cause some churn, minor decisions get revisited because someone upstairs wants their say.

-The performance review process is based on popularity contest, as it is mandatory 10% of the staff in your team receives the lowest grade, thus the rating process is based on who is perceived as high performers vs. quantifiable achievements.   What ends up happening is those true top performers become victims to those that have the ability to manage up very well.

Rest of the engineers are not utilized properly and no one cares for the end product. Most of engineers have left the group and many are in process to leave the group. Managers lack technical expertise and are busy in playing politics and using one against other. This was not the case earlier.

- Poor, depressing culture
- Long hours
- Terrible middle managers
- Heavy butt covering, me me me, command and control attitude of managers
- Managers watch your time like you are an hourly worker
- No arrival/departure time flexibility
- Pay 10-15% below market at the time (2008-2010)
- Co-workers not that smart. Couldn't learn anything from them.
- Very outdated software stack
- No room for innovation
- Product Managers ruled, and they weren't very good

I suffocated in this work environment (I was a new grad), dealt with jealousy of co-workers and managers, was constantly micro-managed and boxed-in, and was never given any real room to try new things, learn new things, do new things, or implement things differently. Every attempt to do something new was met with talk that I didn't know what I was doing, or was squashed for some other reason. 

The managers constantly insisted that I didn't know how to do A and that I didn't know how to do B even though I clearly new, and they went to great lengths to ensure that I would never get an opportunity to do them to ""prove myself."" The managers were obsessed with knowing and commenting on the time I got into work and the time I left and would harass me about this (and any random thing they could find), rather than leave me to do my work."

Salary was not competitive, even when compared to those performing similar work in the company.

I got decent performance bonuses, however I object to distribution ""on a curve"", where managers essentially have to duke it out so their reports can get decent bonuses.

There is little correlation between a person's value to the business, i.e. relevant skills or education and their level of compensation and benefits.

At one bad day it did layoffs all of sudden  and  also simultaneously it was trying to  recruit  the external  staff from outside sources ..not sure why it is unable to utilize the long serviced employees instead of getting from outside .It shows that lack of  commitement for the company so as to help the existing employees and don't care about the employee safe guards at all and by any means  employee's concerns are not respected"

There are multiple cultures within eBay Inc that don't always work together well.  Some employees are able to have careers that span both cultures (eBay and PayPal) but that is the exception rather than the norm.  Advice - find the culture that fits you best and don't look back.

Most micromanaged to the point it demotivated the employees, i.e. would rather an employee be silent and just meet their targets than do 200% and actually talk to your neighbours.  Closed the entire burnaby centre before most could cash in on their options or RSUs as they took years to vest. Options were worthless for most people as the stock tanked and the closed the centre one month before they were to payout those with worthless options.  24x7 environment so people would be scheduled at times when transit would be closed and impossible to reach."

Managers have no clue what they are talking about and you being a slave have no authority to question them. Top it off with really bad office politics. As one manager from Google once told me they have very little respect for developers with Ebay on their resume.

You start each day thinking it could not get any worse and then the ""smart"" manager just raises the stupidity bar to a whole new level. I can barely control my laughter thinking about what all I have seen and heard.

Need proof? Most of the good reviews on Glassdoor are all from managers (this is a management hell hole if you know what I am saying ;) ).

3285,eBay,The Draper office doesn't have that much opportunity,2012-11-13,1.0,Senior Marketing Account Manager,The health insurance and 401k matching (100% match of up to 25% of your salary with immediate vesting - potentially 50% of your salary value into your 401k every year) was some of the best I've ever seen.,"The cons were very much like any place. Jobs would be filled by people that you may not respect. You think you could do better, but you don't get the job. I went elsewhere and got a better paying job in the same field for which I was rejected at this company. I could complain, but that does happen at other places, right?

It's not a business to business company, so your interactions with ""clients"" aren't quite as professional as they are with b2b companies. eBay sellers can be a little trashy. One angry women calling in told me that I was nothing, dirt, etc., and that she was very important because she made $65,000 / year. At least she was above the 50th percentile, but she certainly showed that the majority of eBayers aren't the brightest clients. There are some good positions in Draper, but for the most part it's just call center type stuff and those who work in good positions would be working amongst the call center people. Be prepared for some zoo-like bathrooms."

I grew up in this company’s product management org, and while only few years ago product management was about pitching for budget through ppt presentations and celebrating project approvals, now days it’s about collaborating with the engineering team, delivering a product, measuring success and celebrating our business impact.
eBay marketplaces, and search in particular, is one of those places where you actually work on the core product and affect millions of users with every product change, we truly move the business needle and drive the company growth (check our stock price in the past 2 years!), and eventually, the true leaders of the organization, whether they are new employees or folks who’ve been around (like me) get recognized & compensated accordingly.
The company is really focused on hiring great new talents; I can truly say the team becomes better every year.","Change is hard for many employees with the competition out there we sometime lose the leading talents.

I don't ever sweat bullets when the department manager asks me to see him at his desk or in the conference room. But what blew me away the most, was that the President of Global Customer Service himself shook my hand and congratulated me on the work I had done.

* Has huge market volume, trading data, and user community.
* Has significant resources to employ, and commands many aspects of trading (finance, advertising, inventory (via seller community), international expertise).
* eBay supports the community.  A lot of people can make their living off this marketplace, and many more people can supplement themselves, or their businesses.  Its a great venue for a good many different niche markets.
* eBay is a pretty green company, if anything this might be a little understated.","* eBay as a marketplace is easy to game unfairly, likewise excellent contributions within the organization will likely be attributed to somebody else, or more likely ignored or significantly under supported and appreciated.   Success is not what you can do but, ""how you play the game.""

* ""Playing the game,"" means supporting upper management initiatives the technological
 or methodological flavor of the day initiatives and getting credit for being the loudest and most loyal proponent.  Many of these initiatives are absurd on the face of it, others eventually play out to some kind of clearly detrimental effect.  The principals behind the initiative are simply lost, people thoughtlessly apply what they are told to to the point of actual contradiction with those principals.

* When you read about a demoralizing management practice at amy large American software company, you know its an issue at eBay ( e.g. stacked ranking of individual contributors, over reliance on contractors, too many layers of management, frequent meaningless changes in structure and responsibility, not-intented-here syndrome, innovation only by acquisition).

* eBay is so successful at metrics of the 0.5% accumulative gain, that it simply cannot see significant opportunity before it.  Its as though game changing ideas simply do not apply at eBay because 500% better just does not fit on their scale or a community member or another technology group will object to the change."

- bit of a suck-up culture specially in middle management. Many new managers hired because they are friends with Directors/VPs. Passed over other more deserving people who have spent a lot of time/energy building teams. 
- As a result, core teams are disintegrating..Upper management seems oblivious to it though. Core backend teams bleeding talent at alarming rate.
- 3-4 layers of middle management
- Too many Directors/VPs..microsoft culture being brought in.
- Most projects running very late and delayed.
- The show being run by a few senior engineers who don't listen to any other opinions.
- Ratio of engineers to management seriously screwed, almost more managers than engineers! 
- Was running as a nimble organization a few years ago, but suddenly more process has been added in the name of agile! Half the time is spent in planning, status checks, scrum reviews. 
- New technology stack not working out, too many issues and delays.
- Too much focus on machine learning(lead by people fired from yahoo). However, no returns in investment. On the other hand, areas like social commerce totally ignored."

- new management who don't understand how ebay works, trying to force fit solutions they saw at yahoo, microsoft
- too much process being introduced, agile scrum burndown charts etc..takes the fun out of coding. There are 2-3 update status check meetings every day and you have to fill multiple charts on your progress. Feels like a punch-card system rather than creative software dev.
- the project they are working on has been significantly delayed by almost a year, so work-life balance suffers. Plus key people have left.
- the engineering vision is driven by a few senior people who often belittle other engineers, publicly humiliate code written by you and take credit for all the glamorous work. While these people are smart, this can be a bad learning experience and a disheartening experience for younger engineers.
- the entire software stack is being rewritten for the past 2 years..feels like a long project and most deadlines are missed by months. No accountability of senior management."

The management has brought in new VPs and management who are their friends but have no experience running a silicon valley company.

A lot of new management from Microsoft/Yahoo(trend started late 2011/2012). 
- Follow Agile process to death! Daily standup meetings, and PjMs plan each step of the agile process. Takes the fun out of coding.
- Has become too political, people pushing own agenda
- Too much churn in management, priorities keep shifting
- Incompetent middle management layer
- Specially avoid the backend and ranking teams, too much redundant work being done.
- Most teams just doing rewrites that last multiple years, not much scope of creativity.
- Typical projects last ~6-8 months and even multiple years and are usually redundant by the time they are done.
- work/life balance sucks
- read your contract carefully, they can fire you at will anytime
- common practice to get rid of old timers every few years"

Generally regarded within ebay as one of the better teams to work for.
Good equipment.","Lack of quality projects to work on.
Need to brown nose the architects in order to work on anything significant.
Management is new to the company and runs the team like their personal fiefdom.
Constant re-prioritization due to missed deadlines and lack of a roadmap.
Management are more focussed on their pet projects and there is a good chance you might have to work on one of these.
The team maintains a revolving door for almost all engineering positions except one or two positions. The people occupying these positions tend to call the shots ripping/re-factoring code written by others and acting as almighty gatekeepers to the codebase.
Management does not seem to respect employees."
