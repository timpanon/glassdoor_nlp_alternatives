If you are lucky, you may be assigned to a team who values work life balance. Sometimes the chapter meetings are interesting and useful. Some colleagues are really knowledgeable and helpful","Some engineering managers here are like self-help books, but in reverse. Even though there's daily standup, they may require you to join private meetings every few days and then ask you about every little detail of your work. Insecure managers feel insecure about not managing enough, thus interrupting you all the time. There's a strong obsession with KPI among managers here. For example, we have a KPI for test coverage, and before every quarterly planning we are asked to pump it up by writing trivial tests, creating a false sense of safety while trashing our code base. I remember one day my manager literally told the team not to create bug tickets if we find any, but a general ticket instead because it would affect our bug KPI otherwise. I almost laughed! One thing the managers here really enjoy is cooking reports. They’re so eloquent and so good at manipulating words. They’re the kind of people that would change a light bulb, and then would write that they “successfully upgrade the illumination system with zero cost overruns and zero safety incidents"" in their quarterly reports. If you expect your manager to be your ally, you’re wrong. They may occasionally help you to appear to be on your side. But when you make a mistake, or when non-tech people interrogate you with ridiculous demands, you’re alone.

As an engineer, you may learn a few things here, but the diminishing returns come fast. Code reviews (CR) are not done properly. There's no coding convention, some ""senior"" engineers don't even know what to look for or how to give feedback in a CR, managers may even nag the reviewer to give it a pass for a quick release. This is extremely destructive to junior engineers as they may develop bad habits. Sometimes the manager decides that he needs to ""help"" the team move faster, so he writes some unmaintainable and/or buggy codes. Who will be in charge when there are issues? Of course, it's the engineers! I never had a meaningful CR conversation during my tenure, and my programing skill would have plateaued if I had not practiced with my own projects on weekends.

The company fosters a culture of fast delivery. Delivery is king. You want a proper solution to the new feature? No, use the fastest and most straight forward solution so that we can delivery it next week! You want to make changes to the database because the initial design cannot satisfy new requirements? No, make some workaround a.k.a. hack, so that we can ship this in 2 days! Again, this is extremely destructive to junior engineers as they might think this is the norm or industry standard. Focusing on delivery makes new projects look good to management, but the maintenance and extension after that is a nightmare. There were periods when I spent 80% of my time fixing bugs and handle production issues. But at least I learned something right? No, I did not. If I break a glass into splinters, and then ask you to clean up the mess, and I do that every day, do you learn something new from it? All those issues could have been prevented, but people don’t want a resilient and stable product, they want to delivery things fast to get promoted, which brings us to the next topic.

Promotion is a joke, period. There is a framework to measure your performance which appears to be sophisticated, but in fact just confusing and generic. In fact the chance of getting promoted is proportional to how much you can fill in the blank spaces in your performance review (you know why you need to deliver fast now, do you?), how good you are at playing with words (see the first paragraph), and how close you are to your manager and his peers. I witnessed an engineer who got promoted after 1 year because he was involved in a lot of projects (so he has lots of things to write in his performance report). His coding skill is still the same as it had been 1 year before. He still doesn’t know the difference between a pod and a service (in the context of Kubernetes). He still produces clutters of unmaintainable and unreadable codes. Every piece of code he touches, there’s a bug lying dormant. And somehow he got promoted! Don’t get me wrong though, I want to have a promotion as much as anyone, but it has to be really because of my achievement. Being passionate with the product, focus on growth and improvement should be the top priority, and promotion will come as a by-product. That’s what I feel about software engineer. Here I hardly felt any passion from the people I work with. Most of them are a bunch of passionless robots who just want to deliver a mediocre product and utilize their social skills to climb the corporate ladder."

- Coupons (USD$50) per month","- One important thing other reviews haven't mentioned is the overall organisational structure, which I think is crucial for anyone considering joining the company.

- Reporting Line: HK office CEO --  APAC CEO in SG -- Delivery Hero HQ in Berlin

- Cons:

1. Like other reviews mentioned, the organisational structure is a mess & there is zero internal career development. The average tenure in the HK office is ~7 months.

2. The organisation structure is weird because there is no check and balance. 

The leader in Hong Kong has an Employee mindset who sheds away all management responsibilities to the ""Heads"" and he only focuses on attending external events to meet people who could potentially help with his own ""start-up"" and talking to senior management in Singapore and Berlin. 

The middle management in Hong Kong, like many reviews described, is awfully inexperienced and messy. Everyone is driven by their own agenda, i.e. pleasing their bosses with the hope of getting a promotion, and there is no uniform / consolidated direction / goals for the company. The company is obsessed with quarterly OKRs but the numbers are set arbitrarily with no real business understanding.

The employee experience wouldn't have been so disastrous if the individual team leaders were capable / effective. The sad fact is that they really aren't. There isn't even ONE single leader who is anywhere near the level required for leading a company at this size (in terms of market cap / gross sales / market share dominance).

In normal companies, the HR team could have been a saviour in this situation, but unfortunately it's not the case. 

3. The worst problem is the lack of diversity in the management. In the HK office, all of the Directors are male, with only one of them being Asian (the CEO). Prior to the new CEO joining in Dec 2020, all of the senior management are expats who do not speak / read any Chinese. Their background significantly limits their business comprehension. A lot of times, the employees are pushed to chase unachievable goals with no real rewards. Therefore, capable employees would simply leave as there is no pull factors for staying at all. The only employees who stay beyond 1 year either have zero chance of getting a comparable comp package and/or title elsewhere (i.e. they have been parachuted to a position beyond their actual capabilities and qualifications) OR have zero career ambition.

4. Advice for anyone considering joining the company, especially women: please do not waste your time here if you are looking for a place where you can find motivated colleagues, visionary and responsible leaders, work-life balance, positive culture, and career path. This company is the opposite of all these things.

5. Note for those with any sense of structural fairness:  there is no structural justice in the company, with multiple internal complaints being swept under the carpet and employees being treated very unfairly.

6. Last but not least, like other reviewers mentioned, the management in Singapore and the global team in Berlin share similar traits described in the examples of the HK office above. Having seen the real figures in the past 3 quarters, I really doubt if the management can pull it off to bring the business (including food delivery & other verticals) to profitability and sustainability in the next 3-5 years.

7. Note: the couriers are not hired as ""employees"" at foodpanda. I wish Glassdoor would separate courier reviews from employee reviews, as well as to provide more clarity on the global-regional-local structure."

257,foodpanda,Do not join - extremely biased,2021-08-25,1.0,Logistics Manager (APAC),"This solely depends on your direct manager and their relationship they have with you, and with their superior. 

I was in the local team and I had my share of good and bad direct managers before I was promoted (not because they identified me for promotion)

Is the work in FP interesting - Yes, depending on what you do. some departments are dead ends and they would never tell you that

is the pay good? - NO, far lower than competition and yes from all the other reviews - NO bonus, as far as i know only a select few has equity, so, unless u were poached (their non competition clause is a joke by the way. Apparently its ok to have that clause in your own contract, but its not hypocritical to poach other people from competing firms), then this is a flat NO

Flexiblity - yes FP is is quite good on flexibility, still, depends on your direct manager.","I will save you all the time and not try not to list the general Cons that you can find in other reviews. 

Promotion guideline - they have close to 0 guideline when I was in, and every perf appraise session was basically a pat on the back. There was no career pathway, no one to explain anything. 

back in '17 - 18 - you see interns being parachuted into manager positions. do a linkedin search and you can find out where they're from. in fact, the role i was hired for was downplayed to a senior executive position because in the HR's words ""oh the people in that department don't respond well to the manager role"" 

sorry to say - I had the best time in that department and only found out from them that an intern (yes, from overseas) was slated to be parachuted in to take that role but there were some visa problems.

One of my amazing colleague was only pushed into a higher position because the previous logistics manager (yes, came from being an intern) did not cut it. Both of them started at around the same time and my colleague was a Full Time employee, mind you.

Eventually this colleague left as requested a transfer but was always delayed on that.

Workload - If you really want to work in this company, please apply straight for APAC. why? because you will be paid more doing the same thing. 

And as alot of many other reviews have explained - there is some bias to the hiring. 

Alot of what you do has to be showboated in a dressy fashion to get middle management to notice. So people who talk well but do not do a lot of work tend to get promoted fast, until it catches up to them."

260,foodpanda,Toxic workplace where workload is not distributed fairly and your ability in politic games determines your success.,2021-08-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Top management is actually very good.,"You name it.

The teams are organized and staffed pretty randomly.

Some teams and employees do have very heavy workload, some teams are in the opposite situation, but regardless, senior management is not aware, so it all depends on how good is your direct team manager at talking or taking advantage of the ongoing chaos, so he can get rewarded with additional resources to fulfil his own ego.

Salaries are pretty random as well, some new colleagues might have negotiated a better salary from the start than the ones who are talented and hard workers, who will get similar salaries only after two or three promotions.

Few employees have to carry the whole boat, but their merit is not  differently recognized from ones who do very little, it all depends if you are able to make your pretty much useless manager to shine in front of his own superior, because this is how periodical reviews are carried out.

Eventually only the worst employees, who do not get caught benefiting from the chaos and other teams' work, stay, while the good ones get burned out and leave.

Promotions are based on how good you are in politics with other teams' managers only, there is no standard criteria in place.
If you have no ethic, are comfortable in stealing other people's hard work, are good at overstating your achievements (no one has time to check whether true or not) or make up creative stories about your contribution to the company, this is the place for you, showhorsing is well rewarded.

If you are someone who wants to learn and do some work, make sure you are a good team first with a capable manager, if not, better change team or leave the company. If you unfortunately end up to be in the wrong team then:
- No work life balance.
- No training.
- No support from your direct manager.
- Feedback is ignored or unwelcomed.
- Toxic working environment from others useless team, who just need your work for them to present it just by adding a bit of color.
- No leadership and vision in mid managers, only blatant statements.
- Micromanagement, but no clear OKR."

Also means that some directors/heads will try to manage or direct your work if it benefits them despite you not being in their department.
Extremely fast-paced (mind you, steep learning curve is a “benefit” written in most job listings)
Work reviews by the manager and directors are not aligned at all. Performance reviews can be benchmarked to the entire department, hence unfairly dropping your manager’s good rating to a neutral rating. 
The director, who is responsible for your final performance rating (which directly translates to the total pay raise that you will get), may not always attend the final presentations of your work/initiative. This leads to an uninformed and biased review & calibration of your work performance. 
Communication issues - no streamlining of communication flow (multiple groups and long, repeated questions for one topic).
Management is somewhat biased towards your nationality, only favouring non-locals and to a certain extent, non-Asians."

given the foodpanda business scale is large, trust me, it doesn't correlate with how well the business system here. 
poor work documentation, unsophisticated internal offers tool, unstandardized workflow, and what worst is foodpanda does not have employee value & culture :)) 
just imagine yourself, foodpanda is massively hiring new folks but the company has no unified employee value and culture that could bond everyone together. so, people over here behave as they want, they just want their things 'to get done' and end up to be not very collaborative peers."

Inexperienced leadership team. Experience need not necessarily come with age, however, there are managers with almost no experience in the specific field at all. E.g.

Money can resolve a lot of problem so when u have lots of money, life won’t be too difficult.","Regional office and HQ is not aligned which you will get 2 opposite direction. If you want to do proper value adding work, it is not possible unless your superior is good. However, management are usually the ones that are constantly going against polices and controls. If you have integrity, you most likely won’t be able to survive well unless u are c-level that can make an impact. 
I don’t see any sustainability in the company, for example u burn $1000 employee cost for an output of $1 benefit. HQ controls look reasonable but apac will be constantly trying seek for exception n it always work. 
Company is made up of around 70-90% foreigner and most of them are like expat so you can expect > 50% of self entitled individuals. 
Company doesn’t value employees much where year end performance review can be skipped and annual increment can be quietly ignored. Reason given by management is being ‘busy’.  They will also promise u on bonus coming soon when u join but it didn’t happen n you won’t foresee it to happen soon when management can ignore proper appraisal. 
Most of the people are manager level and if you are the rare ones doing the ground work, u will be able to see the shock of bad processes, systems problems, lack of controls and whole list of stakeholders asking for update. I don’t think they understand that basic foundation of processes needs to be working well for managers to manage unless u hire hands-on manager which is super rare. 
Overall, there are many problems from top to bottom which cannot be resolved unless there’s a realization and change in management."

- Understanding team lead & some of them are flexible 
- Flexibility on your schedule
- Following the Labour law by giving EPF & SOCSO
- Medical card & monthly food/drinks allowance only will be given after a year
- Very fast response from HR when comes to salary shortage (not sure about others)","- Very bad management
- No transparency ( Was given a different position for what have applied for) there is no courtesy to inform you that they have appointed you to a different department. There are also other agents who experience the same thing. AND

- HR lack of knowledge- Asked one of the HR in regards to the other opening for the part-time position, however, we were told only that particular position is available, so I applied for that.  During the induction, the HR mentioned that the part-time position that I applied has already closed. 


- 15 minutes break for part-timers (you can't be late, if not disciplinary action will be taken )- How could you order and eat for 15 minutes? if you are hungry? as a part-timer, we need to have our tummy heal as well. AND 

- Everything in the office "" toilet (15 min) &   break "" is a must to inform via verbal and in chat groups. Well, I do understand certain call centers do adhere such rule esp punctuality, but the 15 mins toilet break & 15 min break ( part-timers) is unacceptable plus have to inform in the group.

- Too focus on rules- If you are late, you have to inform the group and yes, it makes sense. What does not makes sense is when you make in an accident,  one of the TL replied that whether have you inform the reporting TL (about the absence)? and the TL is in the group. Come on,  in this situation you still ask this rather than your subordinate's well-being? 

- Every month shortage-  At the first month of the employment, there is no salary was paid, when asked about the reason from the HR,  there was no clear answer given only have to liaise with the TL or fill in the form which later did fill accordingly and the person who handles the pay comes back and the pay was credited into the account the next day. Even many employees experience shortage every month. (and note that its just a part-time salary and it's much lower than the full-time earnings)

- Hiring more employees? - If you are really hiring more people, kindly provide enough space for them. We have to wait even at the point of 2 hours just to get a seat and do our job, and remember, we still have to accomplish the KPI despite the waiting.  If the management has already done the plan to get more space, then  is awesome, if not pls take action asap."

Only when you want to leave the company (and if you're a star player) that they'll notice you and say that you're ""highly"" valuable to the point of trying really hard to persuade you not to leave.
On top of that, the HR does not tender to the employees properly and really late at everything.

They changed their notice period to 3 months to stem resignations.,2019-09-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"People at the bottom are nice and friendly, and the company is well funded. They also love to party if you’re into that...","Their approach to people management is poor. Managers are not concerned with the development of their people, payscales are unfair and depend entirely on what leverage you have as well as whether you’re an expat. 

To justify pay differences of 40-60% between locals and expats at the same level, management has been heard saying things like “Singaporeans should be paid less because they don’t need to cover rent”. 

Do not let the management trick you into thinking that there will be a bonus scheme. They have said that for several years. I’d be pleasantly surprised if they started offering one next year. 

There are also countless employees who were never offered pay adjustments despite taking on greater responsibility. Management will wait till you are about to resign to offer a pay adjustment. Expect performance discussions to have an adversarial focus rather than a developmental focus. 

Recently, they have also started revising their notice period to 3 months even for junior positions to stem the wave of resignations. 

Some senior managers are engaging in empire-building, where they attempt to assume responsibilities from another vertical and undermine them secretly. This leads to terrible office politics which the top management(C-suite and MDs) seem oblivious to. 

One last note: If you’re an engineer and considering joining foodpanda APAC in 2019, the bar has been greatly lowered for new joiners as they are looking to meet the aggressive hiring targets they’ve announced recently. Good if you’re looking to get your foot in the door, but not so great if you’re looking for a high-performing team to work with."

The vibe in the Berlin office is also very good.","Being a startup means that sometimes the company structure might be still unclear to the employees. This means that some tasks/projects might not have a clear owner, which means that they might not be guided very well. But it's still fun working on them."

801,foodpanda,Good only at the beginning,2016-03-07,1.0,Business Development Manager,"Joining foodpanda was a really good decision at the beginning. 

You go through the Skype interviews, you get into the country and in the first day you handle a lot of responsibilities that you have no idea how to manage. But that is a good thing right? You are ambitious so you give the best from yourself and you start learning, really fast and a huge range of different things, of different departments, how to lead people, how to build teams... You experienced a real start-up there!","The company is too big now to give you that ""start-up"" feeling. It is difficult to get involved in other departments and learn fast and from every department. 

They treat people like nothing. Honestly."
802,foodpanda,Worst ever company to work with!!!,2016-03-02,1.0,Relationship Manager,Absolutely NO Pros about this company!!,"Unethical, Unprofessional, Totally Inconsistent, Mismanagement, Corrupted Top Level Management.
I had worked for Foodpanda India, put all my efforts, over achieved my targets in half of the time frame, and I even had been doing things that were not coming under my responsibility, just because I loved working and I was over sincere to my work. But in the two months course of my overall experience, I could feel unprofessionalism everywhere.
The policies of the company keep changing every now and then. They are so inconsistent with their terms and policies, they badly keep following Zomato for everything and keep blaming Zomato as well, still copies all their strategies. They claim, everything is being decided from Berlin!! God knows if they really have a team in Berlin lol! HR never responds! It took me 45 days trying to communicate with HR requesting my employee code. I have sent nearly 10 emails to HR in my two months requesting for Employee code and appointment letter.  Kept trying for the appointment letter, but till date, I never received such a document! The tragedy comes all of a sudden! One fine day, being at work, in the field, I could not access my official mail. I had two of my colleagues working in the same city, none of us could either access out mail or salesforce login. It was then, that we released that we are terminated! That too with no reason, no explanation, no prior notice. We had pretty good track record, performed really well, but still this is what the company rewarded us with! The reason they said was that, the Berlin team deiced to pull out their business from Tier II cities and so they are shutting down operations in my city. But in reality, Foodpanda is doing business in full swing with the restaurant partners whom me and my team signed up with. They just avoided us after utilizing us. 
Message to anyone who is planning to join Foodpanda : Please do not risk your career, future in Foodpanda, the company sucks! I had the same review from another victim who worked with Foodpanda in my same city, two years back as well."

804,foodpanda,Great people. Terrible leadership.,2016-02-11,3.0,Sales Executive,Amazing colleagues and connections that you'll never forget. Great colleagues supporting you and to learn from. Expect to be fitted into the company within 3 days.,Upper management struggles to motivate. Have little knowledge about local markets and their culture. Make demands from employees that are illogical from a local standpoint.
805,foodpanda,Foodpanda Management,2016-02-10,5.0,Business Development Manager,"Foodpanda really listens. It's one of the very few companies where your MDs Jakob and Emma in particular listens to your feedback and actually take action.

Jakob and Emma especially has helped me a lot she thought me so much - sales, product, people. Emma was always there for me even on Public Holidays. I must say her work ethic is admirable. She really was the one who sold Foodpanda to me.  A large part of my achievements is definetlly accredited to her. She is kind, smart and really the most down to earth boss I have ever had. 

I love how regardless of age, nationality, race or even sexuality the 3 leaders of foodpanda Jakob, Emma & Amit Nagpal are always fair impartial and really understanding. 

I mean sales is definetlly not a ""piece of cake"" and Amit has high expectations of us. But he does that for a reason because he belives in us and he knows by setting standards we will push ourselfs harder and allow ourselfs to fully reach our maximum potential. If you want to learn from a true sales leader with a wealth of experience - Amit is your man. Don't expect your journey to be a ""walk in a park"" but I can assure you he will impart valuable skills in you.",A bit too structured for my liking.. But good for the company..
806,foodpanda,poor management,2016-02-09,1.0,Finance,"team in general are fun and ambitious, but young and inexperienced.","Management is not hands on enough. Bad at communicating how their strategy (that changes every 2 months) should be broken down into day to day business. If something is suddenly not to their liking, no constructive feedback or guidance is provided. Hiring practise is very questionable. countries operate with very limited control form HQ."
807,foodpanda,Stingy and demanding,2016-01-26,2.0,Content,"Overall friendly atmosphere, most colleagues are nice. We also get to enjoy free food. Flat hierarchy somewhat that allows everyone to share their opinions.","Management is too messy and have a strong white supremacist mentality. Too much work and too little pay.  Even when some people share opinions, they get ostracised. Management of this country is also very biased. People who work hard don't get recognised. People who don't work but always suck up get to progress."
