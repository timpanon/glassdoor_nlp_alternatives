The support team responds quickly if you have any questions. Usually within 24 hours.","The platform is quite saturated so it becomes difficult to attract students. The lower your rate, the more likely you are to get students. This comes as a disadvantage because you end up earning very little for the amount of classes you complete."

They say that withdrawals made by the 15th will be sent to you by the 25th of the month; however, if you withdraw on the 15th of the month, you won't get your money until the next month because of the withdrawal processing time. As someone with bills to pay, withdrawing on the 15 and receiving it on the 25th is still way too long to wait in my opinion.
- Very high teacher to student ratio. You have to set your prices very low to get students, plus they take a 15% cut of what you make, so the teachers are not paid what they deserve. If you charge more reasonable prices, you can't get enough students. 
- No curriculum available whatsoever; you have to do all of the work to create lesson plans for students or pay for services on other sites."

The staff is really nice and helpful. Opportunity to work from the comforts of your home.,"This is a language learning platform, not a real online school so you have to advertise yourself a lot to be noticed, but this is not the main complaint. Normally, when a student finds a suitable tutor s/he books a lesson, but there's also a feature called Language Partners where people request tutors to be their friends on Skype, so to avoid booking a class and paying the tutor. I only had one single student throughout the whole year, all the others requested free lessons or told me they'll pay later.

117,italki,Constant emails requesting free lessons,2018-08-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Lots of students around the world to connect with,"Wow. I made my account and within hours was flooded with messages from students asking to do a ""language exchange"" (e.g. they teach you their language and you teach them your language).  I also received many emails from men who were clearly interested in...something other than learning English. I didn't respond to those messages and some of them quickly turned hostile with the men swearing at me in both English and their language. I reported them and deactivated my account. It wasn't worth the headache...especially since most English teachers are charging $15 or less an hour."
