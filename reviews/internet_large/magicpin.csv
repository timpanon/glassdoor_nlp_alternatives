118,magicpin,Worst company to work for.  No work-life balance at all. Pathetic work culture.,2020-09-26,1.0,Software Engineer,1. The compensation is decent according to market standards.,"The leadership or management team is absolutely pathetic. Rather than the company's unanimous vision each of them wants to get things done according to their own point of view. All seem to be running in a rat-race. No original ideas or design and all and just copying from other products. 
Product Managers are hired just for the sake and ultimately the things are done according to the 2 founders only.
No empathy with employees and just they want to completely exploit the employees, solely treating them as resources to get work done.
Although iterations in a product are good and lead to betterment, here the iterations are merely due to the gap between the product and the CEO because ultimately the leadership team behaves as if they don't have an idea when the app goes out to production.
No respect for employees privacy and personal space and time. Just bombarding the employees with useless messages over the weekend as well or at any odd hours of the night and expecting the things to be done at that very moment. 
The founders are completely non-technical and feel like engineering tasks can be done in just a jiffy.
To worsen the things, the infrastructure also is not very good be it the cafeteria or the sitting space for the employees. There are hardly 3 tables in the cafe and having lunch on the table seems to be a privileged thing.
The HR team is merely a puppet in the hands of the founders and doesn't seem to stand for the employees.
So that pretty sums up the work-life balance is a myth in this company. And if you are looking for professional growth you must try not to land up here."

145,magicpin,Pathetic,2020-02-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Some sort of basic remuneration,"Magicpin is a pathetic workplace for any employee. To support this statement here are a few reasons from infinitely many 
Organization's CEO has no trust over the employees as there are frequent salary cut from all sorts of department from unskilled workers to developers in tech team Magicpin as an organization has been hiring mostly on top management level to create some sort of pressure cooker like situation and a sense of havoc(hire/fire) within employees. Instead of giving some sort of freedom to employees they are expected to stay/work overtime on top of their existing work hours.
 You'll not be assessed on the basis of your work, besides this the number of hours you spent in the office is more important. 
There is no sense of liberty in employees to raise their voices as they fear being fired. HR dept is also useless as its merely a puppet and is instructed for unnecessary salary—cuts and cheap hiring by management.
 Their exists micromanagement on each everything you do whether it's you preferred lunchtime or of personal urgency.
 The organization has no or zero focus on employee's personal growth as an individual. It will just find a replacement for the existing one. The organization has no focus on delivering quality/tested products as they're more driven by stupid deadlines and reliance on duct—tapping the bugs to fix the issues later. 
There's no proper solution (design/architecture) setup between different teams again which is mostly another cause of compromised product. Management level employees are quite arrogant and do not have a sense that an employee has a personal life. 
Employee welfare is the last thing that comes to my mind that Magicpin thinks about. The organization has 12 annual holidays on top of 12 government holidays(mandatory ones) which is very low or shameful as compared to industry standards. 
In particular please do not expect to find a proper seat to work as office building is capable of holding x employee currently and holds 2x employees, feel extremely lucky if you are able to get a seat on the floor on which you or your teamwork and besides this be ready to face nuisance/commotion of people from all sorts of department interfering with your surroundings as all of the meetings rooms are already occupied. 

After all this if depending on your luck you might see some magic (Magicpin's magic)— Your manager can treat you like a slave."

224,magicpin,Team Leader Operations,2018-01-21,4.0,Team Leader,"Opportunity to learn more, No timing and leave issue",Work Pressure and high expectation
225,magicpin,Could be better,2018-01-07,2.0,Anonymous,"Best reasons could possible be the transparency in the system where you can share and discuss about your ideas with the top management and they will not only eagerly listen to it , but will also give you feedback.Time flexibility.Energetic and learning environment.",Working in operation is the something I would not suggest to anyone. TL's expect you to work for 12 hours 6 days a week.You are not given any incentives for whatever great you do as someone else will take your credit.Nepotism is highly encouraged.No personal life remains with irregularities in time shifts.Dictatorial and autocratic behaviour of managers.

228,magicpin,Worst Company Ever,2017-10-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are no pros apart from salary will come on time but after getting deducted due to various silly reasons.,"No proper work time. The company wants you to work for more than 12 hours a day.
Salary will be deducted for silly reasons.
Higher management is never satisfied with you effort and hard work.
They will make you work even on Sundays and holidays.
No company policies and ethics.
No transparency between teams.
Preference will always be there no matter how good you are.
There is no personal life. All your time will be wasted in doing company works.
Life becomes hell in this company.
Management doesn't trust their employees.
Till now I have not been to any situation where I am satisfied with the company.
The worst company I ever worked.
Pressure will make you sick and still the management will abuse you"
