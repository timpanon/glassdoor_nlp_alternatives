1. Very bad code
2. Same repetitive work

4.  Unnecessary meetings with no outcomes
5. Many non-technical managers and product managers don't know anything technical.

Cheap HR Policies
1. Snacks are distributed at 6:30 PM so that employees stay at the office till then
2. Recently started morning breakfast too. 
3. Probably first small sized company which has time swipe in/swipe out time tracking. Even big MNCs don't have this kind of rules implemented.
4. Bad pay
If you actually have good work and pay and good managers, you do not need to come up with such cheap techniques.

Unnecessary hirings.  Not sure how these kinds of decisions are implemented and based on whose approval. If CTO and CEO approve these, they seriously need to look into the work culture of other companies. 

Redbus is all you will see in the service company with extra added cheapness."
231,redBus India,Open Stack - Open Culture,2019-02-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flat structure, caring, innovative, CXOs are reachable, flexible timing,  recruits young talent, appreciates self-initiative, explores latest technologies, focus on extra curricular activities and best is very transparent and friendly for any employee",For my 5 years exp in redBus i hardly need to raise any concern. Its difficult to find any cons as you can speak about it openly to Senior Mgmt.
232,redBus India,Good startup,2019-02-15,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Flexible timing.
Good place to learn for freshers 
CEO and CTO are good peoples .
Office location is comfortable to reach from various part of Bangalore.","Not good place for experienced peoples .you need to bare with micro managment of some managers who are naive as manager.
No proper team or organization structure.
Product owners are mostly freshers and they behave unprofessional sometimes. No clear requirement for development  and hardly we get properly designed requirements.They just bothered the kra and trying to push product without giving proper time to QA .
Peoples plays blame game for issues leaked to production rather than working as a team to push the fix .
Limited growth option .Redbus is still has work culture as that of a startup .So there is limited opportunities of growth.
HR are non effective. Before joining ask everything to be mentioned over mail or documents."

236,redBus India,Software Engineer,2018-12-12,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,You get ownership of your work. You get to build a product end-to-end.,"No proper code review in place. Most of the systems on the floor are built upon a really badly written code base.
Very bad compensation as compared to the market.
Very high attrition rate.
They don't even try to retain good developers.
Most of TLs have very poor technical skills.
No benefits like cab service or free food."
237,redBus India,My take on redbus,2018-12-09,3.0,Software Engineer,"Liberty to experiment.

Flexible timings 
- None will bother you until you fail to deliver. Come anytime, go anytime and be in-sync with your manager , NO QUESTIONS asked.

Good, appreciative people and CTO & CEO are cool guys.

Many languages, Many tools - Polyglot development.
 - many argue about polyglot, but this is great as this expands your horizon of tech and solution.

Spot awards and recognition's.

Regular Doctor visit happens every week.

Play Area and lounge -Pool table, Table tennis,Carom,Chess,Foosball.You have so many things if you want relax and chill.

Hot drinks - Coffee,Tea and Milk are available piping hot anytime.","High attrition rate. They don't retain good talents.

Code quality is pathetic. Since its very agile, coding standards and methodologies are not taken as much in to consideration in most of the teams excluding few.

Few systems are just made so crappy that few aspects of data and insights get lost. I strongly believe this is because of the hard push by managers to the team inorder to accomplish their targets for the timeline given to them.

Nothing major has happened like a game changer ever since the launch.
They incorporate cutting edge tech and have good engineers under the hood, but lack to innovate in bus industry space. Don't get me wrong, they are market leaders in bus industry space. IMO i feel nothing impressive has happened from a customer standpoint of view.

Few teams, lack good technical leaders who fail to impart knowledge and inspire them.

No free food and cab.

Pay and hikes are less and not rewarding."
