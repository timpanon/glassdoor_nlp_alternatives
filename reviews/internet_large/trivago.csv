Nice people. You can make friends for life.
Work-life balance is good. You won't be working late often and you can have your life besides work :)","Very low salary and they say they are ""looking into it"" for many years.

They increased people's salaries by x% last year for the good work they did in 2021, except if you are going to leave the company at the beginning of 2022. I've talked with at least other 2 people in this situation. What a shame! Well done! 

No real benefits as it used to have:
 - No trivago on tour (company-wide travel, ok corona times).

 - No ""working in"": We used to be able to work from Palma de Mallorca or Leipzig but since the pandemic began we don't have another office than Düsseldorf. Instead of stopping with this benefit, why don't increase the salaries or give another benefit in exchange?

- No trivago experiences anymore. We used to have things like: Walking the ""Camiño de Santiago"", guided visits to a colleague's hometown, etc... :(

 - The awesome campus they advertised for years worldwide is now a shared building and we can't bring people from outside anymore to get to know the building (even after corona), which was awesome and made trivago conquer new employees after their visit.

- First time we got a ""nice"" Christmas gift and even that they can't do well anymore.
Idea: Let's buy everyone an Apple Homepod Mini, they are gonna like it... I mean, only the ones that have an iPhone but that is fine, right? right?. :facepalm: (How will you keep a company running if you can't buy a freaking gift that everyone can use???).

They don't help you with a single cent to pay your electricity or internet bill, even though they are saving a lot from us working from home. And they will also not give you any budget for you to get your home office ready. Good luck.

 - It is impossible to grow if you don't want to move from engineering to management positions.

- Unclear future, you work many months on a project, and out of the blue, they decide not to move forward with it even though a full team worked on it and the project is 95% ready to go. #LackOfFocus

It is very sad to see a company that was fun and with so much potential to lose its purpose. They are losing their biggest asset: Their people. It is unbelievable the number of talents living trivago that have been with them for more than 4, 5, 7, 10 years.

Today I'm just really upset with many things that happened in the last months. The total disregard is an enormous lack of respect and consideration with people that went above and beyond.

I wish you can look inside and fix those mistakes. It is gonna be better for the employees and the future of the company.
Cheers."

17,trivago,Amazing Employer,2022-01-14,4.0,Inside Sales Representative,"Amazing company with a strong culture. The company invests a lot in employees care and always hears feedback in a constructive way. Managers trust their talents and provide them with enough space for failure, but also gives them full flexibility in way they work.",This feedback is only given regarding a personal experience in one particular team/department. This may not apply to other departments. The company is sufferings a bit of lack of objectivity regarding salaries in the sales team.
18,trivago,Great place to progress,2022-01-11,5.0,Business Analyst,"I have been working at trivago for almost 5 years now. The company has shown willingness to re-invent itself, transition to a remote and hybrid model and change business model in order to better cope with the uncertainty caused by the covid-19 pandemic.
Moreover, recently management addressed a well known problem within the company, that was the discrepancy between trivago's employees salaries and salaries for the same roles in other companies. In fact, everybody received a one-time extra salary increase (in addition to the yearly salary review we all get) to fill or reduce this pay gap.

For me, the top PROs of working at trivago are:
- Great flexibility (working hours, holidays, processes, communication etc.). The company lives the word ""flexibility"" or at least tries its best to do so.
- Great opportunity to progress. I have changed 4 different roles in 5 years, either taking on more responsibilities or getting more involved in specific topics.
- Transparency and accountability. It is nice to know that people around me are willing to share results, successes and failures widely. This helps everybody strive for the common good, rather than just for personal interest","Of course, over time there have been a few cons:

- A bit of a confusing environment. We're in ""experimenting mode"" quite often. This potentially creates progress and value, but it can be hard to manage sometimes
- Being slow in embrace measure to fill the pay gaps with other companies
- Having insisted too much for years on the usual start up benefits (ping pong and free beers, for example), rather than emphasizing the freedom given to employees to create value. Luckily, this has somehow changed lately (also thanks to the remote and hybrid set ups)"

Generally, direct managers are great. When I had some mental health related issues, I was given the time and space to breath and take some time to make sure I was on top of my game. 

Unlimited holiday (with the state minimum) is great, plus having 2 company sponsored holidays (a week in summer, and 2 weeks around Christmas) per year is nice.

Learning is at the core of trivago's ethos. Everyone tries and learns from everything they do and makes learning opportunities out of mistakes and fumbles. The Talent and Culture team even keep this belief when changing processes and making rules.","The flexible working hours are a double edged sword, meaning you might get messages outside of core business hours, mostly from coworkers. 

Pay for software developers is on the lower end for the market. 

No option for full-remote. We're only remote right now because the government has suggested it due to the pandemic. We'll probably be back to normal once the pandemic is over.

Feedback between talents tends to be soft and talents are encouraged to keep it soft for fear of insulting others, despite more direct feedback being useful for talent growth.

As for career growth, there isn't much. You can either be a software dev or a lead. There really isn't anything in between."

Culture is amazing, people are very friendly and welcoming specially during the first month, it is all about getting to know the people, the culture and what the company/product is all about.

Heard from many coworkers that its a very dynamic environment and that seems to be true, you could jump from one team to another on a whole other topic within the year, which at least for me makes things a lot more interesting and non routine.

There's also some focus on personal growth and knowledge, encouraging you to take several hours a week to participate in courses, webinars , guilds, planning your own topic presentation basically improving your knowledge in any area.

Managers offer a lot of help in terms of career planning and growth, focusing on how you want to progress and where you want to end up.
They will guide you and even offer up some tasks and responsibility that help steer and prepare you for it.

I've met/ heard of many people at the company who have been there for 4-5 even 7+ years. And talking to some of them I see no sign of boredom, lack of resolve or burnout which is a very good sign specially in Software Engineering.

Also, some departments (from what I heard and experienced) are structured and managed better than others. There are also people in positions of mid-management that appear to only be there due to 'sucking up' to those above them, not always because of their skills, background or ability.

-a permanent contract means nothing in there, as when they don't need you, they can easily get rid of you by ""performance"".
-the salary revision is just a joke, and employees can not participate in the process and depends on your direct manager decision.
-the contract topic: first you are offered a one year contract, with six months probation period, after that, instead to offering you the permanent contract, they will offer you another one year contract (without payrise or salary review) that can be terminated by the end of the year, so fire you its much more cheaper.

-Very shady remuneration (non) system.  -Employees are often hired from abroad with minimal paid salaries fixed by Germany to accept their work permits.  As the minimums are not the same and as for some countries, they don't even exist (Within the EU for example), this leads to situations where, for the same jobs, employees earn different salaries. Needless to say that these minimums are  ridiculousely low compared to the German mid size and big companies.
-360 evaluation system encouraging camaraderie and politics. Possible to gamr the system by reciprocating on good reviews. 
-A small secte of comfortable & incompetent middle managers doing the dirty work: Humiliating the employees to keep their salaries low. 
-Company is losing its most valuable assets: competent employees as they are refused any  possibility of promotion. Almost everyday somebody leaves.
-Executives infantilize employees with a set of values nobody believes in: trust...
-Story telling is much more important than progression in trivago. To be appreciated, you don't have to do but to say the right thing.

But it's not the majority and I also observe they have a hard time in that respectful and multi-cultural environment. 360 degree feedbacks should be more often than twice a year and recruiting needs some adjustment to identify better who has the right mindset and who not. trivago believes in trust, authenticity and strong collaboration between teams and every team mate.

Attitude to 'pitch' employees and not really listening. Bossy managers rather than leaders.

We put memes on the walls, got drunk together, made jokes on slack, eaten cake together... I walk into the office every morning and I'm always happy to see everyone there. All the toxic people have left by now.

- I have a lot of freedom in my duties and my relationship with my current boss is stellar. I arrive whenever I want, leave whenever I want, I do not get micromanaged, I suggest the topics I want to work on... it's pretty good. It's why I'm still around.

- It looks like some smart people have recognized some of the problems the company is facing and may be working to fix them. Yay for the last strategy summit, I hope things move forward from there!","- Approach this company with a plan, this took me a bit to figure out -- and maybe it applies to all companies. What do you want to do? How much do you want to earn? What do you want to learn? Where are you gonna be in 2 or 4 years? If you do not have a plan you will get complacent and will fall behind on your career while on trivago. Do not expect good guidance from leadership. Do your homework. Stay hungry.

- Since teams are very compartmentalized, what you get depends a lot of who you work with. There are two team tech teams doing great in the Palma office, and there's one that's disintegrating before our eyes due to the toxic culture some people created.

- Company culture declined significantly on the last two years. I'm not exactly sure why... Maybe it's because the shares went down? Maybe the party magic wore off? Maybe Rolf lost part of his charm together with his weight? Perhaps we'll never know.

- Management has two choices: Lose money by paying people fairly, or lose value by losing the top engineers. It's a tough hand for a company struggling for money really, but they've chosen the latter by saying  ""If you're looking for money, go elsewhere"".  This goes in the face of the old saying that ""Your most valuable asset are your employees"". I hope they know what they're doing.

- The HR/culture department has grown really large over the years. I find myself questioning what could possibly all these people be doing? It's very difficult to see the value they might create, even more so now that most of the hiring has stopped. There's 10 people in T&O in Palma.

- No career progression plan. Internal roles not very well defined. No CTO. No tech cohesion, no cross-pillar consultants. Isolated teams. The leadership model (TL/KL/RL) needs an overhaul."

Amsterdam team is one example where people don't bring much value to the company but they get not paid better than others, stocks, etc.  The company is full of politics and many people are staying in their comfort zone and they don't accept criticism due to the company culture. The senior employee are usually underpaid. Also, the managers say always, if you are here for money then it is not your place. Why the people are in the company?. To have fun or to learn ethics?. Of course they wanna get well paid come on. Some people are in the company for the wrong reasons. The company now tries to hire cheap labor to prevent people to ask for more salary raise.

You'll need to back up every argument with all the data required, unless you're high management. Then you can make decisions and change the whole company's strategy without being transparent about it (for example, the Bochum football club deal, the changes in marketing strategy every few months, etc). 

Salaries are well under the german average salary for a given position and a given experience. This leads to a crazy employee turnover. A lot of international people join, then realise how little they're getting paid and get a job elsewhere. This is blatantly denied by management, who normally shield themselves saying ""Yeah, but those benefits thoe"". As if the benefits were unique to trivago...

The way of getting feedback is through anonymous 360 reviews from your peers. Since this affects your salary, your contract renewal and your life, normally people overrate each other- understandably- which basically completely devaluates the system.

As most of the reviews had been written by people which left the company there is  for sure a more negative input then from the ones which are totally happy here.
This is why i want to share the mindset of somebody who is still here

First topic - targets:
When i applied here i knew there will be targets. And yes. Targets can be ambitious but not impossible. We got so many proofs - every month - every day - where people show an amazing performance and hit their targets with ease.
It´s a sales job and if somebody applies and thinks there won´t be target it´s not the wrong company or department. It´s the wrong job. If the target would be as impossible as the comments say i question myself why  so many  individuals and teams hit their targets. And why (best) performers do an overperformance of 300%.

Which leads me to the next point. Measurement.
A lot of the negative comments here is that people are getting measured every day. And once again. Those guys applied for a sales job.
And also i personally don´t think it´s bad to have a totally rational point of measurement. And i would prefer to have a feedback-talk based on the numbers that had been delivered instead of a subjective thinking about my work.

career:
Neither in my personal life or in my friends life i saw such a fast career opportunity as we have it here. If you are really willing to do and you bring at least the basic requirements there is nothing which stops you from becoming a Teamlead or move internally to new positions. Or just to stay in the sales position where you are at the moment. We have many people which just like to do what they applied 3 years ago to - earn bonuses and got a ""easy"" life as through their experience they can hit easily the ""insane"" targets. 

work-life-balance:
Yep. 
You do the interview and you know what are the expectations here. Nothing crazy. But it´s also not a part time job. We could discuss about if the job description is 100% the daily life. But please(!) show me any other company who doesn´t promote themselves online? Latest after the personal interview people know the status quo and you either sign or not. 

and

People here have the maximum of freedom a sales company gives. You are not getting fired because your train run late or the bus didn´t arrive and you had not been punctual because of this. 
But maybe because it happened 5 times. in a week. repetitive. And you are below target. And you leave still very early. And you had feedback talks. 

Mostly every vacation-request gets approved as long as not the whole team decides to be off at the same time. And because we have so many international people here the ways usually don´t cross. 
If something really urgent happens you can leave you place anytime and run home or wherever you help is needed. Nobody will block you for this.

Laptops are getting used many times to do some private stuff (before/after work - luchtime). A nice benefits for people not bringing a computer with to germany or having trouble with the internet at home. 
Or need to use the printer.
Did the ""negative""-comments below ever thinks about that other company kick out their stuff if they use the work-computer for private stuff?

Management:
We scaled rapidly. And this for sure made a big challenge for everybody in a managing position. We needed to built structures and processes which for sure had not been liked from everybody. But this is business-life and somebody who expects something else is not only in the wrong job-area. He is in the wrong life.
And it doesn´t matter WHAT happened. The Management and even the so often bad written MD is ALWAYS approachable. And if you have valid and rational arguments you will have a very open and good talk about your idea or your feedback.

+

The Management has the balls to take decisions back if they had been wrong.
We are trying new ideas, new structures, new business developments. And if it works - fine.
If not - it´s getting changed.
This is why we grow so good and strong while other company stuck.
Other companies do have a almost retired Manager who is ""never wrong"" and will even never admit it. And decisions won´t be taken back.
But please.
Stay rational. 
We never added a process here which lowered the value of the process before. And if - there was a long term thinking behind. 

i could move on like written above.
But i can just tell you. If you are a sales guy or want to be a good sales guy and you bring with a strong and good attitude and the will to perform you will have a great life here, a good career and a good salary! (And trust me. It´s much easier to get a flat if you can show the landlord you earn about 5-7k€ a month).

So many people which left a bad comment here and began their ""dreamjob"" in another sales company i saw changing their job on LinkedIn after 4-5month already because they didn´t passed probation time there. 

I would never lie or pretend it´s not a sales company here with a lot of sales-company-rules.
But for a sales company it´s one of the best you can work for. And if you are entry-level it´s the best you can work for!","Everything i wrote above you could turn around.

People who became quickly a Team leader had maybe not the experience like a 60years old Teamlead. 
But they are willing to learn and do develop. 
And the Team leader as the sales representatives always have the option to approach HR and ask for advice. 

Yes.
You are working for targets and bonuses.
This could lead to the fact that people set themselves under pressure.

Yeah.
Measurement is there. Your performance is based on numbers. Welcome to sales."

The social culture is unbeatable. The new campus is incredible. The barista bar and Culture Kitchen offer quality bites and coffee. 

For anyone looking to enter the EU, Germany, change careers, or start your first job, trivago is a great place to land. They have a philosophy of encouraging people to try new things, even new roles and new career paths. Their value to fanatic learning is lived every day all over the company.

They have great quarterly parties and monthly team events, plus regular Friday activities after work. All of this is intended to help colleagues get to know each other better and build trust.","trivago is not the place where you can grow in one career path for more than 2-3 years. You can change to a new path, stay stagnant in your current work, or leave. 

If you are trying to find yourself, then trivago is a good place to do that. If you know what you want, and you want to grow professionally, then your opportunity to do so at trivago will be quite limited. There is a very junior and inexperienced mentality across most people in the company, regardless of their tenure or title. 

The focus on parties and socialising is captivating at first and it certainly does photograph well, but these activities are leveraged as a way to retain young talent with poor compensation.

Once you come to a point in your career and life when you need more financial securities, career growth support, or are ready to engage in the globally-adopted best practices of your field, then it will be time to move on from trivago."

249,trivago,Hotel Relations - Terrible,2018-11-30,1.0,Outside Sales Representative,"Free snacks and drinks
Free beer in the evening","Don't work for Trivago Hotel Relations - it's a sister company, but separated from trivago core and in a different building across town. This is a high pressure sales job like no other, that involves harassing owners of small hotels/B&Bs into purchasing a product that offers them no benefit, and then ignoring them when they call back to complain afterwards.

The main problem here is that the management team are completely incompetent, and change strategy every few days. There are numerous time wasting meetings per week in which the leader of Hotel Relations seeks to intimidate, embarrass and show his authority. The team and department leaders are chosen based on those who can sell the most, rather than those with actual people management skills. They set unrealistic targets, with punishments such as losing your chair for the day if you don't reach your KPI. 

The turnover rate in the company is the worst I have ever seen, as is the pressure. It's not worth working here, and they bring in people from all over the world, only to fire them after 5 months. Almost nobody gets a contract extension. Be warned, moving to Duesseldorf to work here isn't wise, unless you don't care about working 10 hours a day on average to meet unrealistic targets.

If a German company doesn't have a Betriebsrat, you should be wary. When there is no protection for the employee, and no evidence of the hours that you have worked, the company can exploit the employees, and this is a company that certainly takes advantage of that."

You cannot talk about money. The word ""salary"" is a big taboo. There's a range of ruthless middle managers paid to keep down the salary level using the most idiotic arguments: ""Because men tend to negociate better their salaries compared to women, we close the door for this topic"", ""It's an algorithm that decides how much you get based on rational factors""!!!

Don't be surprised to discover that your salary or the one of the colleagues is decided based on where you come from. Simply insane as they would always push for the minimum stated by the German law. Diversity? Yes they love it especially as it comes at a cheap cost.

As a matter of fact, the turn over is really high. The company is not stable. It's definitely true that the working style is pretty flexible for some departements but not for everybody depending on their responsibilities. In any case, this flexibility comes at a price: a very intrusive company sending surveys every week literally to the employees to ""measure their happiness""  but also to control them more.

The company is very international and therefore gives you the opportunity to exchange perspectives with many different people.
The company openly promotes to change job position within the company to broaden your horizons and develop your personal skill set.",Change is a constant in trivago.

For me the best part of the company is not any of this. It is the people, the personal growth and responsibility you are given. In a previous job I wanted to make a change to an annual process and was told 'maybe next year'. The next year I was working in trivago, where change happens as quickly as you can make it happen. The responsibility I have been given from day one challenges me daily and encourages me to grow, learn new techniques and work with the newest technologies. I've moved from a basic understanding of enterprise software to working with latest big data technologies, learnt more than 1 scripting and query language. I really appreciate the way I have been able to develop myself here. The fridges, events and company trips are also a nice bonus!","You only get out what you put in. If you are not motivated to succeed, make a change or take on responsibility, then this is probably not the company for you. I wouldn't recommend the company for someone who wants to take advantage of a generous leave policy but is not willing to also do the 'work hard' of the 'work hard, play hard' mantra.

* The company isn't profitable: all revenue is funneled back into expensive advertising to fuel artificial growth 
* The middle-man business model isn't sustainable in the long run
* There are too many people w/ too much time in HR as they are constantly scheming up new strange org structure techniques: pillars, functions, etc
* When you call the PEOPLE that work at Trivago ""Talents"", the don't like it. We are people, not your resources
* Onboarding is 1 week of indoctrination of whatever org structure they are experimenting w/ that month: no hierarchy, flat structure, no managers.
* They subside low wages by constantly throwing ""perks"" at 28 year old employees (average age)  so they won't leave. 
* Historically turnover rate is very high at Trivago as interns and young professional soon realize there are greener pastures

- Team leads and heads of department in engineering were largely incompetent (in my experience) and whatever the workplace equivalent of social climbing is. 
- little to no teamwork--more of a ""tear other people down so they can't look better than me"" attitude among more than 50% of the people I encountered. 
- The tech stack is really, really old. code ported over to new versions and frameworks seemingly without any real review or rewrite (maybe ever) or actual thought to a logical systems architecture. In 6 months I don't think I ever heard anyone mention the concept of having a system architecture. 
- you will be a code monkey. 99% of the time you will not have any input into what you are building or why or maybe never even know what ends up happening to it. It is boring.
- I cannot really say I learned anything of substance or grew as an engineer there except what to look for as early red flags when interviewing with companies in the future. 
- The ""core values"" they workshop you to death on are not actually embodied in how people conduct themselves or what behavior is tolerated.
- Lots of bureaucracy, it is a ""startup culture"" only in the sense that they have a nintendo Wii and snacks, which are actually the least important parts of that whole culture. 
- as a collective group (of course there are always a few exceptions) there were very few people I would describe as talented or hard-working.
- all that considered there really isn't enough money in the world to make it worth it, especially if you are considering moving to Germany for it -- but if you are wondering the pay is not very competitive. I moved there because I wanted to work there and be in Germany and I bought their culture advertising which was false in all the ways that actually matter.

The flexible work hours are great as well.,"Some of the promises were not kept: e.g. salary and staying in one of their trivago flats. Some things when I was there however bothered me. It would not bother me if this was a different company but this is how they advertise themselves. They preach that there are no job titles within the company and that the organizational structure is very flat. However, I noticed almost daily that this isn't adhered by the people in the company. Blessing from higher ups definitely matter a lot of  how certain parts of people's work are treated and how resources for projects are allocated."

-The salaries are very low and you are not allowed to negotiate pay raises 

-The website itself is horrible. You have to constantly lie to your family and friends that trivago lists the cheapest accommodation prices, but deep down you know it's not true. And that will haunt you until the day you die

Never wise:
-Favoritism is rampant. Very often employees with seniority, who are not necessarily more qualified, are promoted above newer employees who work harder and are more deserving.

-The lack of any sort of official employee guidelines allow for getting black-out drunk in the office, hooking up with your co-workers and showing up to work completely hungover without any consequences. 

Never done:
-Projects are often put on hold, delayed or flat out not completed because of the lack of communication between departments and the constant back-and-forth among an unnecessary amount of Project Leads and stakeholders

We are friend with each other and we like to help others to improve rather than think just about our results. Trust is the main value of the company and people here really care about it. The management is very attentive to its employees and does its best to make them grow professionally and personally inside the company, giving them freedom and responsibilities from day one and listening for real to their suggestions and points of view.","Since the management and the employees are pretty young (mostly under 30), sometimes they (we) end up partying too hard. I don't love the fact that every party is an excuse to get drunk. This makes the atmosphere too much ""erasmus"" alike, sometimes."

500,trivago,"Nice from outside, superficial from inside. No appreciation.",2015-02-06,2.0,SEO Employee,"-nice colleagues who easily become friends (most of them..)
-working atmosphere: fresh fruit, free beer after 16h, snack service, kicker tables etc... (things that make life nicer but which you do not really need to work). nice offices.
-parties are ok
-trivago trip (a surprise journey which is yearly organized for the full-time people)
- and that is it.","-SALARY. (For interns, this company is ok, they pay them well). Full-timers: The salary is absolutely not fair when you have studied or made an apprenticeship. there is no room for any negotiation, it is just ""take it or leave it"". If it is your first job and you need experience you want to make bigger in your following career (""i worked in an international environment""...), then take it. If you look for sth serious and long term with a fair salary, then don't take it. If you have experience or not (e.g. studied what you also do at trivago), theres is no salary difference between knowing the things already or not knowing anything. which leads to my next point:

-LIMITED CONTRACTS AND PEOPLE-""RECYCLING"". At least in the department i worked in, there was a horrible ""recycling mentality"" when speaking about employees. if someone worked there for 2 years and the point came when legally a permanent contract should be offered (to keep a good worker and the knowledge, to benefit the company), people were just told ""sorry you have to go"", to hire someone new, unexperienced, just to keep the contract conditions and salaries low. I have ""celebrated"" more farewell parties there than birthdays!!! Being offered a 6month contract (full time!) is not unusual there. I have also seen prolongations of 1-3 months. They keep you until they got what they needed from you and then dump you. No appreciation.

-mostly VERY superficial team leaders who don't have much experience and have no idea how to lead a team, pretending to love you soooo much, and this is clearly visible. Just keep smiling.... Also TL's are just put into positions just how it comes. There is no clear structure in ""make a career to work yourself on to the next higher position"". 

-if you want to make career there, you a)are lucky and have a fair team leader (rare case) or b)have sex ;-) or c)you know high position people who can promote you.  Superficiality is a big big minus in this company. Sad!

-ORGANIZATION: In some cases, salaries are paid too low, too late etc. and you literally have to run after them. The same with bonuses, if there are any. You have worked for the money, so you deserve it. A ""Sorry, I pay you next month then"" is NOT an excuse. Oh, wait: you get free cereals and coffee for breakfast! Makes it all up, hum?  People have to live on something, pay rents etc! Also team structures: so many changes all the time, some people did not even know who their team leader is!

-Hierarchy: ""flat hierarchy"" is what is promised. In reality there are some people deciding, and the others are jumping and doing what they want, seeming oh so happy. I have heard more complaints there about how people are led, than a nice word. But hey if you get a beer in the meeting, why should you be unhappy? ;-) Let them eat cake....

Summary: good for interns, and first experience. Also good for people who have not studied long time before. Long-term I can't recommend the company."

• Relaxed, casual working environment in a modern office building providing excellent views 
• Perks like cereal, free beer, access to sports events for recreation, team events (a pro if you like team events)
• This is ideal if you want to gain one year of work experience after your studies in a casual atmosphere while partying a lot","• A sense that everyone is so young and new at the company that it feels like people are just passing through and employees are easily replaceable. Few experienced, long-term employees. 
• Little job security - most employees are on one year contracts and eager to prove themselves so that it can be extended if they wish to stay longer. 
• Limited opportunity for mentoring by experienced professionals in your field.
• Company values felt a little artificial/overblown"

- Nice perks; annual company trip, nice team events etc. 
- A really multicultural place to work in
- Employees are of roughly the same or similar age
- Gives a lot of opportunities to recent graduates","- Underpaid, especially in the case of interns a lot is expected but very little is given back in return
- Complicated decision-making system; literally everyone has an opinion and this hinders processes from moving forward
- Team leaders are not necessarily very well-qualified or experienced, a few of them actually should have never received decision-making positions
- Old employees are very safe and start acting capriciously
- Company promotes too much a culture similar to that of a frathouse, making it hard to take it seriously"

Lot of people complain about things such as communication, bosses or events, but no one gives any idea to improve that or say anything when they have the chance (surveys, feedback meetings). Values are too ideallistic for the company (e.g. trust is the main value, but people dont feel safe to express a bad opinion about their bosses). Low salaries for a very big workload."

- Tons of perks. Free breakfast. Free beer. Language classes on company time.

- I don't recall working more than 40h a week, ever.
- Lots of freedom to do my work in the way I desire (this may not apply to everyone)","- Some key senior people appear to have read the company values and decided to do the exact opposite. Some secret keeping and ""No. Because no"" type of explanations do apply. I'm not a major stakeholder in anything, so it's easy for me to don't care. This may not apply to everyone.
- There's a lot of peer pressure to attend at all the events that the company does. This might work well if you enjoy partying. This may not work well if you have other projects that require your time outside of your work.
- The whole multinational-super-awesome-workplace propaganda does get old after a while. It does get especially old when you stumble into the #1 item on this list, or get invited into a meeting that is in German."

513,trivago,Amazing experience. Non stop personal development,2014-03-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"trivago offers a huge list of pros. 

In terms of professional development: It is a company where they push a lot the entrepeneurial thinking and encourage you to develop a lot and create your own projects. Also there is at the same time an analytical approach and the need to proof actions, what make your learning more solid. 

 There is a lot of cross-funcional communication within the company and opportunities to learn a lot not only from your current position, but from other departments. There are regular internal workshops opened to everyone that get deeper into very various internal fields.

Very international enviroment with many, many different nationalities. No need to speak German is the very most of positions, English is the intermediate language.

Values play an important role and the company seeks a flat organisation, not hierarchical and promote the creation of experts, so that people can develop a lot horizontally and not only vertically.

Work-life balance is extremely good as well. There is flexibility on decide how much vacation you take, or your daily times. Also there is the possibility to work one month (with accomodation and flights paid) from trivago´s office in Mallorca.","I´d say, almost no cons. Maybe the fact that main office is in Düsseldorf, not that amazing city. Perhaps another tiny disadvantage is that the average age is very young, so the enviroment is sometimes maybe ""too college-like""."
