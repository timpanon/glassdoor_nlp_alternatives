One of the obvious benefits of working for a large company is that there are a lot of perks. For example, most large companies can offer a range of insurance options. This includes not only different options for medical insurance, but also supplemental insurance (like life insurance or even pet insurance). And, because the company is large, they are usually able to negotiate a better deal, which means there’s a good chance you’ll pay less out of pocket.","You’re Just a Number:
Of course, a large company is big. You knew that going in. But, what you may not have realized is that when you work for a large company, it can be hard to feel seen as a person. Or, hard to feel like you and your efforts make a difference at the company.

Work-life balance is almost non-existent. And the pressure is mostly for the mess managers create. 

Management is in a complete mess. For a startup as well-known as Udaan, they sure have dirty politics like the MNCs. Lot of favoritism. The company and the leaders leading the company have a tendency to favor brand over actual work. If you have ever worked in Flipkart, you can rest assured you will be in regardless of whether you know how to work or not. 

These guys even poach people from Flipkart. Offer them double or triple the current salary and get them in and all this because one of the founders is from Flipkart.

Lots of mismanagement by the guys supposed to be good at managing. Managers just want to shake the blame off their shoulders. 

Now coming to the real concern, right now there's a pandemic going on. Every Govt has requested companies to bring in employees ONLY if the nature of their work requires them to be in the office premises.

These guys are experts at finding loopholes in the laws. They are requiring even the people from containment zones to come. No social distancing is mainted in the meeting rooms. 

No regard for human lives. It's a money minting machine, they just want people to give up their lives to churn out money for meager amounts.

If you're thinking about coming here, please consider other options. Udaan is only shiny on the outside, but absolutely worthless on the inside."

I am telling truly from my heart in this company their is no growth for the ground level field working people. The top level management is very worst from IIT and IIM. They don't even have field work experience and knowledge of field work. In this company the managers are not having enough talent and capabilities to handle a team but they are called as manager for sales executives because they are from IIT, IIM and top level recommendations. I have not seen this type of unexeperinced managers in any top companies only here it will happen. First of all try to give respect to fos. Without fos you can't able to capture the market mindit. Please try to avoid partialities and give honour to hard working guys in the system. They are thinking the company getting growth because of managers that is not fact true is because of hard working fos.",The managers are behave like a mad with fos and give very high pressure according to partiality. They will never give offs to fos in a month. For every leave you need to pay loss of pay. And last but not least final thing I will not take leave and they will also not approve leave so even in which kind of situation I will go for work but my good heart manager will put me 2 days as a loss of pay for every month. If I tried to ask why you put loss pay for me i haven't taken even a single leave in a month then why means he will simply smile and say we will see next month. Next month also same will happen then why I need to work for this company.
