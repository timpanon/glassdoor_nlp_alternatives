3,AQR Capital Management,Was good but in 2019,2022-04-08,2.0,Associate,"Was really nice place in early days. 
Good food and health insurance. 
Flat hierarchy","India team is more support and less development. 
India team mostly says ""yes-yes"" to what US team says. 
We mostly build in-house applications where it will be used by ""limited""( less than 50) people and hence NO LARGE SCALE SYSTEM learnings. 
They started with IIT only and few top companies people initially but now they are not getting these people and so people from all companies( service based ) are also joining. Decreasing the level of knowledge among co-workers. Internal switch is seen as negative thing.

Join AQR if - 
1- Want to be in finance domain
2- Looking for a normal hike

1- looking for good learning experience

- Upgrading of tech stacks eg, moving to cloud , rearchitecting legacy stuff etc
- Continues to invest in academia and building learning culture
- Trust and Transparency in employees at every level
- Exceptional level of support extended during pandemic 
- As a company we are back on growth trajectory having learned from our own share of success and failures in past years

Talking about Bangalore office , lots of good work happening since past few years and more interesting and challenging work is lined up in coming days as we are in redefining phase of Engineering tech phase. We have a vibrant office located in ORR and what makes it awesome is awesome people (especially fresh hires) joining team .","Few cons one can think of 
- Late meeting few days as things need to overlap from other geography

Campus hires from top schools in India. Start up vibe.,"Most of the talented technical people in India office left. Too much of churn. The existing technical managers have no clue what to do. 

HR department is most employee unfriendly. Instead of assisting employees, they make it harder for people to work productively by not giving them hardware etc. Even during the pandemic time! They dump work on juniors, pick fights with other departments and even verbally abuse the junior staff and contractors. They created a toxic culture in the small office."
31,AQR Capital Management,Company Review,2021-06-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"AQR is a great place to work and I have a wonderful experience working here. I can list down few pros and cons of working at AQR.
Pros:
- Proper work life balance. 
- Good employee benefits are provided like medical insurance coverage, seperate Covid-19 insurance coverage, telemedicine, counselling services like Employee Assistance Programme
- Excellent online and classroom trainings are provided for technical and personal development.
- Good quality candidates are hired from top rated academic institutions like IITs.
- Technically sound hands on managers and leaders","Cons:
As AQR is located in the heart of the city, traffic jam can be bad during peak hours (pre -pandemic)."
32,AQR Capital Management,Open company culture. Niche Business,2021-06-12,5.0,Vice President,"- Being a small company, everyone is approachable. You can even call the CTO of the company or request a meeting with the Principal
- They are currently in the mode of improving Tech stack. This is the best time to join the AQR Tech team.
- If you want to take the plunge in the world of Quant finance, AQR is a good place to be in.",- there has been some attrition in the last year. Management should try to retain good people as the cost of training new employees is astronomically high.
33,AQR Capital Management,Nice place,2021-05-31,5.0,Associate,nice place to work every day,limited upside because management care about PC stuff
34,AQR Capital Management,Decent people,2021-05-27,3.0,Vice President,"Great intellect, nice people and treated well",None to share at this time

Just off the Greenwich train station.",Salary. Upper management doesn’t always help out young employees.  Need better work life balance. People are working hard and deserve to be rewarded.
37,AQR Capital Management,Not a good place for developers,2021-05-12,2.0,Software Engineer,"I enjoyed the open and collaborative culture, especially now that I work somewhere that is much more “everyone for himself.” I got the impression that the people in charge truly cared about the average employee’s quality of life.  There were interesting talks and learning series, and free breakfast, the quality of which declined over time. The work-life balance was great, but that, and everything else, started to go downhill once performance declined.","Compensation doesn’t even come close to market. Ancient codebase riddled with technical debt. The firm is clearly trying to outsource as much tech talent as possible. Senior leadership lacks an understanding of the importance of technology. There are some long-tenured, powerful people on the research/portfolio management side who do their best to stifle all change that threatens their turf. This, more than anything else, is what makes AQR a bad choice for developers."
38,AQR Capital Management,Good company,2021-05-07,3.0,SSE- Development,Decent salary and meal at office,Higher workload and difficult timings
39,AQR Capital Management,Good company but need innovation,2021-04-30,3.0,Software Engineer,"Good benefits, free breakfast and lunch, good insurance","Poor talent retainment, below average pay"
40,AQR Capital Management,"Avoid, Avoid, Avoid",2021-04-27,1.0,Software Developer,"Good medical benefits. Meals provided. They give you a coffee mug and a fleece.

Hey, at least you won't be there long.","Politics are rampant. Communication between layers of management (vertically or horizontally) is non-existent, by apparent design.

Hiring into new roles will always happen before internal promotion. Career advancement is minimal. Man it is damn gloomy.

Firm keeps surprising itself and suddenly finding the need for massive cost-cutting.

Not one person takes the CEO seriously."

- Less competitive than some firms
- Good name on resume (might change soon though)
- Some interesting Quanta lectures","- ""Fake quantitative firm!"" Has a bunch of Econ/Finance people running a ""quant firm"" instead of having more quantitative people, and they often don't know what they are doing.
- Commute wastes so much time for employees. We get that you want to pay less taxes but at the expense of making a large proportion of your employees commute and waste time.
- Nepotistic hiring and marketing specifically to the alma maters of the Principals
- Terrible tech (clusters often break with just 1 TB of data). The response is to blame the researchers for this rather than increase the capacity of the cluster or switch to AWS
- Tech hiring standards are lower than that of FAANG (rarely true at a top tier hedge fund)
- A lot of kissing up to upper management including incompetent upper management, which is quite common. People will stay until their manager leaves ""to save face,"" and that deincentivizes working hard and efficiently. 
- Compensation is far worse than that of traditional competitors
- Stubborn about their traditional ways and refuses to innovate
- AUM has dropped over 30% since I worked there
- Poor data (wastes serious time)"
68,AQR Capital Management,Great place to work,2020-08-20,5.0,Associate,"The most intelligent and friendliest people I've ever worked with. Competitive pay, great benefits, office itself was nice (in the before times). Actually feel cared for.",The commute from NYC sucks.

70,AQR Capital Management,Lean back and observe the free fall,2020-04-21,1.0,Portfolio Management,"Where should I start:
- You will have a chance to master Python and Data Cleansing, under the pretense of portfolio management and research
- If you work in HR you will master the art of leaving fake reviews online on how 'great' this place is (sadly, this has been happening the past few months)
- You will enjoy super low-quality breakfasts, and a $10-capped lunch per day so you will appreciate eating 'healthy' elsewhere
- The brand name brings some heft to your resume, although perhaps not for too long given that people are starting to see the real colors shine through
- If you are desperate for sponsorship (H1B or Greencard) they will do that for you, at the expense of offering you a salary way below the market average","This firm would make a great subject for a white paper on how to:
- Run your business to ground by wasting time on 'Tweeter' picking fight with investors, vendors, etc
- Ignore (encouraging?!) juvenile highschool-level politics across your firm and successfully kill the moral of low and mid-level employees, creating a revolving door
- Not pay attention to the basics of organizational structure, shuffle employees around with no clear logic, and add or eliminate positions for absolutely no reason
- Boil the ocean and reinvent the wheel hence waste money because you know it all, and know it better than anyone else 
- Promote people only if you personally like them, or they come from certain schools, or they openly praise you and the 'outstanding' job you are doing

I would not bother leaving a review but I could no longer ignore how the non-sophisticated investors AND junior job seekers are being mislead to belileve AQR is a great successful money manager. This is all propaganda: AQR is a sinking ship."

- Culture has suffered heavily in recent years

Extremely talented, intelligent, and ambitious younger colleagues--AQR tends to hire the cream of the crop from undergraduate / masters degrees. People are chill and usually very friendly. You will learn a lot if this is your first job in Finance.","AQR is a glorified Fidelity that hires over qualified ""researchers"" to perform mindless tasks. Although it depends on the team, most researchers are given very little incentive to actually make the funds better--this is in large part due to the massive egos of many of the researchers. Serious research is immediately dismissed as ""data-mined."" The only valid research is published research, which by the time of publication, is already arbitraged by faster firms. 

The day to day instead involves data checking, approvals, etc. It's extremely disappointing. Don't take the job description seriously. This pivot has been driven by greedy principals who quickly learned that they could rent seek off of a brand name."

- Everyone has heard of AQR and they're considered to be one of the best in their respective industry.
- Extremely smart people and high standards which definitely helped me grow a ton as a Software Engineer.","- The location sucks. It's close to the Greenwich train stop at least. I can't help but think they'd be able to get more young talent if they had an office in New York. Before joining I justified the hour+ commute to Greenwich in my head but it wore on me over the course of the year that I was there.
- As a software engineer, you're going to end up spending a lot of time dealing with production issues as opposed to building out robust solutions to problems. Engineers with Phd's end up having to debug problems that at other firms would be done by production engineers.
- DevOps/infrastructure-wise, the firm has poured a lot of resources into improving in this area but the results aren't immediate due to the amount of legacy code and processes. 
- The interview process is conducted by VPs from a variety of teams. The result is that you don't get a great idea of what the people are like on your future team if you accept an offer. I didn't do my due diligence in this area post job offer and 
I ended up on a team that I never really vibed with unfortunately.
- The work culture: now this probably is team dependent but I never really felt like I was encouraged to ask questions about things that weren't clear to me; I didn't have a lot of exposure to finance before joining so a lot of concepts were foreign to me, so it was overwhelming to have to figure out everything on my own in addition to learning a bunch of new tools that I hadn't used before."

1. The culture at AQR is unlike anywhere else in that people are brilliantly smart across the board. Street-smart, book-smart, you name it. That said they don't show off about it or try to one up eachother. The goal is to get work done the best way possible and work as a team to get there. People who don’t fit this mold (jerks / slackers) actually leave pretty quickly.

2. The company is open to finding the right spot for you. I've been on the Portfolio Management and Business Development teams and had similarly excellent experiences in both. The company was very open to the move.

3. More than anywhere that I know, the company reinforces education. There are programs designed to constantly teach employees new concepts / ways of thinking. Speakers are both internal and external. Moreover, employees share this mindset and I've often been pulled into a room with a whiteboard to walk through ideas, well above and beyond what was the minimum requirement. It feels like the mindset is that if everyone is constantly learning and sharing, we'll all be better off.

4. This sounds cliché (similar to the culture point… I swear it’s true), but they really encourage entrepreneurial drive. Like any company, you can’t run with whatever comes to mind, but if you’ve proven yourself, have an interesting way of running a process or even have a major project that you need resources for, they will hear you out. If they like it they will absolutely support you on it.","1. The commute for people living in NYC is tough. Luckily the offices are in the parking lot of the train station and if you like reading, you've been gifted 1.5hrs of quiet reading time every day.

2. The most senior people are not at an age where they will likely retire any time soon, so upward mobility is likely dependent on continued growth."

Used to be a legitimate hedge fund; post financial crisis, it transitioned to an innovative asset manager with a diversified business. Now it is  nothing more than a glorified asset accumulator ridden with office politics and middle management (Pro if you're middle management)

Since not really a hedge fund anymore - really good work/life balance - you can go on long vacations, take days off, etc.","Politics, politics, politics - if you're high level, then you'll have to play. If you're low level, then you'll be collateral damage - you do the work, while older out of touch managers fight for credit over emails.

After years of relatively flat corporate structure, the firm is scrambling to build arbitrary titles/hierarchy to ""compensate"" employees. Newly minted titles include ""Managing Director"" and we will probably see ""Senior VP"" soon.

Compensation - low monetary compensation. Speak with most recruiters - they pay below street. Benefits of food and car seem nice, but actually well worse than many other legitimate hedge funds and front office teams at banks.  Word has been that higher paid personnel lured to the firm with street/above street level pay get their compensation cut after the first year.

A lot of egos - this is interesting, as the phenomenon exists BOTH within research groups as well as across groups (between different research groups, or between research and ops, or research and portfolio management, etc.) -  hard to understand why this occurs when no one is tied to PnL.

Ultimately, most employees are a commoditized cog in a huge asset accumulating/business development focused machine."

118,AQR Capital Management,An academic environment where you'll learn nothing,2016-12-21,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"AQR is a profitable company with many profit streams
Generally, there's very low involuntary turnover--it's pretty hard to get fired although this is very team specific, as is the case with any company
AQR has improved substantially since a few years ago (didn't even have a 401k program 5 years ago)","The lies start from day 1: job descriptions and work are sold as interesting and engaging but the truth is that every (front office) job function is effectively operations: researchers check reports, tech keeps the lights on and ""portfolio managers"" manage trade execution. Many reviews on this site have been added by current employees who were asked to write raving reviews of the firm. Evidence of this is clear in the clusters of good and bad reviews sorted by time. 

Being an ""academic"" environment, AQR is devoid of any and all forms of feedback, especially upwards feedback. Employees were unable to provide upwards feedback until this year in which the upwards feedback was two 1-5 selections and a brief comment section; that's a full 18 years of no upwards feedback. This is very much like being a research assistant in which your professor is always correct and you should listen to them no matter what. One result of this is that a large portion of your teammates and an even larger portion of people who have been with the firm longer than 2 years are sycophants.

It's impossible to get anything done. If you're trying to implement some new ideas or technology, you'll be heavily hamstrung by the Windows first environment and the incredibly poor in-house tooling. Organizational changes are similarly impossible due to the highly political environment. AQR has somehow managed to introduce large company politics into a relatively smaller firm."

120,AQR Capital Management,Good Job with Great Friendships,2016-12-17,4.0,Research Analyst,"-I met some of the smartest and kindest people in my life at this firm. In fact, I am still friends with many of them despite my short 2 year stay at the firm. Making many good friends at a job seems very rare amongst my friends in the finance industry. The environment naturally stimulates bonding and comradery amongst the talented employees unlike any place I have heard of. I really appreciate the friendships and connections I have made at AQR.

-AQR, unlike other quant firms, has a very strong marketing presence. Everyone in the industry knows about AQR as well as the academic research that AQR does, creating for it an unmatched reputation amongst industry peers. The trust the industry has in AQR creates an extremely stable career and salary growth path that is hard to find at other firms in the industry.

-I must applaud Cliff and the management team's vision in leading a diversification towards mutual fund and other lower fee institutional product categories that has alleviated the firm's traditional reliance on hedge fund products pre-financial crisis (and hence my positive review of the CEO below). This diversification has increasingly led to firm stability, job security and better work hours over time. This was definitely a key decision that will generate a lot of value for the firm on the long run.

-The work hours are great. As long as work is done, the 9 - 7 is loosely enforced. Reliable co-workers also help each other out in all aspects of the job, adding in some leeway. People seem very willing to help each other out and are very accommodating of personal circumstances. All of my peers with kids seem extremely happy with the flexibility and stability of our business structure relative to other more volatile finance jobs.

-As I have already previously alluded to, the business outlook is fantastic. Assets are growing at a very fast pace, and clients are very willing to stick with AQR through rough bumps in the road (as a testament to AQR's fantastic reputation). All signs point to the fact that AQR will successfully grow from a large firm to an even larger firm even though there are many difficulties. Not only would I give this firm a 6 month positive business outlook, I would probably give it a 3 year positive business outlook if I can. It's successful business model and business results speak for itself.","Greenwich, although only 1 hour from New York, still kind of feels far. With long 9-8 work hours, the 1 hour at the start and end of your day start to wear on you a bit. This forces you to pick living nearby in Connecticut or taking the tiring commute. For young people, it is more fun to be able to live in the city, though I have heard that a lot of people with families enjoy the quiet and safe Connecticut suburbs."

Thats a tough balance to find, and i would recommend working here. The management is very approachable, and tends to help you in the direction you want to go, versus hearing you out with no actions, or just shutting you down. They are also excited to hear new and cutting edge solutions and often support you in your research by sending you on conferences/training.
The benefits are absolutely top notch here when it comes to you and your family.","Like any firm, they have legacy systems that need some work on, but to their credit, they are actively looking at this, and improving these systems."
141,AQR Capital Management,Great Career Opportunities and Working Environment,2015-04-13,5.0,Senior Developer,"The IT Department is growing rapidly and bringing on many great people. This creates many opportunities for existing and new employees to advance in their career.
The impact these new hires are making is starting to be noticed across the board in the quality of of infrastructure, applications and user support. Working here feels like being part of great team.
Management is open to change and very supportive with requests for additional hardware, software and tools. Every single request of mine for tools or software and additional human resources has been approved so far. Nobody is holding me back.
We work in very modern offices with free parking and the commute to NYC, Westchester and North Jersey is comfortable and relatively fast.",A big challenge is upgrading the aging software and application infrastructure. AQR started out as a small hedge fund and is now of the largest Asset Managers. It can be very challenging and also rewarding to be part of an effort to upgrade the infrastructure to scale in every respect to the growing demands of the business.

146,AQR Capital Management,"Great work environment, with some growing pains",2014-10-10,4.0,Associate,"The people here are great - the office is very academic and collaborative and people are always willing to discuss anything with you. Also, you never get the feeling that the person above you doesn't deserve to be there - this is definitely the smartest group of people I've ever worked with. The company is growing rapidly (more than 2x employees, 3x AUM since I joined ~3 years ago), which creates interesting positions and opportunities - I was recently able to switch within front office to a more desirable (for me) role, which would not have necessarily been possible a few years ago. Fantastic benefits as well. Hours aren't too bad - I almost never have to work weekends, and stay late when I feel I need to in order to finish projects, not because of arbitrary deadlines.","With rapid growth comes growing pains - management has gotten larger and there are more layers of people providing input into decisions, which can slow down the research process. Also as AUM has grown so rapidly, the problems facing the firm (and that are highest priority) have changed significantly, so there is not as much of a focus on new ""alpha"" research as maybe 5, 10 years ago, though there is still a lot of this. Many of our current problems are interesting but of a slightly different flavor."
147,AQR Capital Management,Run away!,2014-10-09,1.0,Gss Quantitative Analyst/Developer II,"Free lunch, dinner and breakfast. The location of AQR's office is also convenient if you are commuting from the city.","Terrible culture, insecure managers(because most of the managers got their by accident, and not by meritocracy), horrible pay.

148,AQR Capital Management,Highly political,2014-10-09,1.0,Gaa Portfolio Management Associate,"AQR offers great benefits -- medical, dental, vision, 401(k), free breakfast and lunch.","It is a highly political place which has done very well for the partners, but doesn't offer a lot to the junior employees. The promotion to MD and up is based on who gets along well with the founding partners. AQR favors PhDs over non-PhDs irrespective of the meritocracy and overall contribution. PhDs from Chicago and Harvard runs PhD-mafia with two groups jostling for influence. Some of the recent partner promotion were befuddling. This is probably the only place where someone with a consistent loss making strategies can be made a partner. Anyone who has worked in GSS in last few years knows whom I am referring to -- yes the great Prof from Chicago. 

Infrastructure is terrible -- partners do not want to spend money on technology -- which is evident in the quality of hires in IT and infrastructure. 

The place does a great job in hiring smart people, but there is no emphasis on training.

The compensation is terrible. It is probably in the lower 20 percentile.

Turnover is high among junior employees. As far as I know, AQR has not lost a single partner."

- No silos: quite uniquely for a large hedge fund, senior researchers are very open about their research and results. They are always available to explain intricacies related to their strategies. Research presentations and signal code are accessible to everyone in the team
- Access to senior principals: they are very closely involved in decisions and are accessible to even junior employees 
- Highly collaborative culture: teaching others about your research and responsibilities and having back-ups is always encouraged. The firm dislikes opaque projects that are driven by one single person 
- Firm's roots in academia means intellectual curiosity and honesty are highly prized. Senior leadership has an academic background and they have retained their inclination to pass on knowledge

152,AQR Capital Management,Incredible place to work with plenty of opportunities for growth and development,2014-09-16,5.0,Analyst,"When considering other firms AQR stood out because of its people. Everyone at AQR is incredibly smart, focused and hard-working but more than that they are incredibly warm, welcoming and nurturing. That is really the culture at AQR - you are surrounded by brilliant people who are just as nice as they are smart. Starting day one, you have exposure to senior management and are given responsibilities beyond your title...you are pushed each and every day to learn more and are able to learn from industry thought leaders and some of the best ""professors"" in the world finance. Senior management also looks to provide opportunities for younger employees to move up and take on more responsibilities. The work/life balance is great as well especially when compared to similar roles in the industry...we are given subsidies for meals every day, have 20+ vacation days per year (depending on your title) and have very nice medical/dental/vision packages - also 401(k) matching is a plus as well. Overall AQR is an incredible place to work with plenty of opportunities for growth and development for your career.","No real cons outside of the commute from NYC - about 50 minutes door to door. One thing to note as well is that there is an expectation for employees to contribute starting day one...so the learning curve is quite steep early on but there are plenty of resources and training programs available to help new hires get up to speed and the people are incredibly nice, supportive and willing to spend time with you."
153,AQR Capital Management,Easily one of the most political and hierarchical quant firms out there.,2014-09-11,1.0,Analyst,"Solid benefits. Health, dental, and vision.

Prime location. AQR is located literally right next to the train station, which often makes for a less taxing commute. 

Free meals. Breakfast (hard boiled eggs, cereal, cheese), lunch, and dinner.

Stable business. Let's face it, AQR is not going anywhere anytime soon. That doesn't necessarily mean you have job security, but just that the firm itself will never blow out completely because of its diverse investments. AQR is becoming the next Vanguard.","Too academically narrow-minded. AQR favors PHd candidates as opposed to industry professionals. Many see this as a big benefit. I don't, frankly, because finance professors are only concerned with using non-PHd employees as code monkeys for their research. It's like working in a grad student lab, except there is no tenure track to look forward to.

Lack of innovation. When Cliff goes and publishes a paper on ""Top 10 Myths about Momentum Investing"", you know that he's running out of ideas. Similarly, AQR is laser-focused on investing in new asset classes: strategies are (I kid you not) being ported over from one asset class to another, because, well, ""Value and Momentum Everywhere""! 

Extremely political. Take a quick look at the partners. The vast majority of them are either young hotshot PhD's that Cliff gets along well with, or have stayed with the firm ever since the beginning. There are maybe 1 or 2 exceptions. This means it is nearly impossible to climb past the position of a VP (which, by the way, is a standardized role).

Variable mentorship quality. AQR is a top-heavy firm (more VPs than Analysts or Associates). This means the mentorship can range from extremely poor to average. Each person looks out for himself, and only himself. There is very little desire to help you progress, because that will only mean more competition.

Long hours. Employees average 60+ hours/week. They are lured to stay with free dinner, but this creates a herd mentality where employees leave later and later. AQR is very much becoming like a bank, and face time is a necessity (despite how much they tell you it isn't).

Poor compensation. Relative to the other quant funds, AQR pays extraordinarily less (we're talking >50% pay cut in 5 years). AMG, in 2004, staked AQR while they were in need of additional funds. This position still remains today (you can find AQR on AMG's website), so they claim a gargantuan share of AQR's revenues. Furthermore, AQR is increasing AUM and number of employees at the same rate. This by itself would be no problem, except that AQR is moving towards becoming solely a mutual fund, which means the management fee is decreasing over time. Thus, revenues per employee decreases. It is also no secret that the founding partners claim the lion's share of profits. Finally, AQR is one of the few top-heavy firms, so more than 50% employees are in managerial positions (VP and above). How can compensation be competitive with all of these looming factors?  

HR manipulates reviews."

The people are arrogant and rotund (due to aforementioned free food). Managers are a give and take. Some are great, some are not. One will say one thing and one will say another. Overtime is the minimum, taking vacation time that's allotted to you is out of the question. Positions tend to be a tiny slice of the pie and you are required to work like a sweat shop worker on that little piece every day with no variety.

157,AQR Capital Management,Welcome to the Hotel California!,2014-06-21,1.0,Gaa Researcher,None I can think of.,"This place makes sure that you don't earn any domain knowledge that is portable ensuring you remain its slave forever. This is true for majority of the hires in last few years who were attracted by the shiny sales pitch and the prospect of working at one of the world's largest hedge fund(correction - a small proportion of the managed assets are hedge fund) . The troops are largely demoralized and frustrated at the lack of growth and nebulas career path. Mid-level management shuffles are frequent, and irrational leading to unexplained demotions. Management is full of shiny ex-academic stars who are low on ideas and high on BS. This review is probably similar to others, and after three years I am frustrated. This place doesn't deserve a single five starts. Most of the five stars reviews are from gullible interns who after spending just two months, fattened by the free lunches and snacks leave awestruck by the gimmicky sales pitch. From my experience, it takes six months at AQR for the honeymoon to wane away."

Avoid any position is GSS. They do bad research using tech infrastructure from the last century.  Avoid any ""Portfolio Management XXXX"" positions. You will be a slave working unnecessarily long hours with no clue of what you are doing. Avoid IT because you won't find any inspiring colleagues. Job is mundane and support for the most part of it."

There is no career progress of non-PhDs. If you are young and ambitious, this is not the place for you. Don't believe any word they say in career fairs. AQR's starting package is usually very attractive, but there no significant growth later on. If you are not a PhD you will either end up coding in python, or cleaning up massive amount of bad data."
