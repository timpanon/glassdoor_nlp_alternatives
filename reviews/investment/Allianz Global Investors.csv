Restructurings follow very naive, simplistic and outdated accounting and personal rules regardless of business impacts or multi-level systematic dependencies.

It is an open secret within the firm that there is a hierarchy: Europeans on top, white Americans second and non-white groups at the bottom. I have experienced put-downs, retaliatory behavior, treatment below seniority, being berated for small lapses (very common!) and denial of recognition despite high quality work. I have also noted other excellent colleagues (who are not white) ill-treated by managers often with the aim of beating them “into line” and showing “who’s boss”. 

People are frightened of certain senior managers who have used bullying and public bashing to make an example of subordinates who speak out. It is not a secret who these managers are, but people are afraid to risk their position by complaining. 

I sincerely hope the reader has a better experience at this firm. But if you have options, *absolutely* do consider working elsewhere."

Management in Germany has proven to believe that if you are an American (which I am) that you know nothing.  If you have an idea, if they like it they will take credit for it and give you no credit for your ideas or you work around the idea. 

I'm treated like slave labor.  I'm regularly on calls at 4:30-5:00 am and then expected to come into the office after because Germany refuses to take calls that will work in the US time zones and hide behind the German workers council. 

There are so many things we can do to make our systems and processes better that will cost little to no money but Germany will not listen because those ideas are not German ones, they are American ones. 

It is considered offensive and a faux pas if you bring up how a process/system can be improved that Germany designed, invented or implemented.  

There is a ton of micromanagement especially from Germany. 

If you like technology and expect to be working with tools that are from the 21st century, don't work here.  They love antiquated technology. 

Allianz Global Investors talks the diversity talk but does not do the diversity walk.  I've watched several female colleagues run for the hills from this company based on the way they were treated and HR did nothing to resolve.

223,Allianz Global Investors,Really good internship,2015-08-08,5.0,Risk Manager Assistant,"Well known and recognized company, Good integration of new workers, interesting work as described in the job description, Munich is a lovely city.","I would have liked discovering even more during my internship, participating to meetings... but it is not easy to give too many responsabilities to an intern."
224,Allianz Global Investors,You are nothing more than a number and a body,2015-07-09,1.0,Technology Executive,Chosen offices have nice amenities.,The portrayed corporate values are for show.  HR is useless for legitimate personnel issues.
225,Allianz Global Investors,Market Analysis,2015-05-15,5.0,Mutual Fund Research,very good life and work balance,less carrier chance in Germany
226,Allianz Global Investors,Hong Kong Internship,2015-05-05,5.0,Summer Intern,Great corporate culture and I learnt a lot on the internship. I was given interesting projects to work on by myself and conducting my own research and presenting these to the team at the end was a useful experience for my future career.,"The internship itself could have had a bit more structure and formal teaching. Much of the time I was working as part of the team and had to learn everything on the job as it was new to me. This was useful, but I feel some structured learning would have been better."
227,Allianz Global Investors,Analyst,2015-04-26,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"nice people, globally respected name to put on a resume","Slow moving internally, bureaucratic, still seems to be trying to find its footing as ""one firm"", the talk and aspirations of senior management are a lot loftier than the reality of day to day life, very little opportunity for internal growth, promotion or movement - it seems that the default choice to fill an open position is to bring in an outsider"
228,Allianz Global Investors,Administration,2015-04-14,3.0,,Great people!!  Everyone at AGI works hard with best interests maintained,The company seeks to be the very best at what they do - not always possible
229,Allianz Global Investors,Complex structure in the US,2015-02-15,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Global player, diverse asset-classes, new products, centers of competence","Disconnect between business and operations, long-lasting decision making, protectionism from the very south office,"
230,Allianz Global Investors,Very friendly culture and reasonably good pay,2015-02-10,5.0,Summer Intern,Friendly office culture and perfect work-life balance,"Non challenging working atmosphere, seems like people are here to wait for retirement."
231,Allianz Global Investors,Portfolio Manager,2015-01-14,4.0,Portfolio-Manager,"Reasonably good pay and staff friendly environment, quality and value of the fund products are highly acclaimed in Taiwan.","Some demands from the team head, long hours."
232,Allianz Global Investors,Come here to retire,2014-11-28,1.0,Research Analyst,"Work hours, Job security, responsibility.","The company in Hong Kong is very political. Merit doesn't matter. The CIO is not aware of games being played by the next lower level of management. Pay is bottom among asset managers. Promotions are  based on number of years in the company, and slower promotions vs. rest of the companies. Salary increment in promotions is minimal. Internal politics in the investment team is killing all productivity. Head of that team doesn't perform well and shows favoritism without results. There is no accountability in the team, you can be wrong all the time and still continue.
There is no culture of giving more responsibility to people within, so no one is motivated.

Stay away."
233,Allianz Global Investors,Nice boutique asset manager,2014-10-01,4.0,,Culture is very strong and encourages a healthy work/life balance.,Senior leadership could be better. Their hearts are in the right place but they often fail to execute.
234,Allianz Global Investors,Excellent benefits + great enviroment,2014-09-12,4.0,Associate,"Awesome benefits 410k and pension
Large asset manager 500 WAUM and other half of Allianz Asset Management w/ PIMCO",Bagels every monrning not just friday
235,Allianz Global Investors,A place to be,2014-07-13,5.0,Sales,"A great work environment, real work life balance (a day care centre in the building), competitive compensation, global reach, and a strong parent company. Strong values. Strong and visionary senior management, and excellent career development for talents. The list goes on and on!",Unnecessary hierarchy and a little conservative. But nothing major. Management working on streamlining it.
236,Allianz Global Investors,Large firm with various opportunities,2014-07-07,4.0,Financial Analyst II,"-Allianz as a whole is a very large firm with many international opportunities.
-In the Newport Beach office you have the opportunity to work alongside PIMCO management.
-Excellent Financial benefits (generous 401K matching, ESPP, institutional shares)
-Flexible work hours","-Long work hours during the busy seasons (Quarterly-Close, Summers, and Year-end-Close)
-Annual Bonus and Merit Increases are lacking"
237,Allianz Global Investors,Overall good company if you're not driven by salary,2014-04-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people are great, there are advancement opportunities, the management is fair in areas they can control, the work is very interesting.","The hiring salary is fair. But the increases, especially for promotions, are CRAP. Sometimes, they don't give any salary adjustment for upward movement/transfers.  Many disgruntled transfers because you don't learn about the salary adjustment or lack thereof, until AFTER you've already expressed interest in a position.  How does it look if you turn it down because of the little/no money after you've sold yourself on being excited to join the new team?  Then, because we are all told not to discuss salary with peers, the cycle continues.  
I feel bad for all the people I've seen move jobs excited about a higher level position only to see them disappointed to learn of the very small promotion increase in salary. This needs to be fixed."
238,Allianz Global Investors,"Low pay, little room for growth",2014-01-06,2.0,Analyst,"Great employee benefits, great office location.","Pay is below industry standards, not enough room for growth"

243,Allianz Global Investors,Working environment has deteriorated.,2013-09-27,1.0,Manager,Smart people who used to care about the work being done.,"Since the company started managing everything from the global headquarters the region has lost functionality, reduced the quality of output, and discouraged independent thinking.   Regional offices have little control over anything now and employee morale is at an all time low in all the years I've been there.  Everyone has given up, and is just punching a clock in and out."
244,Allianz Global Investors,Previously worked at Nicholas Applegate. Was Awesome. Now Allianz (AGIC) has taken turn for the worse.,2013-08-20,3.0,Operations Associate,"- Very elite firm. Class A office space high in the sky of San Diego. (Floors 29-34)
- Lots of excellent and valuable people here. (but many just got laid off recently)
- Very high tenure (many people had stayed for 10+ yrs... some 20+)
- Good pay. Maybe not top pay, but not lousy either.
- Excellent benefits all around.","- Big wigs of upper Management don't understand the value of their people. They outsourced their best of the best in class Operations group. That was a poor decision.
- They don't pay for employee parking on site. $190/mo. Like seriously wtf?
- When it was Nicholas Applegate, there were a lot of great things to say about this company when Marna Whittington was the CEO. She was supremely top class. New senior management has come in and done the tired old cliche of ""re-organizing"" a great (and highly profitable btw) operation."
245,Allianz Global Investors,"Very active, but limited expansion.",2013-07-22,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great benefits, great  location (San Diego), great work life balance.  The company does a great job at giving all the resources and learning opportunities to employees.  The office is full of very capable and intelligent employees.","Limited mobility as the company is somewhat top heavy.  Many managers due to expansion and contraction over the years.  The stress level of the office, obviously, ebbs and flows with the tides of the market."
246,Allianz Global Investors,Good company,2013-07-12,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"As a German AM, promising development.","Complicated organizational structure, too conservative."
247,Allianz Global Investors,Stable but frustrating,2013-05-11,2.0,Asset Management,"Stable, solid platform.
Access to sellside, systems, etc. is good.
Also ok to travel.
Mild, comfortable atmosphere.
Good for a German to internationalize.
OK for an intern/junior to learn (although Tier 1 firms even better).","Politics are widespread. Decisions making is slow and often nonsensical...unless it's due to politics. This also makes it bureaucratic.
Comp isn't great either. Lots of valuable senior people end up leaving. It's moving more and more towards pay-for-performance, but it's still early days. Upside seems limited by culture/German civil servant attitude though.
It's not considered Tier 1 among asset managers (which might surprise them).
Very limited interaction among investment teams.
Pimco (sister co) reputation looms large..."
248,Allianz Global Investors,Too many managers patting each other on each others backs for having a great meeting(especially among AGI).,2013-03-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Salary, medical benefits, coworkers, locations, vacation allowance","50/50 of good and bad mangers.
Procedures and decision making are inefficient."
249,Allianz Global Investors,AGI,2013-02-25,2.0,,There is a strong product line up,the organization has terrible communication across departments
250,Allianz Global Investors,Company ruined by merger,2013-02-22,2.0,Marketing Support,"Some good people work there, benefits and pay are good.","Allianz purchased Oppenheimer Capital in New York, NFJ in Dallas, and Nicholas-Applegate in San Diego and merged them together. After the CEO from New York took over, the company went right downhill. People were indiscriminately laid off, despite performance. Financial products with excellent performance were closed, while products that haven't beat their benchmark in months were kept open. It was very obvious that the CEO wanted to protect jobs in New York, and sacrifice everyone else."
251,Allianz Global Investors,"Good company, bad management, off course in San Diego",2012-10-31,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Benefits are awesome; some advancement oissible. Coworkers are great. Can be a good learning experience. The office is nice and has a gym.,Management doesn't make a decision easily...ever. Things get done by committee; achievements not always appreciated.You can get pidgeonholed and then frustrated. Too much politics.
252,Allianz Global Investors,"Allianz Global Investors is the red-headed stepchild next to the favored son, Pimco!",2012-06-23,1.0,Vice President,Global brand and name recognition. Institutional heft when dealing with the sell-side. Generous pension and health benefits.,Horrible senior management. Lack of vision and imagination on the part of senior management. The senior management of Allianz SE don't understand how to build a strong global asset management business.
253,Allianz Global Investors,Great opportunity to work in a prestigious financial environment.,2012-02-23,4.0,Data Analyst,Firm is know world wide. They have a strong balance sheet and run a wide variety of businesses. People there were very friendly.,May not be as well know in the United States and therefore you may not get the type of recognition one may be looking for.
254,Allianz Global Investors,"If you're looking for career growth, this is not the place",2011-12-14,1.0,,"Decent vacation days, good health benefits, people aren't in your personal business. Fairly young crowd. Work hours stick to a 9-5 parameter.","Internal job postings are for show, they prefer outside candidates. If you're not upper management, your opinion doesn't count. Each department is its own fiefdom & there's no office integration nor unity."
255,Allianz Global Investors,Good company if you are a German willing to get international exposure,2011-09-14,4.0,,"Global reach, strong brand, increasingly international staff, diversity of careers to take, international opportunities",German part of the organisation still needs to do a better job in rewarding smart hard working people and excellence rather than tenure.
