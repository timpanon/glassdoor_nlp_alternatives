0,Ally Financial,Good Company/Benefits,2022-04-23,5.0,Data Analyst II,Good Company/Benefits. Laid back place to work for the most part.,Work somewhat repetitive. Management lacking sometimes.
1,Ally Financial,ugh- great paycheck,2022-04-23,3.0,Customer Service Representative,"good benefits, fair pay for the area.","expect to be treated like a robot. forget that you are human once walking through the door. understand you are on your own. 
very toxic 'we are a family' environment"
2,Ally Financial,Fall in line,2022-04-21,1.0,Manager,"Banking industry, good benefits, tries somewhat to care about diversity, pto is good.","They say the return to office is for the culture, but after returning to office, I am reminded after 5 years here that they really put the cult in culture. The company communications are filled propaganda. Meetings are filled with toxic positivity while the issues are ignored. Leaders use the same fake corporate speak repeatedly to try and force you to conform. They don’t value true contributions, learning differences, differing personalities etc… Fall in line like a robot or else. 

Leaders frequently use brainwashing cult language such as assimilate, dedicated, better together, etc…. The leaders in my department are all sexist men who don’t treat female employees equally. We don’t want to return to the corporate brainwashing office where we experience sexism, microaggressions, micromanaging, forced distracting socialization, no personal boundaries, constant disrespect, and classism/elitism. Stop stealing our time with forced commutes. The pay at Ally isn’t even that good. They always say they are an industry leading employer but that is far from true. Their pay is middle of the road, their flexibility with remote work is tight compared to industry competitors and other major employers, they only promote based on cliques and you will not get ahead if you don’t brow nose, become personal friends with a senior leader, work 60-hour weeks, become a mindless corporate drone, or are a white male. Leaders do not respect those beneath them and do not speak to us with respect. The old GMAC culture shines through. They try and force this young, hip, and inclusive culture but that is just surface level. They are the same outdated GMAC they always were in how they treat their employees."

16,Ally Financial,Biased,2022-04-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Overall, the company tries to encourage diversity and inclusion however, sadly the miss the mark.","The company tries to live by their diversity principles but they fall short in the operation department, especially outside of the Charlotte office. The Operations department is rampant with sexism and favoritism. Most operations employees are women however, women don't have a leadership voice and are not given the opportunity to advance. All Operations leadership are men.

In Jacksonville all leaders are men. They were far more qualified women who applied for those positions but it is well known they only promote men. They are regularly dismissive and condescending to women in meetings. They give female employees administrative duties far below their position. They are more harsh with write ups for women. They make condescending comments about women's abilities in the workplace. Women's work and ideas are taken credit for by men. It is an unwelcoming and uncomfortable environment for female employees knowing this department has no respect for women. The Weaverville office is the same. 

Even in my department, all of the men on the team were allowed to stay remote while the women were forced back into office when we are more tenured, higher performing, and made it clear we did not want to return to office. They treat women like they need babysitting and can't function without constant direction and supervision while they give men autonomy."

 What do they care about, you ask? Power. They care about you falling in line and doing what you are told. ""Safety protocols"" like masks, don't apply to everyone. This is why executives, including the CEO broke the rules while the commoners wore masks at their desks when the mandates were in place in Charlotte. They care about money. Kickbacks from local, state, and federal governments to implement certain protocols. The return-to-office is much more about real-estate not sitting empty than it is about ""safety"". Wait until the ""hybrid"" model goes away."

Diverse company that promotes from within and makes sure minorities are well represented in leadership positions.,"Weird vibe and culture and sometimes I feel like stepford wives or a corporate drone. Senior leadership know we don't want to go back in office but they keep on sugar coating and glossing over our concerns. I am getting really tired of the toxic positivity surrounding it. They won't allow us actual flexibility and are not remote friendly in the least but they want to force us to smile about the return to office we don't want. They know we are concerned about burnout, commutes, health and safety in the office, and distractions. They then turn around and tell us we will get through it and then be grateful to get to see our coworkers in person everyday."

66,Ally Financial,No,2022-03-02,1.0,Manager,Good on your resume. Great to stay a year or two to build your career.,"Only so so pay
No work from home options at all for bank employees
Only a tiny bit of flexibility for auto or IT employees

70,Ally Financial,Looking elsewhere,2022-03-02,1.0,Specialist,I like my team enough,Won't allow any remote work at all even though I am a long term employee with a proven performance. I can't stay motivated and invested in my company or work knowing they don't trust me and want to micromanage. I am looking elsewhere and going to another company.
71,Ally Financial,Office work,2022-03-02,1.0,Analyst,"Benefits, some room for growth","No remote or hybrid options, unprofessional co workers, overbearing managers."
72,Ally Financial,No balance,2022-03-02,1.0,Manager,Friendly managers. Talented and competent teams.,"Pay is not competitive, fake culture, no work from home options. I am not sure why there are so many positive reviews in here saying Ally is flexible and offers work from home because that isn't correct. There may be some work from home options for a small percent of auto workers, but non at all in banking, especially for CC&E. I have a position where I work mostly alone all day. None of my team is at my site. I will still be in zoom meeting with people in other locations all day. 90% of my work is behind the scenes and done completely alone. They are still making me come back to a building and lose and personal time 5 days a week. There goes my balanced personal life and pretty much all of my job satisfaction. I have started looking at other jobs immediately. If you are interviewing with Ally, realize they are completely intolerant towards working from home AT ALL. Very outdated environment and expectations."
73,Ally Financial,Not Truthful,2022-03-02,1.0,Manager,Well rounded benefits. Good training opportunities. The company is very diverse at least in the Charlotte office.,"The strict no work from home outlook that Ally holds. We are bringing all of our employees back to office the majority of the week in the coming few weeks. Ally has been lying to employees telling them they are committed to flexibility and they know we are performing well at home but they want us in the building for the culture. Ally has lied and told employees they will offer hybrid schedules one we get back in the building. In a recent leadership meeting, we were told Ally will be pulling employees back to office 5 days a week soon. The supposed hybrid schedule is just for a short period of time during re-entry so that employees have a very limited time to reintroduce themselves to working in office. Then we are going to pull it out from under them and force them to work out of tiny cubicles, in an open floor plan office, with no personal space and now windows 5 days per week. We are lying to and tricking our employees into thinking they will at least have a hybrid option when Ally has not intention of actually offering this. We are lying to prevent all of our employees from a mass exit to more remote friendly companies instead of offering our employees options and flexibility. A lot of our positions also translate well to other industries and companies that offer fully remote positions. Even though a lot of managers want to give their team flexibility and work life balance, Sr. Leadership will not allow it. A lot of other financial institutions are offering more remote options and more hybrid friendly schedules with only 1-2 days in the building instead of 3=4. I am worried that all of our employees will jump ship to other financial companies who have a friendlier environment to young workers that balance that remote work gives them. Our young workers know it is impossible to maintain their outside life and responsiblities when they work in a building 9-10 hours a day then commute a few hours a day, then also have to get read and packed up every single day. That takes what is supposed to be an 8-9 hour work day, into taking up at least 12-14 hours of our days. When are we supposed to spend time with our children and raise them. Ally does pay decently but it isn't worth giving up our personal lives to sit in a depressing office with people who don't respect our personal space and privacy just to do the same job but get interrupted more. I could see 1-2 days in office for relationship building, but Ally doesn't trust us at all."

Get rid of your outdated CEO and Executive Leadership for people that understand the current workforce and job market.
80,Ally Financial,Okay,2022-02-28,1.0,Associate,Some decent managers and leaders,No work from home. Subpar pay. Office politics. Commuting.
81,Ally Financial,Disappointing,2022-02-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Entry level positions with acceptable benefits.,"The culture is not inclusive at the local levels outside of Charlotte. They are bringing everyone back into office to be told what to do and micromanaged by the old white guys that are in the leadership positions in the smaller offices. These offices are not inclusive, and are stuck in their outdated ways of discriminating against parents. That will be even worse now when we have to leave the office to care for a sick child or appointments when that could be done while working if they would allow work from home. USAA, U.S. Bank, M&T, PNC, TD Bank, Bank of America, Regions, Discover, Charles Schwab etc... are way more remote friendly than Ally. They all have a decent percentage of completely remote job postings. How is Ally going to compete to retain and recruit. I have applied for 20 other remote banking jobs in the past 2 weeks and I know a lot of people in my department have as well. Nobody wants to sit in an uncomfortable office environment for a customer service/call center type job."
82,Ally Financial,Lack of Care,2022-02-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,It is a job at least,Not truly inclusive as they brag about. Not inclusive to caregivers and parents bringing employees back to office during the pandemic with school closures etc... They say it is for the culture but forced socialization isn't a culture. They don't listen to all of the employee surveys they do even though they say they care. They are having problems recruiting people and really don't understand it is because nobody is willing to work for a call center in office when it can be easily done at home most of the time. Local leadership in the call centers is sexist and misogynistic. Employees have no respect for personal boundaries and professionalism. I don't know how we will keep running when everyone is out sick with Covid a few weeks in.

84,Ally Financial,Trade off for being babysat in the office is not worth it,2022-02-25,1.0,Analyst,Entry level for agent jobs. Some ability to move up if you know the right people and suck up.,"They focus more on the propaganda and lies that employees want to come back into office than they do developing the employees. It is literally like a cult, it is very insulting they don't think we are intelligent enough to think and speak for ourselves and read through their lies. The majority of us do not want to return to office, lying to us and saying everyone wants to come back is ridiculous. Only your ""yes"" people who are cowards and to afraid to speak their own minds are saying such. We have already started having recruiting problems due to people skipping us over for remote positions. Our managers asked us to brainstorm ways to market the positions to help with recruiting. Get with the program and listen to feedback Ally. Your employees do not want to be babysat in the office surrounded by germs and noise. We want to keep successfully working at home like we have been. You are just going to keep having trouble hiring and retaining employees."

I feel at home here and can be my authentic self.",The only opportunity I would offer is for new-hires making sure they understand where to go for certain information and a more structured training program. Maybe even partnering new-hires with a mentor or a buddy that can help them get acclimated to the place.

amazing benefits","Management has no respect for you 
I’ve been cursed and slandered while the frustrations were misplaced from the onset. 
they don’t care about your health 
Lack of accountability to injuries

90,Ally Financial,Don't care about your wellbeing,2022-02-18,1.0,Supervisor,Decent entry level job with just so so pay,"They don't care about your health and safety. They are pulling most employees back into office the majority of the time with no masking requirements, no enforced social distancing guidelines, and those employees are going to be stacked on top of one another. I am a high risk individual with a disability as defined by the ADA and Ally declined my accommodation request to work from home even though I have a Doctors recommendation stating I should continue working from home (as we have proven we have done successfully and productively). The paperwork states that I am high risk and likely to be hospitalized and have serious complications from COVID and Ally doesn't care at all. They only care about warm bodies and people in seats to micromanage and control. I am appalled that they are being so risky with my health, it really saddens me to know I don't matter to them."

Run!,2022-02-16,1.0,Instructional Designer,"Great benefits such as student loan repayment,  decent bonuses, 401k match and retirement","Auto Learning & Development - upper leaders (directors and up) totally out of touch - rampant favoritism, policies that make no sense, can’t be explained, and are not applied to all. No diversity. Promotions are not posted but handed out like candy to friends with no regard for qualifications or job performance. Some allowed to remain remote and others not. Constant chaos and reorganization that keeps staff off balance and focused on “what are they going to do next?” rather than on producing quality work. Pay is below industry averages. SOME - not all - forced to go back to office though job can be more effectively performed remotely. Department is rotting from the inside - not reflective of all departments at Ally."

97,Ally Financial,Not great,2022-02-15,1.0,Senior Analyst,"Moderate pay and benefits, good learning opportunities","Ally is a dinosaur in terms of how they treat their employees with distrust and won't allow WFH. They keep saying they will still allow hybrid, their idea of hybrid is a joke. 1 day a week at home is definitely not hybrid when I work 10 hour days and don't get home from the office due to the commute and long hours until 1 hour before my kids bedtime. That is not work life balance. Senior leadership got stern in a meeting today that we need to embrace the change and deal with the new normal of coming back into the office. They said this while they were sitting in the comfort and safety of their nice, private executive office with a door. So out of touch when they don't have to deal with constant office interruptions, germs, and complete lack of space that we will have to deal with sitting in cramped cubicles and using a public restroom. They won't be as likely to catch covid from cramped common spaces as us ""common folk""."

99,Ally Financial,Moving on,2022-02-14,1.0,Manager,"Easy to get a foot in the door and gain experience, only positive if you use this a short term stepping stone.","Requires on site office work. Won't allow remote work even though most jobs can be done more effectively remotely and employees have proven they flourish when working in the comfort and safety of their own home. I am moving on to a company that allows their employees autonomy in making choices that best suit their needs, home life, and comfortability. No more archaic 8-6 forced office environment for me."

101,Ally Financial,Not worth it,2022-02-14,1.0,Senior Analyst,Decent entry level pay and benefits,Ally is stuck in the past in their view towards remote work. The pay is not worth it to have to work in office 5 days a week.

Work life balance is good as well.","As a digital bank, I’m still unclear as to why we had to return to the office. Working in Detroit and seeing the big three move to a fully remote environment with the option to collaborate as needed was a huge deal and one that is very evident to us in this area. If Ally calls itself a tech company, they should follow suit with the trailblazers and embrace this new normal."
104,Ally Financial,Truly inclusive culture,2022-02-11,5.0,Strategic Manager,The culture is unparalleled in the banking and financial industry and the company truly lives by its motto to do it right for customers.,Can’t think of any true cons.

We all have to relocate downtown and struggle for parking, and then have to take a public transport the rest of the way, just to get into and out of the office. Ridiculous. All competitors are going remote. Ally is an online bank. Why do they need everyone to be in the office? I will be looking for another job, and so will many others.

You can have over 10 years in banking experience and be making the same as someone who has never had a job before this. If you have prior knowledge of banking you will probably know more then have the team leads or supervisors. The systems and what you are allowed to do for clients without asking for extra help is very minimal, yet they ask you to not ask for help unless necessary.

The staff at Ally is also professional and pleasant, do we always agree, absolutely not, but I never felt pushed or had to take a pre-emptive Xanax prior to meeting with someone.","Access can be slow to get, and you'll quickly learn to remember a 6 digit code texted to you, so you can type it in.

202,Ally Financial,Only looks good on paper!,2021-10-02,1.0,Executive Director,"Good compensation package but not as good as others in the industry

Outstanding senior management team at the EC level, but their direct reports (2 down from the CEO) are not as good, most are controlling and territorial due to incompetency

Good intent to drive diversity and inclusion from the top, but it all falls flat with execution at the grass root level. My own management team does not even embrace it. It's all talks without any meaningful actions","See the Cons included in the Pros listed

There are quite a few long-term employees who are basically deadwood at the company, especially those with over 10 years at the company. They are keeping the company from transforming or innovating at a faster speed as they are blocking new people to do anything good for the company. Any new initiatives takes YEARS to launch on the bank side. 

They don't award or recognize employees who got the job done. Instead, those competent people have been driven out of the company because they make those old-timers look so bad

Diversity and inclusion at this company is only on paper. It's evident by just counting the number of minority leaders in the EC and the percentage of people of color who work as a Senior Director or higher

HR and many corporate systems are still leveraging technology from the 80s"

Given the nature of my role I participated in a lot of conversations regarding team dynamics, employee performance and engagement, etc. I saw firsthand how much people at all levels of the organization genuinely cared - not just about their own job or ability to produce good work, but about the people they worked with or managed. I sat in many executive and manager offices to discuss strategic priorities or team dynamics, and can honestly say that the vast majority of these leaders heard their employees’ opinions/wants/needs and kept that at the heart of many of their decisions, my own leadership team included. 
Community outreach was huge at Ally and there were countless ways to get involved both internally and externally. Regardless of department, there were opportunities to raise your hand and work on new projects.","With so many new projects and ways to get involved it was easy to spread myself thin, but that was a me problem.

-decent work/life balance","Ally is very slow to adapt and change with the times...an 'old school' company very set in its ways.  Questioning why certain job functions are performed, or if there is a better way of doing things, is not really encouraged.  This leads to a lot of redundant or low-value-adding tasks in performance of your job, which doesn't exactly lead to a sense of fulfillment or personal accomplishment.

Also, employees aren't necessarily recognized for their accomplishments in any meaningful way.  I worked there for over a decade;   I always received exemplary reviews from my managers, but it never translated into substantial bonuses or raises.  The biggest promotion/raise I received was two years into my tenure, and then my salary struggled to keep up with inflation after that, despite all the additional experience and knowledge I accumulated.  I also found out I was passed over for a job that I applied for because of the perceived value of an outside hire (the hiring manager didn't want to miss the opportunity to bring an external applicant into the company;   to me this implied that they assumed after 10+ years I would always be around and that there would always be another chance to hire me into a new role....this decision ultimately played a strong role in my leaving)...basically demonstrating they don't put much stock in people who know and understand the company's culture and systems.  Being an incumbent will actually put you at a disadvantage when trying to advance."

The  general  employee  population  fits  the  temperament,  current  (but  hopefully  not  permanent)  socioeconomic  status,  and  education  of  you  would  typically  find  at  a  call  center.
The  committed  and  the  talented  (not  me)  are  promised  promotions  but  in  reality  put into  a  long  slowly  moving  line  to  hop  into  whatever  higher  up  role  might  open  up next  from  the  small  list  at  the  Shoreview  location,  or  move  to  another  city  (which  is never  worth  whatever  is  being  offered).
This  long  line  will  often  mean  the  next  person  who's  long  over  due  for  a  promotion may  not  fit  the  role  he  or  she  is  offered  which  can  lead  to good  employees  being  terrible  at  whatever  they  were  stuck  with  (MANAGERS  and  Trainers  mainly).  

This  is  not  a  unique  place,  and  these  are  not  unique  problems/traits  for  a  collections  call  center  to  have.  Shoreview  is  a  low  rung  operation  of  a  national  company  that  is  too  far  away  from  it's  corporate  headquarters.  Just  know  what  to  expect."

Great working environment 
Many opportunities for growth!","Constant changes 
Some management issues"
579,Ally Financial,I love working at Ally,2019-02-24,5.0,Compliance Director,"Great work environment, company culture, benefits",Some individuals not held accountable
580,Ally Financial,"Don't bother, this is one of the worst jobs I've ever had.",2019-02-22,1.0,Processing,Some benefits are better than no benefits. That's it. I thought hard about this one but seriously there isn't a compelling reason to work here.,"Where to begin..

- Low pay relative to experience and work executed. If you're a processor you'll get paid $16/hr when most doing similar work get in the mid $20s

- Management literally has no idea what it's doing. I've heard about places like this, but it's terrifying to be caught up in one. Since i started working here my process has changed at least 8 times. It's changing for probably a 9th and 10th time soon. Each step takes so long, what should take a few days takes a customer more than a month to deal with because of it. I don't know a single employee happy here.

-There are almost 40 processes in my building. When I was recruited I was told no phone work required. That was a huge lie. They don't give you a choice of what processes you're assigned to. They also won't allow you to move processes either. If they do, it's only because you begged and pleaded and are popular with the team leads. It's a total dead end job

-Each process is regulated, yet training is practically nonexistent and in many cases if it is provided, is contrary to the light general training you do receive on software and procedure. They expect you to know other processes you aren't educated or trained on when answering the phones they initially tell you that you won't be on. In reality, in my case I'm in a call center with non stop customer inquires that can be easily handled online in a tracking system, if they weren't too cheap to impliment one. Knowing what i know now, i would never in any point of time do business with this company. It's lunacy.

- Nothing you ever do is good enough. Nothing. You'll be constantly hounded about statistics low level management admits it doesn't fully understand. Only 20 calls answered today? Where's the rest of your work. You did how many contracts? You must not be taking enough calls. They tell you it's a team effort, but then take away a small yearly bonus (we're talking only maybe $1k or so) based on you individually and your popularity. It's literal insanity.

- There doesn't seem to be any human resource or employment standards. I've seen employees look like they're ready for office work in a suit while their coworker in the same job is dressed like he's in a street gang. No one says anything. One person will be warned for something personal like too much or not enough perfume, when there's no such regulation.

I'm not the complaining type, but I'm actively looking for another job and have been completely dismayed with this one since the beginning of hire. It's embarrassing to tell people I work here."
581,Ally Financial,Not as progressive as it appears,2019-02-19,2.0,Mortgage,"Pay is very competitive than most industry standards, location is very clean and newer from most standard offices, and CEO treats employees very well w/ additional bonuses and company pays for advanced education.","Management:

I’ve been at Ally two years and had 5 managers since that time. Managers are former BofA buddies who will know nothing about your role, but seek to enforce suggestions that are not tolerated in industry. There is a STRONG urge of micro-management culture and lack of direction from management. Do not let anyone fool you into believing that Ally is progressive and have competent management.

Work-Life Balance:

Ally doesn’t allow its employees (salaried) to work from home unless something as serious as a tree has blocked your garage, and even then Ally will ask you to still find a way into the office. Management requires to know your every move from when are you taking lunch to the time you arrive from the restrooms. It’s a very strict and tense culture w/ control from the top weighing down on the individual contributors.

HR & Career Advancement:

HR comes off as very approachable, but this is a plot in order to get you to believe they have your back. As an internal employee (and others I know), I’ve interviewed for 10 jobs and all were given to external employees or former friends. I was once told I did not receive a role bc I had “Compliance knowledge” of the business, but didn’t have “Risk knowledge”. When I found out who was hired internally the guy didn’t have any experience in Compliance or Risk ever; He was literally “bar buddies” with the hiring manager. HR has to meet a quota and will send you on interviews to fill that quota. HR once told me that inside employees are usually good for one job, so they hire a lot of outside ppl.

Other:

I am warning you right now! Because it looks progressive from the outside 85% of the employees are miserable in their role and desire to leave. There are more progressive companies in the banking/financial industry who are not hiring management that are incompetent and want to make your life a living hell. Do not take a role at this company unless you are planning to go in with the intention of leaving after a year experience doing a particular role. It’s not the place for longevity and to grow your brand."

Banking culture leaves at 5pm on the dot or even earlier","• Dysfunctional - Teams are led by legacy BofA management and are not effective at leading. Senior leadership have had a long time to improve communication, team morale and process, but have moved the needle very little on improvements. Practically every department from Marketing, to Tech, to Home Loans and Auto do not know what the other is doing. Senior leadership have Senior Product Managers that have little to no product experience. Many Senior leaders take the ""bullying"" approach to management and seldom are called out for it. If they are called out nothing will be done.


• Disorganized - They will change HR representatives faster than you can keep up. There is little to no on-boarding process, and managers are left to find out how things work rather than being walked through any process. You won't have a clear insight on who to contact or partner with right away, it's a bit of a wild goose chase.

• Deceitful - From HR to Marketing to C-Suite level team members, you will receive one type pf communication, but trust me here, they don't say what they're really meaning. EXAMPLE: Senior management will provide you with the ""we want you to take ownership, shake things up"" speech, while really meaning ""we just want you to keep the peace amongst our nightmarish mess."" Several people who tried to ""correct"" or ""improve"" process or create meaningful change were let go. It's a pretty ruthless group."

Now that it has no vehicle manufacturer backing, Ally is just another automotive finance company and doesn’t belong on the same playing field as its competitors. It’s a failing finance company, in a failing industry. It also still has a culture that is stuck in the 80s - “good ol’ boy” mentatilty runs rampant with 80% of the office making way more in salary than they should. It’s fair to say that it’s definitely an “old timers” office where they sacrifice young talent to promote and move folks with more tenure...regardless of lack of skill or talent. However, a caveat to this are those will last names that are same as upper management. They are placed in a fast track without the real work, with a real possibility of gaining multiple promotions in a year (even though that’s against company policy...wink, wink)."

Ally seemed to put emphasis on doing many of the little and big things to increase employee satisfaction.","In spite of all the pros, management was terrible to the point that I left after several months.  My manager was a nightmare.  She was a chronic liar, a horrible micro-manager--even to seasoned employees like me, and she generated drama at every turn.  It became clear to me at the end that she was mentally unstable.  When I took a dozen pages of notes to HR and my manager's manager, they initially seemed concerned but then after confronting her, she lied her way out of everything.  Never mind that there were other people in the dept with similar issues.  Instead of HR/management taking steps to improve the situation within the dept, they exacerbated it and it only imploded.  I left for another opportunity making significantly more money in an environment where I am treated as a very valued employee so it ultimately led me to a better job but I still resent that I had to go through that and leave a job that I otherwise loved.

I believe my manager may have gotten a free pass because she was perceived by some higher ups as bringing her A-game (she was a masterful speaker).  There are other people at Ally in prominent leadership roles who are notorious for mistreating their employees (i.e., insults in meetings, horribly disrespecting their employees in public, leading an environment of fear, etc.) but also are known for ""delivering results.""  It seems that there is a culture of ""we'll ignore your poor leadership skills if you are delivering results"" at Ally.  Not sure if this is a carryover from the old GM days but that just doesn't fly in today's work environment."

•	Leadership glued to their screens, Management 3 feet away would IM/Email workers instead of talking to workers directly
•	Terrible Work Life Balance – Below Market Pay with 45-50 Hour office work week expected
•	Working after hours at home and working Friday-Saturday-Sunday is the norm. This includes weekends at 2am. Forget a weekend life. No Extra Pay given. When having an out of town vacation already planned and approved, management expects you to bring your laptop with you to work on the vacation. 
•	Talking to management about issues will be turned against the employee
•	Disciplinary action given to employees who want to move within the company. All good performance reviews, but when asking to explore different roles within the company, management will give employees disciplinary action.
• Employees who put in their two weeks will be escorted out immediately if management doesn’t like them, without opportunity to give an exit interview
• Management doesn’t look long term as far as how much time is needed for projects. As projects reach deadlines, instead of pushing back the deadline they require employees to start working nights and weekends in order to meet them. This isn’t a one-time situation, this is normal. This means working nights and even more on weekends than previously suggested. When asked to have more help on the project, the response is, “It is expected that salaried employees will need to put in more work.” Management doesn’t like employees who say no to working on weekends regardless on if your personal life has prior plans that weekend."

747,Ally Financial,It was ok,2017-07-14,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Good pay and benefits. Training was great,Micromanaged by management and unfair to employees. Managers had favorites.
748,Ally Financial,"The work is fun, the people/ideology are not great....",2017-07-06,2.0,Business Analyst,"Salary - The benefits and pay were not all that bad - this is one of the only companies I have worked for that seems to be operating according to modern standards for pay in tech field. The bonus I received was laughable without any clear reasons given or even an explanation for how bonus was awarded - not the first time I have seen this so it wasn't as important to me. I'm not sure even my manager knew as she seemed really uncomfortable giving me the news, and quickly rushed me out after an encouraging ""you can only go up from here"" speech. 

Facilities - This company is really looking to impress the youngins like myself, so they have extremely nice offices in headquarter locations.  It was really weird to hear the people who had been in the Southfield office for 10 years complain to me about parking and having to drive to Detroit now when we worked in such a magnificent work space. People seemed to really hate the fact that they had to walk more than 2 blocks from a parking structure, but I considered this a plus.","Creepy/boring work environment - When I first started working in my team, I was surprised to find how awkward every meeting was. I don't think it was like this for every team, but the general mood of most of my team's interactions consistently oscillated between apathetic and inappropriately hostile. I got the immediate feeling that something was weird, but everyone was still trying to act normal in front of me, so I didn't find out the reasons until later. In a weird attempt at lightening the mood, my manager would often order people to discuss their personal vacation plans during meetings. After getting back from a vacation I had to reschedule due to my manager pressuring me to do so, she kept asking me to send her 3 of my favorite pictures without me having offered which I thought was kind of bizarre. I never did because I didn't think she needed to see my vacation pictures or show them to the entire team for that matter. It gets weirder because she then later dinged me in my performance evaluation for things that happened at work while I was on vacation. She had a poor sense of boundaries in general where she seemed to need to know about everything happening in your life to assess whether it was actually more important than your job. Another coworker after being asked about her vacation during a meeting, flatly responded that it was nice simply because she wasn't at work.

Management - After awhile, I realized that my manager had more far reaching issues with people skills. During task oriented sessions, she liked to blindside people with subtle accusations about their work without any previous communication. During my one on ones she would explain her frustration with her observation that people acted defensive during meetings, so she didn't seem to have any idea how her actions came across. When I suggested simple things like creating an agenda or making meetings more focused on individuals involved without involving everyone every time, she would acknowledge that I spoke and that's as far as it would go. It became a theme over and over again that my manager simply did not listen or retain information. If she forgot something someone had told her or the status of something, she would quickly get angry and blame a coworker who would then have to explain the last conversation on the topic for the 2nd or 3rd time. She had major trust issues and assumed that anything bad that happened was due to the ill will of some guilty party that needed to be ferreted out - she did not seem to understand or even entertain the idea that any breakdown was some fault of her own or just a crappy process (there were many). Much later she would tell me that she was working with her boss on ""being okay with being wrong"", so upper management appeared to be aware of an issue but did nothing about it.  

In summary, this type of work environment made it unbearable to be there, and I soon realized why everyone acted and seemed so defeated in their interactions. The turnover within the group was high - I had replaced someone who had left the team for similar reasons  and during my time there, someone else had transferred out of the team after having loud public arguments with the manager on the floor."

Sometimes free parking uptown. Work life balance can be fair as long as you are in the right department.  Plenty of chances to move up to middle management.  Good at drawing some really talented and fun entry level people.  Great benefits.","You hear Ally and you think modern online bank.  Unfortunately, instead of being in tune with the pulse of modern society and technology, it's a lot of show and no go.  The bank was stood up and for the most part has been left under warming lights like an old fast food burger.  The luster wears off quickly as the old crusty GMAC interests creep in.  Between the Detroit GMAC people who insist on doing things the same way that landed them in need of a rebrand to hide their shame and the Charlotte ""leaders"" who are too busy playing politics and pretending like they're still at Bank of America, things can get ugly.  While pay can be competitive it can also be terrible with even worse raise/bonus policies.  Politics is extremely heavy even at the ground level.  Middle management is ridiculously thick with drama and executive management is tired and, again, crusty old school.  While some of the pros are free parking and great primary offices, this only applies if you're in the main Detroit and Charlotte offices.  Their other Charlotte locations do not have free parking and are dated and soul sucking.  Work life balance, while as stated above can be great, can also be unrealistically bad.

Very rarely do you get positive feed back from a supervisor, any time you are asked to be talked to by a supervisor its always in question on if it is your turn to get terminated.

Supposedly open door policy, but when asked management for help or advice was told to ask someone because supervisor lacked knowledge of subject matter in the area as well as no people or leadership skills.Poor training and lack of knowledge and experience from the trainer in the subject matter was clearly visible. No talk of job expectations other than being on the phone and producing 50 minutes an hour for minimum productivity. In my area they measured us for productivity with over 25 parameters, told me to be open to change during reviews. This did not include your phone call quality reviews - another measure of your performance. Instilled a ""friendly competition"" environment for production. Did not share salary ranges, did not have an attendance policy, FMLA, cell phone use policy and other basic information like how to fill out your time card correctly. Supervisors not knowledgeable of the process they were managing and not good at managing people. Low productivity and too many side conversations to be productive in a call center environment. Physical office was a few years old and quite austere -  very authoritarian in culture. Management did not have a plan on how to deal with deficiencies and would pull the whole department off the floor for hours at a time for meetings leaving no one to answer the phones during business hours. Poor leadership on the front line - mid managers had an idea, but did not have plans or ways to execute them well. Pay was fair, but could be much better due to the high technical procedures needed for accurate information to be reviewed and captured.  Felt like you were in the Church of Scientology. More about culture than substance. Good for some, not good for others like myself who don't believe that pay for performance is really based on how much you produce or the quality of the product. Pay for performance is all about relationships. Call Center work so tethered to that phone, strict break structure."

Some of the skills you get can be used in other companies.,"Management is awful. They still act like they are managing people in the late 80s and early 90s. When you first get hired the company will try to be nice because you will be filling a position that has been vacant for months usually because someone quit unexpectedly. Afterwards you will see that there is no training or development for you whatsoever. Promotions are given to friends and relatives that posses no skills, experience or academics to back their promotions. You will be given a promotion based on company need not what your skillset is. There is no work life balance. 7-6 is expected for all title positions. You will come in on saturdays work past 7 on weekdays and answer your phone and emails on vacation and sick days. When you try to balance your life they will get mad. New employees dont get the perks that tenure employees get all the time. Recommendations and complaints are swept under the rug and if you complain too much about the unfair treatment you are pushed out. They want you to put your head and down work and not rocked the boat even if its completely unfair and ethical.  What someone else wrote about being promoted and then fired a few months later is completely true and just proves my above statement about the lack of training. From my own person experience this company and this office does not care about its employees whatsoever. The work environment is not friendly, the company is non-appreciative and the pay isnt that good.

Their benefits aren't that great, their stock way underperforms, and the leadership is mixed at best.","This company tries to be too much to too many people / organizations.  I truly did love working there, but our vision was scattered at best.  They don't fully execute on one thing before the next shiny object or idea comes their way and the leadership has taken off running to follow the shine.  Their interview process should be illegal.  The way they treat their applicants is as if they are hardened criminals.  They are a hodgepodge of different companies combined into one with each person wanting to take the company a different direction, and the communication is way less than to be desired.  The CEO is practically non existent unless there is a camera or news agency near by, and then by all means, he is there.  People don't stand up for what is right, because when they do, they just get beat down by those sitting in the one of the ivory towers.  The compensation is horrible.  They say they focus on a work life balance, but their definition of that is 24/7 work with a little bit of life scattered in along the way.  They will promise you tons of opportunities, but there is a new excuse every time as to why it can't be honored this time.  On paper their culture and values are amazing.  What a company it would be if they could read those values and know what they mean."

They promoted a 40 year old with no security background to be CISO.   That sent a pretty clear message about the value they place on experience.  In addition if you worked in Michigan instead of Charlotte, NC that was a strike against you.   If you are under 40 and want a job in Charlotte it could be a good fit.   If you want a place where they put more value in being young and articulate then it's a good place.   If you are over 50 I would advise against it.

Compared to other major companies, Ally seems to be a bit 'old fashioned' in that it does not invest in modern, sophisticated technologies that would otherwise improve the business and -- more specifically -- employee productivity. Although compensation is mostly competitive, there are certain positions for which it's compensation is below industry average. Mostly in the sales organization can this be evidenced."

The hours are great also. I work 7am -4pm but if you ever want or need to stay over an hour or so they allow it. Only work 2 Saturdays a month and one late night a week (11-8) which is cool.,The company isnt realistic. From Work group to work group they dont seem to realize that some tasks on a daily basis isnt realistic. They make it seem like youll get a bonus of $1800 every month which isnt the case at all after taxes and other things they take out if they reach that tier to get the $1800 that is. Company doesnt seem to look at the hard workers and doesnt seem open to give anyone the management experience. Thats what it seems like anyway

Benefits are competetive.

Most peers are very pleasant to work with.

Facility is nice.","Sucession planning is non-existent, and the company commits no time or effort into annual reviews. So, there is little-to-no motivation to do anything but the minimum. Most 'leaders' are wholly unqualified to be in leadership roles and provide no value to their subordinates.

This organization does a piss-poor job of providing training, which is amplified by the fact that they do not hire folks with enough experience, or the right experience. The orientation gives a brief overview of the organizational structure and the system employed, but does not prepare anyone for their job-specific duties. The one-the-job training is very informal and is usually inadequate due to the case loads.

The whole company too often operates in panic/clean-up mode due to issues stemming from 'system-limitations', incompetence, and bureaucracy. The constant fire drills leave most people involved too jaded to care.

Their idea of customer centricity is nothing but a coat of paint. Underneath, you have an army of folks with no experience in customer service, and very little desire to do anything more than avoid be reprimanded by their leaders, which they so eloquently refer to as ""coaching."" They employ entirely too many vendors, most of which are monitored ineffectively.

The pay is not commensurate to any professional career in financing. Chase, Citibank and Wells Fargo (their competition) far exceed them in salary.
- If you are not currently in management or connected to management, you will not advance far or at all. 
- Referrals are not accepted in higher grade jobs, again, unless you're a manager or an Analyst. They can get their untrained, fresh college grad in a ""higher ranking"" position over a seasoned employee easily.
- HR is in cahoots with management. Managers are not reprimanded for their harassing and discriminatory practices ever!  The ONLY time someone is let go is when there is pending litigation. So you have to retain an attorney before a formal investigation will be launched.
- If you're a person of color, you are definitely hard pressed to advance. You are targeted in very subliminal ways and your grievances to HR do nothing, but end back on your Manager's desk with no resolution. You will now be the target of their retaliatory scope.
- In 2013, The Department of Justice (CFPB) fined Ally 80 million for external discriminatory practices, imagine if they knew what went on internally. All of the unanswered complaints, the issues not addressed and the hostile environment wouldn't seem so airy as the recruiters above made the false profiles on here seem."

1087,Ally Financial,Ally is in Turmoil and not a place to go at this time,2014-03-26,3.0,Senior Manager,"Good work environment, benefits and pay.","The company is making many short term decisions that will have a lasting negative impact on operations for years.  Yes, they will see short terms gains, but many things put in place for improvement are going to fall apart as they are not willing to continue strengthening parts of the business."

1089,Ally Financial,Get some good experience and then move on quickly.,2014-03-21,3.0,Senior IT Manager,The best part of working at Ally is the compensation and benefits packages are above average.  Dollar for dollar match on the 401K up to 6% and they even kick in some occasional discretionary dollars if the company is performing well.  Their bank office in uptown Charlotte is nice.  Strong CEO.  You'll work with some great people.  Very friendly environment.  Bonus plans are nice if you're lucky enough to get one.,"Ally is a company that is in a lot of transition right now.  Their two biggest goals right now are to take the company public and pay off the remaining debt as part of TARP.  With that transition comes a lot of ciaos.  Recent significant reduction in force has put even more work on people that already have workloads they can't handle, which has caused even more people to leave.  Lots of indecision on direction at the mid - senior management level.  Promotions do happen, but they're rare.  A lot of hiring from the outside instead of promoting from within.  Very dependent on the auto industry and GM.  Any slowdown in people buying cars has significant impact on the company's performance.  

Their HQ office in Detroit Renaissance Center isn't so nice.  While access to the Ally offices is secured, the rest of the building is open to the public.  So you get your share of homeless/scary people wandering around in the building.  There is some security and police presence, but they're not always around.  Good luck getting on-boarded in a timely manner.  I've known people that have waited a month to get their PC, accounts and access all set up.  Lots of turnover in IT over the past year has created a ""blind leading the blind"" environment.  Once the company goes public this year, expect the senior leadership team to cash in and hit the road."

1109,Ally Financial,The worst place I ever worked at,2014-01-18,1.0,Claims Representative,Absolutely no pros for this company,"I currently work in the Itasca office and this is the absolute worst place I have ever worked. The management is constantly micromanaging you from watching and recording every move you make to find the smallest fault to use against you. Ally has a feeder program for kids graduating from SIU and Ferris college, so they cater to them. These are the kids that still live at home with mom and dad, and are the ones advancing in the company with promotions and raises. Like I said these are kids, just out of school with no background, no experience, and no responsibilities, but they are the ones going forward over the people that have several years experience and knowledge. It does not matter how much you go above and beyond your duties, you will not be looked at if you are not an SIU or Ferris graduate. There is constant discrimination of age, and your background. They will promise you advancement and bonuses when your interviewed, but will never receive anything unless your on the A list like I mentioned above. All the kids start out making more than you and receive a healthy bonus to work there, and of course will pass you up in promotions. I was passed up four times for promotions I applied for that I was more than qualified for by kids that still live at home with absolutely no experience or background in any field. You can't talk to anyone about your concerns they will just lie to you and make up stories. I questioned one of the operations managers about a promotion I was passed up for and more than qualified, and I was told I should look for another job if I wasn't happy. All the training goes to the kids so they are groomed for the positions they are promised and it's obvious. They do give you several PTO days when you start, but good luck trying to get any time off that you want, especially around any holiday. Don't even think about being sick, when you call in with the flu or something serious, you will get the third degree and they will try to convince you to come in even for half a day. When you are sick they force you to use a PTO day whether you want to or not, and then use that against you saying it was an unexcused absence. The only decent thing is the benefits, they are a little pricey but a lot less than you would have to pay on your own, and the coverage is great. That's the only thing keeping me from leaving until I can find a real career. There is so much more, and I can go on for hours about the negativity at this place. Apply at your own risk. If they promise you bonuses and quick advancement, think about this review. If you find something else, I would recommend to take the something else."

1112,Ally Financial,"Bias Lending and Employment Practices, Stay Far Away From Ally Financial!",2013-12-28,1.0,Human Resources Manager,Great place to work if you hope to file a discrimination suit against your employer.,"Blatant racism, sexism and homophobia are part of the employment experience.  While I worked at the firm my boss call me her ""little black boy"", I was told the Justin Bieber was a f*gg*t and that one of my co-workers was a ""fine piece of a**"".  The kicker was that I worked in HR. Clearly, the recent fines that Ally Financial has agreed to pay due to bias lending practices that over charged black customers shows that my experiences are not isolated and bias is a systemic component of the firm's culture.  Maybe an investment in a diversity program can pull this firm out of the 1970's with regards to race relations and treatment of women."

As an employee, you'll flounder wondering what is expected of you and be judged harshly for not completing whatever goals you were supposed to be accomplishing. It's up to you to figure it out. No concrete project direction; just a lot of talking about projects, as if no one truly knows what they're doing. There's zero process in place. Very few projects ever get completed because of it. It makes one wonder if the company sincerely intends to remain in business for the long run. Dead end job, no room for advancement. Amazing amount of employee turnover."
1114,Ally Financial,Ally financial is a terrible place to work,2013-12-22,1.0,Claim Representative,Insurance package is the only benefit of working for Ally. It's a little costly but great coverage and a lot less if you were paying for it out of pocket.,"Everything else about the place. They discriminate against age and where you went to school, no advancement, they cater to kids with no experience or background and no responsibilities. These kids that still live at home with mom and dad are getting raises, promotions and advancement over people that have many years experience, strong background and more than qualified to do the job. Management lies to you and denies doing this, when everyone in the entire office is complaining about it. These kids from SIU start getting groomed for their future position they are promised as soon as they are hired, while the rest of the employees take a back seat to them. The Itasca office is a complete joke, the management is constantly micromanaging you, you are always being watched and recorded, and they are always letting you know of what your not doing. You will never get a compliment from them, but will always get critisizm. If you go for an interview and your not an SIU graduate, and they promise you a bonus and advancement, don't buy into their BS. they tell all non SIU people that and don't deliver. They just need warm bodies to answer their phones. Be warned, if you have another place your thinking of working at, TAKE IT."

So you get the assets and market share of a small bank with the management overhead and process of the largest banks in the world.  Seriously, there are far too many chiefs and not enough indians here.  Well, that's not entirely true if you work in IT.

The whole organizational structure is geared toward CYA.  Nobody will ever, ever make a decision on even the most trivial thing without a powerpoint deck, 3 meetings, and an admirable attempt to get somebody else to decide instead.  If you have an idea about how to do something better or improve a process, just keep it to yourself.  Your opinion is not welcome unless you worked at BofA for your manager 3 years ago.  

Like many old-school organizations, there's a big emphasis on empire-building.  So you meet people who are hired because a manager needed to preserve his/her headcount but for whom there is no actual work.

Overly heavy process - creating a Statement of Work for a project can take 6 months due to the bureaucracy and process (inherited from GM!).  Very litte IT innovation due to this.  The job is more of a case where you need to learn the heavy process and follow it to a ""T"".  Look elsewhere if you want to be involved in cutting edge technology.  Look here if you want to be a process guru.

Above a certain level (say 2C or so), employees are lifers.  This is a glass ceiling that is very difficult to punch through if you are a career ladder climber.  Kiss the right butt and you might get lucky.
