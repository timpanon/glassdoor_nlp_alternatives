1,,Worst Experience,2022-04-16,1.0,,"Employee Insurance Benefits
Free Snacks","I would suggest people to not to join this organization as its not good for anyone career.

There is no Work life balance, no fixed working hours, always need to stretch, also the work quality is really poor, there is no such good projects going only support kind of work is happening using all 3rd party tools.

-Office location is worst, heavily crowded, dirty and most expensive. So always think thrice before joining as commute time is really high.
-This is not a good brand and still 3 months of notice however while hiring they prefer to hire people of max 1 month notice
- They have started office with 3 days working in a week and they will force to call you office every week as senior management also wants the same
- Work is really pathetic. No good projects. No learning.
- Compensation is also not so good as per current market standards and yearly appraisal is also bad.
- They do give variable once a year wih the name of bonus. They don't even know the definition of bonus.

overall this organization is only a trap....people will be good to you till your probation and then real problem will get started...so don't get stuck into it....if you will then it will be difficult for you to come out because of 3 months notice"
2,,Growing firm with natural growing pains yet a phenomenal place to work!,2022-04-12,5.0,Current Anonymous Employee,Everyone is kind and eager to help you. Benefits/Compensation package is amazing—best of its peers. Work life balance is a priority. Supportive of family lifestyles. Return to office post mask mandate has been handled amazingly with much flexibility and trust in employees’ ability to continue performing at top levels.,"There are no core competencies for performance standards which seemingly makes it challenging for an employee to forge their path for promotion.

The organization has grown substantially in a short amount of time. As a result, there are various pain points as systems and processes are very manual. If you are willing to roll up your sleeves, though, there is lots of good work to be done."

There have been outbreaks in the office but we are still expected to come in. Anti-vaxxers are allowed to work remotely. Some teams are working remotely and some have to come to work- it seems pretty arbitrary who has to come back. During quarantine we were told that there would be a new work model with more flexibility and to hang on- but what we got was 4 days in the office 1 day remote. Very little compared to the overpromising. Employees are expected to volunteer extra time to sit on 'groups' to handle issues like diversity instead of the company hiring people.

Awesome experience whenever I was working with a good group. Upper management were all respectful.","Lots of cliques, a lot of unfair treatment. Definitely a lot of favoritism and COO did not try to cover it up at all. Also, EA management structure was weird. You weren’t managed by the team you worked for but by the head of EA’s.

37,,Depressing and Toxic Workspace Culture,2021-08-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Above average compensation. CEO is amazing and well respected within the company. Corporate management and HR have done amazing job with benifits and communication during the pandemic.,Ares IT is a toxic workplace as several reviews have made clear. IT leaders have no vision and take no accountability for their failures to develop a cohesive team environment and culture. Employees approach leaders with complaints that are laughed off let alone acknowledged. Some managers are promoted not because they are good leaders but because they are specialists. These managers are not ready to lead a team but they are part of the inner circle and not held accountable for their actions that are reprehensible and can lead to psychological damage to employees. Career path and promotion criteria is highly inconsistent. There is broken trust between management and employees. There was a mass exit in IT and another one is on the horizon. Several employees have left recently and more employees will leave this toxic workplace until management reflects internally and decides to make changes at the highest level.
38,,Great place to work,2021-08-13,5.0,Vice President,Fast growing and a lot of opportunities to learn. Flexible schedule.,Not a normal 8 to 5 job. Can be challenging but expect to be recognized and rewarded if perform well.

Very little effort made by the management to address IT survey results. As if, survey results do not matter. Then, why waste everyone’s time?

Why is there a false assumption that everything is well within the org?"
40,,Great place to work both at firm and team level,2021-08-12,5.0,AVP-IT,"I wanted to counter some of the negative comments about technology team leadership and culture. Have been here for over 2 years at this point and have found the firm and team to have a great culture and collaborative environment.

Few learning opportunities to understand various business units and investment platforms"
41,,IT Culture,2021-08-10,1.0,Vice President of Technology,"Despite everything that happened in 2020, there has been tremendous amount of deal flow and growth.","The IT culture is not aligned with the company culture leading to confusion. 

Key considerations:

- new employees are hired without role clarity 
- current team members are unaware of new members joining the team 
- leadership is not coachable despite numerous attempts 
- be prepared to have leadership talk to junior staff members behind your back to create more confusion 
- IT townhalls continue to be a joke with no strong message"
42,,IT Leadership,2021-08-05,1.0,Associate Vice President,Great firm to work for.,"I did not think I would use Glassdoor for help but this is the only way to share concerns for hopefully executives to listen. There are genuine issues in IT, including a very toxic culture, complete control at the top, favoritism, no collaboration and more. No one will admit it but we are behind our peers when it comes to strategies processes and platforms in IT. The employees don’t want to leave Ares because it is a great firm. We have been patiently waiting for the feedback that we have shared with the leader and HR to be taken seriously but nothing is happening and we are very worried. We are slowly losing employees and ask that please put your employees first and stop defending and perpetuating the main problem."
43,,Good company to work for,2021-07-30,4.0,Executive Assistant,"Nice office space, pleasant environment, friendly and team oriented coworkers, adequate pay and bonuses, decent benefits, free gym on premises.",Poor human resources department. Was not happy with the way the management of the administrative staff was handled.

I am seriously reconsidering my employment status just in the short time that i have been with company. At first i did not believe the bad reviews but now i sense the very same frustrating.

Company is aggressive in growing.","Expected to be available for work and to attend meetings late into evenings, when on vacation, holidays and weekends has gotten worse since Covid. No attempt from top to push back or try to manage expectations or hours. Everything is a fire that needs immediate attention. 
Annual pay raise at mid-lower levels are not reflective of expectations or the 'phenomenal' success of the firm in recent years. 
Lack of transparency with regard to review process, compensation and bonus. Managers do not go to bat for all employees given the amount of work and time on the clock expectation, unless you are favorite. 
Aggressive firm growth means more work and resources haven't kept pace. No consideration for firmwide or cross platform coordination or enhancement evident.

Very good compensation, friendly staff and helpful people.","Everything in IT is below average, outdated and misrepresented including senior manager, people, processes and projects. When you compare the values in IT to the firm’s core values, IT managers does not follow the same.
Entrepreneurship - Having an opinion or idea in IT is discouraged. We run the same outdated systems and processes and once in a while we get to work on something cool that another team comes up with. IT rarely proposes the ideas unless it comes from the top only. The team then has to figure out lack of alignment between leaders and groups.
Meritocratic - not valued in IT. There is a culture of favoritism of the followers that do what there told. If you are a follower of the senior manager, you move up. But everyone understands it is because you did what you were told and not because you were entrepreneurial or performance. So many leaders were promoted this year. Who knows if they can make their own decisions. They will not be here next year if they do.
Collaboration - This only happens with favorites. The rest of the team does not have a voice unless surveys or post here. People with ideas different from leadership ideas are scared to have them. You will lose your job if you don’t agree. All decisions are made by one person. Projects, priorities, processes, hiring, firing are all made by one person for 250 people.
Inclusion and Diversity - There is no community or trust in IT. Most time is spent with favorites and there is no diversity. It is illusion.
We have hired new people who are working hard to make changes but won’t when so much power at the top only."

They have been proactive with communication and helped keep employees abreast, engaged, and motivated during the pandemic. Kudos!","There is a lack of strong leadership within IT group and it has led to a big gap between the company and department culture. Employee morale is very low and people engage in backchannel chatter due to frustrations with the senior management.

There have been situations with the middle managers being terminated and his direct reports not being notified of the change. In some cases it has taken multiple days for employees to realize their manager is no longer with the company. How indifferent is the management to not have the courtesy to notify the staff if their manager is let go?

There is also a lot of turnover, both voluntary or involuntary. There are cases involving individuals that are promoted and within months they are deemed as not good enough to do the jobs. Management is not a good judge of talent and their approach is very reactive every step of the way.

IT leaders talk about innovation but they are not interested in hiring proper talent to build new technology. Their idea of innovation is to have a team in India build low-tech, cheap solutions and market it as a groundbreaking achievement. Competitors of Ares are lightyears ahead of their IT capabilities."

Not sure if you can carry over any unused PTOs for the following year as the PTOs are accrued.  Unable to use any sick days until after 90 days of employment, if sick need to use PTO.

IT is and has been totally dysfunctional for last 2-3 years.  The CIO and CTO  have driven out the ALL the great people, most of the good people, and promoted the marginal people into positions - not because they are that good or trained for the job, but because they can be controlled like puppets.  

Here are some examples.  

We had a great CISO a couple years ago that took us from literally nothing to a leading security organization that could compete against any one of our peers (Blackstone, Apollo, etc.).   Everything is going great then new CTO comes in - decides he wants to do a coup and take over security (even though he has no experience being a CISO) - and boom, a Fortune 500 caliber CISO and really nice guy is gone with six months.  After he leaves, a member of the CISO's staff takes over to try to keep things going, and boom, now he's gone a year or so later.  Now the best IT engineer hands down is leaving.  No matter what  anyone says, it was all due to CTO undermining and screwing with the security team.  Now the entire team the original guy built is pretty much decimated and being run by non-security professionals in IT infrastructure - all controlled by the CTO.    Coup successful but now the company I loved is just a breach waiting to happen.

Same thing happens to our IT CFO.  Great guy (hired by the CISO actually).  He actually get's promoted up to work for the CIO/CRO.  Doing great - everyone loves him - probably the nicest guy you ever would meet -  then suddenly CIO and CTO needed a scapegoat for a colossal failure put in a finance system  and they turn on him and drive him out.  

Same thing with the app-dev management team.  Three of the original team driven out by bad, uncaring management that are unable to recognize the value of the team.  The went from ""the next leaders"" to ""out the door"" -- in fact, if you get promoted, that's probably a sign you are heading out the door.  I can't tell you how many people have gotten promoted and driven out 6 months later.

I could go on and on with examples.  People go from Gold to Dirt on the whim of the management team.   CIO/CRO is now leaving (justice?) but CTO remains.  If I'm an tech or security person, I'm staying far away from Ares until someone above them all figures out what's wrong and actually fixes it."

People rarely smile and hardly talk unless they are in a meeting.

If you enjoy and thrive on constant change, uncertainty, and can deal with a lot of confusion at times, you'll do well. If you need order, well-structured processes, clear governance, and leaders who are willing to act decisively, probably not for you.","Many key areas have no clear leadership, and the organization is really more like a handful of different businesses trying to act as one. If you're on the investment side or business development side, it's fine because all you need to do is focus on your stuff, plus the compensation culture is heavily over-weighted to those areas, and those areas have little or no operational responsibility or accountability. If you're in any of the groups that support the investment or business development side, the lack of leadership direction can be very difficult. Some sub-groups within the broad support group category have it better than others thanks to one or two good leaders trying to make a positive difference.

The comp disparity and personal biases in the rewards structure are a real problem. Carry and equity are handed out based on favorites, and many who work very hard to ensure the success of a fund or of the organization as a whole are left out. I am not close to the awards process in any way, but those who are tell me they worry about the process. I haven't seen this, but I hear those who say Yes to whatever the investment and deal teams want get the awards, and those who are saying Yes know that the harder job of eventually saying No, it's not allowed or can't be done, are not going to get rewarded."

For front office if you work past 730pm you get dinner and car rides home.

Great visibility - there's no free lunch, but if you're strategic, you work hard, you innovate to add value where people have not done before, you will get noticed and get compensated accordingly. Hours aren't bad (50-55 hours a week) but could be a function of the team/manager. This company is my third company in my career, and buy-side investing is just much better than sell-side investment banks (IBD or Capital Markets) from before.

Great brand name - Ares is primarily known as a credit shop (credit team has biggest AUM and was the first front office vertical), so huge brand name in that respect. Private Equity and Real Estate are more recent ones. Direct lending is pretty big and they generate insane fees. A lot of interactive with the Street, known as sophisticated investors. We collaborate with other big shops on deals from time to time, names like Apollo / Carlyle / Providence Partners etc.

Our AUM tends to be pretty sticky, mostly of not solely institutional money, locked up capital that sticks around trough market volatility. AUM is growing every year, which is a great sign of the shop. Believe it's in the low $90s bn now.","Political, but not more than from typical buy side investment shops.

The firm has dramatically increased its compliance, reporting and support functions in recent years and many people still work/behave with that small shop mentality when responsibilities and expectations are now elevated. There are now more layers and upward mobility may be more limited vs the past. Some managers who have risen through the ranks may not have experience leading a team. Hopefully with time, added resources and some patience, the growing pains will heal and Ares will stabilize into a well-run working environment throughout the firm."

Competitive salary, time-off (if you can get it) and bonus, nice working environment (offices are modern), catered lunch & breakfast, opportunity to travel for many and dedicated assistants to mid-level employees. Company is growing (which can also be a sign of poor planning and excessive need).","Favoritism rules. Departments do not really interact, nor is cross functioning encouraged. IT lives up to the stereotype; full of impatient know-it-all's. HR is slow and poorly managed, stuck in their offices and usually helpless; slow processes and some incompetent people; recruitment process lags. Management does not seem connected outside of their specific departments. No one is creating a culture. A lot of useless titles and mid-level management. Anyone familiar to investment firms should be prepared for poor work/life balance. As usual, if you're not making the company millions of dollars, you're just a lukewarm body that better kiss the right butt."

Taking a lunch is frowned upon.   Taking time off is frowned upon and sometimes denied.   During projects, which are always occurring, employees will be asked to cancel vacation and the company will pay you whatever you lost in canceling.  You are expected to know everything and if you ask a question of an analyst they cannot be bothered to explain to you what they have spend months researching as you should read their minds (this is the attitude)"

Ares has been an incredible working environment in that it has challenged me and stretched me in terms of handling new information and tasks, but has still been the right pace so that I can work effectively and efficiently without being pushed to my limits. It is exciting to be a part of this always growing team, and I am happy to say that every day I feel more a part of the community.","Distance both literal and figurative between offices is inconvenient, but not unmanageable (there are however opportunities to connect across departments if you act on them!)"

If you are staff/administrative, the manager (which is corporate services, for some reason) is interested in one thing - no change. If you are looking for an entry level position with room for true growth (monetarily or professionally), move on. This manager doesn't foster growth for any of the positions under their umbrella. This company is notorious for firing people on the spot (don't EVER expect an exit package). Reasons are usually 'headcount', but have seen it happen for simply being disliked by someone with enough power to pull strings. The HR onboarding is sub-par at best. They need to get organized. The HR exit process is absolutely dreadful.  Keep track of everything: your expenses, pto pay out, transit reimbursement, etc. Good luck getting paid for these things once you leave, since there is never a designated person in HR to process anything."

You just won’t have enough hours in the day for anything. If you can't ""hack-it"" then just leave. There is a certain snobbiness with the people who work here. They feel privileged and you should be considered lucky to even be working at such a prestigious company. This all stems from management. Be carful with managers in accounting and operations; don’t question them. For they know it all and have tried it all. Don’t expect any appreciation for great work either. Not here. Don’t expect to have 1 hour or even 30 minute lunches. Free lunch isn’t really free. You eat at your desk."

178,,What a joke,2014-03-01,1.0,Senior Accountant,"Ares Management's pros are as follows:

1) Free lunch, breakfast, coffee, parking in Century City, and dinner if you work pass 10pm.
2) The office is very nice and somewhat modern.
3) The back office is fairly young.","Ares Management's cons are as follows:

1) Month-end process is TERRIBLE.  There is no coherent and standardized process for the whole company.  The monthly close process goes through numerous estimates.  Once before close, once when management company needs estimates, and then another when final valuations are complete.  The month-end process takes about 1.5-2 months to complete!  
2) Managers have no idea of materiality and will give a review comment on a variance of less than a $100.  
3) There is no standardized reports or process.  This goes back to #1.  They act like they're a big shop, but operate as a small shop.  Their accounting system (Geneva) is ""industry standard"" but they don't have a standardized process across all accounting departments.
4) Work papers are crap.  Every work paper I opened at Ares had hard-coded numbers, circular references, and no form of automation.  There is useless information in the work papers and some of the tabs are in other work papers.  It's redundant.
5) No idea of efficiency or automation.  This goes back to #1 & 4.  Ares Management employees are horribly trained when it comes to evaluating processes and improving efficiency.  They have no idea on how to eliminate redundant processes.
6) Investor Relations group is terrible.  Investor Relations would sit on Investor's request for weeks and send it to other departments to complete a day before it's due.
7) Loan Servicing group is a joke.  The Loan Servicing group has no idea what they're doing and how their data entry into Geneva effects other departments downstream.  They would update loan terms and it would effect other funds who sold the asset.  When asked about it, they can't give a solid answer and the typical answer would be ""Oh this is the way it was originally done and how it has always been done."" In addition, you have to send them an example of prior entries to make sure they get it correct.  
8) Long hours.  The management team have no idea of ""industry standard"" when it comes to work life balance and working long hours.  However, this goes back to point #1, 2, and 5.  They expect employees to work long hours and even holidays.  What investment company or bank work holidays?  Anyone?  No one!
10) They had an ""innovation"" contest.  One of the innovations that won were In N Out truck Friday.  Really?  Guess who chose the winners?  Go to #14.
11) The company culture is to throw some one under the bus when things goes wrong.  Most of the meetings are made up of defensive back and forth and finger pointing.  They have no idea of working together as a cohesive team to be productive.
12) Inflated job titles.  Ares Management have different line of business/products and this leads to inflated job titles.  They have like 7 to 8 CAO/CFOs and like 10-12 Controllers.  In addition, each department/product line would have like 5 employees.  They are nothing more than managers with over-hyped job titles, so they can go home and stroke their egos.
13) The review process is a disaster.  Ares Management has a tendency to demand deliverables early and once received they would sit on the deliverables for weeks.  They would send back review comments a few days before the deadline and demand it be turnaround the next day.
14) The Executive team are a bunch of amateurs.  When they did the lift out, they had this meeting and announced it in front of the whole company.  In addition, they even announced the names of individuals who were apart of the lift out in front of the whole company during the meeting.  What high level Management team does that?  They not only did it in an unprofessional matter, but they also got the rest of the company paranoid about losing their jobs.  Decisions like these are done in close door meetings.  Terrible business move.  Furthermore, the CFO can't even speak English clearly and puts up a terrible acting job when it comes to being genuine."

183,,Be warned about taking a job in Finance or Operations,2013-07-11,1.0,,"Free food, OT if you are hourly, opportunity for promotions, office if you're at 2000 Ave of Stars","1. Low salaries even though they seem to think they are competitive.  They are not. Companies like Capital pay way more with better benefits and work life balance
2. Long hours (especially any finance job). Expect to work 12 hour days, weekends and holidays (like July 4).  Walking into the CPE office on a weekend is just like walking in during a weekday, except people are dressed down.  No work life balance.  Several black out dates surrounding month and quarter ends where you can not take a day off.
3. Little employee appreciation.  Expect the occasional good job email from CFO or invitation to bare bones happy hour in the kitchen which will end at 7pm even though you are expected to work until 8pm.
4. Work culture is every man for himself and throw people under the bus.  This attitude is rampant here, I've never seen anything like it.  Very poor intra-department understanding and communication.  No one understands what anyone else does.  You will undoubtedly get rude emails from other departments.  When something goes wrong, everyone gets their blame stick out instead of working together to solve problems.
5. High turn over which management thinks is normal - it's not.
6. Zero accountability for bad managers (and there are plenty); you will never win against a manager here, no matter how inept he/she may be.
7. Caged in with no natural sunlight if you're in CPE building.
8. Zero (not a single person in the past 5 years) mobility from back to front office.  I've never seen a firm culture that has such a strict wall up between their front office and the rest of the firm.  They used to even do separate Christmas parties for the Front Office.  
9. 20% pay cut when they 'promote' you from hourly to salary, they won't compensate you for the OT you will be losing
10. Operations departments are very cheap when it comes to ordering dinner despite them wanting you to work late hours.
11.  Executive management (CFO) has unrealistic deadlines and expectations of departments.  Orders to work holidays and weekends comes from here.  Not sure why someone who can't articulate a few grammatically coherent sentences in front of an audience is in this position.
12.  No encouragement of additional learning or expanding your skill set.  They pay for the CFA only if you pass, ridiculous.  Management probably understands there are no opportunities for a CFA here."

If you're applying for an accounting position get at least 2 weeks of audit experience somewhere else because middle management values it more than 2yrs working at Ares.
