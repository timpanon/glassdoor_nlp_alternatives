Benefits packages and pay are excellent.  
Nice pension benefit.
There are some very smart people at the company that if paired with you will learn from.  
Reasonable work life balance for most managers.
Great camaraderie in certain groups.","Saying 'no' to a business person is not advised.

If you are not part of the business units you are the 'hired help'

All roles outside of the business are 'customer service' roles to the business.  

Technology stack is not cutting edge, very fragmented and silod which makes supporting it with existing resources difficult.

Most of the technical work and solutions are outsourced.

Lack of defined career pathing.  

If you are not part of the deal side of the business and not a high level executive you cannot invest in Bain funds which creates a large divide between the deal teams and other functions.  You also cannot invest in stocks, which in my opinion does not help employees connect with the corporate function of investing."

Able to learn about diverse investment methods. Have made an effort toward more responsible investing.","For non-deal staff it is extremely difficult to move up. Because of this there is a ""know your place"" vibe. Tuition reimbursement is limited and comes with restrictive conditions for those not hired in a ""pre-B"" track. If that's what you're looking for, make sure to discuss that concretely before being hired. They hire a ton of Ivy graduates, that though they may be smart, lack common sense and self-awareness. This can be a frustrating to work with."

Otherwise I have no intentions of leaving at the moment.,Political like most companies are and a very structured promotion schedule.
