8,Bayview Asset Management,Bayview Review,2022-02-01,5.0,Facilitator,"People and Culture - The people and culture is the first pro I can think of. It's evident that people love working for Bayview due to the tenure within the firm. I think a lot of that is credited to the culture Bayview has set where people enjoy coming to work.
Flexibility - I'm not sure if there will be changes in the future to work from home but having the opportunity to work from home now is a major plus. I hope the firm continues this initiative for those who are efficient and productive at home. There is also flexibility within the team (at least my team). Management has been there for me when needed, time off/appointments/ emergency at the kids school. There has been a great deal of flexibility.
Compensation package - The pay has been great. Year end bonus as well. And the health, dental, and vision benefits are terrific! Considering the firm did not raise the prices this year is also something to note as a huge plus.",I cannot think of anything at this time. My first impressions of the company have been great so far.

The company is always looking for ways to support and contribute to the community at large. Whether its a school supply or Christmas toy drive, tutoring or mentoring at risk children; there is always an opportunity to help others.

Management allows you to work independently and is open to suggestions for improvement. Everyone is respected as an individual and professional.

As a new employee, you are eligible for three weeks of vacation; that is very generous as most companies only provide two weeks. Then upon being with the company six years, you are eligible for four weeks of vacation.","Some senior managers/employees do not consider compliance training as an obligation, and there aren't any repercussions for not completing the courses on a yearly basis.

Some routine requirements such as ongoing training assignments are not considered a priority by management so employees do not feel that they will be held accountable for their completion.

60,Bayview Asset Management,Fact Check,2019-05-17,2.0,Director,"It is a great organization for those that are starting out in their career or are new into the industry (less than 5 years).

The owner has created a very noble philanthropic cause and the company is constantly encouraging employees to get engaged in activities both internal and external with the community.

Strong benefits program

Location (Coral Gables, FL) is not too bad and there are lots of nearby choices for eating.

Co-workers are mostly made up of genuinely nice people.","The company does not provide/believe in annual merit increases (irrespective of what you may be told when recruited).  If you earn less than $70k/year, you will receive a COLA adjustment yearly but for those earning more, there are no annual increases.

It is common to be given more responsibility, including whole departments, without a promotion or raise – you’ll be told ‘we’ll take care of you with your bonus’.  In many cases they don’t and a handful of cases there was actually a drop in the bonus.  The worst scenario I was able to confirm was an individual who went from a handful of employees to a team 10x the original size.  No promotion, no raise, no increase in bonus.

One of the companies (BLS) is extremely inefficient given the current economy and as such drives down company profits that impacts everyone’s bonus even if you don’t work for BLS (or at least that’s what you’ll be told at year end).

Most of the leadership has grown up with the company (including the President, Managing Directors, and VP’s) so their only ‘real world’ perspective is what they’ve created ; they’re rarely willing to bring in executive level leadership from the outside that can provide a different opinion and in the odd times that they do, all the existing leaders rally against the ‘new comer’ with the response that ‘its not the Bayview way’.

If you are an individual with seasoned experience, you will soon find yourself in a situation where the market will provide you with a compensation plan that matches your abilities and recognizes that growth comes from those that can provide different opinions that prevent a follow the herd mentality that is so prevalent."

Stable job - Hard to get fired unless you curse someone in the face (it happened)

Easy work - Very trivial tasks and goals","Good salary - Locks you out of the market for the same role. Job titles do not represent what we do.

High tech - Learn how to turn a Ferrari into a Honda Civic in 3 easy steps. After that, you will be tasked to put the stick shift back and will have to drive it without air and only AM radio.

Stable job - Some people who could/should be fired get promoted. The “click” is untouchable.

Easy Work - At some point all that is required is answering some email, show up to the mandatory meetings and check some boxes in multiple dyslexic systems designed by clueless people (coincidently senior management)."

Whatever you are promised during the hiring process, divide it by 10, then multiply it by zero.

Nice location, close to shopping malls","Terrible Management! One of the worst management staffed companies that I've seen! There is a terrible culture of fear coming from upper management. Nothing gets accomplished and many lies are told to employees to keep them on board as long as possible until they quit.

I strongly recommend staying away from this company until hopefully something changes that makes it worthwhile...

114,Bayview Asset Management,Associate Portfolio Manager,2015-03-19,1.0,Associate Portfolio Manager,Working in the asset management with fellow co-workers who were enduring the same afflictions as you and having each other as a support system was the best that came out of such a negative environment where the concept of change was taken to levels that the human mind can't endure in a sustainable manner.,"I became extremely disgruntled with the organization due to the lack of transparency from Senior Management. The lack of respect and appreciation for the hard working asset managers made me  realize that Bayview does not offer a career path for its employees but rather a dead end job. The constant changes to squeeze every penny that they pay you for to then make drastic changes such as taking bonus pay to make you work harder for less money is the precise reason as to why I decided to depart from this abusive employee-employer relationship. This place would work you to the ground to the point where the employee feels like their mind and bodies are being cremated. Stop treating your Asset Managers like disposable objects you are steering your top talent away. The labor market is changing and it will not always be in your favor, value the good workers they are hard to come across."

I really enjoy coming to work because it is like I am hanging out with friends all day. And we are doing important work!  We help customers who have been neglected by others by moving them into an affordable mortgage payment or helping them exit the burden of a mortgage they simply cannot afford. Everyone in my are a works really hard all day long. Anyone who lacks ambition or drive is not a fit. This is not a job - this is a career.,Free health insurance is best for those who don't get sick.
