1,Bessemer Trust Company,Autocracy at it's finest.,2022-03-12,3.0,Vice President Operations,"Client, Senior management, and vendor, centric focused on core business.",Inexorable disdain for rank and file. Stated culture fully detached from experiential culture. True diversity is laughable.

3,Bessemer Trust Company,Ivy tower,2022-03-04,1.0,Vice President,"The firm promotes from within to some extent. How else can you explain how the person in charge of the investment department, that was responsible for lousy performance (check your profit sharing returns during this time) and low morale, somehow rose to the Ivy tower as CEO. Now in this role, he and his yes person have managed to ruin a once proud firm. And the employees don’t care about your so called record profits-perhaps it was a rising stock market and not your management expertise. Better to be lucky then smart.","There is absolutely no morale at the firm. Walk around and if you are lucky enough to actually see a live person you certainly won’t see them smiling. All you hear is propaganda and wokeness which no one believes whether it is colleagues at the highest level or a newer employee. The CEO would love to get rid of anyone with experience since they may question him and people have left or retired in droves even before COVID. Unfortunately for him the newer and younger employees are just as smart and see right through his nonsense. With current job openings at over 15% and great difficulties filing them, it is not a surprise that anyone left behind  are actively searching for a job or praying for a miracle that new life comes to a dormant firm."

7,Bessemer Trust Company,Really Solid Company,2022-01-18,4.0,Associate Client Advisor,Bessemer is a really solid company. Great benefits. Really good hours for the finance industry. I rarely work past 5. Everyone who I've worked with has been great and I love my boss. Cool clients,"It's a very dated, traditional company. The work feels a little repetitive. Years before you can get promoted."
8,Bessemer Trust Company,Slipping.....,2022-01-07,4.0,Manager,Still a great company with wonderful colleagues and services you can be proud of to their ultra high net worth clients.,"As time has gone on, senior management seems to have a growing tendency to be out of touch with the workplace, especially with work from home decisions and policies. A medium size company with large company mentality. Internal hiring for promotions and opportunities are scant."
9,Bessemer Trust Company,Good place to work if you are beginning your career or close to retirement,2021-12-10,3.0,Administrative Assistant,"Great benefits, people and office location. Good place to just coast if you are close to retirement age or are just starting out.",Old school type of management. Not much room for growth. Too many senior people pretending to act like they were born with a silver spoon in their mouth.

11,Bessemer Trust Company,Senior Management out of step with its employees,2021-11-01,3.0,Manager,Generous benefits. Great co-workers if you work in the right departments.,"Management is old-school and stodgy. One's experience with the Company is dependent upon the regional office you work in and who your direct manager and senior management representative is. So employees are inconsistently treated. 

Also, after returning to office after Covid, Management is emphasizing the Jamie Dimon/JPM approach of ""employees must come to the office"" despite a record 2-years of profits and productivity earned on the backs of employees who put more hours in at work while working remotely. Their justification is preservation of ""our culture"" and ""collaboration"", which no employee is buying given that most of us have always collaborated with employees all across Bessemer's 15 offices, most of whom we've never met in person, to the benefit of the Company's culture. In their effort to preserve the culture through forced in-office time, the effect so far has been destruction of employee morale, increased distrust of management and, consequently, damage to the very culture they're claiming they need in-office time to preserve."
12,Bessemer Trust Company,Great pedigree,2021-10-20,2.0,Senior Client Advisor,"Strong, well respected brand. The name opens doors.",Declaring the firm’s culture “collegial and collaborative” doesn’t make it so. The current CEO shuns client contact and seems to spend much of his time huddling with a trusted aide and creating exquisite PowerPoint slides. The result is a cult like devotion to “the message” at the expense of camaraderie and a free exchange of ideas. Fortunately the DNA of family ownership and a respected chairman preserve some of the integrity and character of the firm.

18,Bessemer Trust Company,"Old and stodgy culture, limited opportunities for growth",2021-08-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Most of my peers were smart and collaborative. The firm has generous benefits and vacation policies.,"This firm has a pervasive old school, stifling culture. Promotions are hard to come by and the firm does not implement any clear career paths for any departments or positions. You'll only get noticed if your manager is well liked by executive leadership, otherwise, no growth for you. Very limited opportunities if you are not a white man."
19,Bessemer Trust Company,Awful Culture,2021-06-17,1.0,Client Advisor,Great Investment Platform and Subject-Matter Experts,Toxic culture of micromanagement and lack of transparency with Senior Client Advisors. Job is overrun with administrative tasks and lines are blurred with regard to responsibilities. All leads to a jumbled experience for the client and overwork and stress for the advisors.

34,Bessemer Trust Company,Very ok,2020-07-08,2.0,Associate Client Advisor,"Great benefits pre-economic downturn, but that's how they try to get you to stay (and for many, it works). If you just love wealth management and client services, then you will probably like this place, even with the internal nonsense. If you get lucky and matched with one of the few great managers who are true leaders, your career will progress quickly here. But if you don't get that, you're going to stay in the same role at the same level for 5+ years. Happiness, bonus pay, and career advancement are entirely dependent on which office you're in and which manager you get.","Your success is based entirely on getting the right person in a high place to like you. So work your dad's connections and once you're in, you're set. If a manager doesn't like you, you're toast - doesn't matter how smart and hardworking you are, and you're really going to have a challenging time moving up in your career because of it.

This is an old school place that works in old school ways. White men are at the top and have a lot of leeway - they get away with acting in unprofessional, childish ways, doing less work than their better educated female colleagues, and are paid more for it. At first appearances, you might think Bessemer isn't ""so bad"" with its diversity compared to other financial institutions, but the internal structure is based on a boys' club ideal.

Lastly, senior management knows about the so-called ""bad actors"" at Bessemer. But they care more about the money those seniors bring in than they do about a toxic atmosphere and bullying (this is coming from senior managers towards their charges). Remember, though, that this varies massively by office."
35,Bessemer Trust Company,"Collegial, Family-Like Culture",2020-06-29,5.0,Other,"Bessemer is a great place to work. The company's leadership has genuine concern for all employees and takes great pride in sustaining a collegial, family-like culture. Big emphasis on employees, relationships, and family. Big push in recent years for greater innovation and flexibility.","Burden of determining the best career path or growth opportunities often is on the employee. In that space, there could be greater proactivity on part of management."

The work culture is toxic and everyone is terrified of management, you can not voice your opinions. It is like walking into Mad Men. If you are ambitious this is not the place for you, this place will bring you down and burn you out and not because of the work but because of the people who work here."
38,Bessemer Trust Company,Good place,2020-02-17,4.0,Associate Client Advisor,"Good hours and benefits, not overly aggressive culture","Low upside unless in BD, slow-moving, slow path higher"
39,Bessemer Trust Company,Survivor at its best,2020-01-14,2.0,Executive Assistant,"Decent pay, good benefits, small office, catered lunches","It became clear to me very soon that I was not fitting in. Rather, people were not taking to me. No, it wasn’t like I was making mistakes or creating more work for my team or unreliable. They simply did not feel “comfortable” with me which was odd given all the hoops I had to go through. 
As much as I hate to say this, I believe it was because of my sexuality. I casually mentioned having a partner after I was asked if I were married. Didn’t broadcast it, never brought it up, etc. From that point on, a great deal of the office ghosted me even more. This caused problems because when there was a problem, those people would go over me and to my boss. That made me look really bad. Little things. I could no longer try to win people over by being the person who was first in, last out, kept my nose to the grind and volunteered to help people. 
Later I found out that I replaced another EA who was the opposite of me. I was sorta like an ‘experiment.’ If there were any doubts left in my mind, they ended up hiring another EA who was life the one I replaced and the reception was 180 of what my reception was. I realized that was not given a proper chance. I was sort of ditched after I got hired. 
Never during my tenure was I written up, disciplined or reprimanded. I wasn’t a bad worker. They just didn’t take to me."
40,Bessemer Trust Company,Average company. Too proud over their heritage (Phipps family) and not enough opportunities for growth,2019-11-30,2.0,Vice President,"Easy access to management, so somewhat a “flat” organization. Reality is there is a very strict hierarchy. Unless you know someone, you aren’t going anywhere","Pay is average given you don’t have to build your own book of business.

Lots of nice, hard working people....only ruined by a few bad eggs that will never be fired...","Even the worst managers are never removed! An environment that you are expendable and can be thrown under the bus at any moment! I’ve never seen such a poor, self serving, passive aggressive person given a leadership position in all my career...and worst of all....never fired! Ruined the entire environment and made everything toxic. Very sad honestly...could have been great.  Just cashing a big paycheck to do nothing...all the while...being a potential compliance nightmare. Again...upper management were fully aware but did nothing."

I'm leaving soon.,"30+ years of working in the administrative field.... but far this is the worst company for admins.  Admins are viewed so poorly by this company and treated equally as bad.  I learned early on that even if its NOT your fault, its STILL your fault because your ""just an admin"".  I also learned from a NY admin ""don't ever put in overtime if you work it because its frowned upon"".

Heartless, cold company who's motto should be ""we help the rich stay rich and don't care about anything else"".  I never felt as if this company, and especially my manager, cared about or respected me in the slightest.  And HR, with the exclusion of very few, the HR department is clueless and lack any care for the employee whatsoever.  My manager was nasty to me with HR on the phone and nothing was done.  

Diversity and inclusion - what a joke."
44,Bessemer Trust Company,People are great...Management has no clue,2019-07-04,3.0,Executive Assistant,The majority of people at Bessemer are great. They are helpful and extremely friendly. The benefits are amazing!  Work/life balance is terrific.,"Diversity and inclusion does not exist. The committee who supposedly handles diversity and inclusion is made up of Caucasians...not at all helpful!

Stiff and rigid. Micro-managing. The job has to be done their way.

84,Bessemer Trust Company,Invest in the infrastructure,2016-01-15,3.0,Consultant,Very close to Grand Central at Rockefeller Center. Modern office setting; you're not sitting on top of each other. Pay as a contractor was respectable,"Glacially slow in getting any changes done. People RARELY take lunches and it's almost frowned upon if you do. Could be because the staff needs to be expanded. I've worked for companies that had 3X the number of people doing the same jobs and those employees weren't stressed or burnt out looking for a different job. No one checks your calendar before popping a meeting on it. No refrigerator, Microwave or Sink anywhere; that's a small thing to make people happy. Bussiness dress; men have to wear ties -- what year is it?"
85,Bessemer Trust Company,Assistant VP,2016-01-01,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Client centric focus and collaborative culture. Long and noble history that is over 100 years old. Solid benefits and vacation policy.,"Technology is a bit behind, a lot of time is spent on administrative tasks. Like any other financial firm, long hours. Formal culture can at times be stuffy."

CIO on MSNBC regularly, so great visibility
On the most part, I really liked my job and the people I worked with
The benefits are amazing, lots of vacation time","Technology is very behind industry norm, heavy reliance on paper vs electronic for client communications
Inconsistent promotions of employees across departments, not a ton of room for growth functionally"

89,Bessemer Trust Company,Great First Impression!,2015-11-11,5.0,Client Advisor,"I've worked at Bessemer Trust for less than a year as a Client Advisor and so far have been incredibly impressed with the company's leadership and clearly defined business model.  Senior management provides consistent visibility through corporate communication and offers more than adequate transparency for a closely held firm. 

I think the systems and processes at Bessemer are current and well documented, facilitating the training and on-boarding process for a new employee.  Ongoing education is also a clear priority for the firm, which I think is great!

In spite of clearly defined hierarchy in the organization, I've found that fellow colleagues at all levels are truly collaborative and team-oriented, leaving any egos at the door.  I feel that Bessemer has an exceptional culture, comprised of diligent employees that take pride in their work, but are also kind and normal human beings.",Nothing to note at this point.
90,Bessemer Trust Company,Associate Client Advisor,2015-10-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The people at Bessemer are amazing. There is an extremely collaborative work environment and managers doors are always open.

98,Bessemer Trust Company,IT Staff Over-worked and Under-paid,2015-02-18,2.0,Technologies,"Good benefits, smart people, work space being remodeled.","IT staff is overworked and stressed from trying to do too much without sufficient resources. Senior management wants first-class results but doesn't want to hire enough people to make that possible, so everyone works overtime without compensation.  Raises are pathetic. The knives are out so CYA,"

The company is stable and if you have kids it is a wonderful place to work.,"There is absolutely no room for advancement! Don't come here expecting to get promoted when you do well or getting paid market.  Literally someone has to die for you to get promoted.  If you don't have any kids, don't expect to get the same treatment for time off."
101,Bessemer Trust Company,Peaceful and Good People. Stodgy and Stifling Environment. Terrible HR department.,2014-06-07,2.0,Anonymous,"Marketing department is run democratically, and meetings are open and productive. The head of marketing and my supervisor were so great to work for. Exemplary. 

The cafeteria is nice and the food cost is subsidized.  

Good number of female hires. 

Decent benefits.

Nice people. Liked all my coworkers.","HR department is THE WORST I've ever worked with. Disrespectful, irresponsible and two faced when it comes to negotiations. Really appalling experience. 

Old-fashioned company for better or worse.  You really feel like you've entered a time warp where people are still living in the 90s because of their resistance to internet culture.

You'll feel like you're working in a bubble. The employees are complacent, not motivated to be innovative because there is no room for it. 

The people are nice but stuffy and uptight. This is mostly an attitude that trickles down from management."
102,Bessemer Trust Company,Changes ahead?,2014-05-20,4.0,Administrative Assistant,There have been some recent changes at the top which will hopefully bring Bessemer into the 21st century. Most people do not work long hours. Benefits are decent but were recently changed to more cost to employee. People are friendly.,"Annual salary increases are no more than a cost-of-living raise. Bonuses are small by industry standards.  You'll have to ask for a raise or promotion. Your experience at Bessemer will LARGELY depend on which group you work for and who you report to. Some people are great and others, well, not so much."
103,Bessemer Trust Company,Assistant Vice President - IT,2014-05-02,4.0,Assistant Vice President,"Generous owner and Sr management.

There are good benefits (3 weeks vacation from the start, 4 weeks by your third year).","The office is pretty dead culturally--it is very quiet, everyone does their work and goes home, no one interacts socially very much inside or outside of the office."
105,Bessemer Trust Company,Good place to start your career,2013-11-20,5.0,Tax Consultant,"Started here out of college as an intern on an hourly pay scale.  The managers (atleast mine) take you under their wing like their your students, sometimes even as if you're their own children.  Feels like a small family and everyone is supportive.  There are very few ""backstabbers"" or any of the types of people you will find in public accounting (I did an internship with the Big 4 and experienced these kinds of people).  Pay is good, work/life balance is excellent.",It seems like it takes a long time to advance.  Yearly raises could be better.

There are plenty of folks who have been around for a LONG time.  A handful of them can be stuffy and stilted.  The new management team looks good.  It will be interesting to see what happens.,It REALLY depends who you work for/with.  some of the older people can be very stuffy and formal.  The younger crowd is still quite conservative but fun and mostly well meaning.  I wish there where more minorities and women in positions of power.
