Theres a food court downstairs.,"Brookfield uses an ARCHAIC hierarchy system when it comes to their employees. Those in administration and office team receive the worst treatment - being forced to come to office during rampant numbers and offered WAY below market compensation. After losing family to covid I received zero compassion, being forced in office 5x a week, received no time off, no mental health check ups or anything of the sort. The management for administration is authoritative and keeps people stuck there with no room for growth until 3 years after initially hired. An absolute nightmare to work there. Anyone interested in administration: do NOT work there. Brookfield is a capitalist machine that does nothing for their employees, has zero diversity, and everyone is a worker robot."

Opportunity to work with senior management directly","I worked in the Private Equity Group in New York. From my experience I noticed that although the group overall managed $4 billion the New York team has failed to do a major deal in the last 3+ years. In fact most of the major deals seem to happen outside of New York. This is largely because the New York team is led by ineffective leaders at the VP to MP level, which lack sourcing and execution experience. Additionally, the VP level employees typically run the deals and are generally younger employees in their late-twenties, who treat the juniors like they are analysts in banking. Expect long hours, weekend work (reporting in at 9AM on some days) and limited recognition. To top it all of Brookfield pays ~30% below market. If you are looking to get real deal experience I would recommend looking elsewhere.

Some of the most intelligent and personable individuals I've ever met are employed by this company.

The office and surrounding location is so beautiful it's almost unbelievable. The futuristic all-white, brightly lit office keeps you upbeat even are your groggiest days. The setting on the Hudson with the Statue of Liberty in clear view allows for some pleasant daydreaming when your brain needs a much deserved break. There is also a 24 hour Rite Aid located within the building, which has been clutch so many nights when working late and have no other stores open in the area.

There is tremendous opportunity for advancement within the company, as management works to keep their talented employees. There is always a new challenge to be tackled and individuals willing to teach as long as you're willing to learn.","For every rockstar employee that you meet here, there are at least two stiffs with an inflated sense of self-worth that you hope you never have to work with. It creates a true team-specfic company culture, rather than a general one.

The hours can be a drag, although steps are being taken to mitigate some of this through more efficient processes. Although management is very flexible with time off when requested, there is still a feeling of no true work/life balance due to the sheer volume of work and many late nights needed to complete it.

The compensation is below the industry standard in New York.

The open environment and see-through glass conference rooms, although helpful when it comes to exchange of information, leads to too much unwarranted, noise, nosiness, and butting in from those around you.

Inefficient processes and too many layers of review for some of the simplest of tasks."

222,Brookfield Asset Management,Micromanagement Capital of my Career,2013-09-06,2.0,Accountant,"-Learned a ton, this is one thing I will give them during my time there.
-Incredibly smart people, perhaps the smartest I have worked with, and they know it.  
-Nice location at World Financial, but then again it could be better since they own the freaking complex.
-Good starting salary, expect it to last a few years.","-No work-life balance whatsover if you would like to succeed at your job. 14 hour days, weekends, etc.
-Management acts as if they are paying you out of their own pocket.  My entire team was treated like children despite dedicating our lives to the job.  
-Zero privacy: open work envireonment is the most intrusive I have ever encountered.  The CFO of one of their public companies was sitting in a cube, nuff said.
-Raises/bonuses/promotions are treated like you are gaining the keys to the kingdom.  Like the old saying, if you are not on the inside, you are on the outside.  Better make a friend of a key executive, or you will be left out in the cold.  
-If you never open your mouth or express an opinion, you will be their ideal junior employee."

226,Brookfield Asset Management,Trade Support Associate,2013-03-11,3.0,Trade Support,"Some great coworkers  across several internal teams.
Great work life balance - rarely work more than 40.","Poor leadership, lots of politics with little results.
Below average pay.
Office has clique's like a school cafeteria, this leads to terrible communication.
No sense of ownership for anyone's work ethics or decision making.
Office is mostly AVP, VP and Directors - about 70% of employes have this sort of title (including the entire front office which has no associate on the team). This creates inflated egos.
Wasteful - money only goes to misguided projects and old leadership."
