Create a short presentation on a paper board to pitch a business case you were given How do you learn?

19,,Associate,2019-12-30,4.0,Associate,"Great learning experience, lots of hard work","Difficult culture, some difficult personalities."
20,,Entrepreneurial Culture - Smart Colleagues,2019-12-16,5.0,CCM,"Great company that gives its employees plenty of scope to grow if they create the right opportunities for themselves and help the business to grow / improve.  There is a high bar for work product. Culture of 'getting things done'.  The company is in a growth phase, which could lead to even more opportunities for advancement in years to come.",Lean teams often lead to less-than-ideal work-life balance. Work satisfaction can depend on the group you are in. Compensation is not as good as other reviews suggest.
21,,Vice President,2019-12-08,5.0,Vice President,Great company to work for an aspiring individual,Growth is slower than usual
22,,"Humble, hard-working culture",2019-10-13,5.0,Managing Director,"Senior leaders have all been here forever. They are approachable, helpful, and very down to earth. It's a dynamic environment to work in with meaningful long-term opportunities.","The very entrepreneurial environment isn't right for everyone, especially people who come from bigger firms and want to manage work rather than do it themselves."
23,,Summer Analyst,2019-09-16,5.0,Summer Analyst,Super good environment. Everyone is friendly.,"No cons, the hours are also better than for IB"
24,,Operations,2018-12-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Compensation is above average, firm pays health care no deduction from paycheck
People are generally friendly","Cannot trade stocks.
You are expected to go above and beyond, long hours could be stressful.  
Most grunt work employees are young and hence lack maturity.   
IT/infrastructure is lacking due to the size and age of the firm compared to bigger more established institution, which leads to additional effort by employee. You are required to learn some programming to do your daily work even if you have no prior background.  General culture is ""here is the work, figure out how to do it"".  
Good amount of office politics, cronyism. 
In summary, no work life balance.  Not exactly family friendly.  Lack of support often makes you feel helpless.  You go home not knowing your work is done or not.  You will feel guilty about leaving at 8pm.  Long term growth seems limited. Perfect place for the young, ambitious, workaholic, hungry for money."
25,,Ham and Cheese for days,2018-11-02,3.0,Assistant,The fridge stayed fully stocked,too much ham and cheese
26,,Heads in the clouds,2018-08-22,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great benefits, some upper management are excellent at their work and you will learn from all founders except CFO.","There was a period where they were expanding and the CFO hired a friend as a CIO and there were kickbacks from vendors going to them, and the two treated their staffs horribly."
27,,Associate Position,2018-03-26,3.0,Associate,Paid very well around bonus time,Long hours lead to frustrating work/life balance
28,,The worst place I’ve ever worked at,2017-12-15,2.0,Analyst,"Comp is okay, but you can make same $$$ elsewhere while having better work/life balance, nicer people around you and healthier work environment","Carefully read other reviews and notice a common theme - back office is pretty much run by IT department, run extremely poorly. Your input won't be heard or appreciated. Too many insecure types with inflated sense of self. Some are smart, some not so much. Blatant nepotism. Bully behavior is ignored by HR. People are generally miserable and motivated by year end bonuses only. There is simply nothing else to be excited about. Monthly pizzas don't make up for the utter lack of culture. Wouldn't recommend to a friend."
29,,"Great Company, Avoid IT Department!!!",2017-11-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"First, let me be completely honest and say that this is a great company to work for. Benefits are incredible and I believe the company truly cares about their people (most departments anyway). I have had interactions with C-Level and above colleagues and almost all have been wonderful.

There are some very smart developers here.
As well, many smart operations personnel as well.
To be fair, I think most of the company should get praise for what it's done and continues to do. 
Clear vision and execution strategy.
A company that truly cares that his people are getting the best benefits they can provide from day 1.","The cons I list, as well as any ratings that are not a 5 star, are directed towards ratings of one particular area, not the company itself. This area is a chaotic mess when it comes to developing and delivering their software. There is no process, no discipline, and attempts to work with them from outside departments such as the one I was in was terrible. Someone wrote about a previous interview where a manager had a limp handshake and was too busy reading his emails to pay attention. He also noted that the group seemed without discipline and chaotic. Boy was he ever spot on. I've even heard a manager ask why one developer was talking to ops ""without adult supervision"". I have personally witnessed in meetings where both managers treated everyone very condescending, as though they were not worthy of their time. I've heard people called ""stupid"", and always told they ""don't get it"". Strange how so many folks ""don't get it"", could it be the person relaying the message is the problem?

Total lack of discipline.
Software delivery deadlines are constantly missed.
People are forced to use a system that is under-performing, and their input is completely disregarded.
It is very uncommon to hear positivity coming from leadership in the development arena. Public negativity runs rampant.
I've also been witness to people voicing honest concerns only to ""disappear"" soon thereafter. Although no one will admit to it for obvious reasons, retaliation runs amock.

Millions of dollars are being wasted on what should be (and intent was very much is) a data warehouse that is unsustainable. Constant fitting of square pegs into round holes just because of a lack of any vision other than one persons."
30,,Bad managers,2017-10-19,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Cerberus has decent pay scales,Culture from the top down is one where condescension and lack of development is commonplace and accepted.
31,,VP,2017-05-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Clever people in a global business that has been and continues to grow and can most certainly be considered to be one of the best in its class.,"The culture can sometimes lend itself to long hours and extremely hard work, which can over time lead to increased stress."

35,,Finance,2015-09-08,4.0,New York,Decent Salary and Benefits and company is small enough where you can learn many different duties and aspects of private equity and hedge fund and other finance and investment areas.,"Really no cons, the normal office politics, the normal amount of good people, busy people, annoying people, hard working people. If you find out your job is too easy, start asking for more work and complicated tasks. Be proactive."
36,,Best job I've worked (but might not be for everyone),2015-02-06,5.0,Interim Analyst,"-Work is very engaging and changes every day
-Opportunity to meet and work with professionals across the real estate spectrum
-Team is extremely supportive and pushes you to learn from mistakes rather than blaming you for them
-Cerberus is highly acquisitive in this space (European Real Estate) so it's a phenomenal place to gain experience","-Long working hours; I didn't mind but other people might find it exhausting
-Cerberus is very paper dependent compared to its competitors, everything needs to be printed prior to meetings which can take a while to do"

More worker's and hours are needed to accomplish the unreasonable daily tasks. 
It is not human nature for one to work at their max on a daily basis. This can be very debilitating after time. Supervisory managers are treated like slaves. Constant treat of losing ones job. Must be available 24/7. Evening on one's day off as well as Vacation time. Job doesn't pay enough we're not six figure office mgrs. We do the grunt work.  No time to manage the impossible. So please do sell sell us you're horrible to work for worse than svu."
