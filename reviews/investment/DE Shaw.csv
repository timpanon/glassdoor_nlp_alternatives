Overall a  vibrant bunch of intelligent and good people. the London office could have benefited from less interference from the US team but overall a pretty solid company.,A lot of hype from David Shaw and his expertise in the field. An incompetent London HR team and a hierarchy that would make your eyes water.... despite the collegial environment one is lead to believe exists.

The culture rewards asking questions and thinking rigorously, and collaboration is common. Not a lot of hierarchy compared to many other firms. Stable and low turnover. Pay is good.","Stability and low turnover mean that it's probably harder to move up and make a lot of money relative to some other places. Another way to look at that is that you need to be really impressive to meaningfully progress here. Also, there isn't necessarily a set path for progressing, and self motivation is probably more important here than at larger institutions with predefined tracks."

-Lenient work hours - As a perpetual night owl, the flexibility here has been a godsend. Managers tend to be very understanding with PTO and working from home.
-Amazing benefits - They care about taking care of their employees. Not only are there intellectual talks onsite, museum memberships, an onsite gym and fitness reimbursements, ergonomic assessments, loaded pantries, nap pods, incredible swag, etc. BUT the folks in HC are incredibly attentive and accommodating.

87,,Not a good place,2015-06-12,1.0,Quantitative Analyst,"* Smart people.

* Food surprises.

* Nice snacks in the office.

* Interesting work.

* Good perks.","* Cut throat atmosphere. It's dog eat dog. Managers and their direct reports are competing for a slice of the same pie. Search for ""I actually never really intended to stay in finance, it was just the only real job I could get with my number theory skills."" using your favorite search engine.

* Extremely high pay inequality. Entry quants and developers are making $200-250K while MDs are making $5-10M and the head honcho is making $50-100M. Meanwhile the original founder is raking in $500M+ and doesn't even show up to work any more.

* Pay is opaque. You'll get a raise, you won't know why. Your pay will get cut, you won't know why. Bonuses given only annually.

* Failure rate of projects is extremely high (90%+).

* Nobody here knows how to manage well. You'll be micromanaged until you need to see a shrink. Stifling atmosphere.

* All the best people have left owing to the above issues. Some groups have attrition as high as 30% / year. People leaving both from the top and the bottom.

* Company's best days are behind it.

* Amount of hard work required to be ""successful"" is insane these days. All the low hanging fruit has been eaten. You will have to achieve several Einsteins in a row to make money here.

* Your success depends on not only how hard you work, but mostly on which projects get assigned to you. Projects vary widely in their chances of success and their difficulty level. If you get difficult, unlikely to succeed projects, you won't be successful. You will then be perceived as being stupid. This will lead to you not getting good projects in the future. The vicious death spiral will lead to you quitting. The people running the show don't want to understand this because they enjoy their feeling of superiority for having succeeded and being able to call you a stupid failure.

* For developers - ancient tech stack. They laugh at the idea of contributing to the open source community. They are insular, outdated, and way behind the times. You will get tired of it quickly.

* Laptops only by special request. You'll be chained to an aging Dell desktop machine running an old version of Windows.

* Secretive. Little collaboration. Sharing of work and results limited to tiny peer groups (2-5 people).

* Slippery recruiting. ""Sell days"" in which you'll be lied to in the face until you join."
