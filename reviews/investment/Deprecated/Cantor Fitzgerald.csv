136,Cantor Fitzgerald,toxic and diseased,2019-08-29,1.0,Managing Director,comp till they figure out a way to nickle and dime you.,"Excluding compensation when you produce there are no pros. Healthcare is basically paid for by you and there is ZERO 401K match. Cantor has a subpar high fee charging dealer managing 401K (Brinker Capital) for its employees…SHAMEFUL!  It would not surprise me to find out that Cantor benefits from this arrangement with Brinker.  Unfortunately, once you produce and make money for Cantor they look for ways to allocate normal corporate expenses back to you. Making matters worse everyone has a different compensation deal. Even if you were the primary reason an account was producing managers will attempt to reassign those accounts with people who negotiated a lower payout. This is the essence of what Cantor represents and why their bucket shop reputation is appropriate. Even Charity day has its limits and is considered a farce internally since it’s orchestrated as a PR stunt to improve their image. Lately, they’ve tried to bring in people from bigger and more reputable primary dealers. Most of these people were either out of work or were pushed out of their old firms, their only stand out accomplishments are the deals they negotiated in order to work at Cantor. Anshu Jain is one of them, this man almost single handily put Deutsche Bank out of business with his shenanigans. To this day, it’s still questionable whether DB will survive after Anshu was co-CEO.  Once considered a Prince, now he works under the worst of the worst. Stay away from this place… starting from the top it is a toxic and diseased environment.  I can not imagine anyone giving Cantor a positive review... makes me question who they are and what they did or what they received to write it. My advice: talk to people who once worked there and you will get the truth.  However, this may pose difficulty since many who leave and want their well deserved deferred compensation are forced to sign agreements not to say disparaging remarks. Like I said… bad to the very core."

Lack of transparency - A lot of decisions are made behind closed doors, so there is mystery surrounding why things are done the way they are.  Certain people are selected to succeed  without any clear promotion structure in place, so everyone else is left behind without a sense of what their future will be.

They are one of the few firms on the street to still invest money in company wide outings (e.g., legitimate Christmas party, summer trip to Magic Mountain, Shakespeare in the Park)","The benefits are subpar - I've never paid so much in premiums and received so little in return. There is no 401k matching. 

***IMPORTANT*** In terms of year end bonuses, the firm has a sliding scale (based off how much you make) and uses it to determine how much of your total compensation should be paid in partnership units. It is VERY IMPORTANT to know beforehand that these partnership units are subject to vesting schedules that are not market standard. There is a four year vesting schedule but that doesn't mean you can take your vested portion with you when you leave. If you are a ""good leaver"" (i.e., not going to a competitor, leaving the industry, etc.) your vested portion will be distributed over an additional four year period - effectively making it an eight year vesting schedule. If you aren't a ""good leaver"" you don't get to take the vested portion with you when you go. What that vested portion amounts to is anyone's guess. Ultimately it is up to HWL to decide. You do get paid a dividend (quarterly) on your pship units while you are employed, which is nice. 

The entire firm is an ""eat what you kill"" environment. HWL has individual contracts with each business/team head and at the end of the year HWL takes the  overhead costs and his cut and then gives the business/team head the rest. The upside of this is that someone with an enterprising spirit can do quite well for themselves BUT it means that there is very little infrastructure (with the exception of Legal, which reigns supreme) because no one wants to pay for it or make the investment. They have figured out how to make a lot of money for HWL and if you're lucky and play along, you'll make some money too - you just have to get in line and kiss the ring. 

They do an annual charity fundraiser on the anniversary of 9/11 and employees are expected to contribute one day's salary to the foundation. There is absolutely zero transparency into where the money goes and a lot of the charitable partners get frustrated trying to actually get their money."

Cantor recruits team-oriented professionals who are serious  about meeting challenges in the financial markets and setting the pace of technological innovation. The corporate culture of the firm is a major reason I enjoy working with my team. They play a crucial role in the growth of Cantor Fitzgerald by maintaining a positive exposure in the media.  
 
Employees at Cantor must embody the willingness to  make a difference  in the world with enthusiastic charity work to promote the welfare of others by donating time to elevate awareness  and raise a multitude money for numerous charities through the Cantor Relief Fund.  After the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center, Cantor lost over 600 employees and since then a positive attitude is a common thread that unites the people who work here.
 
I am extremely fortunate to work with a team, who has contributed to my professional development as I begin my career.","Initially, I was hired as an intern for 30 days to assist the marketing team with Cantor/BGC Partners annual charity day.  My work and dedication with the BGC team lead to an extension of my internship which led to a temp position at Cantor Fitzgerald. I met some challenges making the transition to an administrative assistant position, covering the for an employee who resigned. I needed to familiarize myself with the proper procedures and various systems at a time when there was a lot of activity going on and the team was busy with other projects. I feel I have rose to the occasion and did an excellent job figuring out what I could on my own without being a burden to my co-workers.

They do not give bonus in cash nor stock options.  HR is of no use. A lot of turn over. only recruit from outside of the company.
306,Cantor Fitzgerald,"Entrepreneurial sink-or-swim culture, great place to learn if you are self-motivated",2013-11-04,5.0,Vice President,"Cantor is a medium/small sized firm compared to other bulge bracket firms, with a very entrepreneurial 'sink-or-swim' culture.  As a mid-level employee, you have a lot of exposure to senior management, majority of whom are extremely smart, driven, and well-connected professionals.  The amount of diverse experience I have accumulated over the last 1.5 years has kept me intellectually and professionally challenged - every day is different! 

The firm is well-known in the U.S., and proactively looking for opportunities to go organically and through acquisition, internationally and across fixed income, equities and investment banking. 

The CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Shawn Matthews, is well-liked and respected in the industry, and within the firm.  There are so many long-term (10+ year) employees who genuinely enjoy working with him.","There are some long hours, but very similar to other investment banks (according to friends in the industry).  You have to be extremely self-motivated to be able to survive here. This is NOT a firm where lazies can sit around, leave at 5PM and do minimal work while collecting a big bonus.  There is little to no “fat”, but it means every person has more responsibility than counterparts at other firms."
307,Cantor Fitzgerald,Analyst,2013-10-04,3.0,,Friendly and on-time in the interview.  The process seemed very professional.,Gave little indication of where you stood in the interview process.  It seemed like a very close-knit group suspicious of its interviewees.

They also provide great opportunities for employees to get involved in volunteer projects and give back to the community. Team work is encouraged and in many departments, the staff is more like a family than a group of colleagues. It's really a joy to work at Cantor.","At times, the volume of work can become overwhelming. Since team work is encouraged, asking for help is the best way to deal with overwhelming work loads."
310,Cantor Fitzgerald,"Extremely dysfunctional, poor management and lack of morals",2013-07-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you're able to survive and thrive at Cantor, it'll be a cakewalk for you elsewhere.  Also, the lack of accountability of management allows the lazies to get by on little work (with corresponding little pay).",Too many to list them all.  It starts with a culture of mistrust and managerial fingerprinting.  This creates a silo effect and leads to a lack of collaboration and fear.  This creates employees that are very unsatisfied.

Many really nice people in most of the departments that are appreciative and/or helpful. The company stands out on your resume as most recruiters know if you can work here, you can work anywhere!","From senior vice presidents through upper exec levels, you will find some of the poorest, un-schooled and untrained managers ever. They don't appreciate even the greatest accomplishments by their best subordinates and cover their mistakes by throwing them under the bus. The ""blame game"" is constantly in operation here where upper management thrives by rotating employees beneath them in and out of the door to cover their own mistakes. 
Regardless of your position, unless you are senior management or partner, the pay is abysmal and you are expected to be on the clock 24/7 with compensation that would barely cover a trip to the supermarket. Raises do not exist regardless of how well you perform or how much money you save the firm. The least infraction or mistake will get you chewed out bitterly or fired but no accomplishments of any project great or small will reap rewards of any kind!"
316,Cantor Fitzgerald,Good company,2013-03-16,4.0,Qauntitative Analyst,"A lot of talented people work here.
