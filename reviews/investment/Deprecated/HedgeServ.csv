11,HedgeServ,Beware fake reviews,2022-03-03,1.0,Systems Analyst,"If you sort the reviews by most recent, you'll notice a lot of short, vague, positive reviews. One of them is the same review posted twice. The reviews over the last ten months all rave about things that the reviews dated earlier complain about. I wonder if there's a correlation there.","A recent review called Hedgeserv a great investment bank to work for. Hedgeserv isn't a bank (investment or otherwise); it's a fund administrator, and if you don't know the difference you don't work in this field. Either the person doesn't know what kind of company they work for or it's a plant review. I wonder which is more likely.

Someone else said there were no signs of favoritism. This company thrives on favoritism; if you're on JPK's good list, the world is your oyster (until something goes wrong, which is every day). If you're not, keep an updated resume handy. You'll be fighting for your job every day, and it's a losing battle.

This place had a 2.8 star rating not that long ago. Now it's at 4.1 and climbing thanks to these click farm reviews. Trust me, they haven't suddenly gotten infinitely better to work for. They're still closer to a 2.8. Read the reviews yourself, carefully. Be the analytical genius the company claims to always be looking for and make your own decisions."

Plus, there are experienced individuals who sit in on the hands-on portions of the program to help each individual with any questions. It is true that if someone does not grasp the concepts to the company's high standards, then they probably won’t last long. My personal team has been there for me whenever I had questions - the manager even sits down with me to discuss any questions (so I don't know why people say managers don't care). I've only been here for a few months, but I feel welcomed and a part of this team. The internal promotion opportunities are ENDLESS. I've talked to people here that have been here 5+ years who are now seniors/team leads/managers - that gives me great hope for my future here. Also, benefits are top notch.","You know beforehand that hours are LONG.

28,HedgeServ,Always improving,2022-01-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Fast-paced growth oriented company that is improving everyday. Never run out of new projects to work on.,Too much focus on short-term goals and deliverables.
29,HedgeServ,Great place to learn and gain valuable experience,2022-01-05,5.0,Investor Services Supervisor,"HedgeServ has great company culture. When in the office it is very relaxed and everyone is very approachable and willing to help you in any way they can.

As for the structure, the break down into smaller teams within Investor Services really helps you learn and grow, as you work right alongside you manager and have a lot of access to the director of the team. The structure is also beneficial from a growth standpoint, as your manager and director both see the work you are doing every day and see your improvements in real time. The company is big on promoting from within. 

Pay at HedgeServ is also very fair. If you show improvement and growth they do not hold back on compensating you for your hard work. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my time working at HedgeServ and can't say enough good things about the company and the people who work there. I highly recommend HedgeServ for anyone interested in the financial services industry.",Hours can be long at times but management does a great job of taking note of the teams that are consistently working longer hours and try to find solutions.

47,HedgeServ,Top Notch Asset Management Company,2021-02-18,5.0,Supervisor,"Culture
The culture at HedgeServ is phenomenal because no one takes themselves too seriously. We have a casual dress code in the office and a fridge just for beer. It’s a work hard, play hard mentality that suits me perfectly.

Management
The guys in management are awesome. They want to see you succeed, so if you put in the work and go above and beyond, you’ll get everything that’s coming to you in commas and zeroes on your paycheck.

Growth
I haven’t been with the company for very long so I can’t speak to this from personal experience, but I know that they only promote from within and they’re big on developing existing talent, so I’m looking forward to moving up in the ranks.

Pay/Benefits
The pay is phenomenal, especially if you’re good at what you do. Make yourself indispensable and you can write your own ticket. Obviously, full benefits.

Overall 
One of the best asset management companies you can work for in the city, and that’s saying something!","The workload is intense, but I’ve never worked at an asset management company where that wasn’t the case. If you can’t handle long, stressful days you’re in the wrong industry."

It's a culture of fear that pretends to be open.  Managers scream obscenities in meetings.  It's not a healthy place to be or grow in your career.

Their ways of developing applications are pretty dated. Requirements are anybody's guess.

The slew of positive reviews came after management was worried about their Glassdoor rating so take those with a grain of salt."
51,HedgeServ,Team environment,2020-12-10,5.0,Currently Unemployed,If you’re a hard worker and a team player than this is the ideal work environment.

52,HedgeServ,A great place to work,2020-11-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,More than willing to try out new methodologies to deliver better results for their clients. At HedgeServ an entrepreneurial mindset will get you far. Co-workers are very encouraging and supportive. Management provides firm guidance to keep you on track. A good job overall.,"Currently in that awkward phase of growth where they’re not a startup, but not exactly a massive corporation. You could say they’re going through all the growing pains that a company in this position typically experiences."
53,HedgeServ,Good compensation,2020-10-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The compensation is exceptional. That’s one of the first things you’ll notice about this company. The next is how fast-paced the work environment is. Don’t apply if you’re allergic to hard work. You’ll also notice that the people you’re working alongside are incredibly smart. Probably smarter than you are. The advantage to that is that over time some of those smarts may eventually rub off on you.,Improving communication amongst teams needs to be a priority.

Unchecked autocratic managers.  Hire&fire culture. Disconnected senior directors. Every man for himself A lot of people still trying to leave. A few sneaky coworkers. Unreliable HR. Unprofessional behaviors is acceptable here (using caustic and foul language in emails and speech). Brown nose or perish. Ego fest. Learning is limited. Work can be in silo.
57,HedgeServ,Growing and headed in the right direction,2020-01-18,4.0,Systems Engineer,The people; super smart and enjoyable to work with.  Tons of tech and always evolving to latest and greatest.,Priority shifting occurs often and incurs longer project durations.
58,HedgeServ,Toxic leadership ruins the company and its people,2020-01-07,1.0,Technology,"- Salary was good, but not as good as could be found at larger companies or actual hedge funds
- Health insurance was amazing, but didn't include Vision
- You'll learn a ton about how not to run a business or department
- Any time the Chairman goes on vacation
- The freedom you'll feel after you leave","The entire company turns upon the whims of its mercurial Founder/Chairman. He verbally abuses his managers and staff as a matter of course. If not for him, this organization would have already achieved greatness.

Do not approach this organization unless you've exhausted all other options for employment. The culture is truly toxic, and everyone who joins is sucked into the mess given time. This toxicity starts from the top, and is reinforced by nepotism and backstabbing based in fear.

No long-term strategy survives in this organization. Smart, driven people are paid a lot of money to come here, and many find themselves trapped by their paychecks, their talents wasted. Don't become one of them."
59,HedgeServ,Terrible is a severe understatement,2019-09-18,1.0,Systems Engineer,The money was the best thing about this job. And I'm only putting that here because there's a requirement for a pro.,"Almost every company is fairly bad at giving their people a proper work/life balance. Hedgeserv takes it to an extreme. 

Mother just died? That's rough. When are you coming back to work?

Wife is sick and needs surgery so you want to take time off? You're fired. No explanation other than ""this isn't working out"". 

(These are not an exaggerations, either. This happened.)

Management doesn't care about you. They don't hide it. They don't sugarcoat it. They'll tell you flat out they don't care if you've worked fourteen hour days for weeks plus weekends. But they sure will care if you want a comp day or two to cover that. How dare you need time away from work?

The positive reviews on here are plants designed to bring up the company's rating because it's been an anchor around bringing new people in. This isn't an exaggeration either. Numerous recruiters highlighted Hedgeserv's Glassdoor rating as a problem for the company because numerous candidates saw it and suddenly declined interviews and offers. Certain individuals have taken it on themselves to make this place seem like less of a trainwreck. But there isn't enough lipstick to put on this particular pig to make it appealing."
60,HedgeServ,HedgeServ is a great place to work.,2019-08-27,5.0,Operations,"HedgeServ is a great place to work. It provides employees with the opportunity to learn and grow from some of the industry’s finest professionals.

61,HedgeServ,Stay away,2019-08-17,1.0,Middle Office Operations,You will do very well here if you have friends or family in high places,"If you do not have friends or family in high places, it's clear that you are not a priority and any good work that you do will lead to you being viewed as a threat. The majority of the people calling the shots are more concerned with protecting their status and fanning their ego than with helping the people they manage succeed. The office politics cause morale to plummet and people are often verbally challenged on the floor which is very uncomfortable."
62,HedgeServ,Toxic Culture and Horrible Management,2019-06-13,1.0,Software Engineer,Pretty good pay and benefits,"Toxic culture. If the CEO likes you, you will do well. Unfortunately what the CEO likes is people he thinks are loyal and who operate as his trusted moles (even though the information they are providing is false or out of context but that makes them look good). Being a good software engineer has nothing to do with it. The people that have done well in  engineering and product are the back stabbers. They will do and say anything to look good to the CEO. The whole culture is divisive where everyone is suspicious of everyone else, and for good reason. It's like a really bad game of survivor. Tempers flare regularly and the CEO can be heard screaming around the office and slamming doors. Most of the reviews on this site are written by the management team and they only started doing that after people weren't interested in working there because of bad glass-door reviews. It is also a good-old-boy culture. I have never felt like an equal due to my ethnicity."
63,HedgeServ,Great learning careful with management,2019-03-04,1.0,Developer,"Willingness to experiment with technology, agile methodologies and management styles. Management has great open door policy.","If sales are low, letting go of 35% of the staff by dividing those who stay into Room A and those who leave in Room B. The ones in Room A will then wait until the purge ends and then the owner will come and give a mea culpa and reduce your pay. This has happened 3 times.

Oddly the owner does not expect employees from the first purge to still be around so he mentions that this is something rare that happens when it isn't.

The company has many people from State Street/IFS that were friends with the owner. This known in the company as ""the circle"".

The owner also has family members in many odd positions in the company, so be careful with what is said."
64,HedgeServ,Corrupt and shady as hell,2019-02-08,1.0,Engineer,"Excellent at lying. They're so good at it they've got their clients convinced they know what they're doing. Random outages happen because senior people don't understand how their applications work. They don't understand how their vendor's applications work, either. 

Okay, one pro? As others have mentioned, compensation is above average. Spend six months here and you'll understand why. They consider it a down payment on your soul.","Half of the managers are punching above their weight class. Decisions are made based on nepotism and ego. Clients have suffered for, and been lied to, as a result of egos. Transparency is the motto but not the rule. The really talented folks have been beaten and cowed into going with the flow and no longer believe there are places where toxic behavior isn’t the norm. The firm considers work/life balance to be: your work is your life, everything else is secondary. 

If you decided to accept a job here and you're asked to fill out an anonymous evaluation of your manager, don't. There's at least one sawed off boss so insecure in his position that he will call subordinates into a conference room and demand to know who wrote negative reviews of his performance. And if you point out that it's an anonymous survey, he'll threaten to fire you.

Sound like an ideal place to work?"
65,HedgeServ,Technically brilliant people make terrible managers,2018-08-20,1.0,Systems Engineer,A lot of very smart people who are technically brilliant work at HedgeServ. Pay is higher than the average salary because there are no bonuses.,"Smart people are the norm here. Unfortunately some of these smart people think they’re managers and leaders. Contrary to their beliefs, they aren’t. Knowing how these people operate, I’d say avoid working here.

Mileage may vary, of course. You may find this is the right environment for you.

Considering the toxic nature of the place, though, I'd advise against it. Of course, the people I’m referring to have their own ideas as to how to make this place work. Creating a toxic atmosphere is just one of their specialities. Killing the notion of a work/life balance is another.

It's unfortunate when people so technically skilled and so poorly equipped to manage others are put in charge. Still, this is the direction the company is moving. Anywhere but here would be a better option."
66,HedgeServ,Middle Office,2018-06-12,5.0,Middle Office,"Hedgeserv is a place where everyone from the most Junior to Senior management gets their hands dirty and helps mold the organization.  Every decision is generally made as a team with input from all rungs of the organization structure, which is very flat.  The culture of the company is phenomenal, and while it might not be 100 percent for everyone, in general there is a positivity that resonates throughout the walls of the office that I haven't found anything close to in my prior work experience at much larger organizations.  IT has a young, exciting feel and regardless of prior experience those who do well here fall in line with that culture and work to add value, and that value is rewarded.","Still in a place between startup and large company, and with that comes some needed infrastructure upgrades and administrative challenges that need to be ironed out."

The work is challenging and interesting (mostly), and I'm learning a lot as I go. Pretty modern approach in the technology team. Most of the managers are good and don't breathe down your neck. I'm not from the financial services industry, and I was worried about this being a behind the times type of place. It's not at all. I think that's because the senior management (in IT) are from outside of financial services too. Also, the company is growing which is of course both good and bad.",Days can be long at times but that's IT for you. The free food isn't great. Mostly fruits and nuts. Projects can be intense.

Some work time and space flexibility. The management cares most about us doing our job and doing good things","We need more team members
Pay isn't bad but could be better. But that's partly my fault. I didn't have to take the job. 
Maybe more company sponsored after work events, but I know that the business processing makes that hard to accomplish"
72,HedgeServ,Good company!,2017-02-22,5.0,IT Engineer,I have been on HedgeServ team for about year. The technology team is good to be part of. Good teamwork. The IT management has gotten a lot better too. My manager and up to CIO are down at earth and technical and easy to work with. Also employees not yelled at for making mistake. The management has engineering background so understand life of engineer.,I wish to have more vacation
73,HedgeServ,Enjoyed my time there,2017-02-10,5.0,Chief Science Officer (and Former Senior Director of Engineering),"Super smart people. Business fully engaged in IT. DevOps agenda. Agile methodologies. Lean principles. Interesting technologies. Combination of brown field improvements and green field development. Dozens of instantly profitable applications to make in a backlog waiting to be started. Modest travel opportunities. Great medical/dental plan (employees get it w/o a contribution). When I handed my notice in, there was calm handling of my exit and I was allowed work my whole period of notice (wasn't marched out there and then).","Longer hours (for me at least) than ideal. They'll MDM your phone if you want email on the hoof (but I took one of theirs instead). Is a technology company with an accounting arm but believes itself to be an accounting company with a technology arm <grin/>. There is a 401K plan, but no match from HedgeServ (at least up to 2016 that's true)."
74,HedgeServ,Worst Place to start your career .,2017-02-03,2.0,Network Engineer,Cool office location and great food,Never discuss plan with employee. No help provide or Guideline for employee
75,HedgeServ,No management,2017-01-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Easy, minimum effort to pay rent","No upper management cares about the employees or product given to customers. No company wide standards or HR so your job entirely depends on your manager. Get a bad manager and there is no training, no growth, no respect. The talented employees leave after a year and the only ones left are people with no goals or can't get something better. They fire employees for personal reasons and there's no HR to help mediate or investigate."
76,HedgeServ,Hedgeserv IT,2016-09-16,3.0,,"100% Company paid Health and Dental Insurance.
Room for Growth.
Work from home.
Good engineers and people capable of fulfilling constantly changing requirements.
Flexible hours and schedule.","No bonus, 401K match, or any other performance incentive.
Limited budget for technology, IT department is perceived as a cost center.
Expected to answer phone, chats, and emails at all hours 7 days a week.
Low per diem for travel (usually end up coming out of pocket) and 2-3 weeks before reimbursement. 
Off-hours and weekend work expected regularly with little notice.
High employee turnover rate.
Does not pay out accrued, unused vacation."

-- Plethora of opportunities to develop different technical skill sets

78,HedgeServ,Great Opportunities for Highly Motivated and Career Driven People,2016-09-07,4.0,,"Plenty of opportunities to increase your technical skills
Fast paced environment
Emphasis on risk mitigation and client experience
Structured control processes and adherence to industry best practices
Industry and Technology expertise
Collaborative environment",Communication between IT teams needs improvement
79,HedgeServ,Great place to grow in the world of Finance IT.,2016-07-25,5.0,IT Manager,"My experience is specific to the IT organization. I cannot comment much on other areas.

Here are the pros:

+ If you raise to the challenges, you will be noticed and rewarded.
+ There are plenty of challenges which means plenty of opportunities to shine.
+ The days can be long but IT management tries to assist and compensate.
+ Working with an incredibly smart group of dedicated individuals.
+ Medical is the best and is fully paid by the organization
+ Drinks are free, including a selection of healthy tea.
+ Fresh organic fruits are provided!
+ Although initially is hard to see, positive change is constantly happening.
+ Management team cares.
+ Career grow opportunities!","- Sometimes it feels that positive change takes a long time to take hold.
- There are a few individuals with difficult personalities, however there is a consistent common desire to improve the services to clients. 
- As an evolving organization, there are growing pains we all have to deal with."
80,HedgeServ,Hostile Work Environment - Portland Office,2016-01-12,1.0,Technical Team Lead,Nice office space with views,"After being cursed out and threatened with violence twice by my manager, I was told to take the day off. After waiting for assurances from corporate office of my workplace safety and not receiving them, I was fired for not returning to work!"
81,HedgeServ,Growing Pains,2015-11-05,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"One of the best companies I've worked for in my 10-year career. While not everything is perfect, the faults are openly acknowledged and addressed when possible. I appreciate that management doesn't try to keep people that aren't a good fit or aren't pulling their weight.

What else?

- 100% health coverage paid for by the company
- Solid pay
- (mostly) smart team members
- Management who is willing to listen
- Interesting technologies
- Everyone, in technology at least, is expected to be self-managing. Almost no top-down dictatorial management.","The company is still trying to find itself as it expands to a global reach, from its relatively humble beginnings as a tech startup 7 - 8 years ago.

- Few people actually know what we do here at Hedgeserv.
- There's no discernible company culture. People on the business side don't really interact with people on the technology side, infrastructure people rarely interact with software dev people, people in Dublin have a totally different ""culture"" than people in NYC, and so on. It feels as though we are all doing our jobs, but not as part of the same company.
- Along with the above, where is the ""goal"" or vision statement we as employees are supposed to align to?
- No vision plan as part of health coverage.
- No 401k match (yet?)
- No bonus plan (yet?)"
82,HedgeServ,Fun job,2015-09-04,5.0,Infrastructure Engineer,Technology not what you would think. I worked at ING and JPM and nothing like that. Infrastructure is modern and good technology. Allow employees to be creative and not follow a brainless script. Using a lot of automation with chef and open stack. Management with good experience but also willing to learn and not force people to follow older architecture.,It is financial. Sometimes business people do not understand the technology but everyone is trying. A lot of good things happening and team work.
83,HedgeServ,Great place to work!!!,2015-07-13,4.0,Managing Director,"We grown from a start up to one of the top 10 admins in the US. We've done a lot of things right and obviously we've made mistakes along the way. However, what sets us apart is that we are dedicated to continually learning. Learn from both our success and our mistakes. 

One of the key's to our success is that team work has and continues to be at the core of our culture. This manifests itself in many ways. We are ardent believers in TDD and agile development. By definition, everyone has input into the process. Need help resolving an issue, understanding a requirement, finding a design that scales . . . there is always someone there to lending a helping hand. 

Our version of continuous deployment, ""deploy when we want to"" is in progress and is going to require new thinking. We've hired a few senior guys who've done it before to help us get there. There's no ""silver bullet"". But with dedication, smart thinking and hard work we will get there. Technology is constantly changing, we have to change to keep up. Change is seldom easy, but with the support of smart people around you anything is possible.

Want to learn more about another area of the company, we are big believers that people are happier and more productive when they are working in an area that interests them. Many developers started out in one group and have moved to another development group.","People work hard. Everyone is constantly learning and getting better at what they do. If you think you know ""everything"" there is to know about your area of expertise, this might not be the place for you. 

On the technology side we are pretty flat. There are developers, team leads, the senior director of engineering and the CIO. On the plus side, your comp is not dictated by your job title. In fact, we are not all that big on job titles, I suppose that could be a con for some people."
84,HedgeServ,Middle Office,2015-07-08,4.0,,"Great atmosphere, everyone is very kind and willing to help each other.",There really is not any cons that come to mind.
85,HedgeServ,Brilliant Global Engineering team couple with great Ops and Development leaders.,2015-06-29,5.0,Global Chief Information Officer,Highly adaptive cross-functional teams. Strong Leaders and developing managers.  Exciting business model. Rapidly evolving and adapting culture.,Just the normal growing pains transitioning from successful red hot startup to a fully scaled operation.
86,HedgeServ,Going No Where Fast,2015-06-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Strong camaraderie amongst coworkers. Easy hours and lax atmosphere. Beer fridge.,"Consistent lowballing on salary (only relenting if absolutely desperate to retain individuals). Once senior management finds out that you are not happy, your head is on the chopping block."
87,HedgeServ,Quite pleasant experience,2015-05-09,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,Management is very supportive. Love the culture and competent  co-workers,I have none so far!
88,HedgeServ,"For your own sake, look elsewhere",2015-02-21,1.0,Senior Network Engineer,"Some of the other employees are great people to work with.
Casual dress code
Free soda
Free coffee",Highly Ineffectual management that makes me question if they've ever really managed anyone before outside of this company
89,HedgeServ,"In terms of a place to work, its mediocre at best.  I was content with mediocrity for close 4 years before I left.",2014-04-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you can get along with management, you'll get away with murder.  There is plenty  of favoritism, nepotism, and cronyism.  Just suck up a little and never disagree with management.  If you do that you'll have a great career with plenty of autonomy.  As a yes man, you'll have stability and the potential to achieve a good work life balance. This applies to most all areas of the company.    

The firms has had it's ups and downs, but I project them to do well in the future.","If you don't establish a personal relationship with management, expect long hours without compensation, no personal growth, no job security, an uncomfortable work environment, etc..."
