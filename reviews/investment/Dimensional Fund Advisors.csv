1,Dimensional Fund Advisors,Used to be good … not anymore,2022-04-17,2.0,Sr. Associate,"Not much anymore. Used to be a good IT organization in the company. 
As a business they stick to the academic principles the company is founded on.","Directionless IT organization. The IT mgmt is pretty haphazard. Many instances of knee jerk reaction by IT mgmt. 
People are leaving left and right. IT is at least 5 years behind in terms of technology and processes. IT folks have low morale. 

Lot of lip service is given to concerns raised by employees but nothing is actually done."

3,Dimensional Fund Advisors,The People are Great,2022-04-07,4.0,Analyst,the people are wonderful and the office environment is amazing,finding a clear career path is very challenging - you may put in a lot of effort with little to look forward to
4,Dimensional Fund Advisors,Not for a career in finance,2022-04-02,3.0,Investment Analytics and Data,"Friendly colleagues, work-life balance, generous PTO","For IAD: If you are thinking about working on industry/company research and valuation models, this is not the place for you. IAD folks are much more like software engineers and database managers who maintain or streamline existing data processes where the new streamline work barely affects investment outcome at all.

For the company: The morale is low and clients are pulling out money due to the poorly performing factor investment strategy. We underperformed the market regardless of whether the market was in good or bad condition. The company is so stuck on the one ""true"" investment philosophy as if it is the one true God."

Also, depends on your manager - some are flexible with being able to work at home when sick, etc. but don't expect it. They are old fashioned and like people present exactly at 8am through 5pm.

18,Dimensional Fund Advisors,Nothing amazing,2022-01-04,2.0,Manager,"Good on-site restaurant, cheap meals, great facilities. People are generally good, especially on sales side.","They haven’t adapted to WFH culture and are not willing to budge on in-office requirements. Very low pay relative to industry - if you are 1-5 yrs out of college, you’ll be underpaid vs peers. If you come up within the company, you’ll be underpaid vs peers that are hired into DFA at your level. Extremely political between departments, particularly Investment Solutions, Marketing, and Technology. Not willing to work with sales to grow business, they just want to protect their fiefdoms. Not willing to change with the times, people that are lifers are protected, and don’t do much for the newer employees. 

Investment thesis has become incredibly boring and probably won’t change in the next century. DFA will still be profitable, but you won’t see any of that unless you’re a founder.

2 week parental leave if you’re not the one that gives birth - that’s not even a joke, that’s just sad."

Great company to start your career","Not many promotion opportunities
Little flexible in working hours"
34,Dimensional Fund Advisors,Your experience depends on your team,2021-08-07,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Gorgeous offices in all locations, Austin HQ is located at the highest point in the area and you can see for 20 miles in each direction.
The Charlotte office is brand new and stunning. Santa Monica office is on Santa Monica blvd. I can't say enough about our offices as a geek for architecture. I feel this is why there is a big push to come back to them after covid, because they've spent so much money on them.
Technology for the most part is up to date.
Most of of low and mid level employees are great to work with. 
Lately the firm seems to be pushing to hire tons of young people which has really changed the feel of the company over the last few years.
Benefits-wise, insurance is good. We have a HSA/High Deductible option that is great. Both 401k and HSA can be vested with the company, 401k match is below average and caps at 4% I believe.
Onsite cafeteria in Austin and Charlotte with an excellent selection of foods. Comp sparkling water, fruit and coffee/tea on every floor.
ETF launch seems to possibly be pushing the company upward a bit.
Upward mobility seems possible for nearly every department. Company is relatively large at ~1600 worldwide so there is the possibility of movement to another location if you want it and there seems to be decent push to promote from within.","Dimensional is a company that has one foot in the past and another in the future, and is urinating on today. David Booth is old school and until he retires from the board, nothing will change. I'm sure you've already read other reviews below that mention our ancient dress code, the lack of a good work from home policy and the insane amount of overly paid white dudes, and all of that is definitely true. But I do feel the firm is starting to realize that and has started a few initiatives to diversify our employee population. It's a lot better than when I first started.
Because the company has spent so much money on offices, they want you to be in them. This also points back to the firm's old school thinking. Top leaders feel that in-office collaboration is still the way to be productive. Before Covid, employees were NEVER allowed to work from home. That all changed of course.
Currently we have been told that we'll be moving to a hybrid WFH/office situation where some days you are required to be in office, and other days you can work from home. But that will be evaluated at a later date according to our HR. 
This is not the company for you if you think you're going to be working from home 5 days a week in the future. I really hope that changes soon.
I am a support employee, meaning I'm not directly involved with the money-making activities like RDs, PMs, associates, etc. My group deals with building maintenance, event coordination, project management, video/audio systems, etc. I feel for the type of work our group does, the pay is a bit below average to average considering how well padded the company is. It seems most managers are obstinately overpaid, and everybody under them is paid mediocre despite doing an excellent job. Our group is so great at what they do and we really take pride in our work and work hard! 
In doing research of firms similar to us, it seems that our investment philosophy is quite unique and some even feel is foolish. I don't pretend to know a ton about finance but I do feel that we are stuck in the past in a lot of ways, especially in employee experience. The saying goes: take care of your people and your people will take care of you, and I do not feel that Dimensional is an employee-first company.
I love my team because our team lead is just awesome, but others don't have the same experience. I suppose this is true of any company but it seems more pronounced here.
LGBTQ diversity/inclusion is virtually non-existent and was not even recognized until 2020.
The way the marketing department is structured in this company is comical and I don't understand how the bosses over there still have a job. Who are we even marketing to? Our clients have to go through an advisor to access our funds. The marketing team is extremely overpaid and overstaffed to basically do nothing."
35,Dimensional Fund Advisors,Great general work atmosphere and culture.,2021-08-07,4.0,Analyst%2C Desktop Administration,"Compensation, culture, diversity, advancement, benefits(great PTO & tuition reimbursement), nice work environment.","Certain Senior managers were able to advance their careers off the hard work of their under appreciated, under resourced, and under manned service desk team. While the vast majority of the company culture is great, it was unfortunate that the team I was on had a very poor manager with unreal expectations. We went through a few supervisors in just 2 years and other employees left because our manager was living in a different stratosphere."

General inflexibility on strategy, workplace standards, etc

46,Dimensional Fund Advisors,Technology Department Needs an Overhaul,2021-06-14,2.0,Information Technology,"The business itself is healthy, even after a very tumultuous and precarious year (pandemic, 2020-2021).","The IT leadership team is comprised of ineffective managers, most of whom have been employees at DFA for many years. They’ve grown roots and now refuse to budge. They place themselves above anything else and never seem to hold themselves accountable for fostering secrecy and narcissism instead of creativity and cohesion. Also, be ready for some really frustrating discussions about tech advancements...they continue to think and operate within the year 2010. Although, if you can speak in modern catch phrases, key terms and acronyms and you also know Agile terminology, you’ll do well here even if you can’t put it into practice. Don’t worry, the IT steering committee will never notice. Your shortcomings will be obscured by layers of misinformation and confusion for years, during which time you’ll be promoted. The gaps you leave will then become someone else’s problem. Speaking of confusion, they continue hiring more IT project managers but can’t seem to establish real synergy. Lots of short-lived pats on the back when things happen to go well and weeks/months-worth of finger-pointing and hushed conversations when things fail. As a result, the latter has created an atmosphere of gross stagnation where there is absolutely no propensity and no appetite for sweeping change. Using a very traditional and top-heavy management structure, the Technology department lacks the flexibility needed to be ultra-responsive to business needs. There are just way too many personal agendas in the way."

The company does not seem interested/willing to listen or act even after multiple employee surveys clearly point at these issues, again, no actions nor improvements attempts have been made to 'fix the issues', in fact, the issues continue to deteriorate on a daily basis. We continue to hire professionals who then are restricted from doing what they were hired to do due to internal politics, misinformation, confusion, lack of good leadership and decision making. With the lack of guidance and future roadmap, each team works in their own silos, none of which are on the same page or working toward the same goals. Very often it comes down to the same few employees taking on the majority of the workload as others are content getting by collecting a paycheck while contributing absolutely nothing. Many times, decisions are made by the least experienced, least knowledgeable members who then knowingly relay misleading or false information to upper management for purchasing decisions."

Compared to other firms, the people at Dimensional are great. They are smart, hard-working, nice people. There are few bad eggs. Generally I find people to be humble. 

Compensation isn’t bad. Not top tier, but definitely not bottom either. As a graduate (either undergrad or MBA), comp is on the lower end, so negotiate. 

Benefits package is okay. Onsite health clinic is a nice perk. 

Work life balance is great. Get your work done-type attitude.  Food cafe was nice when we were at the office.","No structure for mid or end of year reviews.  Despite being promoted, there is no logic to promotions.   There is no start of year objective setting. 
 General lack of caring about your career/career path and skill development. Completely manager dependent and I have had both types.

Senior management play favorites.  Some people are “in” the club and some aren't. Nepotism is also present, either in the form of UChicago/Booth, or family/friends giving people a leg up

401(k) match is below average at just 4%, especially when Vanguard, American Funds, TRowe are offering 3x as much.

Our long-term incentive program is not good now. A few years ago it was better. 

Middle management is poor. They/We aren’t trained on how to manage properly and most of us have no experience at an outside firm. Generally middle management is only concerned about their own careers, not about the teams that they manage

CEO’s have missed the boat on many things, but the consistent party line from senior management is that we are “being thoughtful”. 

Firm is experiencing growing pains despite being 40 years old.  Firm/management is resistant to change."

78,Dimensional Fund Advisors,Only place I want to work,2021-02-04,5.0,Investment Solutions,"I am a 13-year veteran of Dimensional who started straight out of grad school (and yes, that grad school was Booth). Every year I’ve been here, I’ve seen my responsibilities and impact grow. This has been a wonderful place for me and I consider myself quite lucky to have found a rewarding and challenging career with people who I deeply respect.

We might as well start at the beginning. Did I have a leg up because I went to Booth? It certainly helped connect me to the right people and put Dimensional on my radar. I don’t think they were actively recruiting folks like me in 2008, so my Chicago resume helped get me in the door. But that’s where the advantage ended. I was surrounded by exceptionally smart people, who would have quickly figured out if all I had to offer was my alma mater. 

I have always felt that my career has been determined by my willingness to learn, work hard, and be creative and flexible. I have had many mentors throughout my time at Dimensional who challenged me to grow. I have learned so much about finance, about our industry and about being a leader from those I interact with every day. There are plenty of ways to grow at Dimensional, they just don’t always fall into your lap. 

There are many things in motion here, which is what you’d expect at a company that is innovating and pushing boundaries. In turn, there is a lot of work to do. This also means there are many ways people can contribute and be recognized for their efforts. Within my specific team, many people have a long runway to show what they can do, and be recognized and rewarded for it. And that includes people without advanced degrees from Chicago! 

I am part of “management”, but I was once a junior level employee. My Dimensional story is not unique. I have witnessed many people with many different backgrounds flourish here. It isn’t necessarily easy, and you definitely cannot coast. But if you are smart and work hard, Dimensional is a place where you can tackle challenging work with smart and kind peers while building a rewarding and successful career.","The work distribution seems like it can be quite uneven. While that is being worked on, I observe we still have some ways to go."

92,Dimensional Fund Advisors,Proceed With Extreme Caution.,2020-09-17,1.0,Associate,"--Fair work/life balance 
 --Beautiful office","--Company Outlook:
The mere fact that DFA continues to exist, in and of itself, is mystifying. The basic investment strategy has been replicated countless times over and offered to investors at far lower prices by many competitors. Nonetheless, unwitting investors continue to hand over their assets to financial advisors who, in turn, transfer these assets to DFA at an exorbitant fee -- for the false promise of higher returns beyond the benchmark. These higher returns are utterly illusory. The financial advisors know this of course -- but are themselves compensated by DFA -- so the machine continues forth. This, in some ways, is a form of white collar grift. The victim here is, typically, a high net worth individual or the crime is spread thinly over many thousands of investors -- so no one really cares. The point is, if DFA existed in a more transparent and competitive context -- it simply would not exist by tomorrow morning. 

--Career Development:
You will develop little to no transferable skills over the duration of your employment here. This cannot be stressed enough. Every year you stay, the fetters grow ever tighter and the walls ever higher. Your relevancy to other companies dwindles while your sink even more entrenched into mire of DFA. They know this and will always use it against you. 

--HR:
Truly, some of the worst human beings I have ever encountered over the course of my life. 

--Pay:
Well below industry average. Do not be fooled -- Austin is a very expensive city. 

--Culture:
Because the entire organization is process-driven and has no interest in change, career advancement consequently revolves around political in-fighting and scarcely anything else. This also cannot be emphasized enough. If you haven't kissed the hand of every possible relevant human being within your organization, then your opportunities will be severely curtailed. Correspondingly, I also witnessed appalling employees swiftly ascend the corporate ladder simply by virtue of the fact that they had flattered and flirted the requisite egos. The latter was not the exception -- it was the norm. 

--Work Life Balance:
Previously, I would have said that DFA might actually be a decent place to work if you led a life deeply enriched by things beyond your career. It used to be fairly easy to come, complete your work, and go as you please. Now, however, your movement is meticulously tracked and this data is presumably provided to your manager and any other individual in the organization who might use it against you. 

--Overall:
The sun has set on the glory days of DFA. The company will continue to pedantically adhere to their processes until the company gently fades into oblivion. As resources are constrained and funds are tightened, I imagine the political quarrels will only grow more aggressive and more treacherous. Another procedure to follow, another colleague to betray -- until the last portfolio's last assets under management finally sinks to zero. Nothing will be lost.

Don't bother!,2020-08-22,1.0,Senior Associate,"Nice cafeteria, low expectations, polite people","Whatever respect you had for the firm or excitement about joining you have will disappear within 4-6 months on the job. The Warhols on the wall will lose their color; you'll start avoiding the cafe and eating in the parking lot just to get out of the building. If you hadn't already, you will come to see you've joined a firm that prides itself on resisting change until it becomes unprofitable or untenable to do so (see for example, remote work, growing focus on ESG, D&I), at which point it pretends to be a pioneer and champion of whatever trend can no longer be denied.

Primarily, if you are ambitious and impact-driven, you will come to realize (or be sternly told) that, even as a graduate of a top graduate program with years of industry experience, your opinions don't matter. Unlike consulting/banking or even equity research or whatever field you were considering, there are no required skill sets, work products or career trajectories for post-grad hires in most departments at DFA. While your classmates are leveling up, it will be explained to you why there's no budget for a 2% cost of living raise. Hint: you're in a dead-end job. 

The only way to build a career at DFA is to curry favor with those who themselves have curried favor with higher-ups. Ways to do this include: belonging to the right country club, having a kid in the right preschool, and just plain old kissing butt. It helps to be white. There are no job descriptions, development expectations, or performance reviews. People two years out of school are routinely hired at the same title as people with a decade of experience at top AM firms. The jobs are so easy and promotions so haphazard, these types generally advance faster. Or maybe they know someone. The type of background most likely to succeed here mirrors upper management -- PhD (in finance... optional), never worked anywhere else, drink the EMH Kool-Aid, no concept of how ridiculously micro-managed the company is, and remains grateful for below-market wages.

DFA can best be described as a reactionary firm in a conservative industry. Ironic given it prides itself on innovation. Just take a look at the composition of the board (six white males) or senior leadership of the sales team (3 white males overseeing 12 white male channel heads, 1 white female. Even the head of the Japan office is a white male! Nothing to see here.

The internship and recruiting process are extremely disingenuous, yet succeed in achieving the goal of finding warm bodies to fill seats for the year or two it will take most to realize they've been duped. Whatever 'strategic project' and firm practices you are told it's up to you to improve will never change and your ideas will never see the light of day. If they do, it will be because your boss stole credit for them. Your day to day work as an employee will be even more mind-numbingly dull than you could imagine, and no one will care about your input or development. There were months at a time I had absolutely nothing to do. Get up, put on business professional attire, go to work, and pretend to be busy in an open office floor plan 9 hours a day. It's a bad sign when your manager is showing up late and clocking out early every day. 

The way people end up surviving in this environment is by taking 2 hour lunches, long walking laps around the campus, gossip sessions over coffee etc. Management response: require scanning ID card in and out... get back to your desk! Probably the best thing I can say about working there is that I've never been paid more to do less.

DFA is also remains strongly against working remotely. Despite successfully having had the vast majority of employees working from home, they continue to refuse to let employees know 1) when to expect to return to the office and 2) whether the demonstrated success of the COVID experiment will mean any change in the draconian work from home policy (you can't).

A firm that always puts its owners first, clients second, employees last."

97,Dimensional Fund Advisors,Animal Farm - Some pigs are more equal than others...,2020-04-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Er...the cafe is pretty good and the people who work at the cafe are decent human beings.,"I would give this place negative stars if I could. Where do I start? Animal farm (George Orwell) really sums up DFA.  Basically, senior management tells their employees how everyone is replaceable and dispensable so that you would feel small as an employee and be eternally grateful for the below market rate they are paying you. The senior managers and some high-level VPs ensure that they get all the best, “most visible” useless projects that would bolster their positions in the company and allow them to put more resources (read: employ people who don’t have actual jobs) into their fiefdoms. By the way, almost everyone there is a VP; the less you do, the higher the likelihood that you would get VP.
As one reviewer puts it so eloquently, if you curry favor with the flavor of the moment (employees who are having their moments in the sun and are on a rising path), you are more likely to be deemed a rising star… And those are definitely “more equal than others”. There is no basis for how some people get Chosen. I believe it’s sheer luck. If you have read the “Luck versus Skill in the Cross Section of Mutual Fund Returns” paper by FF, you will understand that the same logic applies to DFA managers and Chosen Employees as well. Most of them are there by random luck and not because of talent, intelligence or integrity. For example, one of the Senior Management personnel may take a liking to a certain employee because he or she likes what that employee was wearing that day and simply say that person should be promoted. And indeed, that person will get promoted. There is just no rhyme or reason for why someone gets promoted and others are not. There are some good managers but those are few and far between.
Decisions are mostly made by the top echelon of PM and Research. The deputy heads of PM would be considered Administrative Officers in other companies because they execute the desires and wishes of the few 0.1% who hold true power in the company. Everything is micro-managed. Email to clients to answer really generic questions are overseen by the CEOs and the various heads of department. This is probably why the company hasn’t come up with real research or innovation in a long time, the management and the Research department are too busy scrutinizing responses to generic client questions.
Let’s talk about the Human Resources Department. The letters “I, N” should be added to form “Inhuman Resources”. This department is there to make the employees’ lives as miserable as possible and offer little support. If you have a problem, they would add to it. If you are facing discrimination, instead of listening to you or helping you, they are more likely to remind you that you cannot sue the company because you have signed an Arbitration Agreement. I believe the department is there to protect the management and the shareholders (really, just one shareholder who mostly owns the company) and to make their employees feel as weak and powerless as possible.
Are markets efficient and do prices reflect all available information? DFA will tell you that they think so unless the market you are talking about is the labor market. They don’t believe in paying fair market rate wages and when they saw that there was significant turnover in the ranks because of better pay or better work culture at other companies, they decided that instead of paying more and improving work culture to retain staff, they would rather put in a No-compete clause so that they can continue to make their employees’ lives miserable even after they have left. Isn’t it, er, the opposite of efficient markets?
What about this new push for Diversity and Inclusion? Well, this was pushed by the rank and file and denied by senior management until they realized that clients actually care about fund managers’ efforts to increase D&I. DFA then did a complete switcheroo and put the same people who have denied the need for D&I initiatives all along to head up the D&I committee. And are these committee members qualified? Are they passionate about the cause? Nope, these are the same Chosen few. They are on all the committees. Only them and no one else.
There is so much more but I will just conclude with this: I would rather go on unemployment than work in this toxic environment."
98,Dimensional Fund Advisors,"Please, Do Yourself a Favor and Don't Apply",2020-04-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great food.
Some good people still there but they are secretly trying to get out.","I was in the portfolio management organization for a time. To start off with the Portfolio Management (PM) team managers are terrible. Extremely political and it's gotten worse with all the deputy co-heads playing extreme nepotistic favorites as well as some of the desk leads. The deputies really see themselves as little 3rd world dictators with a country full of peasants they can play with. All of them need to go but will be there for life. They don't even try to hide it, they are pretty upfront and blatant about it. Half the portfolio management leaders will ask you for your career goals, then ACTIVELY go out of their way to block them or use them against you. 


Compensation at DFA is below industry standard and the longer you stay the further behind compensation wise you will fall behind equivalent level/experience at competitors. Not just by a little but by a lot. DFA is cheap with employees, especially for the industry they are in. You will lose out on hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars in your career earnings if you stay here for any length of time. 


Extreme politics and favoritism with people regularly stealing credit for your work or trying to keep you from getting visibility at the firm. It's basically a high school environment with PM team leaders acting like the mean girls in high school. There is very obviously an ""in circle"" and an out circle. You will be demeaned, never included in any decision or asked for your input on anything if you aren't in the ""in circle"" no matter how relevant it is to what you are working on. DFA is extremely great at alienating people and making you wonder why you should even bother to be there. For example, the favored of the in circle will be invited to meetings and everyone else will be very blatantly excluded even if they should be there because it's directly relevant to their job. 


Within the first few months of your time there if you've curried enough favor with one of the several deputies of  PM you will be marked as on the right path for advancement or if you are in the outside circle which means they will do their best to stamp out your career. They make this decision extremely quickly based on god knows what.


There is no actual documented process or timing for advancement on the investment team or even the criteria to get promoted, including at the initial analyst level - you basically need to have curried enough favor with one of the key desk leads, or deputy coheads otherwise you will spend a decade in the same position. 


The true irony of the investment team at DFA is you are in no way compensated or measured for actually being good at investing or managing portfolios. The only thing that matters is currying favor with one of a handful of PM team leaders in the ""in circle"" and doing silly internal projects, the majority of which go nowhere or have extremely minor impacts. You could be the best portfolio manager in the world, and it would literally mean less than the number of times you give a 20 second update on a minor/silly project in the monthly PM team meeting. 


The technology for PM and the firm as a whole is embarrassing. The investment team who uses a ton of custom excel plugins and applications is given computers that would have been state of the art 15 years ago. You will lose a good 1-2 hours a day waiting for simple stuff to run such as outlook or booting up excel, not to mention the constant freezes and crashes. IT will role out updates that your machines just don't have the hardware to handle and that were obviously not actually tested before they decided to put it on the machines of 100+ people with no recourse. The sad thing is for a company as profitable as DFA is, it would be a small piece of a quarter's profits to fix all the technology issues and would make the average investment team member's life just so much better day to day. This comes up again and again as a top issue on the surveys they insist on doing but they simply say nothing they can do about it, just work longer hours to make up for your type writer of a computer."

Food in the exchange is top notch
It looks good on your resume","The only things the firm invests in are pretty buildings. It’s all fake though. It fools clients into thinking that DFA isn’t crumbling underneath that nice facade. Underinvestment in IT is a persistent source of stress and operational risk. In a typical year, someone in PM can expect to lose two weeks of productivity to IT problems. Much smaller asset managers have more sophisticated and thoroughly documented optimizers than what DFA uses.

DFA has a reputation as being academic. That is not the reality. There will be innovations in academic finance over the next few decades and DFA won’t pioneer the implementation of any of them. DFA refuses to recognize the valuable contributions of academics who are not associated with the firm. That should be a big red flag to anyone who cares about outcomes more than appearances. The firm engages in some dirty analysis of competitors’ approaches. Specifically, DFA’s work on the liquidity and momentum premiums fail to pass the sniff test. I would describe it as reverse p-hacking. They take statisically significant premiums and keep cutting the data in different ways until they get results that makes the premiums look insignificant. AQR seems to be far more devoted to academic rigor and intellectual honesty than DFA.

The longer you stay at Dimensional, the further your compensation falls below the market rate. The firm rarely lays anyone off but they insist on paying below market so they slowly lose their better employees. A year ago the emerging markets desk had six authorized traders. Four of them have left the firm for better jobs since then.

DFA insists that the team-based approach to PM means that they don’t have key man risk the way stock picking shops do. That is a lie. If you buy into this approach to investing then you’ve already realized that the average stock picker doesn’t actually add any value over benchmarks, so it doesn’t matter when you lose one. Factor-based investing actually adds value. At DFA the process is analogous to a  workshop with several interdependent machines all working together to capture the premiums. Some PMs know how to work those machines better than others. Some PMs know a lot more about the underlying logic than others. As those PMs leave, the process gets a little bit worse. Moreover, the firms continues to automate processes that once had more manual intervention. That is fine in theory, but in practice I have not seen a single process automation that did not lead to a slightly worse outcome for the end investor. It is true that DFA fights for every basis point. Specifically, DFA fights for every basis point that ends up in David Booth’s pocket. Every process automation I saw left a few basis points on the table for end investors in order to enrich Booth.

Strategy changes are boondoggles. The main decision makers for investment process changes come from research. These people have never sent a trade and do not focus on client preferences. DFA was a  better manager when the people driving portfolio management process changes actually had portfolio management experience. Now research runs some simulations, spends a few years in analysis paralysis, and PM ends up implementing something slightly worse than what they would have implemented a couple years earlier without research input anyway. DFA weren’t even the first to implement the two extra factors that Fama and French added with the 5-factor model!

It is embarrassing to see Booth go on Bloomberg or CNBC. The type of person who makes you wish you worked for a different person. No charisma. Not insightful. Takes the opportunity to insult employees at company events. Definitely the least talented rich person I have ever met. If someone like him came in today to get interviewed that person would not receive a job offer.

Promotions come easier and quicker to employees in Austin. All things equal, you will get promoted quicker in Austin than anywhere else in the company. Even in Austin though, there is more noise than signal in the promotion decisions."

The employees are nice but gossip behind everyone's backs. Ingroups and outgroups are rampant. People will get invited to one hangout and then not another. It's like an elementary school. The ""adults"" or vps/directors parent the associates and are just as vindictive and exclusionary. It's an interesting culture.

-Good reputation in the industry so you can leverage DFA experience to get interviews at other shops.","-Below market pay. This has driven higher turnover recently. Was a major factor for me.
-Difficult to get recognition if you don't sit in Austin. If you don't work in Austin, you need to make twice the contribution to get promoted a year later than someone in Austin.
-Not allowed to work from home. It's fine that DFA does not want that to be a regular practice, but 90% of the job can be done remotely and if you have a slow week or two without any project work or meetings it would be better if you could work from home. That might almost make the below market pay bearable.
-Hit or miss with managers. Most managers were promoted for being good at their PM job and now the company has grown to the point that it is necessary to have them managing people. The ability to manage people was not a criteria in selecting these managers in the first place so there are many managers who aren't very good at actually managing people. Some managers are good with people, but that's just luck, it was not by design.

They also offer an on-site cafeteria with discounted prices for employees. 

The new C Suite seems to be taking notice that the employee experience needs improvement. Prior to my departure, the Co-CEOs sent out an employee survey and acted on the results within a matter of months which was impressive.  The communication is also good at the executive level.","While the Firm is impressive, the employee experience in the marketing department was not. There is a serious lack of transparency between senior management and the middle managers (and the people they manage). Anyone below the senior manager level is not empowered to make any independent decisions or implement any processes or policies. All decisions have to be vetted through the department head who is a road block because 1) she’s never available due to her schedule and 2) she has no operational or marketing experience which results in no valuable direction and a lack of execution.  Other departments are hesitant to collaborate with marketing due to this road block. Roles and responsibilities across the department are ill defined which leads to confusion and frustration among the staff. Input from anyone below the senior management level is not received well. I’ve personally cringed on numerous occasions watching as someone presented to the department head and was ripped to shreds in front of everyone. Lastly, I never received a single performance review in 3 years or any opportunities for career development. When I escalated this issue, I was told that everyone is busy and to develop myself."

It is a company that holds the client above all else, which is also an explanation for some of the less than stellar employee reviews. The best ideas are welcome, but you have to be prepared to recognize that many ideas have already been thought of, tested, debated, and perhaps abandoned for the time being because they don't make sense for our clients. While to some, this may feel like red tape, there is a good reason for it. There is no shortage of ideas, but it requires time and resources to implement and support an idea for long term success.

I started my career at Dimensional straight out of school. And I have seen many of the people who started about the same time as me get more and more responsibilities.

There are a lot of extremely intelligent people who work there.  Some really great people.,They do not care about their employees anymore.  I worked for them for many years.  Although some of the Human Resources are great like on the recruiting side many of the rest leave a lot to be desired. One in particular loves to try and bully people and intimidate them so they will say something inappropriate or something that will get them terminated..  Many of the mangers in Austin have their heads up their butts and micromanage.  They all have a daddy issue with the new CFW Sam and are running around trying to please him.  They let good people leave the company for no real good reason.  IT management is the worst.  They play games with peoples lives and expect you to sit there and take it.

They will be passive aggressive, slowly isolate you if they don't think youre toeing the line, dont value employee development much.

-The pay here used to be good, now it sucks. Associates/Analysts get paid poorly, as does anyone promoted within. Only way to get paid well here is to come in as RD or PM from elsewhere.If they can take advantage of you somewhere they will. Oh and Austin isn't that cheap, if you don't believe me check housing prices. Pay increases in record years were nonexistent, bonuses are shrinking and they will probably eliminate one of the twice-yearly bonuses soon.

-Hours are terrible in PM, IAD but good in FAS. You dont learn much anywhere after the first couple months, everything is task oriented because they want you to be as replaceable as possible. Development is not a priority here.

-Austin is a tiny city. Thats how they lock in a lot of people, by moving them to a city where they dont rub elbows with any finance people. If you dont get promoted or get a pay bump, you cant walk down the street to a different firm like in a real city.

-David Booth and Eduardo Repetto. Booth has done a brilliant job of taking research and making himself money off of it, then touting some higher purpose. Higher purpose isnt making hundreds of millions of dollars a year in dividends while nickel and diming employees. Eduardo is alright but is really abrasive, he doesn't inspire confidence and regularly yells at employees in public. 

-Everyone who hasn't been here for a long time wants to leave or will leave if they ever got decent offers.

-If you dont believe in the investment philosophy completely, which is ludicrous since finance is not physics and thus has no absolutes, you wont fit in with the cult.

There is often confusion about the Operations and Engineering because the Operations team does the majority of the work, while the engineering team, well, no one really knows what they do, when the two remaining come to work

H.R. does not take employee complaints seriously and dismiss grievances as employee being cynical."
248,Dimensional Fund Advisors,Not a good career move,2013-08-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,It is a paycheck that comes at a stiff price.,This company has become toxic. IT management consistently shows its incompetence and unwillingness to address the problems. The environment has become unprofessional . I have seen departments self destruct before but never on this scale. 26 people have left within the past 3 months.
249,Dimensional Fund Advisors,Talent is Stifled by the Poisonous Culture,2013-03-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you like being part of a Cult, then this is the Nirvana of Cults","The Culture is poisonous. How the culture evolved is a bit of a mystery. Some of the very senior people are fine. There are a few bad apples though who instead of being removed, either got promoted or have been left in mid seniority positions. This is in London."

Outdated ideas about IT and the CTO is the one who covers up the most to protect his friends.

253,Dimensional Fund Advisors,Nice place to work,2012-08-01,5.0,,"Great benefits, lots of flexability, great location outside of downtown Austin in a very high end neighborhood with lots of great schools, homes and restaurants. A nice relaxed academic culture with very friendly employees.  Lots of opportunities to travel and work with senior management even at a entry level with lots of flexability to spend time with family.",Lots of people entering the company very quickly
254,Dimensional Fund Advisors,Truly Shocking,2012-05-21,1.0,,"The majority of the staff are pleasant to work with
Office buildings are in general in nice central locations
Compensation is probably a little above average","Dysfunctional management and politics rule. Independent viewpoints are not tolerated. A deference to the founders and their academic colleagues permeates the culture. There is a culture of fear to question the investment philosophy, and a lot of external hires are truly puzzled and shocked at this when they arrive. A lot of reverse engineering goes into the investment message to try to keep it consistent with the evangelical advisors while making sense to the institutional community. This is pretty much impossible. 

Incompetent managers who have caused huge amounts of harm are protected instead of being dismissed, so staff get demotivated and either leave voluntarily are are forced out. HR knows all about this but is powerless, so just provides the framework to legitimize the coverups. Its a pity the HR head who came from Wall St didn't bring best practice to the firm.

Research, trading and portfolio management run the place. Don't think otherwise. Most of the people in powerful roles have been there for a long time and come from the same cliche. So they protect each other. There is a lot of disinformation from some middle management to their seniors and a lot of back-stabbing and slandering. Would you want to work in such a place. 

Dimensional does not tolerate different views about markets. And with markets broken right now, this is a shame. Most of the investment people in the company don't have any real grasp of markets, since they have an engineering mentality. The investment presentations and calls are cringy to listen to since the people don't have a feel for markets. The place has  lots of processes  sort of like a production line, and has even been referred to as a factory by senior investment people. The intention is to run it like a factory."

262,Dimensional Fund Advisors,Would be a great place to work if not for the uphill battle with management to get things done proper.,2012-02-23,1.0,,"Academic Culture.
Decent Compensation and Benefits
Very nice ""green"" office.
Organization has a stated goal and operates by it at significant cost (very rare today).","Dysfunctional senior management.
Complete lack of accountability my senior management.
Staff is routinely ""thrown under the bus"" for situations and decisions that are completely out of their control.
Politics are a major issue between management & staff, departments and offices.  Politics permeates the culture while management is oblivious to its existence.
HR is utterly ineffective in dealing with the organization's issues.
Staff's only course of action is to resign.
Real talent, insight and years of direct experience are not appreciated.  It will get your hired but counts for nothing afterwards.
No one is willing to ""rock the boat"" in order to fix a blatant issue with another senior manager.
It can be a challenge to work with highly educated individuals who know much about a narrow field but behave as though they know all about everything, including how best to do your job.  It's common fault among PhD's."
263,Dimensional Fund Advisors,Career progression - yea get an MBA from a top university,2012-01-11,2.0,Assistant Trading,"Great history and story to the company.  Smart employees, but bad culture.  Great place to learn how to be an indexer.  How to process corporate actions.  Learn how to elect on proxies!","A lot of ""new"" MBA's that say they are all about efficient markets only because if they don't they will probably be fired.  Not open to ideas that the investment world is looking at.  So it leaves you specialized to the point where nobody else cares how you view the world through a DFA investment microscope.  Leaves you with little transferable skills because of the specialized nature of the firm.  If you can stay and somehow find a niche then awesome, but like most people who leave you will find yourself exactly where you started with few skills added. In house processes exist and nobody wants to change them because they work.  However, current employees don't even know what they really do because they didn't write the poorly constructed code in VB6.   It is really a shame to see the new CEO incorporate all these performance reviews and micro-manage departments.  I guess he should just eliminate all VPs in general and just micro-manage all departments."
264,Dimensional Fund Advisors,Merit is set aside for favoritism....,2011-12-19,2.0,Fas,"good salary
good people, including mgmt. (but it is their decisions that are very suspect)","RDs sit in cubes (thanks to CEO)

questionable promotions - not even sure how these decisions are made

265,Dimensional Fund Advisors,"Can be a great place to work at, depending on your position.",2011-11-03,3.0,,"Great benefits, better-than-average salary, amazing building.","Management within their Marketing & Communication department is dysfunctional. Leadership within tends to be indecisive, and many managers are micro-managers, unapproachable, and/or horrible communicators. Lots of stress constantly and many fires to put out, but mostly because of their quirky direction."
266,Dimensional Fund Advisors,"Great experience if you're in a higher role; otherwise, don't even bother",2011-02-28,1.0,,"- Benefits are fairly decent (healthcare, gym reimbursement)
- Work hours aren't too bad, particularly for lower level employees
- Very talented and bright employees","- POLITICAL - company claims to try to be fair and cares, but it's really a sham.  Incredibly biased evaluation of employees.  If you're in the ""in"" crowd with your boss, you are golden.  If you aren't, don't even bother expecting anything at all. 
- HR is horrible.  They don't do anything and the leadership at the top is SO bad.  Higher up VPs take complete advantage of the system and no one will say a word to them.  
- Morale is horrible.  Everyone is waiting for the remaining founder to sell the company, so they can cash out and leave.  The founder pulled a fast one and moved the company headquarters to Austin from Santa Monica and most people were forced to move because the economy was in shambles and they didn't have the choice.  I know first hand that there will be an exodus once the company is sold and all the VPs can dump their shares."
267,Dimensional Fund Advisors,Growing Company with Many Political Issues...Counterproductive Corporate Culture,2010-08-21,1.0,,"Great benefits; some smart, interesting people work within the company; great cafeteria.  International locations.  Company looks shiny and pretty to outsiders.  Company does not waver from core values, and ""stays the course"" with investment philosophy even in tough economical times.  CEO has lunch with employees periodically and seems to take an interest in employees.  Beautiful building and comfortable (physical) environment.  Pay is above average.","Extremely political, corporate culture pits departments and employees against each other.  Poor communication between middle management and employees.  Immature company with growing pains that hires competent (even the best) people to help grow the company, but seems completely uninterested in making things run more efficiently.  No direct communication; much employee feedback is second- or third-hand information, and almost never delivered by the person having an issue with the employee (have observed this in multiple departments...seems to be related to corporate culture).  Management holds onto negative information, doesn't address it in a timely fashion, and doesn't share it with responsible parties until situations have escalated and jobs are on the line.  Proactive problem solving is not the norm.  

Underling employees serve as a ""life support system"" for PhDs, ""Regional Directors"" and ""Vice Presidents,"" and are treated as ""expendable.""  Titles are a big deal, and if you don't have the ""right"" title, people literally won't talk to you.  There are many ""VPs"", and there is brutal competition to attain this rank. 

Communication channels are not clear, and if you overstep the secret boundaries, you'll get your hand slapped.  Culture is very ""cloak and dagger,"" with many mini-meetings that exclude people who should be included in decision making, frequently vilifying one employee who is ceremoniously sacrificed in order to appease management.  It's completely acceptable to walk all over others and destroy their careers in order to advance within the company, and it's impossible to know who to trust.  With little turnover in the long-term employees, there are many secret political connections which are impossible to navigate while remaining productive and upbeat.  Many employees feel a great sense of job insecurity and walking on eggshells with little positive feedback.  

Some PhDs are incapable of accepting feedback, suggestions, and the work of non-PhDs, targeting the non-PhDs for termination if they make suggestions that cast the PhD as anything but the expert.  When things go wrong, an employee is targeted and blamed for things they may not have even been involved in.  Corporate culture feels like an episode of ""The Apprentice"" or ""Survivor,"" with employees being voted ""off the island"" by others who are completely unaware of an individual employee's day-to-day performance.

I saw another review which cited ""team culture"" with long-term employees, and I did not find that to be the case at all...even when there is a sense of team within a workgroup, I have seen management intervene and disparage a member of the group, turning others against them and destroying the cohesiveness of the team.  I have worked for larger, well-established companies in the past, and I have NEVER seen this.

Also, your educational credentials must be ""pretty.""  Some of my colleagues cited feeling like second-class citizens because they didn't get their degree, MBA, or other advanced degree from the ""right"" university.  Dimensional is very big on outward appearances.  

HR claims to have an open-door policy, but the political environment means you're putting your neck on the chopping block if you try to give feedback.  Many employees cite not being able to trust HR in employee relations issues (they are great with benefits, though).  Semi-annual review process is easily manipulated and completely ineffective, and allows for personal bias on the part of the supervisor or manager."
