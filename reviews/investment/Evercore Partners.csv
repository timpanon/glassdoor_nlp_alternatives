69,Evercore Partners,Not What I Signed Up For,2021-03-18,1.0,"Analyst (Year II), Private Funds Group",The salary is pretty high for a placement agent group,"Everything besides salary. Even with the salary, if you think about how many hours you are working your hourly rate is definitely below minimum wage. 

- Work/Life Balance - Nonexistent. In my experience, the hours were not even spent on any revenue-generating client. Instead, most of my time was spent appeasing a demanding client that ultimately was not going to generate any meaningful revenue for the firm. The work was not useful or mentally stimulating by any means. I found that extremely late nights / weekend work was the norm and that during the day there was never time to leave the desk for a break.
- Training/Mentorship - Nonexistent. You will be held to impossibly high standards and either ignored or berated by senior team members if you ask for support. They also don't invest in the tools or resources needed to support the junior team and have a stingy mentality, though this was likely not specific to the PFG group.
- Misleading - They are not a trustworthy or truthful employer. I interviewed remotely and did diligence on the role by asking questions about work/life balance and mentorship. Once I started the job, basically everything they had told me proved false. I came to this job from a bulge bracket investment bank where I also worked long hours and was shocked at the difference in attitude and culture between that role and Evercore PFG."

Most MDs and SMDs are lovely, people. but the firm's management ruins everything. The firm ties you to your desk and even if you are accruing OT and leave 1hr early on a Friday you will get scolded. They took away any ability to telework for the assistants, but expect you to answer emails after hours. The EAs are treated as guilty and liars, ever though their track records say otherwise. They are aware of managers who yell at their assistants and call them names, but will not step in because the managers bring in too much money. They also have a track record of sheilding managers when admins bring attention to sexual harassment and emotional harassment. Furthermore, they make you sit through a harassment training stating we do not ""discriminate based on title,"" but they certainly do. EAs who want respectable management should not work here."

People are approachable, even at the very top, if you are willing to be confident, outgoing, and professional. The top executives recognize talent and WILL notice you if you know your stuff inside and out. I work very closely with top partners at the firm and I can’t say enough wonderful things about them- and these are people who have enormous accomplishments with world recognition. The company makes a genuine effort to enforce a sense of community regardless of your level. If you believe in the saying that working hard will eventually get you somewhere, then work here. If you study and work the long hours, you will move up. That’s how life works and Evercore strongly values commitment and loyalty to excelling in your craft. This company has strong values and it shows in their talent. Great benefits, solid salary, and wonderful growth opportunities. I look forward to building my career with them.","Long work hours, work becomes life but you still love it. This firm values devotion to excellence- the executives come from intense backgrounds and lots of success. If you don’t put work first, you won’t survive.

Great culture and opportunity to work on some of the biggest deals,"The lifestyle can be grueling at times but it is nothing unusual compared to other places on Wall Street. The firm is also growing very fast and must work to keep its collegial, boutique culture going forward"

228,Evercore Partners,Investment Banking done in an old school manner.,2014-08-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Evercore is a great place to start a career as an investment banking analyst or associate. They offer relatively higher compensation, a collegial  work environment, high profile deals, and more responsibility on projects.",The company is only 15+ years old and still growing its partner ranks through external hires. It will be telling to see how it develops its internal talent.

235,Evercore Partners,The Mexico City office needs rehabilitation and integration with Evercore global,2013-06-10,2.0,Analyst,Exposure to leading economic thinkers in Mexico. Very intelligent coworkers. Learned about public finance in Mexico.,"No chance to interact with other offices/projects worldwide. The Mexican company Protego was acquired by Evercore but they basically just changed the logo. Most people still refer to the company as Protego.

One HR person for the entire office. This means no training/professional development. The HR rep is strictly for hiring/benefits.

No documentation/knowledge management/project management processes. This means every project starts from scratch. Lots of brain drain because people leave. Habitually late on deadlines (part of Mexico in general). We were actually calling former employees for help. People's idea of knowledge management is printing a prior project and putting it on a bookshelf.

Unreal amount of time in the office. People don't care what you get done, they just want to see butts in seats. Work-from-home/flex time is unheard of. If you have to finish something for a Monday deadline they ask you to come in on Saturday instead of doing it on your laptop from anywhere. 

Barebones IT resources (i.e. we make diagrams all the time but don't have MS Visio, we don't have MS project). This is not an NGO and we could afford to have this software.

No upward mobility. Analysts are undergrads, some have master's. Then they all leave for a PhD or go work for the government. You can't stay and work your way up to a management position - there are no ""middle positions."""
236,Evercore Partners,Great prestigious boutique investment bank to work for if you're ok with the lifestyle,2012-11-28,4.0,M&A Analyst,"High-profile M&A assignments, prestigious (and improving) brand recognition. Still small enough to build true relationships with SMDs/Partners and learn from some of the best/most respected senior bankers on Wall St. Pays better than the big banks.",Typical i-banking lifestyle if not worse (because senior people count on you more). Minimum training and HR practice (although improving). Not as recognizable outside of the finance community.
237,Evercore Partners,Operations,2012-06-05,3.0,Operations Associate,"Boutique investment bank located in NYC with other divisions located in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington DC with a great reputation in the investment banking world.","I'm not sure of how the promoting works in NYC, but the branch offices don't offer any room for promotion."
238,Evercore Partners,"Fast pace and intense environment with a lot of late nights, but overall a great experience",2012-03-29,4.0,Financial Analyst,"Great mentors, high level exposure to senior management, active participation encouraged, working in teams, ability to take on additional responsibility above your current level, incredible learning environment","Late hours, stressful deadlines, some senior level employees aren't always considerate, always need to be responsive on your mobile device and be prepared to cancel prior engagements for last minute fire drills, 5 pm Friday staffing assignments, 6-7 day a week work schedule"
239,Evercore Partners,It could be worse...it could be a lot better,2012-01-11,2.0,Administrative/Executive Assistant,"Compensation is decent if you know what to ask for from the beginning - salary with overtime, bonus minimum, etc.
Benefits are competitive+","- EXTREMELY poor HR department though recent changes relating to HR management shows some promise. Change is slow. 
- Fear of retribution prevents many employees from reporting unfair treatment or other issues.
- Very poor communication from the top to the bottom.
- Senior management at Evercore expects personal work to be completed by their assistants. This ranges from very small tasks to large projects dealing with family and outside interests. This work is sometimes personally compensated by the individual manager around the holidays but often times it isn't. Again, fear of retribution prevents many employees from tackling this problem despite being overtaxed and ethically conflicted."
