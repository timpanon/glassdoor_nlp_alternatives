Shoutout to the SPO team - an absolute sweatshop run by ex-Lehman / Bear Stearns structured products folks who learned nothing about the ‘08 crash besides figuring out how to make more complex financial products…they like to call it “esoteric” or “non-traditional”. 

There are a select few MDs that had a sense of morality, but the majority treat you like a cog in the machine…and you better be the best cog as possible because any mistake will grant you a nice “come to my office” verbal beat down. 
As an example, Guggenheim depleted my mental state to the point that I truly believed I was a worthless human being after I sent a draft pitch book to an SMD in arial size 9 when it should’ve been size 10.

Looking back, it was a great experience because it taught me the traits of a human being that I never want to become. Shoutout Gugg SPO for allowing me to see what it’s like to be truly miserable and greedy from the outside. 

I am so happy I am not an employee at guggenheim anymore. Life is precious. Be cognizant of how you spend it."

133,,"Limited diversity, employee cultivation, or upward mobility",2019-03-15,3.0,Senior Portfolio Analyst,"The vacation benefits are great, other benefits are average with the industry, and the company has a very fancy and elaborate yearly holiday party.","Diversity and inclusivity of race, culture, and gender is almost non-existent; hiring practices show a strong preference for a homogeneous employee population. When my team was hiring for the first time after I started, I mentioned my concerns about diversity to my manager and was told that it was just the nature of the investment industry and its limited applicant pool—though, I have witnessed this to not be true with the candidates I interviewed for the role and at other investment firms for which I’ve worked.

Additionally, management has no interest in cultivating or retaining employees, despite offering a modest tuition reimbursement program. Continuing education (MBA, CFA, etc.) is seen as not adding value to the role for which you were hired, your upward mobility, or the organization as a whole (as explicitly stated by my manager upon my graduation from an MBA program). It’s an extremely unfortunate and short-sighted philosophy."

- Pay is slightly above market rate but because they are a mid size firm who's competing with the BBs. Pay is more dependent on firm performance rather than your personal contributions. E.g. WSO would have comp details for front office roles.
-Work life balance is there but it really depends on which group you are in. E.g. Back office roles have better hours than front office. There's no overtime pay.
-Full stocked kitchen for drinks and snacks. However they have been cutting back due to ""budget cuts"".
- Benefits meets industry standards within the financial services industry. 401k (charles schwabs) match and good investment options (e.g. vanguard funds) and you get 15 vacation days. (18 after 2 years)
- Opportunities to transfer to a different groups or offices are there. It is possible but difficult to do so. Many people end up leaving.
- Office Gym ($20 a month)","-Google ""Guggenheim Scandal"" and you'll see the internal issues at hand. Political promotions which is not based on merit but based on connections.
-High turnover. Based on this you may end up working with a difficult manager who has a very bad management style. (e.g. doesn't want to do the work but pushes paper around) These bad apples need to go but upper management doesn't bother to see down. They only look upwards.
- Long hours depending on which group you are in and who you work for. I can see a lot of overworked stressed out employees at night. HR presence is pretty absent and they don't really account for their employees in this regards as there's no time management system in place.
- Very siloed within groups. Everyone works in their own groups and collaboration is very difficult to accomplish as everyone does it their own way.
- Promotions are only available if someone leaves or the firm groups. (E.g. you do get the ""senior"" title but you still do the same thing but that's typical at most firms.)
- There's diversity but only at the lower levels. 
- Technology is outdated.

Additionally as forward thinking as the company is in some regards, it seems to not acknowledge its responsibility to keep up with the modern times -- such as a flexible work schedule policy or a way to track hours for working moms working from home and staying late...many managers still have an archaic view that face time while he is there is what matters, not your product output.

I probably did maybe two hours of actual work a day, if that. When I tried to add value somehow, I just got this feeling like it wasn't appreciated and I was ""rocking the boat.""

·         All major architecture and design implemented by third-party, middle-level consultants and contractors.

·         In-house resources promoted based on nepotism, politics, and almost never based on technical experience or competence. People who consistently outperform and design solutions based on best practices are not rewarded for their contributions, unless they get involved in political bickering.

·         Many teams rely on promotions granted for pleasing their bosses. In turn, they hire even less knowledgeable staff, so as not to be challenged by strong technical talent. This results in inability to troubleshoot even most basic infrastructure issues without involving third party consultants, who quickly isolate issues within minutes.

·         Frequent, unexplained, completely avoidable outages and other network issues; with no root cause analysis or explanation offered. Expensive monitoring systems deployed, but misconfigured due to lack of resources and knowledge.

·         No accountability for misconfigured networks and improper architectural solutions, with some issues ongoing for years and affecting many IT teams.

·         Almost no professional certifications held by majority of the IT staff, including top management and PMs.

·         CIO only concerned about his own political games. Has zero concern over morale issues, talent wanting to leave, or constant misconfigurations and inappropriate solutions.

·         Chief Information Officer as IT leader lacks any vision or knowledge of present day IT, instead relying on frequent reorganizations of the department, and sidelining people who point out legitimate issues.

·         Most solutions architected in silos and not a part of overall vision, since CIO/CTO are completely absent and use the recently-anointed teams of PMO/CSO/""Architects"" to override design decisions and communicate “policy”.

·         Legacy IT practices are touted as great initiatives.

·         No IT budget due to senior management investing in a vaporware sales pitches, and sidelining in-house IT. All recent personnel are expensive contractors, due to lack of an “approved” budget.

Dealing with co-workers constant incompetence, not showing up to work in a timely fashion (drastically, I'm not talking about 10-15 minutes late here - I'm talking 2 hours, leaving an hour or two early, etc.), not showing up to work at ALL (""Missed my train, I'm going to stay home today"" - this was at least once or twice a week), and constant screw-ups which I needed to fix all across the board.  With Sr. level employees working like this, it's frustrating, and creates additional work for everyone on the team.  Management didn't address this at all after several soft complaints about it.

Weak PTO.  10 Days until you're there for 5 years.  This isn't consistent within the industry (I constantly see at least 15-18 days standard).  But, the unlimited sick days makes up for this a little.

Unclear about policies and communication.  People were terminated without warning, and under uncertain conditions of policies leading up to termination."
307,,"Lack of IT Leadership. A great place to watch your career die, unless you play the politics.",2014-09-23,2.0,Information Technology,"The constant employee turnover will ensure that you will never get bored looking at the same faces.

There are a few very technically skilled workers that are the 'go to' for many of the IT service level employees. These few keep the company running. Kudos to them for sticking it out.","Yearly salary increases are kept low with marginal bonuses. I was very dissatisfied with the 'bonus' that was given this year, due to the fact that my salary increase was significantly lower than previous years, even though the bonus was 'higher'.  There was no compensation for all of the extra work I had taken on at my managers request. The 'raise' ( I use that term loosely) was on par with inflation. 

Upper level management positions and promotions are obtained via who you know vs. what you know. This shines through with the constant 'fire drills' that come in and how poorly they are often handled. Outage notices going out a day (or more) after the outage has occurred (scheduled or not). 'The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing' is far too true of a statement.

If you oppose the status quo, it will be used against you in the future. 

The company has no true rules/standards when it comes to users. If they whine loud enough and complain long enough, anyone can get what they want. This often causes IT to be pulled into the last minute 'high priority' issues, which in turn stops their work and causes other downstream problems that they will undoubtedly be blamed for. 

Management might as well be non existent. The lack of response from high level management is not only laughable, but infuriating. When a project or issue resolution is hinging on approval/knowledge that only management can provide, it can often take days to get a reply. 

All of these management issues are displayed front and center by the fact that the corporate budget for the (almost) 2 years has yet to be approved."
308,,Daily Fire Drills. Management Unaware of Anything,2014-09-23,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Good people on your own level.,"Fire drill every day. Management will not say no to any client request.  Management wants ""facetime"" but is never there. No training at all. Expect to work long nights with no compensation.

309,,Guggenheim Partners,2014-09-20,5.0,,Great company culture. They have a nice mix of social events. Pay is competitive. As the company continues to grow I'm sure they will continue to up the pay.

The executives feel a little bit distant from the rest of the company.
310,,IT Department has political land mines and lacks vision or strategy. Where is the CTO/CIO?,2014-09-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Smart engineers from various industries converge to form the IT department.

Some (employees and contractors) desire to change the environment for the better.

Clean and safe working environment with plenty of smiling faces.

Technology solutions in line with competitors within the Fortune 500.

Great benefits for full time employees (consistent bonus, PTO, work flexibility if you perform well, great health insurance, 401K with matching, some travel if desired, IT training, free meals if you have to work late, etc.).","Hands down one of the worse places I have worked due to lack of communicating strategic vision by upper management (CTO/CIO) to ""Managing Directors"" and then down to team leads and IT staff. IT is just trying to “keep the lights on” rather than innovate and move into a hybrid cloud. This approach leads to constant ""outages"" and never ending ""finger-pointing"" coupled with the legacy approach to managing IT.

IT upper management (CTO/CIO) does not have a partnership with the business but rather conforms to any business IT request due to prior lack of performance (and the need to overcompensate by just saying yes to everything rather than thinking strategically). Therefore, project managers and IT staff complete mediocre undocumented work and the cycle continues.

No enterprise architecture group therefore configurations from different IT teams do not integrate seamlessly and best practices are often overlooked because of the need to complete a project quickly and on time.
 
Political interests of individuals at the “Managing Director” level override sound IT processes and collaboration leading to IT silos, lack of communication, and unmotivated IT staff.

IT does not work directly with technology vendors; rather uses ""approved"" vendors who offer exaggerated hourly bill rates but produce mediocre consultants and mid-level engineers who often cause more harm than help.

Rarely notice CIO/CTO interact with “Managing Directors” to provide vision statements and strategy. Therefore, management does not know what to tell staff about future technology decisions. This leads to high turnover and frustration for those who stick around. Also, disruptive but transformative ideas are overlooked and “swept under the rug”. Then, the parties involved in the recommendations are regularly isolated and eventually “demoted"" or “terminated”. Simultaneously, the infrastructure becomes increasingly unstable and less secure each day."

319,,Think of Guggenheim as a 2000+ employee start-up.,2014-03-08,4.0,Senior Financial Analyst,"They take care of you.  Even in 2008 when other (mostly public) financial firms were massively laying off people, Guggenheim didn't lay off anyone.  One of the advantages of being a private firm-- no public shareholders to pressure you...  (Our bonus and salaries didn't do that well, but it was better than being unemployed that's for sure...).  They try to move you around to other parts of the firm if they need to trim down your business unit, which has happened to me and many other people I know within the firm.  Great perks like free Vitamin Water/Soda and food in the pantries on every floor.  We moved to a new building in 2013 so the place is very clean and new and nice.  (I worked here for 7 years, our old office had more personality but it was cramped and just didn't work for the growth/size of our firm).  A lot of the business units work independently, which is a pro and a con:  each one can be drastically different in terms of culture-- so I can't tell you about XYZ department and how it is there if I work in ABC department.  For example, the Investment Banking division is a mystery to me (that's the group run by ex-Bear Stearns CEO Alan Schwartz): they are off in their own secluded world (part of that is due to the securities law (""Chinese Wall"") and exists at any Wall Street firm).","Chaotic (typical of fast growing startups), except this ""start-up"" is 2000+ employees and still growing (mostly via acquisitions):  This means your role will not be clearly defined, management will be chaotic and you basically have to self-manage.  If you need structure and hand-holding, this is definitely NOT the place.  Think: it's a huge start-up.  If you like that, you'll like it here and thrive and grow with the firm.

Any financial firm has ""managers"" who aren't actually great managers (managing people and work)-- they just got there because they are good at what they do and/or make money for the firm.  Guggenheim is no different: managers here don't know how to manage/lead.  It's a bit of a mess, but some how the firm makes a lot of money and keep growing, so something *is* working but a textbook management person would say this is a disaster..."

Since it's privately-owned, with 50% employee ownership, there is a deep sense of stewardship and an extra motivation. The compensation system rewards top performers very fairly - the difference is, at Guggenheim, top performers have the ability to reach their potential - unlike the big behemoth financial services firms.","If you can't roll-up your sleeves and think harder than ever before, this isn't a good fit for you. A non-bureaucratic environment with lots of activity means you have to take initiative and not wait for people to tell you specifically what to do. It's dynamic, which can cause some people problems.
