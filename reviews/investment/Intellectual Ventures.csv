Most leaders act out of fear and insecurity, and simply agree with the person directly above them on the management chain. A lot of bullying and internal politics...I think mostly because there's not much else to do. 

The work is extremely boring. There's not much going on at the company, so most employees are bored and spend their days trying to find random tasks to keep them busy. I'd even see people just sleeping at their desks! 

The lack of meaningful work makes IV a very unfulfilling place to work for most people, especially people who work on the management/operations side (not in the lab).

There's also no long-term vision for the company and it seems like its future is very unstable, but management rarely acknowledges this reality and does not communicate anything with employees."

I joined a women's mentoring circle in my first month and had the opportunity to get to know women from across IV in all levels of management (VP to associates)-from R&D, Legal, Finance, HR etc.  That ongoing and supportive group helped my onboarding process immensely. I love attending the frequent employee info sharing sessions where I can learn about some of the different research and inventions as well. Last week I attended a great session where I learned about the device the Lab is developing which rapid diagnoses cervical cancer in low resource settings and later that day I was in the Lab talking to interns working on assays that rapid diagnose malaria. There's work happening at IV that can really impact lives-1st world and developing world. I love that they take big risks (like TerraPower) that have huge potential impacts across entire sectors.

Our executive leadership is transparent to the extent they are able regarding expectations, performance, achievements, failures and future aspirations.
We are always looking at long term solutions that all groups can integrate with.  We are a dynamic business with complex business practices.

79,Intellectual Ventures,My experience so far at IV in Finance ... Four years and counting,2015-10-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"IV is pioneering a new asset class and business model, so there is no well trodden path to simply follow what others have already done. This creates massive opportunity, but one needs to be a ""go getter"" and accept that things will fail from time to time which is at the essence of invention itself. However, the type of person that succeeds is one that is strong willed, inventive, persistent and can collaboratively work with others and clearly understand the strategy and translate that into tactical deliverables. From the leadership down everyone is hard working so don't expect to coast along ... its not that kind of place ... Also people who do well are those that grab responsibility and lead rather than being told what to do. The Finance management do a great job at keeping that balance which promotes opportunity to succeed. 
I can't think of a more invigorating and challenging place to work ...","IV is not as competitive ""pay-wise"" as the street so many good people have been poached. It's traditionally spread the compensation more broadly at year end, than being targeted to those that really make a difference and will commit to the long term. 
Given the state patent market, its feeling a little bit vulnerable now, but its poised to re-bound."

There is a complete absence of leadership in Finance (despite having 2 CFOs!)   While my coworkers are good people they generally stay to themselves.  There is no ""team"" feel.  It is fairly unfriendly and ""cold"".  In fact, I leave at the end of the day completely drained....not because of long hours....but because of a feeling of mistrust.  I wouldn't recommend IV unless you have thick skin, are ok with office politics, and the conflict that will occasionally erupt amongst senior management.

- Upper Management is completely clueless about what's going on on the ground and what employees are doing. Half of the people work themselves to death while the others merely collect a paycheck. Some people are extremely disengaged.
- Founders appear to be more interested in pet projects than actually driving the company forward. Frivolous personal projects, special exceptions and catering to upper management there to cash in are some of the distractions from actually supporting the business.
- Business units and IT are at a disconnect on a lot of technologies. Business units are being solutions oriented and do not allow IT to do their jobs effectively to create right-sized solutions. Creates a lot of exceptions to best practices."

The culture of this company has greatly suffered and is no longer a happy place .  Their employees have lost faith in IV as have their investors."
155,Intellectual Ventures,A nice place to work - very smart people,2011-11-24,4.0,,"Very smart people trying to solve hard problems.   If you're a process person this is the wrong place for you as the business changes very frequently, sometimes several times a year.  You have to be good with working with people and dealing with ambiguity and changing priorities.",Some parts have very immature processes.
156,Intellectual Ventures,"Overall it was a great place to work, a lot of unique but very intellegent people.",2011-11-22,4.0,Administrative Assistant,"Salary, private office, free snacks",There is little room for advancement
157,Intellectual Ventures,"Great idea for a company, poorly executed and worse management decisions.",2011-10-18,2.0,,The Lab is the only reason that IV is worth working at.  The folks out there create some of the greatest inventions.  Photonic fence!  Spun off TerraPower!,"There are some really smart people in the company, but all the executives who are now directors were VPs or higher want to build their own little empire.
IV is so fragmented that there are inter/intra-department power grabs and political gamesmenship, not necessarily in the best interest of the company."
158,Intellectual Ventures,"Good people, Bad culture",2011-08-13,2.0,,Individual people can be really nice and smart. Personal interactions can be satisfying on a social level. Salary is generous.,"Despite the interesting people working there, the overall culture is not good. There is a pervasive culture of disrespect from the top down (the new President excepted). It is okay for many teams to do almost nothing, or work that has little or no value. There is a large amount of waste in the company which is tolerated, and at times encouraged. Although many people are good to interact with socially, there is no sense of teamwork or common goals overall."
159,Intellectual Ventures,Aggressive management style.,2011-07-05,2.0,,"Atmosphere is ""electric"" with ideas, they have some really hard working, brilliant people with whom working can be a joy.","People who contributed little early on in their tenure have managed to wave their hands long enough in ""cloudy"" euphemism, to ride their early contributions out for years. In other words, their usefulness has long since passed, but someone(s) high up the food chain believe that certain people can strike lightening multiple times.  In the process of doing this, they have frustrated hundreds of people. 

Funding is not an issue for IV, they love shiny objects, believe that strategy is something you must execute on rather than choose not to do, and they fail to see that which you choose NOT to do is equally, if not more strategic than chasing the comments in some magazine, or article recently read.  

I don't believe that IV have come to terms with who they are, and what their value proposition is.  Oh, they have mission statements and corporate goals, but I believe the company is still going through an identity crisis.  Are they litigation specialists? Are they patent trolls? Are they an invention company? Are they a fund company? They still have not settled on anything resembling a hedgehog concept.     

The executive team is still undergoing the storming stage.  Performing is quite a ways out, as additional changes need to be made.     

In closing, there is little worklife-balance.  If there is one piece of advice you can take away from this writing: if you join IV, do not expect family to come first, second or third... they are dead last.  With that said however, I do believe that IV can be a decent place to work, you just need to get in to the right group."
