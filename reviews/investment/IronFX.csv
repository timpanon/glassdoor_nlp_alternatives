Good and comfortable office
Free coke and juices","Brainwashing techniques and culture
Managers extremely rude
They just care about the money you get into the company
Extremely unethical. Everyday they provide a ''market review'' which is just a set of selling bulletpoints about the ''market'' (the reality is that nobody knows a thing about the market but you are supposed to talk to the clients as if you had a PhD in Macroeconomics).
Every two or three months they modify the commissions scheme (against the account managers, of course)
When I quit the company, they owed me two months commissions and I never got that money.
Long working hours (10 and up), even on weekends."
