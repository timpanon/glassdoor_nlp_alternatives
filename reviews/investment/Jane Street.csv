0,Jane Street,A great place to work,2022-04-22,5.0,Junior Trader,"Good hours for finance, ~50 hours is standard but some people work 60 (but typically aren’t pressured to, people just enjoy the job)

The coworkers are great. Brilliant people that are hardworking, nice people that are great to work with. 

The environment is a lot more collaborative and less in-comp-with-coworkers than other shops. 

The work is very interesting and we have fun (albeit tough) problems to solve

You learn so much and are given a lot of trust/autonomy pretty quickly",The job is very difficult. The learning curve is steep and the job can be tiring.

12,Jane Street,"Great Company, Great Salary",2022-02-02,5.0,Quantitative Trader,"The salary is very good.
The job is much less stressful than in other trading companies of similar salaries.
Once you get in, colleagues are invested in helping you get better, rather than just leaving you to figure it out yourself and firing you if you don't.
The training process is very long and thorough.","The contract of employment says 8-9 hour work days, but realistically it's more like 10-11 hour work days (especially for new traders).

- free health insure
- free gym
- free games like ping pong
- above avg pay
- occasionally free tix to plays and baseball","- this is an extremely weird place with very toxic mgrs and culture, either you fit in or you don't; they literally stand and sneak behind your back from time to time to see what's on your screen; micromanagement to the extremes.
- if they don't like you or think you under perform, they cut you
- very hard to concentrate on work, because trade floor is very noisy with traders constantly screaming behind your back, and automated frequent sound alerts
- O'Caml is force on you everywhere even when another lang is better choice such as sysadmin scripts which can be easily done with bash or python; nice if you want to stay here for yrs, but useless everywhere else; good lucky finding your next job
- all tools including those used by traders to trade are TEXT based because O'Caml has no good GUI lib
- free gym is great, except the mouse poop
- love the free snacks in pantry? great, check expiration date
- war posters from WWI and WWII in hallways. what were they thinking?
- some percent of ppl literally wearing communist t-shirts, and even poker cards and message bags with pic of Mao
- you can work here for 10+yrs and be stuck same position, same pay level
- pay can be good but only for small percent of ppl, otherwise when you factor in the 70+ hrs you put in, you're under paid
- they try to squeeze every working hour and minute out of you possible
- no WFH"

83,Jane Street,"Awesome, fast moving environment",2020-10-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I worked at Jane Street for a three month trial as an experienced hire, doing research on a trading desk.

Jane Street is an awesome firm. It's the most exciting environment I've worked in — being on the trading floor feels like you're at the nexus of markets. And looking ahead, I expect the business will continue its trajectory given the growth of ETFs and the electronification of new markets, 

The talent density is very high — people are all extremely sharp. It's more diverse than most finance firms. The hierarchy is remarkably flat — everyone sits together — it's not obvious who is senior or completely new. There's a decent amount of open discussion of proprietary ideas (more than most HFs, less than most tech firms). Progression seems to be extremely fast for those who contribute.

The working day is short and intense. Almost everyone is in by 9 and most people have left by 6. During the day, people are focused — no one is reading long form journalism online, or popping out for lunch.

For those who care about this sort of thing: there's every type of lunch / snacks / drinks you could want. I ate way too many mini-toblerones.","A lot of the technology is build in-house. That's both good and bad — e.g. the code review system is a novel take on how code review should work, but it's also slow and primarily in emacs.

The firm moves quickly. People are a bit less reflective or conceptual than at other places — the focus is on doing good work and moving on. That's also consistent with the sort of work you do — there's less careful methodical research than at, say, a quant fund. (That said, there are cool tech talks / regular speakers, so it's not as narrow as that might sound.)

Feedback & accountability is stronger within teams than across departments.

Partly because there's limited structure, I got the sense there's a small group on each desk that drives the business forward, and it's not completely clear whether you'll be part of that group or not. This is more of a concern for experienced hires than those out of college."

136,Jane Street,Tech wannabes,2016-05-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Money, but nothing comes for free.",They try to be a tech company to entice the best grads and avoid the SEC and media focusing on what they really are - a flash boys hedge fund/high frequency trading firm. Senior partners have too much power and are massively out of touch due to their extreme wealth and egos. Argumentative discussion style. Disgusting wall street excess to the max.
137,Jane Street,Jane Street,2016-04-07,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Lovely people, the food is tasty and there's always something to be do. Everyone there is pretty young and they have a solid culture","Can get tiring, some days are pretty tedious but I guess it's the same with any job. Staring at screens burns your eyes"
138,Jane Street,"Lots of Fun, Always Interesting",2016-04-02,5.0,Trader,"Jane Street has been an incredibly rewarding experience. You are working with some of the top minds in the world, collaborating on very difficult problems. I am a trader, so I am constantly scouring the market for opportunities, tweaking our trading systems, and developing tools to help us trade more effectively. There is very little to no administrative work (outside of doing interviews), and a single hour long meeting per week.

The people here are incredibly smart, yet humble. Think of it as the very top of the ivy league math and computer science departments, so probably some of the geekiest people you've ever met will be your co-workers. However, not all departments are like that and some are extremely outgoing and charismatic (dating back to the days of floor trading I guess). Everyone is willing to help on just about anything, from the simplest questions to the advanced problems. Few are arrogant, and in fact the company will not hire you if you have an unchecked ego.

The pay is really high at the start, even compared to other trading firms. You will have no trouble securing a comfortable apartment in any part of Manhattan on the base salary alone. The bonuses are also high, and they are based on overall performance of the firm. You don't have an individual profit/loss number and never feel that an unlucky stretch will sink your bonus opportunities.

The perks are awesome, I won't go into specifics but you receive a very generous package of benefits covering just about everything you could think of. Breakfast and lunch are catered, or you can also have food delivered on the company tab. The kitchen is fully stocked with food, fruit, beverages, snacks, and candy. Jane Street really takes care of its employees.

The hours are also quite reasonable for this kind of job. You'll never have set times that you must come in and leave by. I work about 50 hours per week and am about in the middle. Some people work more, some less. There are also very few to no days where you feel that you ""must"" stay late to finish something. You never work weekends or nights.

The people are awesome. Everyone works hard while they're here, but nobody gets burned out or has unreasonable expectations. There is practically no hierarchy at all, and little to no busy work.

Finally, the firm has very high ethical standards. We will intentionally avoid strategies that, while legal, are ethically in a gray area. I've yet to run into anything truly illegal happen at this place.","The only weird downside is eating lunch at your desk. Traders don't get up from their desk more than a few times a day, and never for longer than to grab food or use the bathroom."
139,Jane Street,A tough nut with a sweet kernel,2016-03-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Amazing tech: stable, solid, innovative. Decent benefits and comp. Business model proven and effective.","Very difficult to get into, technologically and culturally. OCaml is a big stumbling block for discovery and self-learning on the job, Culture of ""genius"" (people pretending enormous intelligence by refusing to answer simple questions)."
140,Jane Street,Great perks but few advance opportunities for non-traders,2016-03-22,3.0,Senior Financial Analyst,"Amazing work life balance with catered lunch daily, in-house gym and fully stocked pantry. People who work here are clearly brilliant",Non-revenue generating departments could be organized better. Industry knowledge is difficult to apply outside of the quantitative trading space.
141,Jane Street,Good place,2015-11-23,5.0,Assistant Trader,I really thought that the culture t the company was a great experience. All the traders were extremeely smart and definitely knew what they were doing in terms of ability.,Some of the interns were arrogant because of the universities they went to or the type of people they hung out with. Not a great culture fit in my opinon.
142,Jane Street,Trading Intern,2015-11-05,3.0,,"High salary, challenging environment, fun","Intense workload, just an intern"
143,Jane Street,Awesome place to work,2015-10-19,5.0,Assistant Trader,"Lots of things: great hours, work with lots of smart and sociable people, amazing company culture, good food.","Can be intense and physically exhausting, but I suppose this is the nature of the beast in finance"
144,Jane Street,Technologist,2015-10-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great people, and great stimulus to grow and learn new things.
The food is amazing, and there is a decent work/life balance.","Mobility within the firm is encouraged, but only between certain groups."
145,Jane Street,Great Place to Work,2015-06-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Overall, very very smart and hard-working colleagues abound. I was extremely happy working there for several years.","As the firm has grown over the years, the level of general bureaucracy has really exploded. There are a lot of people in support roles who don't add much."
146,Jane Street,Awesome,2015-05-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Jane Street Capital is a fascinating place to work, as you not only have access to some of the most engaging minds but awesome collaboration.",Long hours entail constant mental exertion. Very difficult to gain a foothold among such smart and talented people.

150,Jane Street,worked here for a year,2014-10-28,5.0,,great compensation and great people,sometimes work was too challenging
151,Jane Street,Great company to work for.,2014-04-30,4.0,Systems Engineer,"* Decision making is extremely academic and meritocratic. It's about what you know, not who you know, though politics did creep up from time to time.
* Extremely small company with heaps of awesome technology. You're guaranteed to learn a lot here.
* Most of the work that I did was extremely unique and very interesting. 
* Jane Street goes to great lengths to ensure that its staff is at least familiar with OCaml and functional programming in general. I think this is a good thing.
* Culture is extremely lax. Office hierarchy exists in name only; everyone, including their ""executive management"" is extremely warm and approachable. Casual clothes policy is great.
* The compensation is fantastic and their benefits/perks package was pretty wild. There is ALWAYS food in the office, and their gym is excellent for most of the popular training programmes out there (sports training, cardio, bodybuilding, basic powerlifting, etc).","* Resourcing problems were pretty evident. 
* Interview process was, in my opinion, too selective for certain roles.
* No true career paths for those looking to get into management, as it doesn't exist there in the same form as it exists in other places. 
* Vacation policy is surprisingly light given the rest of their benefits.
* Leaving for lunch seemed to be universally frowned upon.
* No opportunities to work from home given the nature and structure of the business.
* Lots of unproductive conversations about the smartest/most clever way of doing things, which made many meetings run unnecessarily long and introduced many ""side projects"" that slowed work in other, more key areas down."
152,Jane Street,"Software Development Engineering, Full Time",2013-10-07,5.0,Software Development Engineer,"A good salary. Besides, it is a financial company emphasizing on technology. Work rotation between New York, London, Hong Kong is very good.",The only cons I can give may be that its interview is a little hard and it can provide much exposure.

159,Jane Street,"A very unique company you might have never heard of, depend on what circle you're in",2012-06-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company culture is definitely its best feature. An amazingly humble bunch of people with great work ethics and a fair bit of quirkiness. These are the only people in the finance industry I would ever consider working with. Also, the work is interesting and the pay is really good.",It's high energy enough that some more vacation might be nice.
