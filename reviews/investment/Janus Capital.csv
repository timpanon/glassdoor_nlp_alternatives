Most people are great to work with (depending on the department).","Very political atmosphere, and it's very hard to get promoted.

The company used to be, proudly, Colorado culture and quite specifically not a typical Wall Street company. 
 Eventually, after Tom Bailey's retirement, the executive leadership became more and more East Coast financial slickers, which over time undermined the 4-decade long unique culture that was."
37,Janus Capital,Total chaos,2017-03-25,2.0,Senior Vice President,Generally the people are really nice and great to work with.  Home office in Denver is a plus and they have great employee benefits.  A lot of smart people that work really hard but we don't get the desired results.,Too much turnover and layoffs are coming with the upcoming Henderson merger.  No matter how hard we try it's difficult to get any traction for moving the dial on AUM and sales.  AUM has been generally flat for what seems like the past decade.

41,Janus Capital,Happy but...,2017-02-22,4.0,Marketing Manager,"- Great Benefits
- Great Diversity Initiatives and Professional Development 
- You can tell the EC really cares about the employees
- The people
- Work / life balance","- There is constant change happening there. From PM turnover, to mergers, to restructuring. We would always joke ""never a dull moment"" which is an unsettling feeling to employees.
- Sales / Marketing misalignment
- The ""new"" CMO is from the old school thought of marketing
-  Constant random acts of marketing and no real research of what is performing well and what isn't. Employees create so much collateral that doesn't even get utilized. Not for lack of effort, but the market has changed. 92% of content in general doesn't ever get used. This is not an efficient use of the marketing folks time. They would really benefit from more BI and more modern approaches to marketing.
- A limited amount of people make the decisions and if you don't abide by their way of doing things, then you are ousted.

The company puts on a lot of activities to build team moral.",I don't have anything bad to say about Janus.
45,Janus Capital,The Armpit of Equity Analysis,2017-01-13,1.0,Equity Analyst,Biggest investment shop in Denver.  The nicest pro I can give is that there is free soda.,"Janus may seem impressive on a resume but the organization is completely dysfunctional.  New senior analysts are hired based on business school pedigree, or more importantly, ability to effectively gossip and socialize within the office.  Promotions never materialize because experience/hard work doesn't matter here.   The investment team consists of ideologues whom struggle making active investing decisions which is pretty evident when looking at historical returns.  I have never worked for a company with lower morale.  At least in equity research, the best way to gauge whether management is lying to you is when they open their mouths.  The ongoing merger was formed to benefit top executives while bonuses declined and no raises were given to most employees.  Many people join Janus to live in Denver and I would caution against this.  Management will lure you in only to trap you in a city with limited competition.  Please exhaust other options before accepting a position with Janus.  It is impossible to break through the bureaucracy of this organization.

Women and minorities need not apply here.  Most women have left due to the non-welcoming environment and there are no minorities.  The only viewpoint here is one of a white, Ivy League male with a stay at home wife and country club membership.   I am shocked there hasnât been a lawsuit yet."
46,Janus Capital,Soul sucking,2017-01-05,1.0,Nla,Team members were all seemingly cool people.,"Sucked into a job through a staffing agency, paid well below the amount of work you were putting in. Had no drive, and no incentive to do better than an extremely average job every day."
47,Janus Capital,Associate,2017-01-04,2.0,Associate,Very laid back environment for a financial firm. Lots of great people work here. It is not unusual to leave the building for a coffee and meet half the firm doing the same thing. It is easy to have a work/life balance.,"Being ""social"" is far more important than being knowledgeable and hard-working. It can be very hard getting things done as there is not a sense of urgency and a lack of professionalism by employees at all levels of the firm. It may seem great that you can grab a coffee or get lunch whenever you want, but after awhile the lack of structure and lack of passion/drive gets on your nerves."

49,Janus Capital,Great Investment Management Company. Not so good people,2016-10-25,3.0,Financial Analyst,"The work you perform is very rewarding, it has sound and immediate impact to the company's overall objective and mission. People are friendly and willing to go out of their way to help you. Great software tools they are using for their trading. You are surrounded by people always pushing the status quo and going above of beyond, not settling for the simple answer and analyzing more than necessary.","Management isn't always forward thinking. Very bureaucratic. Can be extremely political, you do have to kiss butt to the right people to move up the ladder, which is extremely slow. In the headquarters, in North Cherry Creek, the culture and climate is good but people do act like their poop doesn't stink. This is also noticeable in the company holiday party and summer socials/ happy hours. Compensation lags a bit behind what other competitors pay for the same position in the Denver metro area. Cublics are on every floor, which is extremely outdated, with the size of their AUM you would think they can get better desks for the lowest level employees. There is also no kitchen in the headquarters to eat/ mingle during lunch hours."
50,Janus Capital,Great place,2016-10-15,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Friendly, challenging, results driven, meritorious, forward-looking, socially progressive working environment full of exceptionally smart professionals.","The building lacks a cafeteria, or any place to gather socially or to brain sort mans the interior decor is very dated and depressing, and conducive to creating silos by cutting you off from colleagues."

Well run organization that seemed to genuinely care about its employees.

Decent compensation.","Poor communication from senior management leaves you wondering what the future will bring.  Culture change over the last five-ten years with new senior management rotating in and out has been dramatic and negative.

Middle management is useless (they don't care for the overall benefit to the firm's success, nor their team's success.  They only self promote).  Senior management goes through a revolving door.  No accountability, the firm as a whole is unethical, unprofessional and inefficient.  This firm lacks leadership and good values.  You can tell anyone to do a job, but can you inspire them to do their job? 
I would not recommend anyone to work for them nor invest in them."

Doesn't matter how much you help your colleagues or how many great ideas you come up with. Good old boy club.

100,Janus Capital,Bad Experience in the TA,2014-09-25,1.0,Service Specialist,The People. Your coworkers are the only thing that make the job doable.,Non-existent work life balance. 1/3 of the year blacked out for time off. Require constant overtime and don't allow staff time off to handle things as small as doctor appointments or significant life events. Extreme micromanagement which is done very rudely.
101,Janus Capital,Well past it's glory days.,2014-09-25,1.0,Information Technology,Ofiices are in Cherry Creek with many amenities.  Company has many perks for those it likes.,Toxic culture running a business in decline dependent on a steady stream of new investment cattle.  All products offered thru wrap accounts with the hope that investors signup without their due diligence. Management team is lining their pockets as long as this gravy train will allow.  Assets walking out the door all the time.

Cherry Creek is a desirable neighborhood to work in.","At Janus, during my time I saw senior resources leaving because of incompetent managers within a year. I noticed people being promoted not due to their talent but other reasons.
Extreme Internal Politics"
103,Janus Capital,Only OK.,2014-09-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"I met some really great people during my tenure at Janus, and many of them are still there.  The benefits were good, pay was fair, and roof deck parties with a view of the Rocky Mountains were always fun.  Cherry Creek North is an awesome location.","Shared resources among three different investment management firms is a challenging structure.  The cultures have not melded together.  The hierarchy and many layers of managers make it difficult to be heard, get answers, and move the needle."

Back office staff are not compensated fairly
Marketing department is ineffective
Information technology managers and staff are highly incompetent

The overall company outlook is not bright: It is no secret that Janus makes revenue by charging exorbitant fees to their clients to  hold onto their money and not by their fund performance.  Janus funds are consistently low in performance.  There is always some ""buzz"" created in the news about Janus some fund or dividend having a marginal uptick, but historically Janus outflows mean a ""neutral"", ""hold"", or ""sell"" rating."

108,Janus Capital,A company in secular decline,2014-06-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great location, solid benefits, talented workforce.","The elephant in the room is that actively managed mutual funds are dying a slow death, and Janus mutual funds in aggregate are average at best. 4-5 years of outflows have permeated into company culture. The sales and marketing organizations are in constant turnover trying to put lipstick on a pig - and senior management is too busy worried about poor investment performance to manage any other areas of the business effectively. The company is dying very very slowly."
109,Janus Capital,This company truly lives up to the two-faced mythology,2014-06-02,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good Location.
Pays well but is it worth your sanity?","Favoritism is rampant and expectations of individuals are not uniform or consistent. 
Politics in this place is as toxic as it can get.
There is no adequate training for new employees. They expect you to figure it all out on your own.
There is a culture of gossip, fear and intimidation embraced and perpetuated by management. 
Diversity is virtually non-existent and many of these people will treat you as if you were just another transaction. 
You will not get feedback on your performance. Instead, they will talk behind your back and make you an outcast.
Lots of incompetent project managers who have no clue how things work but love to throw buzz words around. Stop it please! 
This isn't a place that allows creatives to thrive.
