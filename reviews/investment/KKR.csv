The cafe is beautiful and the food is quite good, but there's a catch. Yes, they feed you but that's because they know they get more in-office time out of you. No one ever goes out for lunch or for a much-needed walk. You're in this glass castle for 12-14 hours a day, get used to it.","Zero work/life balance. Hierarchy is everything, it's all about rank. First-class citizens here, second-class citizens there. Also, everything is an emergency. All meetings (for any tiny minutiae) must happen today or this week. Everything is a meeting, everything. It's amazing that people who are so book smart cannot adhere to common sense and debate something over email or a simple Teams chat. Think of all the wasted time.
