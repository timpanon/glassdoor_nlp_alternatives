Layers of mediocre senior and mid-management 

Huge amounts of unnecessary work

London in perpetual decline - bailed out by NYC and Paris again and again - not good for morale

The CEO / partner level employees in London generally have as much charisma as a damp rag. 

Super firings every few months - not good for morale

Losing deals in the UK again and again

Absolutely no respect for work life balance. Genuinely do not care about you or your life.

276,Lazard,Great learning experience being on a lean deal team,2014-03-29,4.0,Associate,"You will get a lot of experience across all functions of an investment banker, because you are on a deal team that is smaller than what is typical for bulge brackets (basically 2-4 people vs 3-6 at a bulge bracket).

I worked within IT, and got a clear view of how backwards the priority's of the company were.  In It ""User Satisfaction"" was the main objective, but all priority was put on quick response to calls and emails, and not on prevention of system issues, like say redundancy in critical systems.  Even after Hurricane Sandy which crippled most of the company's IT infrastructure, there are   Nepotism ran rampant, so if you were somebodies friend, you could get away with murder.  

Outside of IT (you get to see a lot as a tech), there's more nepotism (like ""secretaries"" that have no idea how to use Microsoft office), and a lot of unprofessional conduct.  So called higher ups acting like spoiled children and trying to pass their work off on others (like asking tech support to edit documents for them).  The analysts/research guys get absolutely abused.  I often worked on issues for people who consistently was pushed to a point where they were working 8am to 4am the next morning.  The lower levels of the company are not the place to be.  Sadly most promotions are based not on how good you are, but how much butt you kiss."

Long hours/ difficult lifestyle
Job security

There is a fair amount of turnover at the firm with analysts regularly leaving early for PE/HF or just burning out. Also, mid- and senior-level bankers often leave due to being passed over for promotion or being fired outright for no apparent reason other than there was no MD pulling for them.
