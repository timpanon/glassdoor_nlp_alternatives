24,Lord Abbett & Co.,Growing company with improving culture,2021-08-14,4.0,Analyst,"Lord Abbett is a growing company in the active investment space and appears to make great efforts to grow not only in the US but also overseas. They focus on their product offerings and are strategic, unlike some firms that offer too many funds and products and create new products just for the sake of creating. 

Work is overall meaningful though like many investment firms, the technology can be a bit slow or outdated. At least on the investment side where I sat, I believe that there are efforts to transition to more modern technology and improve inefficient processes. However, like any effort to transition, this process is slow and benefits may not be realized immediately. 

Culture has been improving since the new managing director assumed his role. Because the company is not as large as some of its competitors, it still has a small company feel, especially within the investments side. The company has put in place many good changes such as greater employee recognition and awards and more structured mid-term and year end reviews where we actually set real goals for ourselves and the team. Managing the firm during COVID is a challenge for all CEOs but Doug, the managing partner, has done a great job with weekly town halls, interesting speaker series that sometimes promote diversity initiatives or address current events, company wide wellness events, and a greater focus on mental health. During COVID, wfh policies are still in place and no one is forced to go to the office. Free lunch on Wednesdays (at least during COVID and before I left) All of this makes workers think that the firm cares about you. Business Resource Groups/Diversity Groups such as Women, LGBTQ, Black, Asian groups etc were not that active during COVID but tried to host speaker series or events during important months such as Black History Month, Asian American Heritage Month, Women's Month etc. Is the traditional finance culture still there? Yes, and even though it never bothered me as much, I think this firm is making changes in the right direction even if it annoys some people (especially those who don't subscribe to liberal thinking - there are certainly a lot of diversity and culture initiatives). Still, there aren't that many women, especially at the more senior level. People tend to have more experience and teams are relatively lean. There aren't many junior, young employees because the firm doesn't really have an annual internship program. 

Career wise - I was still a relatively junior employee when I left this year so I am not sure what the career trajectory would be like. It seems like they have created more ranks such as an MD position (right before Partner I believe) so is the firm become more hierarchical? I would also say in Investments, rank depends on which team as fixed income and equities and teams within these broad categories have different corporate ladders. It does seem like a place that is good for anyone who wants to stay long term or retire. Most people here have been with the firm for a long time whether that is because they really like their experience, stay for the good benefits, have difficulty moving to other positions or companies (I'm also not sure how recognizable the firm's name is in the industry), or some other reason but whatever it is, people stay for a long time.

Benefits- I think the firm has great healthcare benefits. The high deductible healthcare plan that comes with an HSA has premiums fully paid for by the firm and the firm contributes $2000 yearly to your HSA. Employer 401k matching is up to 7.5% with vesting over 3 years. Gym is good and there is in-house cafeteria with affordable lunch options. The surrounding areas near the office don't have a lot of diverse food. It's mostly American style food such as sandwiches, salads, pizza, Italian food, bowls etc","Not many cons I can think of. I'm speaking generally here as none of these cons really applied to/bothered me. If you are looking for a career in proper New York, this isn't it because it is in Jersey City. Even though the company is located right on the Hudson River and you get a beautiful view of Manhattan steps outside the front door, you still have to commute over... and decide if you want to live in New York or New Jersey. The firm has no plans to move to New York at all so don't expect to one day relocate to a NYC office. I cannot comment on salary or pay as I am not certain what industry standards are like. One additional thing is that if you want to switch careers, especially in investments, it can be difficult. Perhaps this is owing to the fact that the firm is lean and doesn't have many junior level positions open every year. Certainly, there are people from the client services/sales desk who moved to investments side but it's not common. Also, within investments, it appears to be difficult to move between asset classes. Firm is also based in the US (really just New Jersey) and does not have major investment offices outside the US so if you are looking for international collaboration or exposure, you won't find it here. Like most firms predominantly based in the US, culture is very American-centric so yes, there are biases."

The new CEO is finally cleaning house. The firm got rid of partners / directors who honestly didn't do much during my 10+ years here in the ""Technology"" organization. I can remember going 5 to 6 years here and never heard from the previous partners / directors. No one talked about strategy, goals, things to improve, etc. Every ""team"" was duplicating work, there was no communication, and there was a lack of standards.

Partners and new directors are finally talking to employees, and new technology is being leveraged. I feel the company is getting better after my first 6 to 7 year here.","Benefits are good, but compensation is low for technology employees compared to other technology organizations. If you have a choice, it is better to go to Big Tech or hedge funds if you are looking for better tech compensation.

The company only hires outsiders for promising new roles. 

The company is too small to have any relevant career opportunities. You have partners, directors, and then everyone else here. It is better to develop your experience and skills elsewhere, and then come here at a director level.

The firm is trending younger in technology, which is great for the firm. Most of the long time employees have been overlooked with all these changes, but this is the nature of corporations.

There is a lot more outsourcing now and the never ending search to cut costs like most non-technology companies.

There is a new leadership position that was recently filled by someone not known to promote employee growth.

Be careful with the employee surveys. They are not anonymous, even if they claim them to be."

53,Lord Abbett & Co.,Love it! Wouldn’t Want to Work Anywhere Else!,2020-06-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"At the firm for over 10 years, I have always loved working at Lord Abbett. A lot of positives. There are incredibly talented and dedicated people who work here who are passionate about what they do. People really care about other people here. There has always been a focus on putting our clients first, value of teamwork and being collaborative. It’s probably not right for everyone - excellence is a core value and standards are high (as they should be). Because of the size and structure of the firm you can have frequent interaction and exposure to senior leadership – as the partners actively manage different areas of the firm- and you can have opportunities to work on cross-functional projects outside of your regular responsibilities that you don't typically have at other/larger firms. It’s a high-performing and fast-paced culture. People who enjoy working in this type of environment develop and thrive. 

Our Managing Partner is a strong enthusiastic leader with vision and is accessible- highly visible around the firm, walking the floors, friendly, he makes it a point to get to know people across the firm at all levels. Interested in hearing feedback and in making so many positive changes at the firm. For example holding regular Town Halls to review results of our annual engagement survey feedback- and creating a culture where we not only work hard but can also have fun. (for the firm’s 90th anniversary employees were ferried to Ellis Island for a celebration including a live band).

Changes since he took over include pushing down decision- making to other leaders (an issue in the past), a focus on following principles over rules, relaxing our previously formal business dress code, flattening levels of leadership, investing in training and development programs, supporting internal mobility at the firm, and improving technology. There is a genuine commitment to supporting diversity initiatives and strengthening support in our community. 

Most recently, handling of the pandemic has been amazing – Managing Partner holding weekly town halls with each area of the firm, communicating with transparency, ensuring that employees will continue to work remotely until it’s safe to return and assuring there would be no layoffs- something that is hard not to worry about in this environment. Also holding open and honest discussions at the firm including at a town hall which confronted and discussed the issue of racial inequality and social injustice. 

Benefits are great - include free health care and fitness center; free all day coffee bar and subsidized cafeteria (the quality of the food is excellent and there is a lot of variety including organic, healthy and vegetarian options); ability to work remotely; unlimited PTO; unlimited time to volunteer for firm sponsored Community Involvement activities at the firm; company paid subscriptions to Linkedin Learning and Headspace.

HQ office – on the Hudson River in the Paulus Hook neighborhood with beautiful views of Manhattan. Nice neighborhood with a lot of great nearby restaurants within walking distance.",Nothing material.

Communication from leadership is amazing, starting with my immediate leader up to the Managing Partner. There is so much transparency about what is happening with the company that I truly understand the goals and what my role is in accomplishing them. Diversity and Inclusion is at the forefront of goals as is Employee Experience and Community Relations. There is a constant push to be better and do better, both as a firm and as individuals. It's impressive and inspiring.",None that I can think of.

56,Lord Abbett & Co.,PSA to anyone considering the Advisor Consultant position,2020-05-15,1.0,Advisor Consultant,"Salary- base 60k most make 80k a year (first year out of college)
Office location- nice view 
Can get certified- Series 7 and Series 66 but this is true anywhere you go for financial services as an internal wholesaler or financial advisor 
That is truly it for the pros (as you can see from other posts there are a lot of cons)","1. Management- Managers can really make or break your work experience. The managers at Lord Abbett make the experience almost unbearable. Most are looking out for themselves to try to get promoted, they don’t really want to contribute to your personal growth, and do not want to get to know you on any personal level. Overall, they are really are not personable or have any empathy for employees, you are simply a widget in their eyes. 
2. Training program- the training program lasts for about 2-3 months while you learn lord abbett funds and study for the series 7 and series 66. Most people were completely miserable during these 3 months. They treat study time as a privilege so you have to put in about 80-100 hours a week from work to studying at home. There is also mock calls and a couple presentations in these 3 months to prepare you for the phones.
3. Culture- the culture is very rigid. The hours are a strict 7:30am to 6pm- frowned upon to eat away from your desk or get coffee, very strict dress code (told we weren’t allowed to wear certain colors), very similar people- many frat boys and very little diversity when it comes to race. They are making strides to hire more women but it is very forced. The people who are awarded with promotions are yes men. They are very strict with metrics- you are expected to make 70-90 calls a day and speak to 12 advisors a day and now recently use a screen sharing tool to fit into a point system. If you fall behind on calls in the morning your managers will be on you to ramp it up regardless of what you may have been working on that morning. If you do not fit their personality mold or ridiculous metrics you’re fired. People are leaving the sales department at an alarming rate and it’s a result from management. My advice is to really really consider other opportunities where you will have more growth potential and a much healthier work environment. There are much better places that lord abbett and your happiness should be more important than a salary."

It can be challenging considering 80% of business is coming in Cash alternative short term bond funds.  Compensation is competitive only if you are in top half of sales force otherwise no deferred comp for you.  Divisional Sales Managers are in the field as WS so their is no transparency, they don't travel or support you in your territory at all.  They look at you 100% by metrics and that is it. Not on ability or regional challenges.  National Sales Managers are order takers from Managing Partner and have zero original thought.  The firm has a tremendous amount of risk.

Cherry on top, HR dept turned over and was replaced with handpicked ‘inner circle’, so you can’t go to them about it.  Why treat professional adults this way?

Working for smart, talented people is really great.  Working for untalented people who don't know they are untalented is the worst.

76,Lord Abbett & Co.,Some really great changes recently,2018-12-13,5.0,Investments,"The culture of the firm has changed a great deal, mostly for the better, since Doug Sieg was named managing partner (like the CEO of a partnership). Flexible work from home policy, unlimited vacation days so long as you are responsible and get your work done, and a zero premium health plan are just some of the most widely appreciated changes. Employees also feel more motivated to work hard, which means faster response time from colleagues and less waiting around. Gone are the days when underperforming managers could expect to be left alone in their corners. The firm is also pushing into new areas of asset management and innovating. Communication from top leadership has vastly improved through regular ""Town Halls"" and quarterly division-wide presentation by senior leaders.

At the same time, many of the things that have always made Lord Abbett a great place to work haven't changed. The firm absolutely does not tolerate senior employees who mistreat or verbally abuse junior employees. One very rarely hears foul language.  Managers understand that employees may have families or personal obligations, and are rarely made to feel bad for taking necessary time off to deal with personal situations.","While I am optimistic that things will improve in areas like technology and operations, I must admit we're not there yet. Also the firm is still struggling to gain traction with investors in equities, although assets are booming in fixed income and that is more than making up for any difficulties there."

Most recently, we had a partner laid off. Someone who had contributed to the firm for many years simply disappeared one morning with nothing more than a one sentence mention at the very end of an operational announcement email. 

Mysterious consultants roaming the halls with a dedicated conference room to themselves and regular meetings in the COO’s office. 

Analysts from lesser performing groups are being utilized to fill positions requiring industry experience with managers having little input. Positions that would otherwise be filled externally. 

CEO Q/A sessions where he praises sales, marketing, investments yet absolutely no mention of core services. Many believe this is just another indication that most of ops will be outsourced and ultimately downsized. 

Recent talk of moving the company because of cost savings and underutilized space. I personally believe that this is due to upcoming layoffs. 

Lastly, I was very happy during my time at Lord Abbett and at a time where I was weighing my options, the changes just kept coming. The high, positive energy employees almost never stay due to the environment and I eventually fell victim to this as well. You will be suppressed to some extent.

86,Lord Abbett & Co.,Developer,2018-06-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good location and medical benefits, Excluding the technology , Good overall culture at the firm.","Small firm with too much politics. New technology management is a failure after its 2 year term as neither the business is happy nor the technology team. The failure is due to the fact that it is lead by people who are people's manager and lack in technology. There is lot of focus on managing people rather than driving solutions. Technology directors and senior technical managers are outdated as they have worked here for years and have no exposure to outside world. They cannot drive any  technical conversations due to lack of knowledge . They are way behind in technology and are trying hard to save their jobs by giving non automated solutions to business so that business depends on them for every piece of data that is needed by them. 

Managers do not let developers to interact directly with business and build anything good as this will jeopardize their job which is not even needed in such a small firm. There is a manager for every 2 developer and some of them are really worthless.

  Business users are easy going and are happy even if the technology teams are able to provide the excel based solutions as business has never seen anything that goes beyond excel. The technology team is predominantly governed by project managers who have no prior experience in building any solutions,

There is lot of kiosk at the firm at the technology side and their is no direction. Its a 45 hrs week timesheet that is being asked to fill in at the technology side  .  

No career growth and absolutely no flexibility. People who are confident in themselves have already left the firm or are planning to move out. People who have visa issues and are less confident are getting pressurized to work 10 to 12 hrs at office and not to count the time they spend at home."

90,Lord Abbett & Co.,Pretty Mediocre,2018-01-20,1.0,Manager,"1) Working here is better than being unemployed, or working in some food services industry. 2) Many days off. You get 5 weeks off, which is pretty darn good actually. 3) Working at this company is great, if you are a working mom and need an easy paycheck with minimal stress. An ideal job for those looking to coast while putting in minimal amount of effort required. During my time at this company, I have seen many, many people that are very mediocre in terms of talent and motivation. Some people I knew at the company  were busy doing on-line shopping, booking trips for vacations, or chatting with random dudes everywhere around the office. Much to my surprise, these people managed not to get fired for years.","1) Mediocre coworkers in terms of talent and brain power. During my stint at this company, I've met many people who would struggle with 7th grade level algebra, including some directors and partner level employees. Just look at the firm's leadership bio. Half the partners at this firm hail from sales background that haven't spent a day of their careers in an investment division or in an analytical capacity. Yes, a bunch of smooth talking ex- sales dudes with fancy suits, who used to sell funds to neighborhood mom and pop shop financial advisors. Most of the partners at this company come from 3rd tier academic institutions, rather than the Harvards, Stanfords, or Princetons of the world. I sometimes wonder if the directors / partners at this firm would be able to get a job at a company like Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Citadel, AQR, Google, or some other high end consulting shops like McKinsey or Bain in a front office, analytical position. I suspect that many of them won't even get a first round interview at the elite finance / tech / consulting companies, which tend to favor people with strong intellectual horsepower and high academic accomplishments.  2) Pay raises / promotions / career growth here isn't good, unless you are in a sales position and have a bunch of support from the senior management vouching for your success. I've known many people here that were stuck with the same title, same work, same responsibility, and supposedly same pay for YEARS, with no prospect of growth. 3) Boring work and lots of repetitive tasks. I do not want to labor on this point too much, because let's face it - unless you work at a high end elite finance / tech / consulting company in a front office position, you won't be working on cutting edge projects or tasks that are interesting / challenging most likely. So, the fact that you'd be working on boring / repetitive tasks at this company on daily basis ain't exactly a unique negative, compared to working at other mediocre positions / jobs at middling institutions... But the point stands that the majority of work you'd do at this company ain't really interesting or challenging. Many times during my stint at this company, I felt like I was nothing more than a glorified soccer mom, making sure that things are running smoothly, setting up a bunch of pointless meetings, and checking that others are actually working on their stuff and not slacking off. After doing this job for a couple of years, I felt that actually using my brain to do some sort of analysis tended to be frowned upon.   4) Almost no happy hours / office events. Compared to my last job, there is significantly less volume of happy hours / socializing amongst coworkers. Boring office culture. 5) Company location. This is a finance company that is located in Jersey City, not in Manhattan... do I need to say more?"

It is a nice structure to distribute responsibilities but in this organization, even a small decision has to trickle down from top three partners. Due to this, most of the initial meetings will have no outcome. Each and every partner will have their own small world and follow instructions.

If you have a good connection with your reporting partner, you may get an opportunity to ask a question in annual meeting or holiday party. That question will be given to you and asked to follow a sequence. At that time whole company knows your name.

It’s a good place to work as long as you are ready to say “yes” to your manager because no one wants your opinion.

However, DO NOT let this company's culture make you think that this is what corporate life is like. IT IS NOT. Many other firms are out there with a much better work environment. 

Most, if not all of management was organically grown. They've been with the same company since graduating college. Many one-minded, one-sided individuals in management.

Just horrible.,2016-10-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Nice gym, nice cafeteria, nice view of the skyline","The fact that the partners and managers feel a need to come here and post obviously fake five star reviews speaks for itself. Managers and partners do read these reviews and do try to figure out who wrote them. Where to begin...
Partners are to be treated as demi-gods. I witnessed a brand new admin employee get ""talked to"" because she had the nerve not to recognize an EX-CEO/Partner that came to visit. She treated him with the same respect she treated everyone that entered the department, but she didn't address him by name.
The partners and directors gossip and backstab at a level I haven't experienced since elementary school. Open door discussions about who to fire next and how to build enough evidence to fire that person for non-work related reasons are rampant. I knew about no less than three impending firings way before they happened because I heard department heads discussing them. I saw one lower-level employee get harassed out of the organization because another employee within the department launched an absolutely horrible campaign against her. The managers knew that the rumors spread and accusations were false, but considered the lower-level employee being harassed into resignation collateral damage compared to having to deal with the real issue of an employee who had already harassed numerous people into resigning. It was sickening. The worst part is that even when other employees see what is happening, they have no choice but to look the other way or participate. Everyone knows they will be the next target if they do what is right by reporting the behavior.
The core issue seems to be that the people that survive at Lord Abbett are those with nasty personalities. It's like a grown up version of Mean Girls. Except a lot of those doing the bullying are grown men who make themselves feel important by claiming a lunch table in the cafeteria or forcing ""less important"" employees out of a conference room. 
Major violations of ethics rules are overlooked for pet employees while the most minor of infractions for non-favorite employees result in write-ups. Non-liked employees can be written up for something as ridiculous as telling an innocent joke that a partner or director didn't find funny. A person can become a non-liked employee for just about any reason. Most of these reasons are not work-related. The reason usually involves not wishing to participate in gossip or having a personality that does not fit into the ""culture."" After spending 6 months in the organization, I was left to wonder why anyone would WANT to fit into this culture.
The culture is outdated and ridiculous. There are meetings about meetings. There are fights over which conference room to hold these meetings in. Blame-shifting is rampant. I'm going to stop here because it makes me nauseous to think about what went on during my time at Lord Abbett."

While there, I constantly asked them to hire me, and the people who I worked with also asked the HR Department to hire me, but they refused.  That always confused me because they liked me enough to call me back but not enough to hire me.  I needed a job with benefits, just like everyone else.  The Hiring Manager said that that companyt only hires people with college degrees, which at the time I did not have.  It turned out that it was a lie because there were many employees who did not have college degrees who worked there.  Due to the poor economy, it was very competitive to find employment so i decided to go back to college and get a degree.  Fast forward three years later, I graduated with an Associate Degree.  When I mentioned to HR that I had graduated with high honors and was looking for employment, they never called me back again.  That was the last time I worked there. That was such a bad experience and I still cannot believe that a human being could do such a thing to someone looking for a job during difficult times, especially since I was already working there.

Benefits are industry standard, nothing exceptional.","In retrospect, I played the Lord Abbett career game wrong. I was young and thought that the harder I worked the more I'd be recognized and would be promoted. I was wrong. The harder I worked, the more upset I became that I was constantly overlooked for promotions and other opportunities despite glowing reviews and strong recommendations from my partners. I wasn't part of the boys club and as such had no future at Lord Abbett. If you're a woman, unless you're one of the few token women that they likely are promoting to avoid lawsuits, you may as well keep looking for a new job. . . you're unlikely to ever succeed here. 

The funds, in general, are sub-par. The only thing that kept Lord Abbett alive through 2008 was their Short Duration fund. The larger the percentage of their AUM that went into that fund, the riskier it got. The Affiliated fund was a stinker and the PM's arrogance with his management was phenomenal. 40%+ in financials in 08/09? I don't think he's there anymore but they let that train-wreck go on far longer than a responsible company would have. 

The culture is stuck in 20s. While there is something nice about a polished looking work force, they take dress code above and beyond any other company that I've worked or. Sales force needed to wear suits with diagonally striped ties even if they were stuck behind a phone all day. Other departments had it slightly better but not by much. 

In the 6ish years that I worked there, I watched it quickly go downhill. The management got worse, they lost tons of quality workers because of unfair promotion practices. They should be investing in their talent not letting them leave to the competition."

I would like to start my review with a factual statement: as of my writing this review, the great Lord has a 2.5/5 rating on glassdoor.  Enron has a 3.4/5 rating.  Take the time to let that soak in.

I'm not sure I can add to the adjectives that have already been thrown around about this place in other reviews.  Sexist, irresponsible, toxic are just a few.  I have worked here for several years, and my observations are very much in line with some of the reviews that have been buried by the five star ratings that someone within the HR department has posted.  If you are not within the inner circle, you will be absolutely miserable here.  How do you know if you're one of the chosen ones?  Well, you will have been promoted to partner inside of a year, and you wouldn't be asking this question in the first place.  For the rest of us, expect to be passed over in all aspects of your job here - whether it's proposing new ideas, moving up in the career ladder, or something as simple as asking for a new desk chair (don't bother asking - the firm is only going to devote most of their budget to fresh flowers in the lobby to mask the stench of dying careers).  I can't dissuade you from investing with this firm, but would you like to work at a place where everyone around you is out interviewing and calling in sick?  Where some of the members of the IT department are afraid to leave because the firm bullies them into staying for their visas?  Where several partners from the old regime were pushed out or left voluntarily within months of each other?  Where a senior account rep was fired the day before he was to receive his year-end bonus?  Where the actual portfolio managers are not allowed to talk to clients about their sectors (instead, there's a human buffer that takes the form of ignorant partners or client reps who don't understand our markets)?  Where, in the last year, most of the women in the department have left due to the terrible environment? And lastly, we have a fun thing in the Jersey City office called the ""Jersey City stink"".  It's a fun surprise that happens once every few months when the city has accidentally cut into the sewage line or the sewage pipes have frozen and burst and, as a result, you can't use the water or wash your hands for days at a time.  Yes, the view may be nice, but it sure stinks quite a bit."

122,Lord Abbett & Co.,"Weak Management, Mediocre Results For Employees and Clients",2016-01-12,1.0,Equities,"Excellent views of New York City skyline.  Easy commute from Norther New Jersey.   Free gym, subsidized cafeteria.  On site parking.","A wonderful thing about the Glassdoor site is that it is transparent.  When a statistically significant number of reviews are presented, a meaningful consensus ranking of a company surfaces.  I randomly sampled 10+ investment management firms' Glassdoor profiles/rankings.  I would suggest any potential employee or investor in Lord Abbett funds do the same.  I didn’t randomly select a single competing firm with a ranking below 3.3, let alone one with a ranking anywhere close to Lord Abbett's score of 2.4 out of 5 (with low scores for management).  In other words, relative to its peer group, empirically on Glassdoor Lord Abbett screens as a poorly managed, material negative outlier versus other investment firms.  

My experience at the company was very much consistent with this view.  When I decided to leave its equities business, I saw a company that was both pursuing strategies that yielded poor investment products/returns for clients, and, which had unraveled culturally.  There was an increasingly unhealthy negative employee feedback loop at the firm under the current management which didn’t exist under prior leadership.  Anyone who questioned the performance of the Equity funds, the direction of the firm, or, who pushed back on management decisions in any way, was effectively committing career suicide at the firm. Folks that jumped on board with management, irrespective of their talent, performance or motivation (often it was as simple as self-preservation at the firm), were on the fast track.   

At the heart of the push-back was management’s decision to more or less abandon its commitment to fundamental equity investing.  Under current management, the use of independent, fundamental analysis was marginalized, as were the people most committed to this craft.  Management introduced an (unproven) internally developed quantitative investment model, and eventually overlaid it across most of the domestic Equity assets (even many products that were not explicitly managed using the quantitative strategy).  Management’s hubris led them to believe they had cracked the code to a better way to invest client assets.  Internal portfolio decisions and internal investment research were routinely pressured by management to be reverse engineered so that they would comply with the company’s quantitative investment model’s outputs. 

According to third party fund rankings, after more than half a decade of managing client assets this way, today Lord Abbett is left with is a family of equity products that have collectively generated mediocre investment returns.  Said another way, many of the company’s equity products and internal research are structurally benchmarked to a mediocre quantitative process that is the brainchild of the people now running the firm.  The process was rolled out prematurely, and has not been held accountable for its performance. To add insult to injury, management and the Board’s decision to convert (previously actively managed) assets to the quantitative strategies, has in some cases yielded unnecessary transaction costs and tax obligations for clients, further compounding underperformance.   It is a disservice to clients that nobody in a position of influence or leadership did more to stop this from happening.  The principle ‘check and balance’ at Lord Abbett, has been when talented employees who have no power to change things simply leave, or, when client assets get fed up with chronic underperformance or employee turnover at the firm, and take their assets elsewhere.  

Its hard for outsiders to believe, but during the tenure of Lord Abbett’s current management and board of directors, a period where the S&P has reached near record levels, Lord Abbett saw the overwhelming majority of its domestic Institutional equity assets walk out the door.  The company’s Equity business overall has seen massive redemptions.  Many institutional clients and consultants-folks whose job and fiduciary duty it is to determine where to invest their/client assets, have sent a vote of no-confidence in the direction Lord Abbett’s equity business has gone in.  

A similar vote of no confidence is seen in the flow of (good) people out of the company. Turnover among partners is even alarming.  Many of the best PMs and Analysts have self-selected to leave (or been pushed out into ‘early retirement’ for not being on board).  Some of the people who remain are those given countless lifelines for their loyalty to management-even when their funds performance track records would be viewed as unacceptable at any firm where meritocracy prevailed.  Such extreme turnover doesn't just happen in a vacuum, and, much of it has happened at the client’s loss.  Of the countless departures, included are folks who 1) helped build the company’s Equity assets base, and, former status within the industry, over decades, who 2) had strong performance track records, 3) whose credibility with both clients and management teams of portfolio holdings was rooted in a genuine, rigorous fundamental approach to investing, and, whose 4) concerns about the risks of investing client assets using an unproven quantitative model have proven to be prescient."

(Advice to whomever is writing a fake review you may want to make it a little less obvious.) Management is also trying to scare people from writing reviews by asking people to squeal if they know anything.

 To begin the environment is horrendous and there is no camaraderie what so ever. Everyone dreads being here and you can really tell with how negative the atmosphere is. I don't think anyone here really cares for the well being of Lord Abbett. There are so many complaints about how uptight this place is, but yet management doesn't care to make any necessary changes. It's like they thrive off your misery.

There isn't any room for growth just horizontal movement unless you are in really good with upper management. There really is no incentive to perform above and beyond when your at a dead end. And don't get me started about management they are truly incompetent and most have no idea how to manage or know half the stuff the groups they oversee do. Makes you wonder how they got promoted/hired.

Constant lies by the upper management to try to get you to believe how great lord abbet is, but employees see right through it. I don't think they understand we work here and have first hand knowledge of how poorly the company is doing. It's quite hysterical and it only creates distain for upper management. They also recently changed the health insurance policy in order to""retain and attract employees"" - exact words of HR. They did this by upping the prices across the board and lowering the benefits provided by the plans...

Except in the Lord Abbett version, every time someone points out that the emperor isn't wearing clothes, that person is ostracized or summarily dismissed from the firm.

I was not dismissed from the firm and I happily moved on to pursue a better opportunity so I was going to spare glassdoor my gripes, but reading a few of these self-serving positive reviews forced my hand.  I can only think that someone in a bot tie is encouraging some of the favored sheep to try to stem the tide of negative reviews.  Just like the deception they spew internally, they expect the working public to believe the lies they tell.  News flash, not even the most loyal kool-aid drinking employees believe the lies they are fed, but the fear and intimidation manages to keep them in check.

My first several years at this firm were a gift.  I will likely never work at a better place than Lord Abbett of the early 2000's.  Strong leadership, great investors, positive culture.  The inflection point was October 1, 2007.  The new senior management of the firm and the CIO were completely miscast in their roles.  After a few years of abuse, most of the best investors moved on.  Senior management started spinning thier lies ""we are a stronger firm without them"", ""we needed to evolve and they were unwilling"", etc.  It is all hogwash.  The CIO is an intellectual midget who needed to get rid of anyone who was smarter than him or dare challenge his opinions.  Eventually, he was appropriately surrounded by his yes men.  Fast forward another 5 or so years and a taller intellectual midget used the same blueprint on the sales force in order to blow up the institutional business.

Going in the wrong direction. Firing (essentially) the entire Institutional Sales Team in 2013 was a huge mistake. Asset plunged by 40% and on a downward spiral with no end in sight. Need real new products to sell - UCITs are a joke. Management works in a clique with the inner circle (2% of employees) in control and everyone else (98%) in the dark and ignored. The ""fake"" employee reviews on Glassdoor are disappointingly desperate. The CEO is completely checked out and is either totally unaware what is really going on or just doesn't care. Many people are so poorly treated, it's hard to find the words. Women are not treated as equals with many quitting over the past year."
152,Lord Abbett & Co.,Worst working experience of my life,2015-04-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Honestly, not many. Decent benefits and an ok retirement plan.","The partners have turned this into their own private fraternity. If you go to work at Lord Abbett your a pledge, most likely for a decade. If you voice an opinion, your removed. If you attempt to spend time with you family, your removed. Don't get sick. Don't take vacations. They don't want employees. They want mindless drones. The turnover rate is amazingly high, from portfolio managers to internal sales representatives. Best move I ever made was leaving this sinking ship."
153,Lord Abbett & Co.,"YOU DO NOT GO FROM ""SINKING SHIP"" TO ""GREAT COMPANY"" !!!! FALSE POSITIVE REVIEWS",2015-03-26,3.0,Current Employee,"THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OFFICE SPACE YOU WILL EVER WORK IN. Breathtaking views of NYC, Onsite Cafe, fairly priced a great food, including variety, Free Fitness Center, GREAT coworkers, a few bad eggs, but not that many. Excellent Facilities Staff, HR is still in touch with humanity, although firm doesn't like that. Close to PATH, Lightrail, Bus Stop. Depending on the department, for example Legal :You can easily be promoted as they value their employees and encourage movement. Other departments are not the same, unless of course you work for Marketing and are in the ""clique"". It's also a small which can be a good thing. Benefits are good too, but increases have happened over the years whareas 6 years ago the old regime cared and wanted to take care of their employees. Salaries are not one way or the together. It really depends. I am happy with my salary, some are not. I truly believe it depends on longevity, education, experience and the group/manager/partner you work for. However, raises are NOT what they used to be and usually you are left with disappointment if you aren't In the ""group"".  Many been held flat. Other pros, I am scratching my head, because after 2009 the company went down the Hudson.","I don't know if there is enough room for cons. They are all inside the building. Long hours, no flexibility, if you are looking for maternity leave: NO NEED TO APPLY HERE., you are considered disabled and put on disability, no paid parental leave. ALL HUMANITY HAS LEFT THE BUILDING WHEN THE PREVIOUS MANAGING PATRNER STARTED HIS TRANSITION IN 2009 TO RETIRE IN 2013. Pioneers of sales and other departments pushed out because they aren't like by the new kids on the block, very very sad. Parking is ridiculously expensive, yes you are going to pay if you want to park here and have no other offers to work elsewhere. Upper Management DOES NOT want to hear your opinions and questions/concerns about the firm and the direction it's moving in, you open your mouth: strike! You're out, Partner or no Partner. Don't step out of line here or you will be taken off the line. Greed is everywhere here in upper management and that significantly has impacted the negative change in culture."

Inability to recruit talent has led to poor performance - in sales, research...  If you're not a ""yes man"" you will not be able to function here. Inept management must be praised or you will be black listed.  This is a ""dog eat dog"" culture - watch you back. Compensation not competitive.

It's rather straightforward; you'll get out of it what you put into it. 
Management is transparent, fair, driven, and intent in helping you and the Firm to be successful. Promotions from within are commonplace. 
Working for a privately held Firm is also a tremendous advantage as the Firm is able to take a long term perspective and make investments that will grow the business over time.","Balance can be a challenge at times, yet that's incumbent with any position where you want to be very successful and have the opportunity to advance.

Most of upper management are arrogant elitists with no respect for their subordinates. Most of middle management personnel are not trained or qualified to be managers, but are in the position because of some sort of popularity contest. The fact that employee turnover rate is so high serves to prove the above. Fund performance is weak at best and one would think this would humble those in charge, but it is quite the contrary. A bizarre culture which is almost as  outdated as the technology they provide. It's almost comical to see the micromanagement that goes on right down to the dress code. And the meetings....meetings to have meetings to set up meetings about meetings to talk about meetings and plan more meetings..for what? I don't know. In a word: obnoxious. That sums it up.

The greed at the top is shocking. Fixed income side of the business has done better performance and asset growth wise, but still not where they should be and generally poor leadership down there as well. The firm is not positioned well for the future with no products or PM talent in equities anymore. Having a difficult time attracting and retaining talent. Only people they can get anymore, when they can get them, have baggage. Some pressure from the board, but they don't seem to understand the equity business or how to manage money managers. It's incredibly difficult to turn around investment firms like this once they've entered a downward spiral.

I do see there are many other poor reviews here, and ""the Lord's"" overall rating is quite low, so perhaps I'm not adding much that's new. But here goes: If they want you, they'll be nice, but that ends pretty quickly once you actually start: they're quite belittling and arrogant in ways that are neither necessary nor appropriate. It is a particularly harsh environment for women. Most employees are not given career paths or mentoring. There are no clear lines of authority; everyone wants to be in charge, but few wish to be accountable. In this age of mobility, they don't allow telecommuting, and people chafe at the suit and tie dress code - even on holidays, Fridays and 100 degree days. The firm is really run by a handful of folks who seem out of touch. Projects are frequently blown up with no explanation - a huge waste of money for a firm that is so closely held. I've also seen them waste vast sums on paying recruiter fees, only to see those new hires leave rather quickly for one reason or anther. It's quite staggering. I know that there a fair number of jerks in the financial services industry - but there are also some very nice people as well. Lord Abbett has more than its share of the former and far too few of the latter. I am now at a firm that is far superior to Lord Abbett in every respect mentioned here - and have helped bring in two people. We're all much happier - and productive."
