32,Millennium,Fractured and Incredibly Siloed Company,2021-12-03,1.0,Anonymous,I felt they handled the pandemic well (at first). That's about it.,"Millennium is large, fractured, with no consistent culture or messaging. They hired an entirely new branding team a year or 2 ago to try and help with this issue but it doesn't seem to have made a difference.

If being part of a company with a positive, engaging culture (or really any culture at all) is important to you, I would not give this firm much thought. If you luck out and have a decent manager/department, a somewhat positive culture may be possible, but it really depends on where you land. The odds aren't in your favor, unfortunately.

Many of Millennium's leads/managers etc. come from Goldman Sachs so the dysfunction is REAL. The heads of my dept. were ex-Goldman and it was embarrassing to watch their incompetence and immaturity every single day. They were not taken seriously and it affected the whole dept.'s ability to operate effectively.

Offensive co-workers and bullies who make it clear they cannot do the work will be 100% tolerated -- no matter what tactic you take to try to make things better. I saw toxic employees decimate teams and still nothing was done no matter how bad it became (this was very apparent in Corp Services).

Managers at Millennium can't be bothered to work with HR to handle toxic employees and other problems that arise. Few at the firm have faith in HR to begin with. There was no effort to remedy obviously troubling issues because it didn't directly affect themselves or their work.

The perks and benefits are also not great at this company, compared to others. Most other hedge funds offer you free lunch every day, free health benefits, free gym, many team building events. None of this is at Millennium. Do yourself the favor of a lifetime... go to another firm!"

39,Millennium,The pay isn't worth it,2021-11-08,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"fast-pace environment; smart people; decent pay

great if you've been in the industry for at least a decade and/or you enter Millennium as a manager or director","employees are just a number to this company, the only focus is performance, they really don't care about work-life balance, and if you're a college grad or recent college grad be prepared to work at least 7-10 years until you get your first real promotion here (hopefully you'll leave before then). 

people boast about the pay, but funny thing is when you're overworked and you're stretched that thin you really aren't compensated that much after crunching the numbers. be prepared to have to work even on holidays and have extremely lean teams where you're expected to wear multiple hats with minimal guidance. 

personal and career growth is basically non-existent and things are so disorganized for such an ""established"" company. it's a decent place to start your career and if you can survive here for 2-3 years it's definitely good on your resume, but believe me Millennium is not a place you want to spend 5+ years slaving away only for them to undervalue you as an employee at the end of it."

The team seemed genuine and I got a great sense for their culture. I walked away from the first meeting wanting the job.","The interview process itself was quick but the feedback on a final decision took a bit longer- I don't hold this against the company however.

Management makes promises to lure you in and delivers whatever they see  fit once you've joined.  Limited bandwith.   Back office infrastructure is abysmal. There's some sharp people here.  However, dialogue among people is discouraged for fear of ruining the fund's diversification so little sharing of information or ideas occurs.  Turnover is ridiculously high here and you get the sense every employee is one wrong move away from being shown the exit. Frankly, most people seem pretty unhappy here.

The politics are severe and despite your loyalty to the company, there is no loyalty to you. Make a big enough mistake (and it need not be large) and you are gone. Just had a kid? Bought a new house? Fallen on hard times? They don't care. Cross them, and gone. Just like that. Also, there is no support or guidance. People are quick to fault find and finger point so don't dare ask a question or you will become the butt of gossip as an incompetent who should not be working at mlp. They are also a bit on the cheap side for compensation and benefits."

The firm has a good payout ratio compared to comps.,There is very little culture. Risk controls are right and the pressure to perform is intense with your job on the line.
193,Millennium,VP,2015-07-23,4.0,Intern,As a trading group you have your own little hedge fund within.  Millennium keeps you fairly walled off from other groups.  The capital is allocated to you and you simply invest and trade without regards to overall fund strategy.
