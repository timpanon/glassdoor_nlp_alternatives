Many people move on from Moelis to attractive jobs","In the London office, Moelis has earned every bit of its terrible reputation for poisonous politics and a churn and burn approach to people at every level. 
There are some good people but the average quality of the senior team in London is poor compared to other boutiques and to its own US offices.
Progression internally is limited by these issues"

IT management constantly changes direction, they don't bother to ask the business what the community wants, instead they run with their own agenda, separate to business requirements. 

Our IT team is so far behind our competitors, it's not even funny, Windows 7 and Office 2010, ridiculous! 

Constantly work 100 hour + weeks, not appreciated by management, no room for advancement, no work life balance."

On most teams, it is a meritocracy - if you prove you are intelligent and have the ability to handle the work, teams are more than willing to allow you to run with a project.","The IB experience at Moelis is very binary, depending on which teams you end up working with. There are certain teams who care very little about your work/life balance, professional development, or general happiness. They are in the minority, but there are far too many left after 5+ of junior bankers raising the issues to Management - they should have been weeded out long ago. One bad deal team can destroy your year-end review, whether or not you were the actual problem."

- consistent deal flow and good learning experience (especially for jr. bankers)

- experience is largely dependent on who you work with and the range is enormous

Even though they do not punish recruitment at other firms, the workload is so unbelievably high (even in comparison with other banks) that there is no time for anything other than Moelis."
116,,Demanding but good for learning the ropes as an Analyst,2016-06-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Growing firm with smart bankers and good deal flow. Lots of room to step up and take responsibility.Significant opportunity to interact with senior bankers,Formal training is limited compared to big banks. Also fewer support roles require the deal team to do more (a positive and a negative - see more of the overall deal but also need to cover multiple functional areas). Brutal lifestyle but firm is aware of this and working to improve.
117,,Honest review,2016-05-31,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Great location in Midtown and access to plenty of stores and eateries on Lexington Ave. Good access to trains and express buses. Good pay (but you have to prove you deserve it - they will verify pay from previous employers). Pizza Friday's in a small kitchen.,"Cliquey staff and middle management blocks advancement. If they don't move up then you don't move up even if you deserve it. Bankers and execs don't mingle with the support staff they just stay in their wooden and glass offices. Admins think they run the show and are constantly fighting amongst themselves. They are supervised by a higher admin who they walk all over. Operations teams couldn't get it together if their life depended on it. Place looks and feels outdated in front and back of house. Wood throughout entire entrance space looks like an old school 80s law firm. Back areas looks like an insane alyssum/off white color only dingier. The IT systems are a joke and our inboxes were always hit with spam followed by ""Do not open those emails"" notices once or twice a week. It's an embarrassment that a company that wealthy can't get simple infrastructure issues addressed once and for all. the HR is like every other company that is run by sorority sisters. No work life balance for staff, not family friendly and when one banker jumped out a window, it was only a brief mention by the top brass. Nothing changed the culture and people are still expected to work like dogs through all hours of the night. Don't expect company picnics or company activities with the exception of a company Christmas party that is always stale since nobody mingles outside of their pay grade circle. Not friendly. No one even mingles at pizza friday they grab their food and go."

Savvy senior members who are hungry.  Positive macro trend with more business shifting to boutiques if the firm can retain people once lockups expire.","A select handful of VPs and MDs at Moelis just ruin it for everyone. The firm minus those individuals (mid-level and senior especially in media, healthcare and some others which maybe I'll hint at another time) as well as some terribly pathetic associates make what could be a decent experience, horrible.  It's why the only reason (and i stress 'only' very seriously) junior folks (including associates, yes you read right) join solely so they can get a brand name on their resume and recruit right away. Many many associates and VPs are currently recruiting at funds and other banks.  And if comp ever lost its premium over other places, Moelis would lose all its top talent to other places as well as hiring power for future years."

No shortage of modeling experience.,"Hours were brutal. Get caught with the wrong team and you will consistently work until 2-3 every day for weeks at a time. May be better now as they have since hired lots of additional analysts.

Lots of pitching - few of the senior bankers are any good at  using analyst / associate resources efficiently... Problem with there being many analysts now means that you are less likely to get exposure to good deals as there are not always lots to go around."

High pay if you're willing to give up your life - literally.,"ZERO work/life balance - worse than the typically bad reputation most investment banks rightfully receive. Working all day on Saturday AND Sunday is a minimum expectation even if/when on vacation. As an example, after working two full Saturdays in a row, I made it clear to my working teams that I had a wedding the coming Saturday night and would like to work remotely should anything come up. Sure enough, something came up (something ALWAYS does) so I logged on and started working. I ended up missing the wedding - one of my oldest friends from high school - and if that wasn't enough, I was later reprimanded by HR because they claimed that since I wasn't physically in the office I showed a ""lack of engagement/commitment"" and that my absence caused ""inefficiencies in the work process"" - even though we finished the work ahead of the deadline and it was later praised by the senior bankers and client as ""outstanding work."" This place demands facetime, rewards those who work hardest (not smartest), and now that it's public is continuing to be run more and more by HR and the bureaucrats . . . something Ken Moelis pledged not to let happen when he first started the firm. Moelis is a great place to work for a year or two if you're looking to build your skill set and experience, but anything beyond that is soul crushing."
126,,Tough slog,2015-08-31,3.0,Analyst,Good firm reputation. Generalist experience.,No personal time whatsoever. Always on call. Poor project management skills from many senior and mid-level bankers.
127,,Investment Banking Analyst,2015-07-15,2.0,Investment Banking Analyst,"- Lots of responsibilities for junior bankers due to fewer mid-level layers
 - Competitive compensation (though that seems to be the bulk of the satisfaction on the job) 
 - Decent brand name on Wall Street which helps recruiting","- Poor work-life balance and culture (though looking to improve due to recent tragedies with junior bankers) which lead to low morale
 - Sr. bankers care very little about what's going on with the junior bankers
 - Lack infrastructure and resources
 - High turnover"
128,,Executive Assistant,2015-06-05,1.0,Executive Assistant,The EAs are a good team and help each other out,"EAs are treated with no respect
High turnover of EAs so constantly having to cover 
Management for EA team are unable to communicate and will not make a decision 
You are not allowed to have an opinion you will only do well of you put up and keep  your mouth shut
No job stability I have seen them on many occasions  try and manage people out just because they were not liked by the manager
Very much us and them,  bankers get treated  a lot better and been told on many occassions that they are a priority"

134,,Moelis is a newer name on Wall Street but everyone knows what it is given the history of its senior folks.  Great place.,2014-12-10,5.0,Investment Banking Analyst,"Meritocracy, strong compensation, great exit (and promotion) opportunities and great deal-flow!

High turnover of people 
'us and them' office culture

London offices in dire need of a reorganisation! There is no natural light on the first floor! As an Analyst working long hours this was terrible."
