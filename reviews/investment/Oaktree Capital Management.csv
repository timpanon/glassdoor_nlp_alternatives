11,Oaktree Capital Management,Compensation is Way Below Market,2021-11-03,2.0,Vice President,"Bottom line is that there are still ""some"" good people who work at Oaktree.","I think there is a huge disconnect with upper level management and reality when it comes to compensation. The executive committee still thinks they can pay early 2000's type salaries/ bonuses in today's job market. When upper management is approached by this topic, the political response has always been ""research has shown pay is not what keeps employees happy"". When employees hear that, the perception is, ""we rather pay you the bare minimum so we can fill our own pockets."" The fact that pay doesn't bring happiness might be true in some cases, but the discrepancy is so wide it can't be overlooked. We all work in this industry for a reason and we all have families to feed. When pay is this far off from market comps, the decision to leave becomes very easy."

14,Oaktree Capital Management,Great company with great culture,2021-10-27,4.0,Senior Analyst,Most of the time there is good work life balance. Pay is completive. The office is very nice. 3 weeks PTO. Challenging projects. The IT department is always innovating and trying to get better. Upper management is very accessible. Promotions and raises are given out relatively frequently if you improve.,"Too many ""high priority"" projects. Deadlines are not always realistic."
15,Oaktree Capital Management,It's a circus,2021-10-18,2.0,Accounting Manager,You will impress many future recruiters with the name on your resume. The front office workers seem to be happy.,"This review is primarily directed towards anyone interested in the ""Accounting Manager"" roles which are constantly posted for the LA office. When a recruiter contacted me about one of these open positions, I was very interested. It seemed like a great opportunity to work at a premier private equity shop in a manager role. But I would like to give you insight into what you're potentially getting yourself into:
The reason these roles are constantly open is not because of business growth or internal promotion, but because the turnover in the accounting department, particularly distressed debt, is extremely high. While I was there nearly half the team left or was actively seeking different opportunities. Generally speaking, people don't leave jobs when they feel valued, feel challenged, have good relationships with their managers, have career opportunities, etc. The turnover being so high should give you insight into the environment.The grunt work is done in India by people working LA hours. They work night shift so they too have high turnover. You will be ""managing"" people 8,500 miles away. And I use the term ""manager"" very loosely. The reality is the real managers are the VPs, who sit in their offices all day barking orders and whining through emails. You will have 3 or 4 of them above you who are all very demanding. They don't communicate well between each other so no one knows how busy you are at any given moment. They are primarily interested in keeping the front office happy, with no interest in their subordinates happiness, career development, or overall well-being. They will very happily and very publicly throw you under a bus in order to protect their hides. It's a very disrespectful environment where everyone appears to be looking out for themselves only. You will be buried under paper as the technology is very old-school and arcaic. The way the work is organized is also chaotic - dozens of people are posting journal entries and booking transactions with little communication. It can only be described as a circus. If you are desperate for work and you get an offer, I suggest accepting the offer, doing your time (1 or 2 years), and getting out...life is too short to work at a place like this."

26,Oaktree Capital Management,Oaktree is a good brand name but learning no long term growth potential (career + compensation),2021-05-24,3.0,Senior Accountant,"Spent my career at a large bank and moved to the firm three years ago. Company was acquired by Brookfield not too long after I joined. I was worried about changes/firings but so far there has not been much change which is a relief.

Healthcare insurance which is very affordable, both low monthly fees and deductible while providing great coverage. 

WFH policy has been very flexible during the pandemic. They are going to hybrid model of three days in September which is very reasonable. Even though their isn't much upward mobility career-wise or make more compensation I will continue to stay as long as they maintain this flexibility/balance.","CEO is requiring COVID-19 vaccine shots. Think it is wrong that they would push their political views on employees.

No long-term incentive - previous job gave some stock and allowed you to buy more at a discount. From what I can gather they give ""equity"" to only certain employees but its not even really equity, they just defer salary into the fund. Doesn't make sense as you just get the fund's return and not a return on funds underlying economics. Pretty much this means the PMs will make tens of millions on a blockbuster year and you would just get a modest return.

At times co-workers and bosses can be very political and cut-throat but you just need to learn to navigate this."

44,Oaktree Capital Management,Corporate continues to surprise us,2020-11-06,1.0,Finance,"Well respected name on street
Will soon be part of Brookfield
I will be leaving soon","Oaktree does not care about employees. The company likes to say buzz words like diversity but when you look at upper management there is no diversity. 

Time and time again corporate puts their best interest ahead of employees. Since the Brookfield transaction we have seen them laying off employees with long tenures and given them very little severance/benefits despite many years of employment. They don’t say it but Brookfield will be paying them out based on earnings multiple so it makes sense they focus on savings. 

Just when you think it couldn’t get worse they decided to dramatically increase health insurance premiums under the guise of making it parity with the industry. When this happens during a pandemic, it should tell you enough about the company.

None of this should be surprising as the culture starts at the top and the founding partners struck a better deal than the other partners at the firm.

Avoid if you can career wise as wages are now indexed to “inflation” and they don’t care about employees like they did before company went public."

56,Oaktree Capital Management,In Decline,2020-01-11,1.0,Assistant Vice President,"Benefits, work relationships, a stable environment to work in","Few opportunities for internal movement, if you're stuck with a bad manager, move on quickly.  There are a lot of ""managers"" who serves no real purpose at the firm, and most of these managers do a poor job managing their team.  Be careful about what you are promised, words mean very little to this firm.  Get everything in writing.  Don't expect years of good work to count for anything.  The company's goals are aligned with clients and employees are seldom rewarded for good work.  If you just want a job and don't mind being in a stagnant career for the rest of your career, Oaktree is a good place to land yourself.  Office politics sucks and 100% influences your movement within the firm.  So start sucking up early, because it will likely be the reason why you get promoted or are denied a promotion down the road.   The good people tend to leave quickly, at least that's what I noticed there.  Extremely high turnover in certain groups, our team faced nearly turned over in its entirety during my time there."

There are opportunities to learn about the industry. The benefits are ok. Its founders are well known. Some seem to have a good work/life balance while others are treading water constantly.,"It seems Oaktree has made a concerted decision that fear and intimidation would be utilized as its primary motivational tool. There is not open communication among staff, and management has formed cliques that can only be entered by a few. There is no room for error at Oaktree; everyone is afraid to make a mistake. The intimidation comes from the top down and it hovers like a dark cloud over the office. This creates constant tension that is exhausting. Processes are cumbersome and frustrating as the company has not kept up with its growth. Technology is sub-par and adds to the frustration. There is a lack of respect for people; lots of attitudes, egos, rolling of the eyes, office politics, etc. Training is very poor here. No one has time, or desire, to train others - but expectations remain very high on day one. It's truly a ""sink or swim"" environment. Mentor/protege relationships do not seem to be valued. Management understands the technical aspects of the business but lacks an understanding of people. I've yet to hear one manager accept responsibility for a mistake - the buck is always passed to a subordinate. There are many bosses but no leaders. Lots of self-centered people uninterested in the welfare of others. I assume in the old days the company had a heart - but as it's grown it's lost its way. Those who are successful here seem to be cut from the same cloth. This has normalized odd, disrespectful behavior. Many drink the Kool Aid, get well paid, and hang around for the miserable ride."

89,Oaktree Capital Management,Used to be a Great Place to Work,2017-09-10,3.0,Senior Vice President,"The people, co-workers and colleagues in the firm, are generally fantastic people.","Nine out of the last ten years were great,  but Oaktree has changed a lot since going public, getting a CEO, etc.  Some of the top Managing Directors are people that you don't want to work for, that don't value the work you do and/or your contributions.  The firm has begun eliminating positions (i.e., laying people off) for reasons that seem to discriminate against older workers and others who are at the top ends of the salary scale, and this is really bad for morale."
90,Oaktree Capital Management,Meh,2017-08-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Really smart teams and people.  Management is very poised and professional.  Fun yearend party and summer party.  Very family friendly.  Excellent health insurance.,"Until recently, they had 10 vacation days a year.   Finally, they increased that to 20!  Huge win.  They always work on Christmas Eve and the day after Thanksgiving.  It is not the kind of work environment where you feel comfortable using your vacation.  People love to romanticize the ""good ole days"" and pretend that it is all the same at Oaktree.  But those days are LOOONG gone.  I feel like they are walking around pushing that same tired story and doing things the way they have always been done.  But that is NOT going to cut it in this business environment.  They need more employee-friendly practices, and to quit being afraid to change.  Their entire investment strategy is to avoid risk, and they apply that to absolutely everything.  Per Mark Zuckerburg, not taking risks in this business environment is the riskiest thing you can do.  They need a full revamp of their brand and a facelift on their identity. 

Oh yeah, and very little opportunity for movement.  But they will work the heck out of you."

Senior Management also appears to be genuinely committed to the company (founding members taking $1 salary and still working full-time in the office, for example)

Truly an incredible experience to work at this firm, and I have the highest respect for Oaktree's business integrity and adherence to its principles.","I wish HR would be a little more employee-focused and less company-focused sometimes.  Sometimes seems like HR is focused less on current employees being happy, and more on cutting corners to maximize $$ for the company.  This, obviously, is perfectly fine from an operational perspective, but with a company that stresses ""people first"" it'd be nice to see this play out in practice.  Absolutely no qualms with senior management on this; they've worked hard to enact a lot of new changes that directly benefit lower-level employees and local communities.  This, I feel, is a good embodiment of Oaktree's principles, some HR policies less so."

Most employees have very strong work ethics and a lot of loyalty to Oaktree.  The 'changing culture' that some individuals report here is, IMHO, mostly common-sense practices that most companies of this caliber already subscribe to (e.g., prioritizing how we spend money and trying to reduce costs and streamline operations; what sound company doesn't need to always be mindful of that?)","Can be demanding and stressful, but it's mostly normal, acceptable demands (not abusive).

Some departments are said to be fair. Fair work life balance. Heavy volumes were cyclical and expected.,"Management runs amuck in some departments and does not back up their employees.  Compliance was not really a teaching environment more of a get-the-task done environment.  Promotions were not fair and the reasons behind why one wasn't received were not valid. (You have to be in a certain position for x amount of moths, yet you see others get promoted without meeting that ""qualification"").  Lots of closed doors, whispering and holier than though vibes from the higher ups in that department. No room for growth."

- Compensation is above average, although not spectacular.
- The vacation policy is antiquated but the health coverage is unparalleled.","- The last year has changed Oaktree as it has morphed from a optimistic 'tackle-anything' small office firm to a more corporate, cost-cutting, EPS-driven structure; this is largely driven by the new CEO.
- There is no real opportunity for promotion or bonus increases, as promotion timelines have been significantly lengthened to slow the growth of compensation expense for shareholders.

122,Oaktree Capital Management,Oaktree Capital (Hong Kong) Review,2015-03-14,2.0,Associate,Very generous pay. Relaxed culture.,"Oaktree made some very bad hiring decisions during the early days it started here in Asia. The teams in HK, Tokyo, Seoul, and Singapore made a series of bad investments. Particularly in HK PE team, the performance was so bad that the HQ people lost all confidence in the team. What is left for us who joined later is a legacy portfolio consisting of bad performing companies. Our daily job is to manage them and try to exit. The problem is, there is not much to be done. We have very few companies and maybe only one of them is worth managing. And as a financial sponsor you don't do the actual operations at the company. So all we do is monitoring. And that takes maybe 20 minutes a day on average. On new investment side, all the deals we sourced need to be sent to LA. And because I mentioned earlier that they have lost all confidence in the team here, all the deals were met with deaf ears. In the past 5-6 years, the team here did zero deal. For some of the MDs here that is fine. They are already MD meaning they have arrived at the end of their career. They are settled with such great lifestyle (20 mins of work per day and can take vacation or do personal things any day at any time). So intead of traveling / going to meetings and trying to make something happen, they just sit in the office every day and chill. Good for them. But for us junior employees, you know you will not find another job if you go by years without any deal experience. The model is not sustainable. Eventually the LA people will cut this team and you are left with nothing as you just wasted years of your life while your peers are so far ahead of you that you may never catch up again in a fast moving world like this. 
I admit I sound like a disgruntled former employee. But think about this, if I was paid a lot of money, and lived a great lifestyle (too good) and yet I am still so bitter on the internet, it says something about the Oaktree's HK office. As a matter of fact, the PE team in Asia lost 90% of the investment professional over the past few years. That says something."
