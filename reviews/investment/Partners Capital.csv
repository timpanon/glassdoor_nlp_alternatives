0,,Run as fast as you can,2022-05-19,1.0,Administrative Assistant,There are no pros to working at Partners Group.,"- Salary is way below average. They say they compensate with benefits. Yes 25 vacay days and ok medical alas it does not compensate for the fact you cannot afford to live. 
- Bullying is acceptable and even supported. They claim they do not alas they often promote those who do bully. 
- Lacks diversity. 80% of the employees there are Cis Het White males. PG claims they are diverse alas do not have a team working on it and only care if clients think there is diversity. 
- Post pandemic they are mandating everyone be in the office.
- You do get a $10 lunch allowance and alas often lunch is $10 and change. It is a slap in the face to bring your CC for a few cents. Rather pay for my full lunch vs being nickel and dimed. 
- You will be overworked and underappreciated
- Office management is rude and they are the worst at bullying people. Seems they are bored so they cause problems. 
- Assistants are easily replaced and are openly told that.
- PG makes promises to bring you in and then they tap dance around keeping them."

27,,A back-office perspective,2021-12-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. Exposure
Since everything is outsourced, you will be given lots of responsibility and manage fairly large projects yourself even as a junior. If based in Zug, you can be sure you will work personally with the C-suite. 

2. No budget restrictions
The company has an EBIT margin of 60+%. Buying the best tools for the job is not an issue.

3. Trying to change
Middle management is pushing hard to address all culture-related issues. I think in a few years PG will become a better place to work.","1. Micromanagement and toxic culture
The founders keep making random unpopular decisions ignoring HR's and middle management's requests. 
Example 1: don't expect any flexible working here. With the first wave of covid outbreak, PG made the news for being the first (big) company in Switzerland to force everyone back into the office (end Apr 2020). They then started counting how many employees were actually badging into the office (like at primary school) and kept putting pressure on middle management to bump those numbers up.
Example 2: the company only got to use an internal messaging tool (MS Teams) in 2020. This because top management didn't like the idea of employees wasting time chatting.

2. Overwhelming, broken processes
Processes in this company are a mess. Extremely cumbersome and mostly broken. It takes ages and lots of effort to get anything done. There is no culture nor incentive to fix the issue. Just tick the box as you're asked - if you make noise, that'll be bad for your career.

3. Not meritocratic
You only progress through politics and by keeping your seat warm long enough. 

4. Skewed, delayed compensation
Compensation is very skewed towards the top. Juniors across the company make less than the market average. Salaries explode as you make it into management. Also, keep in mind you will forego a lot of money when you quit since the stock bonus vests over 3 years. 

5. No focus on development
PG is not a good place to grow. It will not invest into your development. The budget for external trainings is ridiculously low and management doesn't support employees' professional interests (or at least that was my experience).

6. No team building
There's little budget or focus on team building. Expect to do very little with your colleagues outside of work.

7. Outsourcing
PG strategically outsources everything possible. Expect to do little work yourself but mostly coordinate an army of near-shore externals that you will never meet in person."
28,,Associate,2021-11-18,3.0,Associate,High salary and compensation for employees,Company culture and office politics
29,,Disappointing,2021-11-10,1.0,Team Member,"I’ve made many friends from this place 
I’ve heard that the environment here is less cut throat than in other workplaces 
A lot of free gifts / allowances","Pay is much lower than market but as said in other reviews, weekends are respected so you somehow get some work life balance

Before the coronavirus situation, hours were already long. On some precious days when you leave work on time,  the next morning you receive lots of emails bombarding you why you didn’t complete your tasks and responsibilities. During the lockdowns, hours were longer and you came to realise how mundane your work becomes which was why I had decided to search for better opportunities elsewhere. 

Feedback were collected from employees every year. One of the feedback I gave was that the same job title here entails a different job scope than the same role elsewhere so you do learn lesser and there’s literally no transferable skills, The answer I got from my feedback was to go elsewhere if outside is where I am focusing. So here I am. 

My team just utterly disappoint me. On occasions when I was allowed to voice out my inputs, it was heard by the team but not accepted. For example, during hiring, the interviewee shows utter disregard for basic courtesy and respect. I voiced it out during the feedback with HR but my feedback was put down by the management for ridiculous reasons.

In addition, the junior investment team members were allowed to show disrespect towards the back office staff. There’s outright nepotism as well as favouritism. In 2021 itself, beside this year being the year of The Great Resignation, it is also the year whereby this company loses a lot of its talent as well as more senior members of the company. I’ve seen resignations from people who has been with the firm for more than 5 years and it’s disheartening to see people whom have contributed years into this company leaving with a lot of resentment."

-High attrition from hardworking employees due to low pay and lack of career growth

- No work-life balance 

- Incompetent team head. Management wouldn't do anything about it ""because it's hard to hire a new one"" 

- Projects are more important than actual production

- Diversity and and Inclusion initiative is BS. Rampant racism. You're a second rate citizen if you're not Swiss (or white, male). Read about the recent Bloomberg article about racism. Low salary and no career progression in the Manila office. We are treated like the sweatshop of the firm"

Great place to join if you can't join another buyside firm for a year and lateral to a firm that compensates its employees adequately.","Compensation is the lowest out of all peers. They ""brought people up to market"" in 2019. Not clear what ""market"" they tracked against but compensation numbers were below the Heidricks LMM AuM compensation numbers for associates for that year. 

Advancement track gets longer and longer as the firm does not push out weak mid-level and senior personnel. 

If you are ambitious, do not join their financial analyst program. Entrants to their financial analyst program take a minimum 2.5 years to make investment associate and depress the pay of those associates, while they also hire people with 1 year of post qualification experience as associates. 

Have D&I issues. 

IC process is archaic, requires 100+ page word memos across 4 steps that often exceed 300 pages. Numerous deals have been lost because IC members threw fits because memos weren't printed to PDF the way they wanted and refused to discuss deal until next week.

Turnover is high with certain teams losing their entire junior deal team in 2021 due to compensation issues. 

Firm refused to pay for tech for assistants during WFH.

Firm depressed junior bonuses in 2020 because ""tough year"" for the firm and then paid out record dividends which went to senior professionals pockets who own the company's stock.

2) Plenty of capital to write large checks as fundraising happens annually across many different vehicles.","1) Pay: More than half of discretionary bonus is deferred. Notional amount including Base + Carry + Stock + Cash only brings you in line with broader market standard's Base + Cash. On a cash basis, the pay is severely below market. Deferred bonus doesn't get paid until 3-8 years later. Employee surveys conducted annually and every year the same issue arises on pay but is always ignored.
2) Decision making: No decentralization whatsoever, except for overtime expenses. 
3) Quality of teams: Teams are extremely lean and junior talent pool is not well-trained - generally from spillover from those who didn't get a grad job in investment banking and joined Partners Group's grad program for significantly less pay below market. Senior leadership often clueless, with a lot of office politics and face time.
4) Painstaking IC process: Minimum 2 IC discussions before being able to submit a non-binding offer. Most competitors do not need IC approval to submit a non-binding offer.

The key to survival and advancement is to kiss the right proverbial behinds. I have seen investment professionals up to the SVP level hide their lack of basic understanding of investing fundamentals behind a song and dance about formatting and adherence to rigid IC processes (less so of the more recent lateral hires). If you cannot cut it as an investor, there just might be a cushy fundraising role for you if you followed my advice from earlier.

High turnover in certain departments so you often find gaps of knowledge and information. Many people just leave and the new ones lack massively in history so cumbersome to get up to speed.

Non-cash benefits are plenty but if base pay is low it still hurts because not everyone likes the forced non-cash benefits. Hours are unreasonably long and everything is always unreasonably urgent on the support side - it actually never got better over the years I was here. The support teams are oppressed pretty badly here if your team's political power isn't strong relative to others. Collaboration is great to the extent only when there is some sort of proper process for projects to be done properly or engaging proper external consultants or hire proper project manager, but most of the times they'd like to build things in house by themselves, appoint project leaders who aren't actually working on the grounds, and actual users not involved, so yeah, results can be unusually faulty with the teams using them eventually suffering greatly."

Base comp is pretty good, even better than street in some cases, but the bonus is ridiculously poor. There is literally no reason to work hard; no incentive. 

Additionally, there is no ability to review the people above you. In my experience, there has been many instances where this would be productive but there is no avenue to do so.

During the COVID pandemic, instead of offering work-at-home stipends like many other companies, PG sent out a mass email indicating that they would not be assisting anyone monetarily to build their at home setup and told employees it was better if they were in the office anyway. This is all multiplied by the fact that the company was hiding COVID cases and only alerting senior people of potential spreading. They also did not enforce mask policies in the office despite begging people to come back. 

In addition to previous comments, I have had multiple senior people claim responsibility for the work I did. 

In total, not a place I would recommend but could be if they just made some simple adjustments."
76,,Egregious discrimination in my department by management,2021-03-08,1.0,Business Unit Applications,I experienced a hostile work environment,"I came to the company last year on the promise of working in BUAP and supporting the applications of the business users. There's an old saying, when something seems to be good to be true, it usually is. Upon starting training at the company, I immediately noticed the company placed in me in housing accommodations much worse than the other employees sent for training who were outside of my protected class. I was the only person who had no bathroom, no shower, and no air ventilation in my unit. Upon complaining about this difference in treatment and the road noise near my unit, I just got a simple shrug from them and was told to just shut up and ""find some earplugs"". 

During discussions about performance, every comment into one about national origin. One morning I was pulled me aside and mentioned that the appearance of fatigue in the office doesn’t conform to the “Swiss standards” of the company, and being on time to a Swiss person means being several minutes early. The condescending tone used was an attempt to place my own national origins and personal standards of workplace conduct beneath their own. Furthermore, I noticed an abundance of discrimination towards minority employees by my direct management. People from the surrounding 4 nations of Switzerland were openly mocked for their perceived stereotypes, women in the headquarters cafeteria were openly talked about in terms of their appearance. Unsurprisingly, the men of Swiss origin in BUAP were not similarly mocked or talked about in terms of their appearance or ""desirability"" like women were. On the my way being kicked out the door, the company decided it'd be worth it to give me a parting shot. I was sat in a room with clear glass in the middle of the whole office where everyone could see from the outside I was being given ""the talk"", and the lady from HR tried to contradict every single thing I said during the meeting. I'd say I stayed past 7PM every single day, they would counter and ramble ""The entire time I was here I never saw you stay late here a single day"", blah blah blah. I told them if I'm being let go then allow me to go, and she continued to mock me in front of everyone and said ""no, you're going to sit here and finish listening to your manager talk about the reasons you're being let go, you should show some respect"". When a company decides to let someone go from the company, let them go and move on with their lives, they shouldn't continue to kick them when they are down for their own pleasure or whatever sick reason is going through their minds. 

Lastly, the company will try to persuade you to sign an agreement to waive all legal claims against the company. Additionally, the agreement states you will not make any statement that disparages the name and reputation of the company. If you are asked to sign this, don't do so. Read through it carefully and you'll realize that you gain nothing from it since they deduct your accrued vacation days, which often adds up to be close to the amount of severance you'd expect to receive. Ask yourself if this form of bribery is worth being muzzled for the rest of your life in exchange for a bag of potato chips ."

81,,Company's COVID response was outrageous and bad for those with families,2021-01-23,1.0,Investment Associate,I experienced few pros worth mentioning when I worked here.,"During about the 4th month of the covid pandemic, the company was sending out emails notifying employees about a mandatory plan to begin pushing employees to come back into the broomfield office in the fall. This was during a time when most companies were doing the opposite and making contingency plans for workers to work remotely into 2021. It was only with pressure from the city and local government and complaints through these avenues that the company walked back its plans to make employees come back in the office. It's bewildering the executives didn't stop to think about the fact that people have families they have to go back home to and don't want to potentially expose to covid. The bottom line, the deal flow generation, the shareholder returns are always going to be prioritized over your health, your family, your well being. The company also has a well known history during its earlier years of management practicing borderline hazing of associates and asking them to sled down steep slopes of the alps during training in Switzerland.

139,,Partners Group - stay away from this company,2019-06-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Used to be a good place to work when the firm had between 200 and 500 employees,"Base salary is significantly lower than the industry average since Partners Group operates at a 65% EBITDA margin, whereas competitors have an EBITDA margin of between 30% and 45%. Consequently, salaries are low. An AVP has a base salary between CHF 105-115k, a VP between CHF 120-142k, a SVP between CHF 150-170k and an MD has a base salary of only CHF 200k.

Cash bonus: Cash bonus is also low compared to industry standards. In Switzerland you even need to pay taxes on the restricted equity employee programs at the time of allocation, which results in very low cash bonuses. In case you receive a base salary increase, your cash bonus will be cut by the same amount in the next year. Effectively you don’t have an increase. Management tells you then that it looks at total compensation.

Equity incentive program: Partners Group employees receive shares in Partners Group Holding AG. However, the shares are locked up for several years, with a linear vesting of 20% per year. For instance, if you receive a bonus of CHF 50k p.a. over a period of 5 years (in total CHF 250k), you are only entitled to CHF 150k because the remaining shares are still restricted. This means that you lose 40% of your share entitlement over a 5 year horizon if you leave the firm. It is a rolling process and the employee always loses and the “bank” always wins.

Carry: First and foremost, 65% of carried interest goes to Partners Group Holding AG (the listed management company). Partners Group employees receive carried interest from Vice President level. However, the carried interest only vests over time with a linear vesting of 20% per year. For instance, if you receive a carried interest dollars of CHF 100k p.a. over a period of 5 years (in total CHF 500k), you are only entitled to CHF 300k because the remaining carry is still restricted. This means that you lose 40% of your carry entitlement over a 5 year horizon if you leave the firm. In addition, there is a 2 year non-compete clause. In case you join a competing firm, you lose everything. It is a rolling process and the employee always loses and the “bank” always wins.

Employees are squeezed like lemons and, to salve their conscience, the founders make occasionally smaller donations to welfare organization. Partners Group employs 1.200 employees globally and has permanently around 120 open positions on its website. Personnel turnover is very high due to (1) low compensation, (2) incompetent management coupled with (3) extremely high expectations for which employees are not adequately compensated.

Discrimination: Horrible pay compared to similar asset managers.
Very little chance of promotion beyond Vice President level if you are not Swiss or work in sales. The firm keeps increasing promotion timelines and has made it almost impossible to get carried interest. The firm keeps making very large special allocations/distributions to senior management, but refuses to share anything with non-senior employees that ultimately keep the firm. Partners Group only promotes Swiss nationals to business unit heads in Switzerland, with the exception of sales people.  

The firm claims that it is responsible for the dreams of beneficiaries. In reality, however, the only story about Partners Group is asset gathering so that the founders and senior management are able to pay large dividends to themselves.

Conclusion: Therefore, never ever join Partners Group. Management´s only objective is to boost the share price and increase dividends. Since less than 20 people – including former and retired partners – own more than 40% of the outstanding share capital, the only objective is to make them even wealthier and exploit employees with low salaries and restricted compensation. Before the IPO in March 2006, Partners Group was a small shop having difficulties attracting qualified employees. The vast majority of your compensation was equity options and from 2008 onwards equity options and shares of Partners Group. It only mattered when you joined the firm (how many equity options and equity you got). Forget the big and shining brand that Partners Group is today. Many seniors that have joined before the IPO are retiring or have already retired because the stock rose twelve-fold since the IPO in 2006 (from CHF 63 to CHF 750 per share) and made many of them multi-millionaires ranging between CHF 20m and CHF 500m. It was the equity story Partners Group.

To conclude, never ever consider even applying at Partners Group. Do stay away from this company!!!!!"
140,,Cares about its people; growth opportunities for employees,2019-05-06,5.0,Senior Vice President,"Partners Group is a great place for a long-term career in private markets. The firm provides a lot of exposure (internal and external) for young professionals. Partners Group is a unique global platform in an industry that will face consolidation, ultimately allowing it to gain market share. As an employee with 10+ years at Partners Group, I have personally seen how the company takes care of its people as personal challenges come up and work-life changes are needed. The company continues to grow quickly and there are a ton of opportunities for people to grow, as well as find new challenges without having to leave the company. The company continues to get increasingly global and decision-making less centralized in Switzerland. There is a lot of emphasis to add and grow young people.","Main challenges are to successfully absorb the company's growth by training and retaining talent, and maintaining its unique global culture, while also appreciating each office's own culture. Work-life can be busy but still not as crazy as other PE firms."
141,,Interesting company (in cumbersome transition to a big company),2019-05-04,1.0,Assistant Vice President,"Efficient business model generating loads of fees.
High pace and rapid growth is what people make proud to work here.","Since the last 1-2 year may people get hired due to the growth aspirations. It takes a while until the new joiners understand the company and its values. Currently there is a dilution due to the fast growth. The high turnover on top forces to hire even more.
Many new joiners expect to get rich in 1-2 years which is not the way how it works at this company. Once they realize it they get frustrated. Better do not join if you are not prepared to stay less than 5-10 years.
Regardless of your experience it is expected from you that you work as foot-soldier for at least 5 years to prove your commitment. Below 5 years you do not belong to the core."
142,,Honest Review,2019-04-16,4.0,Analyst,"I decided to write this review after the glassdoor reviews have been brought up to me multiple times about working at Partners Group, and specifically this is to address the eight part most recent negative review. I was not encouraged by anyone to post this, this is entirely out of my own volition. 

1. Partners Group has changed a great amount, particularly over the past couple of years. I feel reading negative reviews from those especially during the time of the movement of the SF office will not help. 
2. I generally don't believe all if any positive reviews are written by members of HR, but I can't prove this. What I can say is that management did not tell anyone to write fake reviews, but they did encourage those if they have had a positive experience they can write a positive review. 
3. Previously the person mentioned that IVC, Private Real Estate, and Private Debt are the most toxic groups. That is probably the most inaccurate statement if you ask current or former employees, as those are some of the best groups to work with. Having worked with or on all those teams, I know that the leadership is phenomenal, takes time to train junior employees (analyst / associate level), and all in all the team dynamics are more friendly than anything (people joke around here and there, teams get drinks after submissions, the off-sites are a ton of fun). Those teams definitely are demanding, but I personally have never seen people get chewed out unless they royally screw up (which has never been bad), and I would love to hear about a finance company where a handful of senior people don't get upset when people mess up in high pressure situations. If you can't handle tight timelines and high workload, than this industry in general may not be for you. I find it hard to believe MDs throwing associates under the bus, as on every deal team, there is at least one mid level person between the MD and the associate whose name is on the line before an associate, and I personally have never seen it happen. People who leave these groups to other firms tend to do well, so I generally disagree with the statement about long term career, mentorship, and development. 
4. The entitled millennials statement tells me enough that this person is just being vindictive. I can say this though, at the junior levels, you will have a mix of less experienced and more experienced analysts / associates. Some of them will have worked in banking for some time and have moved over, while others they have done summer internships in banks or other finance positions. The people who did work in IB for a few years before moving to PG tend to have a bit stronger technical skills, but people do not expect the fresh out of college hires to be producing at that level. The purpose of the analyst program is to train individuals from the ground up, and after a period of time you see the analysts who have been working for a few years at PG outperform most external hires coming from banking with no PE experience. As for the comp, I can agree this is constantly an issue at PG, but anyone who works there knows the firm is taking steps to offer more competitive salaries (the salary at junior levels increased significantly going into 2019). 
5. I do not know how one's experience can only be formatting tables. The amount of on the ground diligence, modeling, and getting involved in every step of the IC process I have done makes it hard for me to believe the lack of work one could have. People often complain the opposite, that our IC process is too tedious because they want detailed descriptions and analysis of every part of the business written in papers instead of the high level powerpoint presentations a lot of other firms do. 
6. As mentioned above, I understand issues some people have with the comp but then again you agree to your salary, no one is forcing you to take the job. The person complaining about carry clearly has an issue with the private equity salary structure if you complain about how carry works in general, so that is not a particular issue to PG. 
7. I generally disagree with this that no one respects the founders and leadership. The growth in AUM, successful transition to direct deals from FoF about a decade ago, and expansion into new business lines is impressive at the least. There tends to be a frustration with the IC members nitpicking certain items which makes the IC process a bit slower, but having a seen issues surface late in the IC process it is clear why members of the IC are more cautious than not. There is a wide variety of senior management members on the different investment committees, and I believe deal teams tend to like and support more members than they dislike. 
8. Definitely not the highest turnover in finance, but yes people do leave early especially at the junior level if they have frustrations with comp or other reasons. That being said, I think it's a mixed bag, and you see both smart people and morons leaving just like any other firm. Other smart people stay, and hopefully the morons that stay cure their own stupidity otherwise PG won't want them their for too long either.","As mentioned issues with comp, but management taking positive steps to solve that."
143,,Large but fast growing private market investment firm,2019-04-12,4.0,Vice President,"Few large firms can demonstrate strong growth like PG which entails growth opportunities for employees.  

Firm’s mission is to grow its employees personally and professionally and seems senior management is trying hard to deliver this promise. 

Compensation is long term oriented which promotes longer tenure. Considering the strong growth, this can provide competitive rewards.

Lastly, every 5 years all employees receive 1 month vacation (sabbatical) on top of regular annual 25 day vacation when you can rethink of your career and decide whether this is right for you.","If you are looking for a place where you want to get some experience prior to your next job, you can be disappointed because growth and compensation is long term oriented. 

Most senior management were with the firm for a long time, can be less understanding of people coming from other firms with different backgrounds.

Large platform with many initiatives, seen by peers as trying to do everything with less specialty. Name value is generally not perceived to be in the rank of industry leaders (Blackstone, KKR, Carlyle, Apollo, etc.) even though PG has a strong platform.

Sometimes, employees can get frustrated with all the procedure and committees.

Younger professionals can be frustrated with lower than market compensation, there are many senior professionals who joined PG when the firm was still small and less institutionalized some of them are less competent for the current firm status nevertheless compensated with shares and carry leaves them with little incentive to leave the firm and they have little motivation to perform."

Most of them are not really investor but process manager. Some don’t even know the process and push everything to the Associates and AVPs. Cos if anything goes wrong, it will be junior’s fault.
2) There is no coaching: Seniors are not able and don’t care to coach. A lot of home growns who never got coached themselves. The only ones keep coaching others are the Associates and AVPs cos apparently it is their fault again that the turnover is so high in the company
3) Pay is low, but not if u have made there already: not only cos pay on junior levels are below market, but also they need to do everything and take all the blame while not enabled to grow fast.

4) Very slow career development: u spend 10 years to become a VP, while u could be there in 5years in other companies

147,,Horrible Place / HIGH Turnover,2019-03-31,1.0,Associate,Absolutely no positives that I can think of. I have made a horrible mistake accepting a position with Partners Group.,"1. There is a reason Partners Group has a 2.6 Glassdoor rating (based on over 150 reviews). You would not stay in a hotel room with a 2.6 rating - why would you accept a position at a firm with such a low score? This is your career and livelihood.
2. The recent positive reviews on Glassdoor are fake and written by HR. In Q4 2018, the management team held a firm-wide forum to discuss the firm's low Glassdoor rating (which at that time was 2.4) and asked employees to write fake reviews.
3. Avoid these toxic groups - IVC, Real Estate, Private Debt. TOXIC LEADERSHIP. They come across as friendly people in interviews but that's because they have trouble recruiting people. Extremely political, UNPROFESSIONAL environment … not team players. These groups' leaders are deceitful liars. After working in these groups for 2 months, you will see what it's really like. This is the first firm that I have worked at where group heads and MDs verbally abuse associates. Rather than training or mentoring new associates, MDs throw new hires under the bus to cover their own behinds. These groups also have the highest turnover. Avoid these groups if you're looking for a long term career, development and mentorship.
4. Untrained, inexperienced co-workers. The firm is filled with people who are not qualified to do their jobs. Think about it … who in NYC finance would take a job in Denver for half the comp? Basically the industry's rejects. So hours can extend late into the night because you spend your entire day training your peers and junior co-workers on tasks that bulge bracket summer analysts breeze through. Oh … and your untrained workers think they know everything, so have fun training. Entitled millennials
5. Deal teams do limited diligence on investments because most of the time is spent formatting and adhering to internal procedures. You spend your day copying and pasting. I seriously have not learned a single thing here, except how to use Siebel (PG's internal database system that keeps on crashing because the IT team is 3 people) and other non-transferrable skills. 
6. Low comp … This is not even the worst reason, but read your offer letter carefully because the Denver HR team is seriously incompetent (no joke). The short summary is that you're basically working for cash comp is that half the market rate. The equity comp is minimal and has 3-5 year vesting. Any carry that you receive is worthless unless you stay over 5 years and agree to sign a two year non-compete if you ever decide to leave.  
7. No one respects the firm's founders or leadership. It's not uncommon to hear people call the founders and other senior management team members idiots behind closed doors. The management team and group heads are not visionaries and command no respect internally. How can you keep a firm alive with no vision or respect?
8. HIGH TURNOVER … Seriously one of the highest turnover rates that I have seen or heard about in the finance industry. Everyone competent leaves, so the morons who are willing to work for half the market pay remain."

The firm keeps making very large special allocations/distributions to senior management, but refuses to share anything with non-senior employees that ultimately keep the firm running. 

Terrible 401(k) match and expensive healthcare coverage. 

The firm has been actively trying to drown out the honest Glassdoor reviews. This was even a topic at a firmwide presentation and current employees were encouraged to give positive reviews. There have been a number of suspect positive reviews popping up recently. 

The U.S. firm also made a massive mistake by choosing Broomfield instead of actual Denver for their U.S. headquarters. If you are not from Colorado, this is in a northern suburb of the Denver metro area with a terrible commute. This should be factored into your decision if you want to live in one of the nicer areas of Denver.

Benefits by U.S. standards are below market as well. Healthcare is very expensive and 401(k) match is very poor for the financial industry.

First, people you work with tend to be very nice and competent. If you ask, they will try to help you even when they are busy. 

Second, the firm’s reputation is good and it helps to have PG experience on CV, no matter if you are job switching or going for MBA. Rather than complaining the pay isn’t good, try to look at it as a short term sacrifice for long term gain, just like attending university instead of working for four years so you can get a better job later. 

Third, relatively good work and life balance. IBD and many PE firms pay better than PG but it comes at price of having no social life.

It's annoying that you get paid in shares that are locked in, but the share price has been steadily going up.","Rather bad office culture: PG relies a lot on management of fear. Going to work everyday means fearing to be penalized, yelled at and treated like crap. I don't know about any other serious investment firm with such a high employee turnover rate (sub-VP, because from VP onwards you are too locked in), and a lot of that is due to this. Apparently, this is much worse in the Zug office where the work/life balance is zero and the rules even stricter!

The firm's primary focus is to maximize the share price (c 50% of the shares held by employees; c 25-30% by the founders), which is done by focusing 100% on fundraising. If you're in an investment team, you will work more hours for same or less pay vs the fundraising teams, and face an investment committee that most of the time has no experience from making a direct investment (at least not within your field). PG is not known to be the best investor in the industry, which the management seems to be fine with.

Very bureaucratic. The back- and middle-offices are huge and keep implementing new procedures and processes all the time, and the firm culture stipulates that you know all of these by heart. It's very cumbersome to get things done unfortunately.

You probably need to be in the Zug office if you want to make sure to have a decent career in the firm. And you don't want to be in the Zug office more than a few days per year.

Extremely hierarchical with a lot of steps before partner level. Every department has two co-heads plus two co-heads per sub-team and probably a few heads and co-heads below them. If you're not a co-head of something, you will be seen as a nobody.

Basically, you are already down ~20-40% compared to the industry from the get-go, and you are stuck with a whopping three months notice period that only begins on the month after the date of resignation. When people jump, it is not surprising to hear of a >50% pay raise! Even for the mid-levels, people are stuck with a six months notice period and they can do much better elsewhere, but these guys are mature adults, and I would like to use this post to warn the younger ones who might be more naive and believe in Swiss fairy-tales.

Basically, turnover is crazy this year (especially in US, Singapore) and you see some teams getting decimated. For teams which still seem relatively unscathed, half of them are probably actively spamming their resumes in the job market looking for a better gig. In the real estate team for instance, there basically seems to be a whole new team every 2-3 years. Please don’t think that this time is different, because it never is as long as the guys running the show are still the same. Expecting a different result from doing the same thing over and over again is insanity.

If you are coming in now, be ready to clean stuff up, as can be inferred from the dozens of new job listings. Also, your pay is likely to benchmarked aginst the Manilla office and Denver office which were essentially set up to cut costs. However, if you are happy helping old white millionaire/billionaire males get from filthy rich to “I don’t know how to describe! rich”, then go for it!

Everyone is just a digit, a cost to be minimized if you don't bring in revenue. Well, that's life, but you have a choice on how you want to live your life and to choose the company to work for where your values align. Here, you are also less important than clients, whom they rip off anyway through exorbitant fees, considering that their track record is nothing stellar and that the Global IC members come from a fund-of-fund background and gets seriously in the way of investing in certain contexts.

Also, am not sure what HR is doing. They are really proud of their “feedback is a gift” campaign, which they seem to genuinely believe helps employees develop, when all they are doing is coordinating a simple but manual 360 feedback which other companies do as well. Maybe one of their new KPIs is to increase the glassdoor ratings, judging from some of the suspiciously fake positive reviews that have been popping up recently."

However, this is largely due to the tenure of these people which is generally 2 years or less, so they are still in denial that they are suffering from Stockholm Syndrome 

Large firm and depending on which team you are on, you get exposure to big deals. If you're self motivated, you can teach yourself a lot about different industries and markets. Unfortunately, your analysis will revolve around explaining irrelevant topics to a dense investment committee who does not want to engage in constructive and insightful debates (mostly because they don't have a real deep understanding of the investments and don't read the memos) and would rather bicker at you over the formatting of your paper or how you missed a step in the glowingly insurmountable investment process.

Global firm which is, generally speaking, well integrated.  

Work Life balance varies a lot by teams but generally speaking, it is okay. There are a few teams (especially in Europe) that work non-stop","Below market comp is a known fact - it is the way of doing things and it will never change (company needs to maintain 60% EBITDA margin, and when your only real cost is labor, there is no room for improvement). The comp structure is generally speaking very fixed. Few really ""outstanding"" individuals will get comp outside of the ranges. They sell you on the ""long term comp"" structure but that only really kicks in at the AVP and above level. 

The comp structure is typically as follows - in USD: 

Financial Analyst Program (undergrad): 55-66k base + 5-10k bonus 
First Year Analyst : 70 - 80k base + 15-20k bonus 
First Year Associate: 115-125k base + 30-40k bonus + 10 -20k of shares (vested over 4 years) 
Associate Program (MBA): 110 -125k base + 30-40k bonus + shares 
First Year AVP:  135 - 150k base + 40-60k bonus + 20-30k shares (eligible for carry after your first year) 
First Year VP: 160-175k base + 50-85k bonus + 40-50k shares + 150k-300k carry 
SVP: 220-250k + 60-100k bonus + shares + carry 

Share price has kept everyone okay in the end. God forbid their PE multiple every trades in line with other publicly listed PE funds... that would be no fun."

Acceptable work life balance","Thing have gotten worse year after year especially with compensation, which is utterly disappointing and shameful. Rewards are not commensurate with the amount of effort put in or how much they value you. Managers’ hands are tied. 

The higher management of the firm has become so out of touch and is helmed by Swiss, white men with no diversity at that level. They are most concerned with keeping up appearances and don’t seem to have a clue that people are becoming unhappy and dissatisfied, and don’t necessarily agree with any of their plans. They are not concerned with improving this and are more focused on keeping EBITDA margins extraordinarily high (despite telling employees that increments and bonus are lower because it’s a bad year). They treat employees with no respect and think we are fools who will just continue to work hard and be happy with whatever we are given. They do not care if other firms poach us and believe we are all replaceable. On the surface the pretend to be concerned by holding “vision lunches” and the like, to “gain some feedback”, but conditions have gotten worse despite this. 

I had so much hope in the beginning working here and I believed this firm had so much potential (read: extraordinarily high EBITDA margins) but unfortunately employee satisfaction has taken a backseat and this has led to a disappointing experience overall."

Longstanding issues of treating employees as totally replaceable. Very disappointing crisis management at the start of this year lead to mass resignation across many teams (>30 in just the Singapore office so far)
- Generally less outstanding employees as compared to other PE firm. Career progression seems to be based on tenure and not performance, penalising competent workers especially junior professionals. A drain of competent junior staff every few years. 
- Decision making still pretty much concentrated in the head office. Management in other offices have very limited say, hence don’t expect your local team head to fight for you.

- Management does not want to hear (negative) feedback (they never conducted an employee survey). Their view is that people need to be happy to be allowed to work for such a great company while forgetting that it takes a bit more than that to attract talent (and ensure that they stay for more than 2 years!). 
- Many young people leave after a short stint because they realize that this is only worthwhile if you stay for a long time. 
- No real management trainings, that’s why there are people who lead teams who do not know a) how to do that, b) how to address friction in the team, c) how to implement feedback and d) how to enable young employees to learn and get exposure. 
- Clear problem with diversity. Nothing is being done against openly stated comments that discriminate or belittle women or homosexuals. 
- HR is unable to cope with a lot of things and not always helpful when it comes to recruiting talent or when solving issues with team leads.

1 month of sabbatical for every 5 years that you work in Partners Group
S$10 lunch allowance (honestly this is mostly used to supplement your pathetic compensation)
Great colleagues
Exposure to large PE deals (albeit only less than 1% gets executed)
Great medical and dental benefits, largely favor families","Compensation & Benefits:
Pay is way below market standard, difficult to attract top talents due to the unwillingness to match salaries. Partners Group often undercut their employees, claiming they are focused on a long-term compensation structure. As such, many inefficient and sub-par employees stay on by doing the bare minimum, resulting in wastage of resources and negatively affecting team morale. Turnover is rampant. Partners Group does not see this as an issue as everybody can be easily replaced by hungry university graduates who just want to get their foot into PE. Unless you are Swiss/Male/White, promoting up the ranks is much slower. The carry incentive that Partners Group likes to hang infront of the deal team vests over a rolling 5-year period and is pooled; you hardly get credited for the deals you execute. Despite working similar hours, investment teams in Singapore are paid half as compared to their counterparts in banks or other PE shops.

Culture:
Because of the long term compensation structure, incompetent leaders stay in Partners Group and rise through the ranks.  This creates a very negative work culture as new employees do not look up and respect their team leaders as role models. Many older employees (some are incompetent and ineffective) have huge inertia to leave Partners Group due to the huge amount of shares they have amassed over their tenure, further worsening the low morale in the company. In an attempt to cut costs, HR will no longer do recruitment for ranks below the Associate level. This has been 'outsourced' to the departments and teams. By doing so, this adds additional workload and responsibility for the businesses. Junior hires are no longer hired based on fit (into the Partners Group corporate culture) but instead based on businesses' immediate needs. The company's recent focus into the expansion of the Manila office, in an attempt to cut costs and increase EBITDA margins brings about a horde of issues. Partners Group thinks they are able to get the same level of quality and output and also be able to cut costs at the same time. (You can't have your cake and eat it too!)

TLDR: If you are a fresh graduate and thinks this is a great place to have a headstart into PE, you cannot be more wrong. Go slog it out at Big 4 or the banks before jumping to a bigger PE firm, you will learn more transferrable skills, gain valuable work experience and actually have a nicer brand name on your resume. 

This place is great for people who want to have kids, seeking retirement, have 0 career aspirations and are comfortable being led by inefficient leaders.

For potential job seekers, the grass might be greener here at Partners Group but I can assure you it is nothing but garbage once you are in."
192,,Not a friendly work environment,2018-05-07,1.0,Associate,A well known firm with a lot of money coming from the Middle East. Good exposure to deals of all sizes.,"Well below market compensation.

25 days paid vacation per year
$10 lunch stipend daily
Opens up doors (use them to get out quickly)","Compensation: Horribly underpaid, as in roughly 1/2 of relative industry competitors. Partners Group knows this and pitches a long-term view and better work-life balance as the reason for underpayment. In reality, work-life balance at PG is as bad or WORSE than other upper-middle market PE shops due to process oriented investing process and 200+ page investment committee proposals. The long-term view is a complete joke - carry vests over a rolling 5-year time period and is pooled, so you don't get direct credit for the deals you may have done. 

The real reason PG pays under market: PG is publicly traded, which means the guys at the top of the firm and anyone who was around when it IPO'd are stock rich. In order to maintain an ever-increasing EBITDA margin, they pay their employees terribly, but expect the same caliber of work as firms that pay market. As a result, EBITDA margin continues to increase and stock price goes up, making these guys even richer. People who work at PG that are good quit because they can do the same amount of work, or less, and get paid double. This leaves B-level employees at the firm who then move up the ranks. Turnover is rampant. Incentives for those who stay are misaligned: upper level deal team members are incentivized to get as much money out of the door as possible because they will get a larger bonus. Junior guys have a poor bonus (largely fixed although PG will never admit this) regardless of the amount of money they deploy or deals that they get done. Thus, their incentive is to do just enough work to get by and in reality they hope deals do not get through so their workload is lighter. 
This is a story of endless greed by those who have the power to decide how the firm operates. 

Work-life balance: nonexistent. Investment Committee (IC) sits in Switzerland so meetings begin at 6am ET every week. IC requires countless analysis on every potential investment, much of which is not pertinent to the specific deal. This translates into many sleepless nights of literally not leaving the office. Deal documents often end up being in excess of 200 pages due to the ridiculous number of irrelevant questions that IC members, who are too far away from each deal, ask. IC members do not read deal-docs due to extreme length, but require that every single question or detail about the business is covered. Deal teams spend more time writing the document than actually diligencing the company, for fear that an IC member will reject the deal due to formalities in the document. Getting a deal done is extremely internally process intensive, and purposefully so because PG does not trust its employees."

Nice colleagues","Apart from the annual leave and benefits, everything else is just poor. 
Promotion is by tenure instead of merit. You may be the best analyst on your team but still won't be promoted because of a minimum tenure requirement. Which is a vicious cycle because to good employees will leave and only those who are not confident of better offers elsewhere will stay. Which means that these people becomes your senior although they may lack technical expertise.
Compensation is an absolute joke. When recruiters and headhunters ask us what our pay to see if they need to manage our expectations, they often find that there isn't much to manage since the compensation we were getting was so low. They will simply brush it aside and say things like ""oh 30% is no problem"".
