20,Perella Weinberg Partners,Blame culture,2021-01-14,1.0,Director,"Great people on the asset management side, but they've since separated from the PWP group. Person running that shop knows their stuff.

A few nice young bankers on the investment bank side, and of course other nice people sprinkled around here and there.","Massive blame culture on the corporate finance side, everyone has to operate on a CYA basis. No one on the investment bank side for corporate finance has any real talent or technical chops; the 10+ year vets hoard information so that they can appear to be critically important, but all they do is hold the keys and nothing else. No respect for each other, little teamwork, little kindness and no compassion. CFO is an ex-banker that is nice but playing catch up on accounting. Managers don't care if you are worked to death; greedy culture across the firm but especially at the top - but hey, it's an investment bank. Strategic direction is confused and the past several years was a constant back and forth on where the firm was headed as a whole, causing a chaotic work environment; corporate mergers, followed by divestitures, secret meetings, secret projects, spin-outs by the asset managers after rounds and rounds of battle negotiations over equity. All the guys on top are desperate to monetize through an IPO. Bad blood all around. There is constant backstabbing and trampling on others to get ahead. Constantly have to check behind you to make sure someone isn't about to stab you. C-suite people are pushed out routinely and tone at the top is all over the place. Termination notices floating around daily. The founder is chauvinistic; gave a speech at the Christmas party thanking the families at home for making their spouses contributions to the firm possible - wake up, its not 1975; housewives have gone to work. They had to, since you don't pay anyone but yourself."

35,Perella Weinberg Partners,Great Job but not a great Career,2019-12-21,3.0,Vice President,"I spent c. 7 years at Perella Weinberg Partners as an M&A Analyst, Associate and VP in London.

I was exposed to great opportunities to participate in landmark transactions and an exceptional on the job training in corporate finance (second to none actually on the street in my experience dealing with other analysts and associates in leading banks).

I had the privilege of working with many brilliant individuals and it was refreshing to socialize with so smart people on a daily basis.

There was a clear difference in quality of materials produced for clients vs. other banks as my team would go to extreme lengths to produce the most accurate analysis and cover every possible angle strategically in a transaction.
Managing Directors typically had a hands on approach on every transaction they worked and focused on providing the best possible advice to clients. Lack of conflicts such as absence of lending is a huge benefit for clients.

As an ultimate credential to my ex colleagues I would say that I would definitely prefer hiring them vs. any other bank given the opportunity.

Remuneration was top vs. other banks and given that Perella Weinberg is a private company remuneration was 100% cash","Work hours were brutal and there was constant pressure that resulted in a lot of stress to the point it was detrimental for some junior and mid-level bankers for their mental and physical well-being. Very high level of turnover in recent years was the result of that. 

There is a clear lack of a prospect of a Career in Investment Banking for junior and mid-level bankers as the platform is not designed to produce a new generation of successful bankers. 

This is due to many reasons: 

Business model: the model simply speaking is for Senior Bankers from large BB banks to join Perella Weinberg when they have already established a career and clientele. This means that they can transfer many of their existing clients to PWP and get remunerated much more that if they were to stay at the BB they were working at before

Presence of a prohibitive minimum fee (c. $5m per transaction) means that generally only c. $500m and up in value of a transaction would be accepted as a mandate. No mid-level and junior MD banker can regularly get mandates on such large scale transactions

Extremely limited opportunities for origination / coverage as this was seen as a cost vs. an opportunity. Partners and MDs are the only ones that are “allowed” to network and try to create relationships

Focus on execution only – mid level bankers are solely tasked on executing transactions

Meetings and pitches are typically attended only by senior bankers

Obsessive focus on execution leaves zero time for commercial efforts

Clear evidence of this lack of a career aspect is that literally almost all junior to midlevel bankers that joined PWP have either left or been fired after they became too senior (MD or ED level) as then they became much more expensive and obviously could not generate the minimum fees at once (as they were never given a chance honestly)

There were also instances of borderline abuse that resulted in great individuals at the analyst and associate levels quitting. In my years at PWP too many great individuals quit because of this and there was no penalty for the manager in the teams when something like that happened.  

Sadly HR and Partners were completely absent from the conversation and preferred to not be involved / not know. That was really sad actually as you had HR that only cared to protect their job and not the interests of the Firm."

48,Perella Weinberg Partners,Firms reputation precedes it.  Senior management is aloof.  No real firm culture.,2018-03-27,2.0,Asset Management Associate,"Firm has a good reputation.  There are plenty of smart people at the firm.  Senior Management is clueless and leaves you alone. They’re smart enough but don’t have the right mindset.  They aren’t hungry, they only float at a high level never getting into the details.",Management is clueless.  No firm growth so no compensation. Certain employees in Asset Management are nasty to each other and senior management looks the other way.  No real firm culture.
49,Perella Weinberg Partners,Great Environment for Women,2018-02-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people at PWP are exemplary. This was my first experience working at a hedge fund in NYC, and I worried that it would be a sexist environment or that I would face harassment. To my pleasant surprise, that could not have been further from the truth. Everyone I interacted with — from one of the founding partners to the IT team, and everyone in-between — treated me with utmost professionalism and respect. I was in a junior-level position, so I expected senior-level staff to either not acknowledge me, or to pay attention to me for the wrong reasons. But on the contrary, they were gracious for my work, they listened to my input, and they made me feel valuable for all the right reasons. It was also nice to see so many women in senior-level positions. Many companies preach about inclusion for good PR, but PWP actually puts it into practice. I think the fact that there are so many women in senior-level positions is proof that they are doing something right; not only is the company is inclusive, but it is a safe enough environment that high achieving women want to stick around.","The office itself and its equipment is a bit old school. I think they could use an upgrade on that front, but perhaps they are just fiscally conservative when it comes to that. I would have liked to have healthier drink options instead of just soda, and healthy snacks in the pantry would have been nice. They are pretty stringent about getting in on time, but I guess I get why."
