The quant arm of Point 72 used to call Cubist Systematic Strategy. Seems they removed the name, now people can no longer find info on Glassdoor (try to think why they do that? ) 

The company has two relative independent businesses: fundamental ( Point 72) and quantitative ( Cubist ). I don't know much about fundamental side, but I can say a few things about Cubist:

It is no a fun place to work. Cubist is organized as many small PM teams, there is no sharing among teams, even within the team people don't share ideas.  Don't expect to learn any thing, instead of contributing your alphas/ideas. 

In general, I think some PM teams are hiring people to get trading algos from him/her, instead of trying to grow with this person and help him/her become successful.  

Unless you plan to join as a PM, or one of the core member in the PM team is your uncle, please seriously consider other options. For more junior entering this field, consider other bigger places like two sigma/citadel, where you can actually learn something."

116,Point72,Cubist Data Team,2019-09-23,5.0,Equity Research Analyst,"One of the most compelling reason for any Quant PM /Researcher to pick Cubist is the quality and variety of data.

Most of the Data team analysts are very smart and have a graduate degree in Computer Science/Statistics or relate d fields.

Data related support is 24/7 and thus there are not many data related production outages.  
Another important differentiating factor is many datasets have been collected PIT in-house and thus not available at other places. While I was at Cubist, I was able to get access to pretty much all the data sources which were mentioned in academic literature and more.","I stayed with the firm over a decade and can't think of any negatives about the place.
Probably there is a room for improving snacks in the Pantry"
117,Point72,Collegial environment for career development,2019-09-20,5.0,Managing Director,"Cubist is extremely selective in it's recruiting. The vast bulk of hires are lateral, with a handful of PhDs and masters students hired each year. The quality of colleagues is extremely high, and people honestly try hard to be collaborative and help one another. 

Employees' experiences can vary greatly across different PM teams and support functions: Each PM team is free to be entrepreneurial, and each team pursues a different set of strategies with a different management approach based on the interests and expertise of the PM and members of the team. Support functions have different skillsets and cultures: for example, the talent team doesn't code, the data team tends to hire relatively less experienced people and train them up from scratch (eventually many of them move on to join PM teams). 

Management is focused on the career path of the individual. While some PM teams do not meet the firm's bar for performance, the firm always seems to take steps to provide opportunities for a better fit internally, and it seems like in the vast majority of such cases people opt to take internal opportunities.

The firm provides a ""target rich"" environment for research, with a vast archive of datasources, ideas, and other resources. As a major client of most sell-side firms, Point 72 and Cubist have access to all the resources that the street can offer.","The average PM team is small in headcount. While this means that each person on the team can have high impact, it also means that sometimes teams cannot pursue resource-intensive highly speculative projects.

People generally agree that the culture of Cubist is pretty distinct from the rest of Point72, which is not a surprise as Cubist employees tend to lean towards PhDs in Computer Science and Statistics, wheras the rest of the firm is populated disproportionately by MBAs. There are quantitative functions on the discretionary side of the firm, but they are limited and in many cases fairly secretive.

Cubist offers most staff a lot of autonomy, but it's hard work. Senior executives are ""always on"" and by extension many teams expect high intensity work and output from their colleagues.

It is fairly rare for a researcher on a team to subsequently spin out and become a PM. This is understandably discouraged, since the PM teams want to have some comfort that their IP lies within the team."

Exposure to hundreds of interesting and unique data sets.
Opportunity to work with state of the art hardware and technology.
Projects and day-to-day work are challenging, but rewarding. Huge opportunity to learn here.

Regarding the work environment:
Flat structure - opportunity to work directly with senior industry professionals  (including PMs).
Management is quite open to new ideas and is generally willing to give people opportunity to work on projects of their choice.
Very nice work environment. Majority of employees (including management) are approachable and friendly.

When they made mistake, they will just keep quiet and pretend like it didn't happen. They like to set unrealistic goals. If an employee somehow managed to hit any of them, they will raise the bar immediately and ignore his/her achievement. 
.
Performance appraisal is a joke. There is no shared visions from top to bottom. Everyone is walking in different direction. People at the lowest hierarchy have to work on competing requests from all direction. HR is not playing the right role to build a proper assessment process. Managers don't have a systematic way to evaluate their subordinates.
.
Team player will get hurt the most. Many people in the team will magnify your mistakes and embarrass you in front of management/team members/users.
.
No career path at all. You will be working on everything everyday, sometimes including weekend and public holidays. No job specialisation. You can only be a half-cooked data analyst/scientist who may not have an opportunity to work on any research project."

125,Point72,Great place to learn and grow,2019-07-26,5.0,Associate Director,"- Relatively flat structure that allows for growth and learning. I've had the opportunity to expand my responsibilities and take on projects that I never could have imagined before working here

You will learn (if you are thick skinned) how to handle challenging personalities,"Office politics completely run the show. Unfortunately your performance is evaluated more on face time and who you know rather than actual performance and results. From the very top down ego, unprofessionalism, and prejudgice are apparent. I have seen more than one *higher up* physically throw things across a room. More and more people have left/are leaving after spending many years there, while newer hires aren't sticking around longer than a year or two. Make a mistake? You will have someone actually scream at you in an open seating location rather than a private discussion. Do great work for several years? You'll receive a minimal raise (if any) and watch them hire a junior colleague at a higher salary than your current. Aside from the dysfunctional leadership, basic processes are falling apart and becoming less main streamed. Zero communication between teams. Cutthroat within your own team. Point72 has become chaos."

132,Point72,Great Place for Career Advancement,2019-04-08,5.0,Associate,"I worked at P72 for 4 years in two different roles. In both roles, I worked under managers who were consummate professionals and who were ready to be teachers and mentors for someone like myself who was young and inexperienced with HFs. Point72 has one of the best infrastructures available for developing young investors and HF professionals. From the Academy program to a core focus on developing talent, it is a primary concern of theirs. 

Additionally, it is a place that generally allows for significant upward and lateral mobility amongst professionals. If you have the work ethic and interest in trying something new, they will find a way to make it work for you. There were a number of employees of various ages, experience levels, and backgrounds like myself who were afforded opportunities to change groups, pursue their interests, and build new skillsets. 

Additionally, they have pretty solid work-life balance (for finance/HFs) and excellent benefits packages from free, full-coverage healthcare, to brand new facilities and more.

Overall it was a tremendously cool place to work. I was treated at all times with respect despite my age and seniority, and was given responsibility to learn and grow and manage projects on my own. I was also invited to travel to other offices globally and attend industry events to broaden my network and gain exposure to current trends and the cutting edge of the industry. I found however, that much of what we worked on at P72 was already ahead of the 'cutting edge' that was being presented at these conferences. Point72 is a super energetic place, and there is a lot going on at once, as it is constantly looking to develop the future of HF finance, both technologically and talent wise. 

Contrary to what you might hear, the culture has developed quite positively, and each year that I was there it got much better. As with any organization, culture is an ongoing process, but they are focused on the right goals and making significant investments and devoting their attention to continuing to make it a great place to work. 

If you are looking for someplace where you will be treated with respect and given opportunity, this is a great place to grow your career. The compensation doesn't hurt either.","Occasional travel to Stamford can be annoying. The Firm is hit-or-miss with this requirement and reimbursement for travel. However, with a move to new Manhattan headquarters at Hudson Yards, this should be less of an issue."
133,Point72,Cubist Systematic,2019-04-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great shop. As an independent PM, you'll have full autonomy over your investment process and will be treated like a grown-up when it comes to risk. You are given all the tools and support to help your business succeed:

-> QBIZ team (cubist business) will help you launch new strategies, trade new securities, etc. by liaising with brokers/venues/other parts of the firm, account set up, etc. Everything is very streamlined and you can tell they've done this many times before. 
-> ingestion of new data sets is a priority and they do a good job of it with a steady stream of new data sets announced every week. The data team is very responsive.
-> Ross will (to a large extent) let you set the tone of his involvement in your business. He offers lots of ideas on research and risk management if you are receptive to it.  Also helps you to focus on the business/management aspect.
-> Most of all I'm impressed with the culture: senior management is always asking what we can do better and is receptive to feedback (both good and bad).","The non-equity space lags the equity space in terms of set up and infrastructure, but cubist is aware of this and is working on catching up. 

There is little in the way of centralization of real-time market data feeds, utilities/tools for trade monitoring, etc. as the expectation is that you will build these yourself (this could be a pro/con depending on your point of view)."

Good food/benefits and employees are enjoying increased access to general training and learning opportunities.","Employees in the back office are for the most part, pleasant, diligent, and hard working, but are far from the most intelligent in the firm/industry and are easily some of the most lackluster people you will meet. Lack of passion and diversity in the back office (personality, pedigree, ethnicity, etc) creates an extremely mundane and demotivating environment. 

Senior directors are distant. Most mid level managers seem disinterested or dispirited. Most junior employees seem to be studying for the CFAs or making efforts to lateral to the front office / other firms.

A good environment to be in if you're introverted and favor a predictable, routine life in a cubicle with good pay. However, the work itself is far from fulfilling, as it is mostly routine and uninteresting.

1. The senior management promises a lot, but nothing is delivered, in the end only yes men get promoted to director, managing director title for doing nothing smart.
2. The verbal language used by the top management is at best arrogant, condescending and frankly against every HR policy in the handbook.
3 The pay is sub-par, also the work you are given is outdated with nontransferable skills for your next gig, so, all in all, you will simply waste your time here with no monetary benefit or knowledge being gained.
Changing name of the firm every few years is not going to help and neither is bringing in consulting firms to do surveys, we all know this is simply an effort to restore the image and nothing more.

There are several hedge funds out there with better culture technology stack and smarter people out there, better working for them then a blotted name that is always in the news for the wrong reasons."

The benefits/401K are also very generous. They are building the quant business for long term, and is expanding it.",Not much to complain.

On top of that, I have been pleasantly surprised with the work life balance and the emphasis placed on that for employees.","Same cons as with any fund in this field, though muted relative others.

Employees are let go time and time again, for speaking up about this and other deficient management practices with no fear of HR interference.

HR issues: once hired into one function, many people are tracked and unable to change course, values new employees and recruitment more than existing employees, sometimes places people in wrong jobs because not always interested in fit, seems intentionally ambiguous how to apply for different job, with different gatekeepers depending on circumstance, review process only takes into account what the firm considers germane and does not allow employees to showcase outside accomplishments as basis for promotion or job change."

They overhauled the management and hired a group of completely unqualified people.

- Frequent research presentations by Academicians, brokers and vendors about new ideas, new technologies and new data
- Vast resources in terms of datasets, operations and infrastructure help is available which is critical for the success of a quant manager
- Top management is very accessible and working hard to make you succeed by having one to one meetings, providing new ideas and helping you get over any kind of hurdle

Teams are organized along racial and linguistic lines, which is not a problem if you are in the right team. Very little opportunity to grow if you are working for a PM. The PM has no incentive to let you grow and become an independent PM. The teams are silod and there are a lot of secrets even between the team members. This use to be a great place, but recent years saw a rapid hiring which broke down the structure."

Support staff is generally very responsive , and senior management is good.","I worked as a trader for a PM. I don't learn anything from him/her. The way I was treated probably ticks a lot of the don't of an HR manual. There is not much chance to advance when you  working for a PM. Although HR will say that they have very low turnover, the turnover within certain teams is very high. The people are hired, and when they are let go once they have transferred all of their knowledge to the PM. At least this is the model in several PM teams."
219,Point72,Black Women Need Not Apply,2016-02-03,1.0,,Great health benefits. They offer tuition reimbursement. The office is in a convenient location. They have a cafeteria on site and free snacks.,"Based the experiences of myself and others, it's pretty clear women who are black or mixed with black will never get a fair chance at Point72.  The firm's discriminatory practices are sometimes blatant but oftentimes veiled. My impression is many managers and senior management advocate soft bigotry of low expectations where black women are concerned.  Black women are denied opportunities for growth and development and repeatedly subject to double standards.  Regardless or how much more deserving we were (than others) of a more promising role, we were not granted that opportunity. They repeatedly find ways to justify their biased approach. 

While others are groomed and provided with tools and tutelage to expand their knowledge base and progress, black women on the other hand were (and still are) kept down and oftentimes had to deal with obstacles and hindrances placed intentionally to result in failure. 

They would rather assist, groom then promote someone is not a black female - despite that individual's struggles and absence of true potential - than to groom a black female who is more experienced, shows great potential and has met and exceeded expectations time and again. 

To top it off we were subject to their resentment if we gave them any indication that we are intelligent and capable of far more than the menial role they pigeon hole us in - as if being subject to their discriminatory practices wasn't enough.


If you advocate soft bigotry of low expectations where black women are concerned, then you will fit in perfectly at Point72"
