5,Robinhood,Avoid the Research Team,2022-04-18,1.0,Researcher,"If you join the research team at Robinhood, your therapist will finally be able to buy that vacation home they've been dreaming about (because you will be needing daily counseling sessions).","Joining the research team at Robinhood was one of the worst decisions I've made in my career. But here's the good news - you can learn from my mistake. If you receive an email from a Robinhood recruiter, delete it. If you receive an offer from the research team, throw it in the trash. You'll thank me later. Robinhood might look like a good option on paper, but beneath the surface it is a garbage fire and joining this company could turn your life upside down. Our stock is performing like a lead balloon (currently down 75%) because the company is so poorly-managed. The research team is no exception. The org structure is a mess. There's no strategic vision. There's a lack of prioritization and planning. There's a lack of support from leadership. There's a lack of transparency, especially surrounding major decisions. The internal politics are nonstop. Budgets are decreasing rapidly. There's an emphasis on quantity over quality and ""taking orders"" from stakeholders. Researchers are burnt out due to unevenly distributed workloads, aggressive deadlines, a lack of resources, absentee Directors, and a lack of scoping. Research projects at Robinhood can be especially stressful because the company is constantly shifting its priorities and strategies... and the executives tend to trust their gut more than they trust research. Internal surveys show the research team has poor work-life balance, low morale, and a lack of psychological safety. But these problems have been largely ignored. When researchers raise concerns, they face retaliation. A cloud of fear hangs over the team. Due to the leadership and the culture, most of the researchers are miserable. It's one of the most discouraged research teams I've ever seen and people are running for the exits so fast you would think someone yelled ""fire"" in a crowded theater. One third of the team has resigned in the past six months (since the new Head of Research took over). Two-thirds of the managers have resigned. Our team has one of the highest levels of turnover in the entire company. And the mood on the team has only gotten worse over time. Do yourself a favor and avoid the research team at Robinhood unless you want a front row seat to the sinking of the Titanic."

Work from home","It’s tough to put a rating on Robinhood. At first everything was exciting and different. Then leading up to IPO and post IPO things began to change quickly. In a recent meeting Vlad said his CEO rating was going down probably because of the current stock price. At that moment I realized he had no finger on the pulse of the company any more. The reason his rating is going down is because so many peole that were loyal and believed in the mission have been taken advantage of. They had their equity comp taken from them and been passed for promotions by outside hiring time and time again. Only to train their new boss and have roles and responsibilities taken from them. 

The environment that use to feel fun now feels corporate and leaderships answer to make everyone feel better is shipping products. The ones that care and try to voice concerns of employees turnover only get candid answers from leadership saying it’s natural from company growth. People really don’t voice how they feel because they need a job and the benefits.

First rule of business. Take care of your people. Robinhood will continue to stand out from traditional brokerages because the competition is infamous for burn out, poor ethics, pushy sales, and shady business. However has time goes by the employees who helped Robinhood pre IPO see the signs of it becoming the same."

While the tech and product side is constantly evolving, the live client support group is being built up in the vein of every other brokerage firm, when there is untapped potential to be something totally different.

And boy was it a fun one! The code yellow that lasted 3+ months were employees worked their butts off to make up for leadership’s negligence and incompetence. The company almost imploded, largely out of the ineptitude of the finance team to internalize the company’s capital requirements, the operations team’s incompetence serving customers during a time of high-growth and market volatility, and the marketing and legal team’s utter lack of communication to customers, employees, and regulators. The worse part about the experience was that the leadership team did absolutely nothing to help, thank or or support their teams through the crisis. They just told them to work harder, scapegoated direct reports, gaslit other teams, etc. I really don’t think most of them understood what was happening, much less knew knew what to do.

61,Robinhood,"***WARNING, HONEST REVIEW POSTED***",2022-01-24,1.0,,Free gifts every now and then,"I've been working at Robinhood for a little while. When I first started, things were great. As we started hiring new managers, things took an ugly turn for the worse. The work environment and culture has turned disgusting and toxic. The culture is based on creating a bunch of ""yes"" men and women who will ""buy in"" to the mass incompetence leadership displays perpetually. I learned more about trading and securities by reading the Series 7 and 63 books than I do in my day to day activities working here. We consistently bend over backwards for customers that have zero clue about complex topics such as margin and options when outages occur (which is damn near everyday). We continue to roll out experiments when the focus needs to be on stabilzing the platform and getting rid of the incessant app issues that occur daily. When you ask certain teams or departments for help, the snide and passive aggressive remarks you sometimes get as answers are unnecessary and comical at best. If I knew the answer, do you think I'd waste my time asking you?!?!?! Also, they get in their feelings when you ask a lot of questions too. The people they promote to management positions are unqualified and ""buy in"" to the brainwashed ""we are all friends"" mantra that is going around. First of all, we aren't friends, we are COWORKERS. If we happen to build a friendship along the way, great but we aren't friends from the first moment I meet you. What kind of psychosis is that?!?!?! I can go on and on but this is only the tip of the iceberg. Many of my colleagues have ditched this trash company and I'll be following them soon because I became depressed after working here. READ ALL OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS because they are factual. They try to blind you with all the standard benefits but those benefits are outdated, the culture is absolutely trash and toxic, leadership is an absolute joke, Lord I can go on but I'll stop. Please listen to my warning, don't work here. You're better off working at McDonald's for real, this place sucks the life out of you!!!! STAY AWAY!!!

It is the specific and primary reason for my departure.

Managers were predominantly unskilled at role and had surprisingly little industry knowledge. Honestly the industry knowledge amongst the leadership was scary. 
- Felt like everything was reactionary instead of proactive. Constantly shifting focus and priorities instead of driving change and creating products
- Career pathing is ill conceived and there is nowhere for service employees to go. I was fortunate to go to a team that opened doors to more hidden parts of the business but most have no shot with over hiring and service promoting only those drinking the Kool aid.

The history with it is that it was a mess and had a couple of really toxic leaders and then had a quick change of general counsels. The current general counsel came in about two years ago and fired basically the entire previous legal management within six months. Some of those folks needed to be fired, but there were also people with long institutional knowledge who wanted to do the right thing. Many people were very hopeful when he came in, as they thought this would be the beginning of a well and professionally run the legal department. It was not. What legal and comms too got was an influx of Republican revolving door folks, including from the Trump administration, and other mercenaries and hangers on of the GC. Mostly in Washington DC. Nobody has been promoted from in-house except one very curious case but they have hired people that did not last 2- 3 months for management positions. Nothing has changed for the better - lots of publicized $$ to settle cases but as anyone can read from the media, a load of investigations continue.

Pay is competitive",On call could be tough
82,Robinhood,it's an ok company,2021-12-30,3.0,Customer Service Associate,"great training, great intro into customer service",now work life balance. Advancement is easy but the compensation is not great even for advancement
83,Robinhood,Fun but not transparent,2021-12-28,3.0,Customer Experience,"Amazing benefits. 
WFH / Nice updated work equipment. 
You’ll work with some amazing people. 
Beautiful offices with free lunch and snacks offered onsite. 
Great COVID-19 response for employees. 
CEOS seem pretty cool and show face every week which is pretty rare for most companies. 
Young Millenial/Gen Z workforce. 
A fun environment overall.","Choppy licensing program that required employees to obtain the SIE/Series 7/Series 63 in 10 weeks which wasn’t disclosed to us when we onboarded. My advice to anyone going through or into the CXR program is to buckle down and don’t bank on finding internal positions if you don’t make it just because you saw others do so. They can and will terminate you while not batting an eye or offering  any guidance to the people that fail out. 

It seems the entire CX department is slowly but surely turning into another corporate call center. 

They’re constantly changing standard processes on us and I don’t feel they do enough to update or prepare us for these constant changes. The training on some topics could be way more in depth in my opinion.  

The work itself can become repetitive and boring and customers can get pretty abusive given our reputation. 
 
HR seems nonexistent and clueless when you ask them about PTO, your shares, annual bonuses etc.

Leadership leaves much to be desired as well and can be super dismissive.

They boast about caring about their internal employees and their career growth but it doesn’t show. The internal promotion/transfer system seems pretty broken."

The benefits are great and so are the working conditions. It's overall a low stress job and I am grateful to work here!,"It's difficult to move positions especially if you've been there for a while. The growth and career development opportunities could be better in my opinion. Additionally, the 401k match should be 6% however it's currently at 3%. It'd be nice to have that be higher."

87,Robinhood,"Unproductively hierarchical, cult-like immature environment",2021-12-19,1.0,Product,"- Solid pay and benefits (relatively typical for tech companies, however). 
- Moderate to mild respect for customer perspectives (better than some companies, I guess.)","- Absolutely terrible work-life balance across all product teams. Robinhood moves from one disaster to the next, trying to find its footing amongst mediocre product launches. 
- Unreasonable requests from leadership constantly derail product efforts and create chaos amongst peers. 
- Cult-like worship of upper management and a zero tolerance attitude dissenting opinions. 
- Awful prioritization of resource allocation; product teams are highly reactive and seldom understand limitations of their work. 
- One of the worst marketing teams this side of the U.S.; firing the CMO hardly had an effect on useless marketing practices. 
- Promotions are driven by blind peer feedback mechanisms that hardly encourage transparency or authenticity. Significant bias in promotion processes and quotas for promoting employees (encourages extremely unhealthy competition). 
- Absence of diversity across leadership. Where is leadership representation for the BIPOCs that the company supposedly cares so much about (particularly Latin/black employees?) It is all a facade. 
- Toxic culture of gossip, cutthroat behaviors, and high school-like cliques that are unwelcoming of new employees."

96,Robinhood,It's a cult. Next WeWork documentary. Run away.,2021-12-02,2.0,Senior Marketing Manager,"Amazing pay and benefits, but that's pretty standard for tech.","Management consists of a bunch of con artists that brag about their Master degrees from Ivy Leagues but have extremely poor people skills. We just recently lost our 3rd CMO. I've witnessed more than 4 people in management positions quit within less than a year. The founders get extremely jealous when the attention is not on them during All-Hands, even if it is just to listen to them rant about basketball. The culture here consists of the ""OGs"" who have zero backbone and their only reasoning for justifying any decision making is ""Because the founders said so."" They are so far removed from what the actual public perception of this brand is and get very defensive when people bring that point up in order to inform marketing strategies. The mass hiring of management positions that happened leading up to and after the IPO created a hostile power-tripping environment of people who pound their fists about which Big Tech company they came from before this. I can go on and on, but I'm anticipating this to be the next WeWork or Fyre Festival documentary."

198,Robinhood,Steadfast - eyes on the mission,2021-02-01,5.0,Customer Experience,"Culture is like no other in the industry. Incredible leadership, mission, growth opportunities, projects, and benefits. It's a simple as that.. 

Just a quick note - It's quite shocking to read  some of these one star reviews from current and former employees. For those who wrote reviews based on what occurred this past week, I'd suggest understanding the regulations and requirements of the industry you work in prior to spreading/believing in conspiracies.. It's a straight forward/simple explanation.  You're internal for goodness sake and you should take the time to understand the situation.  

Also, a quick note on the mission, the proof is in the pudding - look at what the company has done and continues to do. Not just zero commission trades on equities AND OPTIONS(which used to be unheard of, how fast people forget this was not the norm) but access to crypto through a brokerage account, options access, fractional shares, cash management etc. Think about cash management for a second.. prior to this, you were extremely limited to where you could set funds to earn as much or more than a savings account. The money sitting in cash was neglected and most brokerages(and many banks) continue to give you absolutely nothing rather than pass some of the benefits on to clients. Curious about quality of trade execution? Pull the pricing data, you will find that orders are not inferior to other firms(contrary to popular belief). Fractional shares, think Tesla, now everyone can participate. 

Robinhood is constantly searching for new, unique ways to bring more benefits and features to their clients. Heavily investing in customer support, the systems, product, the the online customer learning center. Customer support definitely has room to improve but it's on its way.

Name a fin-tech company or brokerage that pushes the boundaries like this... I'd guess that you can't. We innovate and the rest follow or attempt to mock. 

No doubt it's been a tough week, it's been a challenging 12 months, but let's keep our eyes on the mission. The facts will come out soon enough.","Robinhood is a rocket ship and there are obvious but also not so obvious growing pains. Expect long hours, busy days. 

Some of the general distrust from these false stories going around can be challenging but this is temporary."

I believe I've had the ability to have a larger impact and grow my career here than if I had joined a larger company 

Leadership: Our leadership is incredible.It puts me at ease knowing we're in capable hands and that such successful people have joined Robinhood because of the potential they see in the company (i.e. Jason Warnick, Gretchen Howard, Anne Hoge, Adam Wolff, etc.) 

Company/Culture: Leadership/employees are **obsessed** with our customers - how we can bring them the most value, listen and action on their needs better, etc. It's really fulfilling to go to work every day with a team that knows what they're working toward and is passionate about the mission","Not much - we're growing, which can mean a lot of change, but that's exciting for the right people.

266,Robinhood,Very happy and looking forward to the future,2020-02-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been here about 5 months and can honestly say I'm very happy. First, I have a great manager. They make me feel supported and are encouraging me to focus on my career development. Robinhood has a very fast work pace (which some may few as a con) but I'm listing it as a pro. It is never boring and the work is challenging / fulfilling! Robinhood as a company very much embodies the ""work hard play hard"" mentality and does a great job of providing perks that balance out the high workload. The people in general are awesome and everyone is passionate about what they do. You honestly cannot beat the culture here. I am happy with the work/life balance I have so far. I also have a lot of autonomy in my role which I love. And most important of all.. Robinhood is dog friendly!","The normal cons of any startup apply to Robinhood. The pace is quick and there is always a ton to do, which can be difficult for some people. We are often putting out fires. If you require a lot of direction and micro managing you will not thrive at this company. People also wear many hats which is typical of a startup, and can mean that you will become responsible for things that you didn't necessarily ""sign up for"".  Everything I've listed is to be expected given the stage we are at."
267,Robinhood,Great Culture and Benefits!,2020-02-28,5.0,Registered Representative,"- The benefits are amazing! Not many places could compare to the compensation and added benefits. Health benefits are great and four weeks paid vacation is a blessing.

The fast pace can also cause instability as well.
269,Robinhood,The Best One Yet!,2020-02-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This place is phenomenal. I have yet to have a day where I wasn't pumped to be apart of the Robinhood family. The emphasis on culture, building up your fellow teammates, and employee appreciate is unparalleled. This job was the best thing to ever happen to my dog - she loves coming here as much as I do! Most of all, I'm impressed with the C-suite. During our weekly all-hands meeting the entire senior leadership will answer any question from anyone in the company on the spot. This speaks to their commitment to transparency and has been super helpful.",The learning curve for someone outside of the financial industry is steep but completely manageable.
270,Robinhood,"Special place to work, build, and grow",2020-02-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I'm constantly grateful to be surrounded by a supportive team, driven colleagues, and a place where I can be autonomous and trusted to build and voice my opinions. The HR and leadership team truly cares about their employees and takes all voices/thoughts into account when making decisions, providing benefits, and building guidelines. The office has great energy where people are excited to be there - fueled by a shared mission to democratize access to finance. Really smart yet humble people.","Typical of a hyper-growth start-up, there are spacing constraints and imbalance of work bleeding into personal time. It's hard to completely disconnect (however, people still has so much optimism and energy that it's not a detriment. people give their 110% because they want to, not because they're expected or demanded)."
271,Robinhood,Feels like working at Google in the 2000s,2020-02-27,5.0,Software Engineer,"Robinhood has an amazing culture. What I imagine Google may have been like in its startup days.
- The work you do matters. Instead of grunt work, you try to solve some of the hardest problems in the industry. Even if you're an intern.
- The company is incredibly transparent with employees. Good, bad, and ugly, it's all open, and you are trusted to make it better.
- No big egos. Any employee can ask direct questions to leadership, and opinions are respected and taken seriously.
- Mission oriented! (people here seriously care about transforming the financial system to work for the many instead of just the uber wealthy)
- People here are some of the kindest, smartest and most creative.
- Snacks, perks, and swag is UNBEATABLE.

You will have tons of opportunities to try some new ideas, learn  and grow everyday. Free breakfast, lunch and dinner from Monday to Friday - you don't have to cook.","Sometimes you will be asked to do sth. in the morning and the deadline is the same day, which means the work pace is really fast.

278,Robinhood,Literally the best job I've ever had - I'm never leaving,2020-02-27,5.0,Product Operations Manager,"Robinhood captured the triple crown of employee satisfaction in my opinion: wonderful coworkers, challenging and engaging work, and generous compensation.  

The work is not easy, but it's very satisfying and the tasks change every day.  For me, that's awesome - I love variability and feel like I'm actually engaging in the work I do.  At the same time, when things get rough, your coworkers always have your back - everyone is willing to help you out if and when you need it.

Compensation is great - pay and benefits are top notch, and the office environment cannot be beat.  Food, drink, snacks, a *gorgeous* set of offices, and dogs!  It's easy to be comfortable at work so you can bring your best self to the tasks at hand.

Bottom line: I have never been happier in my workplace, and it's a pleasure to come to work each day.","By definition, building a company in a relatively new industry is not easy.  The work can be unstructured at times, and if you aren't comfortable with ambiguity and constant change or chaos, this probably isn't for you."

If the benefits aren't enough, you have a casual atmosphere where you're encouraged to be yourself and to challenge yourself. They give ample opportunity for advancement and the managers really respect you and want what's best for you.","Because we're still growing, there are times where we need to ""stretch"", so to speak. This means taking on additional responsibilities and wearing different ""hats"". It's definitely not a bad thing at all, but it's very important to be honest with your manager and to voice your limits so you don't push yourself too hard."

Coming from my last job, I had very low expectations in regard to my work-life balance,  the culture of the company, my co-workers, and honestly everything else that I would be walking into. Robinhood is not only revolutionizing the financial industry, but it's also revolutionizing the work place for employees. I truly feel like I matter and not like I'm just walking into a standard cookie cutter, 9-5 job. Employees are truly valued, heard, and appreciated here at Robinhood and you can really feel that energy consistently throughout the workplace.

- Strong mission and vision for the company inspire its employees and make the work enjoyable.
- Recent focus on tooling and infrastructure will help Robinhood mature as a fintech company.","- I have seen cutting corners to make sure project deadlines are met as part of the ""ship quickly"" startup mentality. This is being better addressed as we grow, but the mentality still lives with several employees.
- Growing pains have definitely been real"
298,Robinhood,"Great Culture, Interesting Work",2020-02-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"If I had to choose the best things about Robinhood, I'm split between the people and the products.

Robinhood cares immensely about culture fit, and it shows. My coworkers are friendly, fun to work and collaborate with, and talented at and passionate about what they do. There's a clear sense of community between employees, whether during meetings or at happy hour. 

The projects I've worked on are exciting; there's always something new and exciting to work on. I never feel like I'm doing busywork or that my contributions aren't valuable to the company, which really improves my morale and makes me excited to work here. Additionally, my manager proactively takes the time to learn what projects team members want work on and allocates us based on our input.

I appreciate how transparent our All Hands meetings are regarding the company's vision and performance. Also, I've interacted with upper management much more than expected. The level of trust and communication between employees and upper management makes me feel extremely valued as an employee, and I hope to see this continue as the company grows.","The product roadmap tends to change quickly and without much notice. Sometimes, I feel like our roadmap also doesn't make sense or isn't data-driven enough. While inconvenient, it makes sense given the stage we're in as a company.

I also feel that expectations for various levels can be unclear or not properly put into practice. I see myself and other junior-to-mid-level employees working on things normally allocated to senior employees out of necessity. On the other hand, I've also seen some senior employees not carry the same weight as juniors. 

Work-life balance is also an issue if you have trouble setting boundaries. While many employees will snooze Slack during off hours, it's not uncommon to get pinged late at night or on weekends by a busy coworker. Workloads and deadlines can also be very intense at times, with limited wiggle-room depending on your team."
299,Robinhood,Solid workplace,2020-02-26,4.0,Product Development Engineer,"There's still meaningful work to be done, and an ability to make a big impact. Culture is informal and friendly, offices are beautiful with lots of amenities.","Product velocity has slowed a bit.

If you have never worked in a startup environment before (like myself) prior to coming to Robinhood it is definitely an adjustment, but in all of the best ways possible. Not only do you have the freedom to be yourself in regards to attire and creativity, but you also have the ability to utilize your voice in many ways you wouldn't normally be able to in other traditional work settings, especially within financial services. Robinhood is breaking down the barriers for what typical workplaces should look like and feel like and that in itself is an achievement. Even when things are constantly changing, that's the beauty of the startup process! Being part of the hyper growth stage is something to be excited about. And to have a seat at the table in decision making processes is even more gratifying. Everyone has their own perspective and personal experiences, but with full transparency if you want to be a part of a company that embodies inclusion, diversity, career growth and employee empowerment, this is the place to be!","In any environment, adaptability is key and if you struggle with constant change and working in a fast-paced setting, then maybe it's best to rethink your career options.

Free lunch is nice. 

Medical benefits are very good. 

If you are young there will be lots of people your own age at work. 

The pay is above average for the basic work that you do.

Stretch opportunities and projects here and there.

Awesome career building job for non-support staff.

Fun outings and amazing work-life balance.","Very cliquey, almost feels like high school. 

Everyone is having sex with each other.

If you've ever wanted to be in a season of The Office, come work at Robinhood!

Not many advancement opportunities for support staff.

If you're not in the ""cool kids"" circle, you will get talked down on/talked about behind your back. 

You should not apply to a support job at Robinhood expecting advancement. You will be given call-center type of work with stretch opportunities, but those opportunities may or may not translate into a promotion regardless of how good of a job you do. There is a good deal of favoritism and those who are close with or friends with individuals at the top will get higher positions and roles.  This is not a whiny personal complaint because I did not get promoted, this is a genuine fact that many here have experienced."

In fact, I'm excited to come here and work with my team. The people who work here all come here with the same mission on the mind and that is to make our customers as happy as we possibly can. Everything we do is centered around making our product better and our clients happier. The vibe in the office is nothing like a traditional financial office. Obviously, there are perks too which people love. However, the perks are not what keep me here, it's the people I work with and the environment I get to work in.  I've been in a normal financial world where the client doesn't always become the number one priority and it normally doesn't lead to great culture. Overall my experience with my manager has been great. They are super receptive to my ideas and have me push actual improvements quickly. I've only been here a few months, but it's been great so far!","I may have not had bad experiences with my manager, but I know others have had issues with getting clear direction and goals. Some other issues include time differences between the two offices causing scheduling and work conflicts."
320,Robinhood,Amazing high growth company,2019-03-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,One of the reasons I love working at Robinhood is that it is a mission driven company where values drive decisions.  People bring intellectual curiosity and a learner mindset to every challenge and move quickly to implement positive change.  I am also pleasantly surprised at how humble and collaborative my co-workers are every day and it's a privilege to build this company with them.,As we grow (both in # of employees and # of customers) we will need to be diligent about maintain a high quality bar while achieving scale.
321,Robinhood,Making a Real Difference,2019-03-09,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"Benefits, coworkers, food, the vision and goals., the pay! 

I’ve seen these other negative reviews and can attest that the information stated is false. It definitely seems like a jaded person with the intent of hurting people and the Robinhood brand. With that intent, the great things about Robinhood aren’t even mentioned! 

As someone who has been here awhile, I know that Robinhood takes all HR matters extremely seriously. I have no doubts in our HR team and our management. They speak to our company culture and the strong foundation that’s been built. We are a company that’s trying to make a difference and everyday are doing amazing things to reach that goal. 

I’ve never felt more valued at any other employer. I can be myself at work and that’s amazing. Robinhood makes me so proud to be working there and I count myself lucky to be a Robinhoodie.",Whoever this employee is who is posting lies!
322,Robinhood,A lot of words with no real action ​,2019-02-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Fast paced and nice people,"Over the last month or so we've found out that there are a lot of interoffice relationships, which shouldn't be happening.  My question to our management team is why is this happening and how can you correct it. Maybe tighten up the policies in the office and cut down on the fraternization to create a more professional environment.

Management has acknowledged that things are wrong here but so far no major changes have taken place, which is unnerving. In response to a comment in a previous review ""Just because someone does not get fired does not mean the company didn't investigate. People are quick to jump to conclusions without having facts they are not entitled to have"", this is true. I am aware that Robinhood has investigated the relationships in the office and all of them are confirmed. These are facts and we all know that here. What makes many of us uncomfortable is that there has been no re-assignment of these employees into different departments or onto different teams. Romantic and sexual relationships have no business happening in a professional work environment, especially when it happens with managers and subordinates.

This office is very cliquey and it's always interesting to see who is talking down about who. Small groups around who are typically uninviting to others. Just an observation

324,Robinhood,Unresponsive Management - Room for concern? Are they listening?,2019-02-21,1.0,Support,Friendly employees and interesting vision,"I have heard some talk throughout our office lately and after reading a review titled ""Toxic environment with inappropriate sexual relationships between management and subordinates"" I wanted to chime in. This was sent to me by another employee here and i felt like I could give some insight. This is something to be concerned about and is happening inside our office. Word travels fast and when something happens it does not take long for others to learn about it.

Over the last few months there have been a couple relationships that have turned over here, mainly from people bragging or talking to friends about it (which is how I heard about things). I do feel that our company is pretty professional for the most part but I don't think they have acted so recently. I am glad to hear that there are other people here who are uncomfortable about co-workers hooking up but that does not address all of the problems with it. This creates an awkward work environment and I can see why people are unhappy enough to come forward about it.

I think Robinhood needs to take some control of what is happening and listen to what others are saying. The other review mentioned a ""professional and safe"" work environment and I can say while I don't feel ""unsafe"" with my physical surrounds here, there is a definite level of discomfort knowing about these relationships happening and no sort of change happening."
325,Robinhood,Most transparent company ever,2019-02-20,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"The culture here is nothing like anywhere I have ever worked. I have worked in corporate America for a lot of years with a couple brokerage firms under my belt. Some of the reviews here specific to the Orlando office are written by people who most likely have never worked for an established company that adheres to specific HR guidelines which include not to disclose investigations. Just because someone does not get fired does not mean the company didn't investigate. People are quick to jump to conclusions without having facts they are not entitled to have. There is nothing unsafe about the environment or non-inclusive. Our leaders all the way at the top to the bottom are more transparent then you will ever see a Fidelity, Etrade or Schwab.  There are a lot of younger folks here so I give them the benefit of the doubt not knowing how good they have it but this company is incredible. Free Healthcare, dental and vision. Free lunch. Freedom to roam around the office and work in your own personal space. Not to mention the comfort in knowing you can voice your opinion and things actually change. I think they did a great job handling the recent events and were candid about it as much as they could be. I applaud the CO-Ceo for addressing it as well and taking tough questions. It's not easy as a company to address allegations that are based on opinion or rumor. There are zero threats here, it is all inclusive, and people are Happy. I am not writing this to combat my colleagues but simply give another side because I don't think it's fair to be judged off a few people when most of us feel much different about the culture.",Bring reses pieces back
326,Robinhood,Toxic environment with inappropriate sexual relationships between management and subordinates,2019-02-11,1.0,Support Specialist,The company is fast paced and offers decent benefits.,"Robinhood curates, and fosters, an uncomfortable work environment when it comes to inter-office relationships. There are currently multiple cases of sexual misconduct between supervisors and subordinates, all of which management seems to have no intent on addressing. I've been speaking with our Human Resources department for weeks about things, and we've seen no change within the office. Managers here are very tight nit, and know that they need to hide eachother's relationships as they happen. 

This has made it extremely uncomfortable to work in this office environment knowing that they are making no efforts to stop anything. Sexual advances and obvious flirtation between employees and managers in the office, along with inappropriate relations at company outings has truly made this office unbearable for many of us and causes daily disruptions.

Many of us are currently seeking positions elsewhere, because we do not feel that Robinhood has our best interests in mind. They continue to ignore the problems inside the office and have chosen not to rectify any of the situations at hand. I love what I do here at the company but cannot work in a place where they do not look out for their employees in their entirety.

My advice, if you're seeking a job here, keep in mind that there are no boundaries when it comes to relationships. Male managers are sleeping with married women and others are seeking entry level employees. If you are looking for a professional and ""safe"" feeling work environment, Robinhood is not it."
327,Robinhood,Robinhood 1 year later,2018-12-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've never felt compelled to write a company review before now, so here goes.  I have been employed at Robinhood - Lake Mary for just over a year now.  At times it's been frustrating, tiring, and aggravating, long hours and late nights. But, within the past year I have been exposed to more facets and departments within a clearing firm, than in my previous 8+ years are other clearing firms and in the end it's been worth it. I got exposure to the whole wheel and not just a cog in the wheel, I was allowed outside of the proverbial silo to explore new areas.  Robinhood allows you to flourish, expand your horizons and increase your knowledge base. Recently there was some apprehension with regards to compensation, would Robinhood be the change they are attempting to me or status quo. Robinhood put their money with their mouth is, listened to it's employees, HR and compensated fairly. I took a risk leaving an established firm and coming to Robinhood, I can honestly say I made the best decision career wise in my life.","The only con would be the ambiguous nature of the job, if you are a person that prefers structure and being told what to do daily, Robinhood is not a place for you.  You get what you put into it."

329,Robinhood,Support Associate,2018-10-10,5.0,Support Associate,"Too many to count honestly.

The pay and benefits are incomparable. Starting pay is $18 per hour as a support associated and all benefits for the employee are covered by Robinhood. Medical, dental, vision are paid for completely and with my wife on my plan, I only have to pay about for about 33% of her medical cost while her dental and vision are covered as well.

There is paid parental leave, continuing development in the company as well as some reimbursement for courses outside of work. Paid time off is 4 weeks per year on a biweekly accruing basis. 8 sick days and holidays match financial market holidays.

The support management team is also amazing. There are weekly check ins with your direct supervisor to set expectations and discuss your progress, any concerns or problems you have, as well as any ideas you have. Jake, the manager of the support team, is an excellent leader.

Being completely honest, not having phone support at the moment is a huge pro. It's so much faster and easier to serve customers and help them through email rather than taking phone calls.

Robinhood provides lunch everyday and breakfast on Fridays which is amazing. There is also a fully stocked snack kitchen with a variety of drinks and snacks that are all free.

We also have company trips as well as departmental and team outings throughout the year which is fantastic. There was a weekend retreat to a resort near the HQ in California which was awesome. The outings to local areas are places like Universal, go-kart racing/arcades and others after work hours.

There are 2-3 weeks of training when you start (depending on scheduling and any holidays) which helps you get covered in many different basic support issues. After that you will have more periodic training over time to help develop you into new areas.

I can't think of anything else, but overall it is a fantastic company with an excellent culture that promotes teamwork and serving our customers in every way possible. Everyone from the CEOs down to support associates are always doing their best to help.","There really aren't many I can think of and the ones I do think of are really petty and irrelevant things like some bad lunches sometimes.

One issue specifically for support is the last of support associates. We serve millions of people with a very small team in place. I think we do fantastic work, however I know many customers feel like our support is lacking. Growing this department will help in the long run. I know it is happening slowly to make sure we get the right people in place, but in the short run it can be slightly discouraging to see a lot of people upset with out turnaround times."

I like working here. You can tell that the founders are passionate about our mission of ""democratizing America's financial system""...that's not just a catch-phrase, they really want to remove barriers and cut out middle-men.

It's got all the good things you expect at a startup with the free food and lol attitude.

The people are really good; they are friendly and want to help each other succeed. I think Robinhood has tried hard to not hire jerks and so far it's really working.

I'm 40 years old and have a family so I was concerned at first about the idea of joining a startup and saying goodbye to seeing the family for dinner, but so far that's been manageable. I come in first in the ""early"" around 8 in the morning and leave ""early"" between 5 and 6.

- Still fairly small engineering team overall so as engineers you would have a lot of impact and recognition.
- Includes all of the typical bay area startup perks.","- Need more PMs and designers, many front-end projects are blocked because the company lacks PMs and designers to spec out the project.

- Lack of recreational amenities (e.g. pingpong table) due to lack of physical space."
356,Robinhood,Good place to work,2017-07-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Robinhood has a strong product with a powerful mission (democratize access to the American financial system). This makes it easy to get motivated to come to work and put one's all into the job. We've built a team of people who are both incredibly intelligent and easy to work with, which is a dream come true for collaboration. There are always interesting projects going on, be it yours or one mentioned at all hands.

The work culture is fun and laid back, best captured visually by our whimsical murals on the walls depicting the world of Sherwood Forest with cats. It's a fun group of people to eat lunch with during the week or play board games with at the end of a long week.

Perks are pretty solid (wellness reimbursement, catered lunches and dinners, etc.). We don't have matching 401(k) but what startup does? We have equity stock options.

I've had only good managers so far despite these managers never having managed before. Not sure if this is luck or a part of the ""secret sauce"" that is hiring, but it's been a pleasure working with all of them!

Management listens to feedback and makes changes accordingly, including increasing the number of PTO days accruing a year from 15 to 20, rescheduling all hands for a time that worked better for early morning teams, revisiting the compensation policy structure, and increasing support for women in the firm following feedback. Personally, this is my favorite thing about the company, as nobody expects a startup to get everything right the first time around -- what matters is course correcting and putting the effort in to be better than you were yesterday.","It's not perfect.

The hours can be ridiculously long especially for teams that come in at 6:00 am (or before), which can make the teams seem disparate. If you're on the early schedule, it can be brutal at times, especially in the winter.

Work/life balance could use some serious improvement. Some teams are better at this than others.

Not every team receives the same resources or recognition: the focus is clearly on developing and shipping with support, compliance, and HR as more annoying requirements. Please hire more compliance people. Please.

The pay may not be equal with competitors, and the vagueness of titles within the startup environment doesn't help. The pay disparities between departments can be demoralizing at times, though this is true for every tech company. This is a work in progress, though, so it may not be a ""con"" forever.

It's somewhat diverse (and has improved tremendously in the last year), but it's still both a tech company and a financial firm, i.e. there are no women in management or executive roles. Granted, there has been a lot of effort going into building team diversity and bringing more voices to the table. (See last paragraph in ""pros"" about management acting on feedback.)  While it's not the best starting place, I do truly believe we're headed in the right direction."

Seeing the movement of large amount of money, even in an electronic form, can make you fall into greed and prejudice. Fortunately, we have the clear mission and the nice team to fulfill that mission together."
359,Robinhood,Best Company Ever.,2017-06-30,5.0,Marketing Specialist,"At Robinhood, I work alongside some of the most intelligent, down to earth, ambitious, and kind individuals I have ever met. The work environment is extremely collaborative and open to testing new ideas. Since Robinhood is still a pretty lean team, your work is noticed immediately (which in my opinion, is awesome). The company culture is amazing and there is never a day I don't want to come into work. Overall, this company is comprised of incredible people, a purpose-filled mission to democratize the financial system, and everyone is working hard to benefit the world. 

I never thought I would be so genuinely happy with where I work.","A bit limited on resources, but we're hiring lots of people so we can get things moving quickly and with top-notch quality!"

361,Robinhood,Best team I've worked with,2017-06-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Exceptional team. This is hands-down the best team I've ever worked with, even better than my previous team at Facebook. Some of the best engineers, designers, and product managers in the world are here.
- Important mission. We're democratizing the American financial system - something that has traditionally offered tremendous opportunity to the wealthy and elite - and making it accessible to everyone. We're making people's lives better and fixing a totally broken system.
- Individual impact. If you’re building a product, you’re usually the only person on the team owning that feature. This is incredibly exciting and fulfilling.","It's not for everyone. These might be pros or cons for you:
- We have an aversion to bro culture and smug attitudes.
- We justify our decisions with data rather than seniority.
- We want people who care about our mission, not people who want to ride a unicorn rocket ship."
362,Robinhood,Join Robinhood if you are looking for a fantastic start up experience.,2017-06-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I would say that Robinhood does a very good job on maintaining amazing corporate culture.

365,Robinhood,Five Stars,2017-06-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I love coming to work everyday!  The culture is welcoming and warm, everyone is apart of the team and we all have the same goal. It's a dream come true to work at such a great company!",I tried to think of one - CAN'T.
366,Robinhood,"High-impact & meaningful work in collegial, respectful environment",2017-06-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Mission I can get behind
- ""Think tank"" atmosphere, in the sense that there are very interesting people with different academic and work backgrounds coming together, who are very interested in /excited by a range of ideas
- Management is ethical, fair, accessible, and very open to feedback
- Non bro-y, very respectful group of coworkers
- Diverse group of employees, and zero sexism (or any other -isms, for that matter)
- Clear-eyed vision for the company
- Hybrid nature of work--input from everyone is welcome and actively sought out, even if you're working in a totally different team
- Very interesting, welcoming/inclusive coworkers
- Focus on ethics permeates the company
- Collaborative: people don't try to take credit for themselves, and are very generous in highlighting the work of others that might go unnoticed","- Space is increasingly tight with increased hiring
- Not enough meeting rooms
- Perks exist but are not plentiful
- Location not very convenient since not very close to Caltrain (about 10 minute walk from California Av Caltrain)
- Hasn't quite achieved gender parity yet
- Don't always get systematic feedback on your work, so have to be proactive about asking in order to get meaningful feedback
- Some teams are stretched thin
- Physical space could be nicer / get more natural sunlight"
367,Robinhood,Best company to work for,2017-06-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Amazing group of people - smart, driven and always ready to help. The company is mission driven and everyone is super motivated.","PTO is 4 weeks only, unlimited would be sweat."
368,Robinhood,Start on your life's work,2017-06-30,5.0,Senior Operator,"Starting to work on projects at Robinhood was the first time I really felt like I was beginning to hone my craft and start my life's work. That isn't to say that I didn't value the skills and intuition that I had built in other jobs, but it was the first time it felt like putting them to use actually mattered.

The entire team, from the founders down, are 100% committed to making finance about the average person - the person who's trying to make it in their life, and needs help. Not trying to make the rich richer. 95% of financial startups I considered before joining RH have gone the direction of catering to the wealthy, because their product knowledge is too weak to build a mass-market product. Robinhood really is driving both the cost of operating a financial business down through superior technology and automation, and passing those savings back to the customer. At the same time, the commitment to building beautiful, useful products is what sets us apart for millions of our users.

The work environment is about output, quality, and craftsmanship. We all want to get better at our craft. Sitting in every seat means something to people here, and there is a clear connection between people's daily work and the impact it will have on our users.

Our users are also our friends and family, people whom we care deeply about, and who come from all sorts of backgrounds. We are building this product for them, and millions of others who believe in equitable access to high impact and low cost financial services that are beautifully designed.","Its a smaller working environment - if you are looking for titles or people to manage for the sake of ""leveling up your resume"", look elsewhere. We do 3 things here: Research, Build, and Ship.  Your impact here is always measured by output, collaboration, and mentorship and your goal is to hone your craft."
369,Robinhood,Fantastic place to work,2017-06-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Robinhood is a great place to work.  The people here are brilliant, motivated, and - most importantly - friendly.  We've got a very tight community here that works hard to promote our mission and build the best products we can. 

Workplace culture is fantastic, from the catered meals to the health benefits and other random perks.  The company takes care of us and makes everyone feel welcome and appreciated.  I left another great job to come here and I don't regret it for a second.","It's hard work to build groundbreaking products - hours can be long, but it's well worth it."
