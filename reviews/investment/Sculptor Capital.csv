29,,Look at all other recent reviews,2017-06-20,2.0,Analyst,"1. Free breakfast food available at the pantry and free lunch orders on Seamless up to $15 and delivered to your desk. Sounds great, but you get tired of ordering from the same place after 3 months.  $15 on lunch doesn't get you much, and this $15 limit has not changed forever.  Also, because everyone orders via Seamless, you feel obligated to do so. Sometimes, it's nice to go out and have a lunch outside, but you won't be able to do so without feeling guilty. Also the food at the pantry has downgraded significantly over the years.

2. Great healthcare benefits. Until last year the benefits were fully paid by the firm. Now, employees must shoulder some of the expenses.  Still a great benefit at the moment, but with all the cost cuts, who knows what the benefit will be like in few years.

3. Great professionally looking office with great outside view (if you are on 39th floor or 40th floor).

4. Good place for professionals who has 2-3 years of experience to work for 2-3 years to learn. Personally, I would not recommend staying for extended period of time beyond that, as growth opportunity here at Oz is not great.","1. New senior managements with fresh look at the situation. What they preach sounds good, but what they are truly focusing on is cost cuts, and not on how to make the firm better place for the employees.

2. LOTS OF people leaving.  The headcount of the company decreased by more than 20% from its peak about 2 years ago.  People who are leaving and have left are employees that were loyal, knowledgeable, skillful, and smart (and personable!). Almost everyone I talk to that are still at Oz expresses an interest in leaving the firm. Less people = more work, but not necessarily get paid more. The worst part is that the management is doing absolutely nothing to prevent more people from quitting.  Maybe that's what they want.

3. ""Promote within"" is a false statement. The only promotions I've seen involves their bosses leaving.  Even then, in many cases, instead of promoting a capable employee, the management likes to find talents externally.

4. Very little bonding and interactions between the employees in different teams. People only come to you when they need something.  Personally, I like to have more personal interaction with people I work with, since I spend more time with them than with my family.

5. Overly complicated process and institutional nuances causes steep learning curve. This also takes away employees from fully understanding what they are doing and focus more on learning about the process. Most people resist changes, so there are no efforts being made to reduce unnecessary complexity.

6. Even during vacations, you are expected to check your e-mails.  Also, taking a vacation is such a big deal.  Why can't I take the vacations I earned without being complained about when to take them?

7. Look at the asset under management and the stock price of the Company in the past few years. That will tell you everything you need to know about the firm."
30,,Stay Away,2017-06-08,1.0,Analyst,Free breakfast and lunch if you think that your 1 hour work only worths that much. They even cut most breakfast choice because of the legal settlement cost ( how much can it save???),"1. No growth opportunity 
2. Management doesn't care about the employees unless you directly make money

Biggest problem with OZ is the whole layer of management -- can't think of one MD/EMD/Senior Manager who is motivational or technically impressive or cares about employees or just really understands how to leverage a technology and ops group within a financial firm.  Problem starts at the very top and filters downward.  From a tech perspective, it doesn't help that the firm's senior management has no tech or ops background and tech management is not really a deeply experienced, creative or motivational group (....mostly the opposite).

4) Cult –like atmosphere -- they expect you to give up your personal life & worship senior management -- very cliquey in certain departments
5) There is a real division between Front Office & Back office roles – the people on the upper floors “look down” at anyone that’s not in a role that makes them $$ (accounting, operations, compliance, etc.)

For me, however, this ""perk"" merely added to an already cult-like environment and culture.  It quickly grows old.

The offices are nice...","No upward mobility.  Talent is overlooked due to short-sightedness and politics.  Managers foster a culture of fear.  I never did hear an encouraging remark during my time there -- just the opposite.  

What's more, the CEO is rarely to be seen -- basically, he has no interaction with employees outside of the EMDs.   Other certain members of the executive committee are around, but you'd prefer that they not be, as they are more inclined to point a finger and humiliate employees in front of their peers than they are inclined to help their team carry out the firm's mission (which, by the way, is unclear).

Generally speaking, the people are not be nicest -- certainly not the type of people you want to deal with on a daily basis.  As with the free breakfast and lunch, they quickly grow old.

If you want to leave the office during the day to eat, run an errand, get some air, that's ""fine"", but it's frowned upon.

During my tenure the senior leaders have significantly improved the culture, creating a very collegial and dynamic work environment.  They have focused on re-engineering the operations and accounting functions to automate manual processes and shift the work detail to analysis and value-add work.  The firm is clearly willing and open to change when good business cases are presented.

Management does a great job recognizing top performers, continuing to challenge them with complex projects and additional responsibilities.  While the pace can be very fast at times, teamwork is encouraged and additional support is always available.  The relationship between the front and back office is very strong, significantly better than what I've experienced at previous employers.

You cannot improve yourself, rather you are encourage to put your head down and not be intellectually curious. Most people are two faced, there isn't mentorship at all. 
The HR team could not be more superficial and clueless. At the end of the day they do not care about helping employees improve themselves professionally. They rather have you be ""content"" with your responsibilities than explore your strengths and potential capabilities. 
Gossip is very common among the administrative staff, starting with the receptionist. 
Overall you will not be professionally challenged but rather dissapointed with the corporate culture. Last thing, they use Lotus Notes not Microsoft Outlook, very outdated and inefficient."
68,,Culture of suppression.  Infantile management.  Elementary level of work.,2014-08-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Breakfast available.  Lunch paid for.  Moderately higher compensation than large banks.  Some very high caliber coworkers.,"Closet management.  Fear culture.  Rigid chain of command with extreme level of micromanagement, to include dictating whether you can communicate with other members of firm or attend meetings in your area of responsibility.  Zero communication with regard to industry trends of company news, especially news of a serious nature such as SEC investigations.  Job duties and responsibilities require the intellect associated with early high school education.  No one on one career development.  Zero assessment of work quality until final review.  Bonuses far below sector levels.  Public firm which almost eliminates meritocratic environment.  Job responsibilities do not match those explained in interviews.  Very little room for advancement and almost no internal mobility.  Most people have been doing the same job for 8 or more years.  Unnecessarily long hours with zero focus on strategic technical improvements.  Majority of employees unhappy with jobs.  Employer retaliation likely in cases of looking/interviewing externally."
