0,Techstars,Awesome company to work for!,2022-04-16,5.0,Quality Assurance Engineer,Been here less than a year and have been impressed by how the company seems to care about the wellness of their employees! Great collaboration & teamwork.,Seems to be growing so fast it is hard to keep up! Unsure of how bonuses and raises will work here. Also unsure of opportunities to advance.
1,Techstars,great,2022-04-16,4.0,Corp Development,A good spot to work would recommend!,none to say at the moment
2,Techstars,Weak Leadership,2022-04-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some program teams are providing exceptionally excellent and truly world class experiences and opportunities for early-stage founders. If you have the fortune of working for one of those teams (or in one of those regions) you will have an excellent experience serving founders, growing your network, learning about the tech ecosystem, and making life-long friendships.","The organization has weak and low integrity leadership. A few years ago there was a strong internal culture that was damaged by the original CEOs wanting to scale the company as if it were a SaaS business and failing (it's not SaaS, it's productized service). This resulted in a couple years of tumult within the senior leadership team and resolute abdication of responsibility within the executive team. The board brought on a new CEO who is even more factional than the previous leadership and lacking as a visionary. Likely, whether they know it or not, they were brought on as a hired gun to rapidly change the company, take the blame for the stress of the changes, and then the original CEO(s) will come back to save the day .

All of this impacts everyone's day to day lives because it's creates a disordered environment from the top down. It means employees aren't supported, camaraderie is lost, collaboration is difficult, and culture is toxic."
3,Techstars,Great learning experience,2022-04-11,4.0,Associate,"Great learning experience, good opportunity to network (Techstars shines on your resume for life) and also leads into job offers after the program if you put in the effort.","Lower pay, a bit unstructured (what you make of it)"
4,Techstars,New leadership lacks strategy,2022-04-08,1.0,,"Program Managers, Managing Directors  and Associates are great - all here believing in the ""helping founders succeed"" mission, putting in their best work.","The new CEO is a serious disappointment - all words, no substance. No real strategy or vision. ""Growth, growth, growth"" is all she talks about. Growth is not a strategy, it's a desired outcome - strategy is how to get there. She doesn't have a strategy for Techstars. There were huge hopes for the new CEO coming in - but nothing changed for the better since she stepped into the role - in fact, it is worse."
5,Techstars,Interesting role with lots of startup learning opportunities,2022-04-06,5.0,Operations Associate,"you get to learn alot, meet lots of founders and understand startups","Low salary, high workload, contract basis"

12,Techstars,Things used to be good....,2022-02-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Working with entrepreneurs
-The OG are good people
-Original mission serves","-New CEO has no loyalty, empathy and does not care for the people. The way she presents herself is absolutely not how she reacts. Very disingenuous. 
-Leadership is no longer about the people
-There are no longer opportunities for internal players and is one of the reasons why so many people are leaving. 
-People are leaving in droves due to lack of confidence in new leadership, lack of opportunities, fear factor for lack of security and new mission being wholly money and not founder focus.
-Lots of favoritism where certain people are treated differently and protected due to their relationship with some members of leadership.
-The Techstars ego is strong...they think everyone knows who they are and are fans...this isn't true I realized once I was no longer drinking the koolaid."
13,Techstars,"Started as an amazing experience, but disappointing in the end",2022-01-26,1.0,Program Manager,"Some great reasons to work at Techstars:
- Access to a large network ranging from founders to investors
- Learn how to operate a startup on the job (no better opportunity)
- Work closely with some incredible founders, many who will be in your life for years to come
- Still some honest people left in the company trying to steer it in the right direction","Some not so great reasons to work at Techstars:
- Upper management paints their own reality of the company, despite what is happening on the ground
- Total lack of empathy, despite the new CEO writing a book on the need for empathy in tech
- Egos, egos egos everywhere. Did I mention the egos?
- On the note of egos, middle and lower level employees are treated like interns, particularly by Managing Directors.
- Burn out and overwork are rampant. It's not uncommon to hear about peers crying on the job because they are so stressed out. Few complain, they just leave for better opportunities.
- No internal career progression whatsoever. They expect you to come for a couple years, put in your time, then leave without any commitment. If you're looking for a place to put down some roots and make an impact, keep looking.
- Diversity inside and outside is practically non-existent, despite the heavy emphasis and cliche sayings you'll find everywhere.
- Salaries are lower than market rate for similar roles with no transparency between genders 
- Non-existent People Operations and odd management structure leaves no protection for middle and lower level employees"

Hard to navigate when you need resources or support - will have to find budget to get support from external contractors if you need help asap

40,Techstars,Serious Growing Pains but Moving in The Right Direction,2021-02-19,4.0,Current Employee,"-Some of the smartest and most passionate colleagues you'll ever work with 
-Mission driven company
-Flexibility to work remotely, most managers are very flexible which provides a nice balance for employees
-Ability to grow if you willing to put the work in (many complain there is no growth opportunity) but in reality there is a ton if you're willing to hustle and not wait for it. While you may not get promotions often (pretty flat org), you can learn so much by working across the org and creating your own path to development
-Getting to work with entrepreneurs is a dream, we're incredibly lucky to work in this sector
-Things are changing, that's not good for everyone which sucks as there are really good people at Techstars but it's good for the business and it's good for the founders which is what we're here to do (pro/con)","-It's the ugly teenage years. There are constant reorgs, jobs change often and there is a push pull across team for budget/resources.. While this is not ideal, the reality is that this happens often as companies as they begin to really mature. It's hard on employees, especially younger employees who haven't gone through this before but it's the reality of business change. Techstars can 100% do better to help their employees in these transitional times. Unless you're on an accelerator, there is a sense of job-insecurity. Even then, Techstars should focus on finding ways to keep great staff after programs end. 
-Pay is still low for the workload but it's an incredible company to have on your resume, you will get lots of interviews after working at Techstars. 
-Techstars needs to quickly revamp the marketing team
-ELT needs to make a decision on if/how they are going to change the product mix and GTM as the current model is stale. It's stressful on employees who are sitting in a constant state of change on the product they are trying to deliver.
-Data is a mess
-There is a culture of rampant complaining among employees. Many want things to be perfect and complain about Management being top down (this is often true BTW). In reality, in my personal experience, these same people also sit on the sides and never bring new ideas to the table while complaining (toxic behavior). If you don't like what is happening, speak up and try to get your hands dirty. Techstars is not for the faint of heart, you need to seriously hustle to prove yourself. If this is not your style, then you really should not try to work here as it's not going to be a good experience for you."
41,Techstars,Great organization,2021-02-05,5.0,EIR (Entrepreneur In Residence),"+ lots of interaction with world-class startups

Also, the accelerator is designed to promote work-life balance and engagement between founders and the program team.",Working virtually can be draining.
43,Techstars,"Very toxic culture... ""Don't drink that Kool-aid...""",2020-11-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some very smart, connected people
Great mission for Founders","- Really toxic culture. You might not see it immediately because the mission is amazing, but slowly but surely the kool -aid you've been given starts to taste of poison and you start to see what's really going on.
- Some terrible managers/leadership - shocking behaviour reported to People Ops but they're too scared/incompetent to do anything about it.
- A lot of nepotism - e.g if you worked at Zoll or Makerbot you'll be fine, maybe with new CEO it will change
- There's a lot of Boulder v's the rest of the global organisation. HQ rolls out processes and material that is very Boulder-centric and they don't seem to care about regional nuances, cultural differences or language barriers. 
- They do not care about Corporates. They don't treat them like clients or customers, they expect them to fund the program, the equity and support non-revenue generating activity and other programs that have nothing to do with their accelerator. 
- Corporates are now saying ""It's not Founder First, it's Techstars First"". Whatever TS wants, TS does. 
- Accelerator model for founders is good, but TERRIBLE for corporates.
- There's a lot of high-fiving and patting each other on the back for literally turning up to work - so bizarre!
- They've also managed to convince 1,000's of people to mentor and work for free (or for very little e.g. the associates), with the amount they charge, this it's madness!"

84,Techstars,"Great people, poor management",2017-08-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flexible PTO (aka unlimited), typical 401K match, casual office environment. The people at Techstars all have awesome backgrounds and I truly enjoyed the people I worked with on a day to day basis. There's an amazing amount of talent within the company.","The company culture at Techstars is broken. While management talks a lot about diversity, growth, opportunities, engagement, etc. I found that there wasn't truly awareness about how lower level employees were feeling (questions for leadership around pay that came up repeatedly were attributed to one disgruntled employee rather than considering that maybe lots of people had the same issue). Many of my colleagues and I felt overworked, underpaid, under-utilized, and under-appreciated. When I was hired, my manager told me I was overqualified for the role but there was ""so much opportunity"". Over the next year, my team was downsized 3 times, I had 3 months without a manager, and my new manager said ""I don't sit around and think about your career"" and that while he knew I was doing more than my existing job description, he didn't understand why a promotion would be so important to me.  While I loved the program managers and others I worked with, I felt like I was pigeonholed into a role that, in my mind, was supposed to be a stepping stone. I spoke to HR several times and they acknowledged there were issues but they didn't know how to fix them. Techstars execs are great about creating roles for people that are in their inner circle, but not about retaining and developing talent across the board. While I'm grateful for my experience, I'm glad I left."

86,Techstars,A Great Company with Great People.,2016-12-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Work with an awesome group of talented individuals. Advanced Corporate culture.,Company is not huge so promotion is limited
87,Techstars,Great Experience,2016-12-02,5.0,Business Associate,Awesome experience - I learnt so much so quickly. Salary is low but goes far enough in Berlin,Only lasts 3 months - but had a blast!
88,Techstars,"Not great, not terrible.",2016-11-07,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good benefits, flexible PTO. The network offers the greatest value if you put in the work. The programs in local cities are inspiring as well as the people leading the programs on the ground.","I found the internal culture to be misaligned and more forced than what naturally occurs when employees are happy. For a global company, the business practices are USA standard being most executed decisions are heavily influenced by a white American majority, disorganized, and diplomatically stale. They have a bounty of women on staff and a “diversity"" initiative but also tolerance for staff who’ve shown unethical conduct toward women.  It's not a great place to work but not terrible short term or if you have no other options and don't mind the stuff mentioned above. Pretty high turnover."
89,Techstars,-,2016-10-26,4.0,Associate,"Great mentors, and solid exposure to incredibly smart founders.
Good work-life balance for the most part.
Entrepreneurial environment - you get out of your experience what you put in.","Too many needless meetings on a daily morning basis.
Not enough knowledge sharing on how to run the day to day of the program - this could have saved us tons of time

97,Techstars,"Experience, opportunities, and life-long friends - scuffed by a handful of cons",2014-07-17,3.0,Associate,Connections (if you play them well) putting you in front of influential people in the industry; the people you work with throughout the space; coffee/snacks and sporadic meals; Boulevard beer on tap (until it runs out); opportunities to work with startups and own projects; a handful of other opportunities pop up from time-to-time,"More time could be given to helping direct professional career post contract; 'not many' of the actual representatives from the Boulder office had much interest in really getting to know the associates past most initial interactions; had to work about an extra week past contract and have yet to see the check from it; will spend more time than most others in the space cleaning up messes, making coffee, and preparing spaces for guests and catered meals."

I was able to find my niche and work fast and freely.,A little disorganized at times but I believe this form of organization has to. Maybe could use a little more focus on some of the hackstar a and associates.
