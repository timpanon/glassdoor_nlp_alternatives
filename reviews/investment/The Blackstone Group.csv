When you work in the DC office you don't have time to take additional trainings since it interferes with your work there.

If you are contracted to the government, blackstone does not care about you, they care about what the government wants. Federal employees were rude and vindictive and I was told I just might not understand what they want. At no point was it a Fed's fault, it was strictly my fault. 

When I was told my contract would not be renewed, i asked for lenience with teleworking/using my time off to find work. I got two telework days and was then told ""you need to use your sick time to find work"". I was told we aren't trusted to telework so we can't utilize it. Management does not like being confrontational so will say what they need to get you out of the room. I trusted my boss and that was a mistake.

I had no training for both my positions. I was told my original job would be a research job and that's all; it had nothing to do with that.

Work is interesting - there's something new every day and we see so much and can learn a ton.

Hyper focused on client relationships and ""customer service"", which helps the firm maintain strong relationships

Each business unit is pretty much a standalone business, so you feel like you're working for a much smaller firm. You can get to know people, get more face time with senior people and have a greater impact.

If you figure out what people value and have demonstrated ability - you will be given increasingly more responsibility","Lack of firm-wide and partner-level focus on leadership and development, which means that VPs/MDs were hit or miss in terms of managing/leadership skills and how good they were at managing a team and developing junior talent.

Misalignment of compensation and behaviors that the firm wants to promote - too focused on financial outcomes, not enough focus on contribution to culture and people development.

Healthcare is EXPENSIVE - you will end up paying a good amount of money for mediocre healthcare.

Women and people of color are generally only found in support positions unless they have highly impressive Ivy league credentials or have sold their souls and clawed their way up the ladder. Highly competitive environment. Highly ambitious people who are often  narcissistic and/or sociopathic.  Still holding on to  the outdated Wall Street boy's club culture, especially at the top levels. Expect to be thrown under any passing bus - people are encouraged to advance themselves at the cost of others. Blackstone management routinely find any small flaw or criticism rather than recognizing or rewarding success which makes many people legitimately paranoid. Very difficult to have work-life balance.   Burn out is common. The corporate hierarchy drives a class based culture, so there's a lot of brown nosing and different rules for the elite executives who are treated like Gods while everyone else does the actual work."

And that started few months ago, prior, lunch was at your own expense but the business generating departments always had free lunch. Such BX claims of all employees being equal at the eyes of the firm was a sham. Many complained about the various inequities in place.","Long hard core hours,the weekends, public holidays, spoiled almighty bosses who think they know it all, screaming bosses who can't scream enough for the day, bosses who don't acknowledge your presence, and bosses who don't even know the basic etiquette to greet their staff in the morning. Colleagues/bosses you work with are generally nasty only disguised by their fake smiles,forcefully imposed onto their faces, backstabbing to screw over each other, mud slugging fest, so I stepped to the sideline just to watch. Don't have time for that pettiness/game. Those who hang in there are pitifully for the money(low pay though) and bonus(fairly good but one can get better at other PE firms like where I am now) but be ready to have your blood drained by a forever corporate vampire. Like PE motto, BX will suck the life out of employees like their business takeovers. Extremely high turnover, people leaving or crossing over to other departments and bosses are surprised by it(shows how dense they are). Low morale, frustration, favoritism, and playing politics. Not really worth my life and time to do my best because it's never acknowledged. BX motto ""perfection, perfection, perfection"" but haven't really noticed the difference between other firms I have worked at versus BX people. People make mistakes/errors and push their works to others. Managers are sub-par quality that they might as well have VP titles. and not MD. A senior compliance offcer who fired a colleague on the spot because she requested(she merely asked if she could) to work from home on Fridays to take care of her child. Shocked that BX has not yet been sued.

- Immense brand value
- Great name","- Though my group kept a great work-life balance, most other groups didn't follow that. Summer Analysts/Analysts/Associates -- all worked insane hours (15-16 hours/day)
- The culture is very type A, a lot of people would find it too fast-paced and intimidating
- In core groups like PE, Real Estate -- Harvard and Princeton grads got respect and everyone else were thought of as ""others"" (But that doesn't mean they can't make it to the top, they can at Blackstone)"

- Unbeatable reputation and recognition across the globe
- Very steep learning in an environment which fosters a lot of interaction between employees at different levels; Analysts can just walk into the cabins of Partners and discuss their thoughts
- The only place where I have seen employees not doubting the smartness of each other
- Low/No office politics which is a very refreshing experience in itself","- Long work hours at times but I haven't been too bothered by it. Compare the salary/hour with any other type of job and you will see why the long hours are justified to an extent.
- Slow career progression - one has to typically spend 3-5 years at every level before moving up. Faster promotions are far too rare at BX.
- Very low attrition rate: You might get stuck at a level for longer than expected due to lack of 'pull in the pyramid' eventually."
