Shared rooms with coworkers for company events, who even does this?
Every salesman is overloaded and underpaid. They purposely make monthly commission unobtainable. Some of my coworkers have had to get second jobs to support their families. 
Complete mess internally - high level directors suddenly fired or let go, poor customer service and ordering process, outdated systems.  Concerns or solutions to the internal problems are not taken seriously and/or not heard by management. No management of accounts - duplicates and incorrect account assignments make it impossible to see which sales you get credit for and which you don’t.

There are always jobs open in these areas because there are always people leaving. Why? First of all, no work life balance. Even for an accounting/financial reporting job, work life balance is poor. Second, the culture within the fund accounting department is terrible. Teams are responsible for unreasonable amounts of work with no support structure and poor educational resources. Finally, and most importantly, is management. They do not care about their people as long as deadlines are met and no one is actively jumping out a window.

You're supposed to get up to 20% of your salary if you perform highly above expectations however you'll hear the ""we just don't have the money this year to do that"" line every year while you get around 12%, tops.

Additionally, having The Carlyle Group on your resume is a definite plus!","In terms of the cons there are simply too many to mention them all. However, I will list the top five based on my nearly 3.5 years of employment within the firms IT Department. 
1. Extremely high turnover within IT (the hours are long, there is little to no work life balance, management openly demonstrates who are their favorite pets which in turn causes colleagues to not trust each other etc.) I have been corporate America for over 2o years and I have never seen at least a half dozen employees submit a resignation without having another job...yes it’s that bad.. 
2. There does not seem to be any rhythm or reason to who gets promoted and who does not. It absolutely has nothing to do with performance but goes right back to who is favored.
3. Toxic work environment - team members as well as managers will throw a staff member right under the bus if it protects them from getting blamed for a mistake..yes I have experienced staff members and senior managers actually tell untruths or not stand up for what is ethical all in the name of not bucking the system.
4. The Human Resources Department is part of the problem!
5. The firm's managers, general speaking, and not just the IT department managers are full of hubris and treat staff as if you should be ""happy to be here"".

Although my experience was beyond with this firm was so disappointing (went in with such high hopes) if you get the right manager and the right department things could be different for you…it really just depends."

Promotions do not happen unless you are there for a specific period of time and are not often based on performance.  There is a focus on ""performance"", but it's unclear what that actually means.  There is very little guidance from upper management and employees are all seemingly unhappy, unfriendly, and don't enjoy their jobs.
