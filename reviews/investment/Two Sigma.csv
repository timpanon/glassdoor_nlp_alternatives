Culture is certainly more laid back that peer firms.","From a strategy/planning perspective, the firm is pretty disorganized.

Managers are technically sophisticated
Great mobility within the company","Very few checks on management authority - no 180 review, no peer feedback. Disputes with management feedback have no recourse. Advice - make sure you trust your manager.
Sometimes it feels too laid back and no one is held accountable for serious issues.
Bad managers aren't found and removed.
Much of the trading technology is mature. You won't get to do much new development.

Outdated tech stack with a ton of stuff built internally. This means that the skills you learn (ie working with their build system) wont translate to your next job.
Impossible to work with internal mobility process. Super slow, people make it impossible to move by making you endure entire days of interviews like it's still 2016 and they have their choice of FB/GOOG/AMZN employees to choose from. At that point you might as well just look externally. They claim it's an easy process, but it is anything but. 
Unless you end up on the right team, there's a good chance the work wont be super interesting.

The company does a really good job in trying to help employees during the coronavirus. Also the company is actively taking more steps to further embrace diversity and inclusion. The founders are serious and play an active role of keeping this place ""a nice place for geeks"". The culture here is pretty damn remarkable. Talent here is top notch. That needs no explanation.",The coronavirus has taken most of us to work from home. This has stretched the laptop network experience in video chat and messaging particularly when working from a different state. Perhaps a better investment in these tools might assist in this pandemic.

External learning and development are heavily encouraged and reimbursed.","Lack of culture (which is common for a large company). Socializing does not happen organically. Most people put in their 9-5 and go home.
Difficult to grow. Bureaucratic promotion process.
Divisions are heavily siloed, so much that teams that work with each other on a recurring basis don’t even know the full scope of each other’s responsibilities."

62,Two Sigma,Incredible place to work - best in finance and on par with Google/FB,2020-01-06,5.0,Vice President,"Culture: do great work, work with incredibly intelligent and talented people, and importantly, no wall street culture. By that I mean people do not have the delusion that overwork or self-sacrifice is a heroic quality, or source of success for the firm. Hiring the smartest people, and setting very high expectations for them is much more important. You're not expected to work 100 hours per week, but you are expected to have the most intelligent work product in the industry.",Small-ish company - you have to be comfortable being patient when looking for career growth opportunities

- good work-life balance
- depending on team, might work on something very interesting","- extremely secretive culture which makes for both awkward interactions with colleagues (people on your own team won't say hi to you in the hallway) and actually makes your job harder (lots of things don't just lack documentation - they CAN'T be documented, people get thrown out of meetings half way through to preserve secrecy, no one casually talks about what they're working on)
- can't interact with open source community or speak at conferences about your work very easily"
66,Two Sigma,Great firm with interesting work and flat organization,2019-10-08,5.0,Product Specialist,"- Very flat structure. Everyone is approachable.
- Interesting work.
- Senior management comes from a place of trust, meaning they trust business and project owners to do what's best. And that culture permeates the organization. I feel like my manager has trust and confidence in me.
- Certainly a tech firm in the finance / investment management world. This means casual dress code, great benefits, work-life balance, and workplace perks.
- From what I've seen, internal mobility happens often and is encouraged.
- Employees are empowered and encouraged to take on additional work / solve problems that aren't currently being worked on.",- Different business units can be compartmentalized so can be difficult to meet others throughout the organization.
67,Two Sigma,Decent company,2019-09-05,3.0,Software Engineer,"Interview bar very high, so generally very good peers",little strict about office timings

Internal mobility is accepted, and it's possible to have a long career here while working on several different teams/products.","The company is growing rapidly and is starting to experience big-company problems. Politics can occasionally impact productivity, especially with regards to titles and team size."
69,Two Sigma,"Small Teams with Big Impact, Mostly for the Better",2019-08-15,4.0,Software Engineer,"The broad context here is I'm extremely happy with my job at two sigma. I've been here for 1.5 years and in that time, I've learned and grown more than I would have thought possible.

- Almost everyone I've worked with in my corner of the Engineering world has been very kind, creative, and incredibly driven.
- Since team size is small relative to the number of products, impact-per-person can be extremely significant. It's possible to be a star, even as a new employee.
- Compensation is head-and-shoulders above similarly tenured roles in the rest of the industry.
- Casual, geeky, tech-focused culture relative to other firms in this sector.
- In-office extra-curriculars (giving talks, attending internal classes, organizing volunteering events) are readily available and encouraged by management
- A strong lean towards the DIY in engineering projects means you'll probably learn a lot about parts of the software development process you might not elsewhere.
- A gold star on your resume. TS is a heavy hitter as far as perceived engineering clout.","On the flip side, growth can sometimes be painful.

- It somehow always seems like there's 20% more work to do than the amount of time there is to do it. Small teams with out-sized responsibilities in combination with the type of passionate/ambitious personality that TS seems to attract can produce an environment of intense self-imposed stress.
- That same strong DIY lean? Means a lot of projects get built from 0 to 1 by one or two people, and fail to make the leap from 1 to 2 as it's realized they're a lot more difficult to make stable and production-ready than it was to produce an MVP.
- As an adolescent company, TS is beginning to hit some phase changes with things like maintenance of aging software, management of organizational structure, and knowledge sharing.
- Less hierarchical than many companies in its sector, but you can still feel like you're at the whims of a teetering stack of managerial decisions at times. It's often hard for bad news to propagate up the stack since people will soften what they say to higher-ups. This can lead to directional decisions being made without knowledge of the situation on the ground.
- Front-end development is largely unsupported by the build/test infrastructure and varies wildly from team-to-team as each one learns separately to deal with the quirks."

Lots of smart people walking around that are mostly humble and will answer your questions.
Complex environment but you can and probably will learn a lot in a relatively short amount of time.","The usual corporate bureaucracy and politics. As Two Sigma grows into a medium-sized entity, there are some growing pains. Limited upward mobility depending on your management chain (they essentially shut down a partnering project with a chance for me to transfer to that team). Depending on your engineering area, work/life balance can be bad.
Mixed use of proprietary technology and open-source. The proprietary stuff could hurt your marketability. 
Did I mention all the politics and corporate red tape around everything?"
79,Two Sigma,"To me, super interesting work matching my skills",2018-06-10,5.0,Quantitative Researcher,"(1) As a quant researcher, super exciting work. See the impact of your own models to bring revenue to the company, see you can predict the future by using advanced quant techniques;

(3) Excellent pay with no doubt.","In my view, the company hires way many engineers than needed sometimes. I need to maintain the bar to be high and hire just enough and really excellent engineers, and of course treat them well. Too many so-so hires hurts the company reputation and the business."
80,Two Sigma,Treats employees well; relaxed tech-focused environment,2017-08-31,5.0,Data Scientist,"Research and technology drives everything here. At times it feels more like a research firm instead of the super successful hedge fund and trading company that they built themselves into.  They treat their employees well, and the environment is relaxed. Casual dress, flexible hours, on site gym and showers, tons of snacks, great parties.

Probably the best thing is the depth of talent here. They really recruit the best of the best.

Technology is solid in the infrastructure, trading, and development groups,  and management is committed to investing in tech.

They are very conservative when it comes to compliance.  They are super focused on not taking risks when it comes to legal responsibilities.","They are becoming larger and more beaurecratic.  They have been around for 16 years and are expanding into new businesses, and with that success they have loss some of the startup vibes they once had.

Although they are committed to tech investment, they are now 16 years old and this area of tech is changing rapidly. Constantly upgrading systems brings its own challenges. There is often a blend of old and cutting edge, and sometimes you are on your own if you want to use the cutting edge stuff.

They are also heavily regulated, and this weighs alot on how fast they are able to move."
81,Two Sigma,Good choice if you don't mind DIY on a lot of things,2017-08-28,5.0,Software Engineer,"While they are really in the financial world, the technical level is really good.
There are lots of in-house engineering solutions and combination of open-source products with specific configuration/upgrades.
Engineers are encouraged to take responsibilities on whatever projects that matter. Some people do enjoy that feeling of making great impact or building something from ground.","A portion of those projects apparently became ""abandoned"" after the team/person backing it left.  Now you are left with two choices: 
1) read someone else code (remember that person could be not working in the company anymore) and fix it 
2) rewrite the whole thing on your own.
Lots of engineers here are so smart that they often chose the second solution and managed to success on that (short-term), which to some extend make the problem for the entire software ecosystem worse (less standardized, worse compatibility with each other and less reliability of services)."
82,Two Sigma,Opportunities and challenges abound,2017-08-12,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Growth and change at the company create chances for individuals to move up and over to new roles.

Those that can self manage and collaborate well will have an amazing career.",Because everyone is so smart and able it is almost assumed that you will be attempting to reinvent the wheel to get your project off the ground but the result is a plethora of home-grown tools and services.
86,Two Sigma,Great company!  Hard to get in but well worth it!,2016-07-14,5.0,Vice President,This is a place that really cares about doing right by its employees.  The perks are great and senior management is focused on the right things.  There is definitely a culture of learning and a strong willingness by management to support experimentation and exploration -- feels rather  unique for a finance firm.,Very time-consuming hiring process (on both the side of interviewers and interviewees).  Not convinced it's as effective as it could be given the time investment.
87,Two Sigma,anonymous,2016-07-07,5.0,,"Great culture, location, offices
Highly successful company
Outstanding senior management
Team","No longer a small company, working hard to stay entrepreneurial
Tech resources in short supply for corporate functions (but improving)"
88,Two Sigma,Not worth it,2016-06-05,1.0,Software Reliability Engineer,"Human Resources department has been doing a great job at posting fake 5-star reviews on Glassdoor, all to convince the founding partners and the outside world that everything is just peachy.","Compensation is low compared to peers.
There are no real growth opportunities. If you want to learn something new, then forget about this place and move on. The technology is arcane, bloated, poorly managed, and plain old. You will be told lies at the interview about the so-called state-of-the-art internal technology stack.
There's no real innovation either, only pretend business-unrelated ideas which never fully materialize. Many promising projects silently fail. Most VPs and MDs are pretty bad at their job, although they are very good at blaming each other for failures, taking credit for each other's accidental achievements, exaggerating their own results, and convincing the upper management that they're worth the unreasonably high compensation.
Partners have no idea what's going on and why things aren't working anymore, but they keep on introducing and removing dubious workflow/HR procedures, restructuring the company every 6 months, moving people around, reassigning responsibilities, and hiring external CTOs.
Don't waste your time there!"
89,Two Sigma,Great place for technologists,2016-05-24,5.0,Software Engineer,"Huge emphasis on technology as a competitive edge makes it a great environment for an engineer working in finance.

The company truly values its employees and it shows in a variety of ways. (i.e. gym, free food, professional growth opportunities). 

Work with some of the best people in the technology industry on a daily basis.","The company's rapid growth constantly stresses organizational processes.

The selective interview process can be brutal."

High level of impact - the projects we take on are meaningful
Interesting work - you will have the opportunity to be creative & take on interesting challenges
Autonomy applies to work life balance - you are responsible for creating value, not for putting in long hours","It's up to you to determine how to contribute to the success of the firm, since you are given autonomy. This can be con, if you require direction to succeed."

Benefits, perks and pay are quite competitive.
Hiring standards are very high. I work with very smart people.","Technology is not always cutting edge.
Bureaucracy and legacy software gets in the way of doing your job at times.
Secrecy and lack of transparency create impediments."
92,Two Sigma,Manager,2016-04-04,4.0,Manager,Good environment and spacious office-good benefits-nice people-a good company that takes care of its employees.,growing pains.to know who is who and does what.
93,Two Sigma,Great Company to work for,2016-01-23,5.0,Product Manager,"Extremely high calibre engineering talent, great work culture, less bureaucracy. Continuous learning, free laundry, great bonuses(depends on your job and performance) and kitchen stocked with really healthy food and drinks, free friday bagels and once a month free lunch","Bad 401k, no free lunch/dinner, Gym has limited equipments with no steam sauna"
94,Two Sigma,Great place to work!,2015-12-28,5.0,Software Engineer,"By far some of the smartest people I've ever worked with. The culture of Two Sigma really promotes collaboration, and respect in the workplace is highly emphasized.","Teams are incredibly lean and depending on department, understaffed. This creates a heavy support burden at times. Certain departments also carry a scary amount of technical debt."
95,Two Sigma,Great place to work,2015-12-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Responsive and considerate company, great perks",Sometimes feels very large and disconnected
96,Two Sigma,Best place for nice geeks to work,2015-12-09,5.0,Software Engineer,"I've been at more than a few companies and was initially skeptical, but TS is pretty fanstastic. It's an engineering place through and through. Almost everyone is a developer of one kind or another. The people are very smart across the board with some seriously high highs, the interactions between people are expected to be nice and open (and are -- no jerks allowed), the work is very interesting (lots of big problems to solve for sophisticated internal users in a very competitive space), opportunities for internal mobility are best I've seen by a margin, senior management are super smart, nice, and engaged engineers. Big emphasis on community and internal learning and networking, regular hackathons, talks/presentations/study groups/etc all the time, by both internal and external people. Opportunities for OSS contribution, room to experiment.. And in the middle of NYC. Hard to beat.","I've been here a year and it's hard to think of many cons. Interview process is tough to pass. It's typically far from rigid environment and there are lots of opportunities, so being a self-starter and self-motivated is pretty much a must."
97,Two Sigma,A highly enjoyable blur each workweek,2015-11-04,4.0,Quantitative Software Engineer,Good vision from management.  Engineering focused on quick experimentation to prove feasibility followed by judicious hardening and iteration.  Excellent co-workers.  Absurd perks.,"Management has good expectations of what can be achieved in a reasonable workweek, holds employees to what is reasonable, but talks expectations as if much more is possible.  Inbox zero adherents may be disappointed."
98,Two Sigma,"Great company, exciting future ahead",2015-11-01,4.0,,"+Great benefits
+Internal mobility encouraged
+Location (Soho!)
+Extremely low voluntary turnover rate, once people get here, they want to stay
+Collaborative culture (minimal offices, no cubicles)",-Growing pains due to rapid expansion--some managers have been promoted into positions that they're not necessarily prepared for due to their institutional knowledge

101,Two Sigma,Upward Mobility,2015-10-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Not only is the culture amazing, but they believe in growing their talent.  There are many former receptionists working their way up the ranks.","As the company grows, more processes are codified and locked down.  This leads to some extra paperwork."
102,Two Sigma,Great organization doing very challenging work,2015-07-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Two Sigma is one of the few organizations that I've been part of that cuts through politics and values your contributions.  The company is growing fast and it has been able to maintain a unique and positive culture.  The informal environment let's people be who they are.  There is just enough structure to be helpful without being bureaucratic. Tons of challenging projects to work on.  Two Sigma is doing leading edge work in a number of areas.,If you like more traditional organizations that aren't changing quickly then Two Sigma is not for you.  Alot of people being added...new faces appear every week.  That kind of fluid environment might not be for some.
103,Two Sigma,Business associate,2015-06-27,3.0,,Great collaborative atmosphere. very collegial feel.,Few managerial roles and lack of promotion from within.
104,Two Sigma,Smartest and Nicest People I've Ever Worked With,2015-06-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Two Sigma honestly cares about their employees and they do a great job of showing it by empowering people to make decisions.  Also:
-There is almost no bureaucracy and people don't push their own agendas
-Highly collaborative, very few pointless meetings
-Tons of learning and development opportunities (Tech Talks, Town Halls, Hackerlabs, etc)
-You get lots of autonomy
-""Get things done"" attitude, not a ""let's talk about getting things done"" attitude
-Strong compensation and benefits package
-Only hire smart and nice people","Since there are not a lot of formal processes, you sometimes have to take a lot of initiative and ownership to get things done.  This can also lead to things taking longer than they need to.

A pretty steep learning curve if you like structured on-boarding."
105,Two Sigma,The best place to work,2014-12-14,5.0,Software Engineer,"Great benefits.
650+ people who believe the scientific method is the best way to approach investing.

80% of employees are software engineers / researchers.
NYC.",Not too much marketing going on - many people haven't heard of the company.
106,Two Sigma,This IS the financial tech shop you are looking for,2014-11-21,5.0,Software Engineer,"Everyday I'm solving challenges. There is a constant push for newer technologies, better platform, faster response, more verifiable software engineering. Everyday is another day to make your impact on the company's output. Everyone is friendly. There is a strong sense of meritocracy and delivering the best work possible.","There is little hand holding. You will get help if you ask for it right. Otherwise, you should be able to read the actual code. This can be extra tough if you are not familiar with the gnu toolchain."
107,Two Sigma,Do great work with great people,2014-11-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some of the nicest, smartest people I've ever met. Always learning, always having fun, always doing great work in an environment that is energizing, collaborative and incredibly motivating. Love it! First place I've worked where I feel truly valued, treated like a grownup and supported on all levels.","If you need hand holding, this might not be the place for you. You have great freedom to design your work plan and flexibility to approach your work however works best for you, which I think is fantastic, but might not work for everyone if you need rigid structure and oversight."
108,Two Sigma,Great firm,2014-10-18,5.0,Quantitative Research Analyst,Lots of interesting work. Open to pursue your own ideas.,Growing pains. Needs to update technology infrastructure.
109,Two Sigma,Me-too technology and difficult work environment.,2014-05-08,2.0,Software Engineer,Most colleagues are intelligent and ambitious. Compensation is OK.,Little management focus. Technology is well behind the state of the art. Old technology creates a high maintenance burden.
