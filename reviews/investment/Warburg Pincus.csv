Things that have been commonplace for a while in the business world have only just been implemented here in the past few years, such as 360 performance reviews and the freedom to occasionally work from home. Not a lot of real upward movement if you are on the operations side. Almost no diversity in upper management although they have been giving lip service to changing that ""soon.""

Great salary & benefits package
Great work-life balance 
Great people overall","Your experience will depend on the group/department you work in. The cons I list here are specific to the IT department: 
Little to no opportunities for advancement.
Training and professional development is not valued and seen as a chore rather than an opportunity. 
Total top-down management style with little communication to the developers and other experienced staff below management level.
Poor people skills among much of IT management. 
Developers are not involved enough in the early stages of the product development cycle which leads to communication issues and problems down the line that could have easily been avoided. 
Poor, antagonistic relationships between managers of sub-groups within IT lead to a lack of teamwork, paranoia and poor morale.
Managers are not responsive to the suggestions and recommendations of their subordinates and are resistant to change.
Spaghetti code and outdated technology are the norm. 
Lack of communication with the internal clients leads to the development of products that never get used. 
All of these issues combined led to a recent mass exodus of full-time developers from the firm."
