5,1st Constitution,Horrible Culture,2020-06-11,1.0,Banking,"SOME (very few) of the people that work at the branches and 1 or 2 other departments were nice, really helpful, and care about helping customers.","95% of the people that work at this bank are rude and miserable. The employees here have a bad habit with elementary phone etiquette, asking ""how are you?"" with no substance and rushing right into whatever they have to say. God forbid that you have to ask someone in back office for help with something or a simple question because you will get a condescending attitude telling you to refer to a page of an outdated manual. With the very old school ways of the bank and the amount of time it takes to fix issues I honestly feel bad for customers that have accounts here."
6,1st Constitution,Loan Administration,2018-08-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great working environment. Lots of training,Not more opportunities to grove on someone’s career
7,1st Constitution,Bipolar institution,2018-05-03,1.0,,Have very few good people. At the corporate unless you are an executive or have a SVP Position you will be treated with respect otherwise you are a simple employee of the bank !!!,Not enough space in here to state all Cons with this bank.. if you are a brown nose or snitch employee then you will grow within the company. Lots of promises to grow but it all stays like that in promises. Micromanage. Favoritism. Bipolar managers. Stressful environment. No matter how good you do if you’re not in the good side of your boss forget about it is like you haven’t done anything right.. unless you are referred by the person who will be your boss you aren’t going to be happy working here ...

9,1st Constitution,"Ironically the most Non-community ""Community"" Bank for Employees",2017-06-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Met some great people, truly under appreciated workers here
-2 Weeks PTO & 6 Sick days: ONLY if you are full time and have worked here past 6 Months
-Okay health benefits/Life Insurance & Dental
-Lots of Holidays off","-Absolutely no room for growth. They speak on how you can move up and grow within the bank, but require you to be in your position for a year before doing anything. This requires there to BE a position to move up in once you have been in  your position past a year. Otherwise you are stuck with nothing unless you fight tooth and nail for it. Even if there are positions, you have to apply like it is a job and interview for the position even if you are qualified for it.

-Management micromanages to no end possible. 

-Raises are pathetic and barely tangible, see my point on room for growth

-HR has one person in their division, terrible at solving any sort of problems with the bank. You'll have to figure it out with your manager/other coworkers if you need problems to be solved.

-No community whatsoever between divisions of the bank. Nothing feels coherent, you are in your own little island whether it be in the Teller side or Mortgage or Compliance, every one makes their own little King of the Hill. Bank has no sense of unity among employees (Unless you are in Retail/have a good manager, since the managers try their best to connect with other managers)."
