0,3G Capital,"Poor management, inept investment decisions, turnover like you've never seen in you life!",2011-06-27,1.0,Analyst,"Mid-range to above average bonus, of course discretionary.  Good location in mid-town, two blocks from subway/gcs.  Strict with budgets, which makes up for the lack of fund performance come payout time!","You will be fired without a blink of an eye if you screw up or cannot conform to their george orwell-ian type culture.  In my time there, I saw more people either resign or get fired than I saw in total with my prior two firms, everyone from partners/pm's all the way down the chain.  In fact, I was told in one of my interviews about the employee turnover issue, but I was naive.  Very poorly managed shop that fails to invest in technology in order to capitalize on future growth opportunities.  Be warned...stay away!!"
