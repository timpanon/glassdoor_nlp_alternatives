0,AFS,People oriented company is a lie.,2019-10-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have a job, for now.","Signs have been taking place that the company is going under.  Robbing Peter to pay Paul for conferences, no raises EVER, if you aren't accepted by upper management you get no where in this company, they promote the same people over and over and leave everyone else out.  They recently laid off our field staff and didn't ask our volunteers.  For a volunteer driven company, they made the decision to do away with the field people without including the volunteers.  I cannot say enough bad about this company.  I'm looking to get out before we try to get in the doors one morning and find them locked.  Communication at this company is terrible.  They do not value any employee unless you are a favored employee.  Not inclusive organization.  Lots of pressure and long hours."
