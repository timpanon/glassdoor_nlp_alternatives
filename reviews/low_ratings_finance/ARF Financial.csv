5,ARF Financial,Sales,2017-03-29,1.0,Sales,Remote with a flexible schedule. Decent work-life balance.,"It doesn't matter if you have a VP title or a Sales Rep title, the Sales Job is basically a telemarketing job. As a rep, you hammer the phones ALL DAY looking for a business who needs money. It's VERY Difficult. The few business owners who do have a need, typically are turned-off by the high rates. When you finally find a business owner who can stomach the high rates, the application is usually declined by the UW department. This is a VERY difficult job.   They will tell you that you will make a considerable amount of money, but not tell you that 50%-70% of all applicants are declined. The competition if fierce. You are always fearful of losing your job.  You can find a better opportunity. Keep Looking!!!"
6,ARF Financial,Sales Rep,2017-03-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working on my own, I liked that.","Senior Management is HIGHLY secretive, and act most definitely is a good ol' boy network, with no room for advancement and a Napoleon as President.  Absolute joke when it comes to professionalism, constant threats, name calling, comical."
7,ARF Financial,I've had a good experience with this company.,2017-02-10,3.0,Auditor,It's a small company so if you do well it will be noticed and because it's so small there's more chances to move up within the company.,The pay is pretty low compared to the same job at other companies. It's hard to get paid more than what you started out at.
8,ARF Financial,ehhhhh,2016-11-28,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"atmosphere, the people, the extras","no career path or advancement opportunities, temperamental management, pay"
9,ARF Financial,"Good company, tough sell",2016-10-10,3.0,,"Nice people, flexible hours, decent benefits.","Tough sell, high interest short term loans, difficult underwriting requirements."
10,ARF Financial,Not a Good Place to Work,2016-09-14,1.0,Sales,"Independent work environment. Management is hands off as long as you log calls in Salesforce (which they do monitor). Most people in the company are nice with a few exceptions, and all Salespeople are nice and helpful.","The product was a great alternative to other options when the company was started in 2001. Now, when the competition is offering much much better deals - WITHOUT the long, drawn-out, excessive paperwork process, it becomes nearly impossible to find takers. Qualifications are difficult for clients to meet and the ones that do qualify, can get much better deals elsewhere. Commissions are tiny because goals are unrealistic, unattainable and charge backs are permitted throughout the entire loan life.  You are always making less each month than you expect. 75% of applications are declined. Employee turnover  in the company is rampant because of this. When one or two, or a handful of people are turned over - it's them, when it's constant - it's you. Offices have closed, internal folks are being eliminated as well. This turnover, with the sales turnover, speaks volumes about the direction of the company. Ownership is unbending, uncaring and greedy. Salespeople operate in a silo and receive little direct help from Management on deals. There is zero upward mobility possibile. Stay at home and make hundreds of phone calls and become like those people that call your home (whom you hate)."
11,ARF Financial,As mentioned in another review you can do better,2016-06-30,1.0,Senior Loan Officer,"Work from home, somewhat  protected territory, build and develop you're own book of business","work culture, secretive management, ever changing commission structure and rates, difficult underwriting, greedy management"

17,ARF Financial,"Very constricting, not allowed to give input, no place to advance your career.",2013-03-12,1.0,Account Manager,"Some of the people, some independence.","As a salesperson you do not have control of your destiny.  The product is somewhat suspect, HIGH interest rate loans.  No opportunity for advancement.  Very controlling environment, with threats and dishonesty."
