You don't get many good managers at collection agencies that the staff actually want to work for, when you get two like you had in Burnaby you want to keep hold of them at all costs! commission is a struggle although again the managers tried to make as many people as possible make at least some commission, even if it meant annoying/upsetting head office by giving away ""freebies"" it adds to make people want to work harder and work for the managers. take note head office","commission is never enough, although again the managers tried to make as many people as possible make at least some commission, even if it meant annoying/upsetting head office by giving away ""freebies"" it adds to make people want to work harder and work for the managers."
