8,AST Fund Solutions,Floor Support,2017-11-27,1.0,Floor Support,I do not think there are man pros here,There are a million cons.  This probably applies to a great deal of the contractors or temps AST hires.  First off this place is infested with bed bugs.  The place is dirty and mgmnt does not care.   There was a fight on the floor the other night.  The just took this guy out the other day that had a bag of pot and was threatening people.  This is a ghetto environment very very bad.

Plenty of overtime when available.","Training is minimal (a few days at most) despite the lies on their website. A lot of favoritism when it comes to policy adherence, especially if you're an attractive and ""willing"" female. No background checks or drug testing, as is evident by the sheer number of employees stumbling in while high on something. No educational requirement, either, as evidenced by the majority of tin-foil dropouts that worked there."

18,AST Fund Solutions,Quality Assurance,2016-09-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some people are nice, stable schedule most of the time.","The Quality Assurance team is just a clique. If you don't fit in with their ultra-libtard views, you will get canned, regardless of your work ethic. There are no full time opportunities, seeing as this company wants to cut all kinds of costs that would benefit the employee. Punching in and out to go to the bathroom, lunch, any kind of break, - the same bureaucratic setup as a sweat shop. No benefits."

32,AST Fund Solutions,Proxy bid,2016-01-07,4.0,Proxy Solicitor,"Easy work, and great environment",None to really speak of
33,AST Fund Solutions,good job while you look for a job,2015-12-06,2.0,Clerk,"they had unlimited overtime in the beginnning, pay was $13.00 am shift  / $14 p/h pm shift. Some people (permanents) were great. easy job, just practice those rebuttles. only work 8:45am-4pm (am shift)","EXTREMELY STRICK , be on time, a LOT ghetto people, 30 min lunches and the cafeteria sucks(looks nice though) Permanents stick to their own, theft is a problem; someone stole a girls phone, someones lunch, and someones water bottle all in the same week. People have attitudes in the work place despte dealing with the people that occasionally curse you out on the phones. team leads think they're gods among men sometimes. Let ALL of the temp/seasonals go without a warning. You only get paid 2 times a monthh ....on the 15th and the 30th. you only work 8:45am-4pm (am shift)  pm shift is 4pm-11pm.  so not a full time employee    also they get a real credit card swiper and not a smart phone with a cube"
34,AST Fund Solutions,The worst job I've ever had!,2015-11-28,1.0,Customer Service Representative,The only good thing about this place was they had the schedule I needed. Mon-Fri from 8:45 a.m-4p.m.,"Ok, where do I start. The call center holds about 250 ppl for the day shift and the same for the night shift. They only have 2 time clocks for employees to clock in and out. When it's time to clock in and when it's time to clock out, it's always a long line. It can take up to 15 min to clock in and out. There are no assigned seats. You do not get a new headset, everyone shares. They pass out alcohol wipes in the morning for you to wipe them down. Disgusting! During your shift, you are not allowed to chew gum, eat candy, no coffee, juice, tea, snacks or food at your desk. You can only have water at your desk. Yes, you read right. You are not allowed to talk either. They want you to be a robot at your desk. Don't dare try to bring in a book to keep you occupied while you're just sitting there. You're not allowed to read either. I can go on for days. This was definitely the worst job I've ever had in my entire life! O and you only get paid $13 an hour on the 15th and 30th of every month. If your start date is on the 1st of the month, you will not receive your first check until the 30th of that month. Take this job only if you're desperate/border line homeless.

40,AST Fund Solutions,Unprofessional,2015-06-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,When they did actually have a contract you could work as many hours as you could.,"Unprofessional supervisors and the, quality of people hired was not the best. Management talked down to you at times and made for an unpleasant working environment."
41,AST Fund Solutions,Shareholder Proxy Agent,2015-05-12,3.0,Shareholder Proxy Agent,"Decent pay and lots of overtime is available when the season gets busy.

42,AST Fund Solutions,"A job, not a career.",2015-04-23,2.0,Top List Customer Service Representative,"Very few come to mind, but there is a lot of overtime offered.  It is easy money, this job is not Rocket Science.  If you can read a script you will do just fine.","There is a lot of unprofessional behavior.  A few of the team leaders are young, unprofessional, and/or on a power trip while they make the same measly $13 per hour as the rest of us.  There are times when they speak to their employees like children, belittle us, and threaten to write people up every other day."

46,AST Fund Solutions,"Flexible, well-paying job with a great new location",2014-11-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great opportunity for making easy money (up to $1400 a week pre-taxes when there's open overtime).  If you can follow a script, read/speak proper English, and learn proper use of the rebuttals, then you'll do well on the job. Do well at your assigned task, come to work every day and on time, and sign up for weekends when offered. Management is very flexible when it comes to scheduling around school, other jobs, etc.  New office location is massive and beautiful in comparison to the previous location in Lyndhurst.","Training is too short and rushed to be of much use anymore, and the trainers seem far too unprepared when new classes come in, wasting everyone's valuable time."

48,AST Fund Solutions,Great Job to Get you back on your feet,2014-04-15,5.0,Proxy Solicitation Agent,"It's an easy job that pays pretty well, and offers lot of overtime during their peak times.  If you are willing to work the hours, you can easily take home 700+ a week.  It is a temp job, so you do have to prepare yourself for times when they will lay you off, but if you work hard it won't go unnoticed and they will call you back when it picks up again.   IF your unemployed, and down on hard times, this is a great job to get you back on your feet.  The job entails talking to stockholders, reading a script verbatim and getting the stockholder to vote on their proxies.  Time goes fast, and if you do what you are asked, for the most part management will not bother you.","Occasionally Management can be a little overbearing and immature.  But not to the point that you feel used or abused.   Take it with a grain of salt and just keep doing your job, you'll be fine.  There is a lot of gossip going on, so try to just mind to yourself and don't get to personal with anyone.  You will make friends due to the proximity of how close everyone is, but just be careful with your opinions, because you never know who is friends with who, and anything you say can be misconstrued and end up on the managements desk."
49,AST Fund Solutions,"Corporate sweatshop (Lyndhurst, NJ)",2013-11-01,1.0,Client Services Representative,Really difficult to think of ANY positives - one or two floor managers were helpful when needed.,"Managers were the most ridiculous, overbearing, controlling and incompetent group of people I had the misfortune of ""working"" with. If you are not a manager, expect to be conditions like a slave-master would their herd. Managerial staff at call center completely ego driven and have very little professional business skills."
