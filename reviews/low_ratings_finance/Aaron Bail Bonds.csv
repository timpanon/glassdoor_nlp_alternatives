10,Aaron Bail Bonds,horrible owners,2017-12-06,1.0,Supervisor,there is no pros to this company.,every review on this job is accurate!
11,Aaron Bail Bonds,Years down the drain,2017-12-05,1.0,Management,"I met a few downtrodden souls who, like myself, were very oppressed by this job. Made some nice memories.","Everything negative that has been said so far about this company stems from the top down. The owners are two brothers, who go by the aliases of Mike and Tony (these are not their real names; their names are Agron and Veton Binakaj and they are Albanian by birth). They treat their workforce like their personal property. They will mistreat/demean/humiliate their employees, either directly, through ""staff meetings"" which are laced with profanity and threats, or indirectly, through their management. Management is also cowed by these paranoid, power-hungry brothers, and they do their bidding out of fear for their own jobs. Mainly, management parrots the same threats that ""Mike"" and ""Tony"" issue,  or they spy on employees through one of hundreds of cameras spread throughout the facility. Employees can expect 9 hour shifts spent on a phone at a cubicle, with lunch in a tiny cramped break room. On the phone, employees get to speak with the scum of society. It is common to hear profanity. Meanwhile, perched over the cubicle, is a ""supervisor"" listening to every word you say, correcting you, belittling you, all according to ""Mike"" and ""Tony""s"" orders. There is like one supervisor per employee. It's ridiculous. It's a system that reflects the greed and paranoia of the company's imbecilic, heartless owners. 

This company, like the waistline of one of the brothers, expanded wildly in the last decade, growing from 5-10 employees to a staff of 150. The brothers threw lavish office parties in order to congratulate themselves on their largesse, inviting members of the Albanian diaspora, reporters, politicians, etc., so they could brag about how big they had come. They rented a massive office for themselves, with two presumptuous oak desks and opulent leather couches just to show off for any guests. Now, after New Jersey's bail reform, they've had to fire 3/4 of their staff. They are down to bare bones, shutting satellite offices. But tellingly, ""Mike"" and ""Tony"" have maintained their large, glamorous (and highly unprofitable) office space, so they can continue to show off and presume to anyone who cares to be in their presence. Sadly, no-one does anymore."
12,Aaron Bail Bonds,Horrible company,2017-07-23,1.0,,They aren't any pros of working here,"They owners Mike and Tony are horrible lying selfish individuals. They never appreciate there employees. They will curse and yell and threaten everybody jobs if there goals arent met. They abuse their power and be little you to make you feel like they own you. The supervisors are a joke and lazy. All they do is hover over an employee and try to find a reason to write you up when all they do is sit down all day and talk about nonsense or be on their phones. They barley take supervisor calls when needed. The hr department is a joke as well. If you call out once they want a Dr note and will call the doctor office to verify if you were really there. The payment department break so many fdcpa laws it's ridiculous. The owners doesn't care what you tell these customers as long as they make a payment or post a bail with us. They are selling people false hope and doesn't have no regret about it. They will fire you in a heartbeat and if you try to be noble and put your two weeks they fire you on the spot. They will fight to not approve unemployent checks if you request it. They make it seem like they care , but in reality they dont. The lowered everyones pay rate since the bail reform and fired  over 30 employees. They don't have any benifits either. They only thing they give you is paid vacation and sick days after a year of employment. Do yourself a favor and don't apply to this stupid company. Mike and Tony are a joke and karma will come back around to Bite them which it already has started. They have so many pending lawsuits it's ridiculous. STAY AWAY AND IF YOUR STILL THERE FIND A NEW JOB ASAP. THIS COMPANY WILL BE OUT OF BUISNESS before 2018."
13,Aaron Bail Bonds,STAY AWAY FROM APPLYING,2017-05-28,1.0,,There are none. Pay wasn't even worth it..,"STAY AWAY. The worst company you could ever work for. I would rather be broke than to work for this company. They have the most disrespectful supervisors. ALL of them are very unprofessional and nasty. They are always threatening to fire you for any reason, whether it's being one minute late to work even with a valid reason, whether it's because you didn't meet their ridiculously high quota for the week, or if it's because you spoke to another employee for a second. In payments, I've heard the supervisor curse at his employees multiple times. Everything at this company is a joke lol. The company is a joke. And they are going out of business hahahaha. In fact, they are at a point now where they already closed down two of their offices. If you start with them, you'll regret it and you probably won't even last a couple moments since they're most likely closing and keep lying to their employees that they are not. The owners are crazy, and if I may say STUPID."
14,Aaron Bail Bonds,It is what you make it,2017-03-02,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"-Good Pay
-Parties if goals are met
-Easy take days off
-young employees",shift sucks 1-10 p.m. There are other shifts but less pay.
15,Aaron Bail Bonds,Customer rep,2017-02-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,You gain customer experience. Prepare you for a future in a company and dealing with difficult customers.,"No room for growth, constent supervision, controlling
The company is good to gain customer service experience especially with difficult customers and will prepare you if you're looking to get in the business field. Sadly the company has no employee culture all they care if for the employees to bring bails in even if they have to bring the bail in with $1 and try to make people put more down after. All the supervisors do is day dream, do nothing and constant listening in employees conversations. They interrupt you while you're speaking to a client and correct you which is rude and unprofessional. The production department does all the work but keep on abusing the department into bring more bails in when there's hardly bails especially from the bail reform. A lot of employees see this job as a way to bring bread to the table thankfully I finished my BA and just used this as something to put on my resume! This company helped me finish my Bachelors degree because being there for the rest of my life would of been death."
16,Aaron Bail Bonds,NOT WORTH IT,2017-01-31,2.0,,It starts at a good pay rate,"Satellite offices are on their own, they will constantly watch and listen to you over the cameras. You will never be told when you're doing good, but will be quickly reprimanded if you do something wrong. It's high stress and they borderline doing some things illegally (example, trading phone calls for inmate referrals)"
17,Aaron Bail Bonds,this job sucks,2017-01-09,2.0,Anonymous Employee,the co-workers are young and cool,"no room to grow, managers aren't hired within , 1-10pm shirt, people come and go"
18,Aaron Bail Bonds,Customer Service,2016-11-14,2.0,Customer Service Representative,"14/hr, easy job, supervisors were cool","Management sucked. sucky hours, not flexible"
19,Aaron Bail Bonds,Its a great job,2016-10-11,4.0,,14 an hour if you work second shift and 12 if you do first which is better than I've had. If you actually work they leave you alone and you can get away with stuff like requesting days off. Its a great job especially if your in school or just graduated. People seem to get promoted. You can learn all about an office here. If you actually work but just dont like where you are you can ask to work in a different department. If you do really well management does nice things for you.The other people are pretty nice but they talk a lot. Dress code is easy.,"You can talk to really difficult customer, the water cooler is gross!"
20,Aaron Bail Bonds,Loving my job,2016-10-10,5.0,,I have been with the company for 7 months & have no complaints at all. My supervisors have always been helpful & understanding. I have grown within the company in a very short amount of time. Management is great! I have never been mistreated or judged. its a very friendly work environment and I wont be leaving anytime soon.,"I don't have any cons , I enjoy working with this company, hoping to learn & grow more within time."
21,Aaron Bail Bonds,Unbelievable,2016-09-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"None, I thought long and hard but there is literally and honestly none, unless you enjoy working for a bail bonds","Unprofessional work environment, you can't take upper management serious, you'll still get fired even if you do your job, etc."
22,Aaron Bail Bonds,Don't do it,2016-08-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The $14 hr and that's only if you work customer service production is $12,You have to harrass people for money meet a $1200 a day goal from people who have never even made a payment you have to ask to use the bathroom get water stand up everything! They always walk around watching you amd are very condescending the managers smile in your face talk behind your back they sit on social media all day but god forbid you pull out your phone always threatening to fire you when goal is not met 1000 cameras watching you all day long they gossip alot about people and are very cliquey really can't stand that job people quit left and right they put too much pressure on people to the point of being scared when your goal is not met thank god my husband has a great job and i dont NEED them like some in there trying to feed thier family oh and there always one guy yelling and screaming literally degrading people and others try to do the same im not with that the job sucks
23,Aaron Bail Bonds,STAY FAR FAR AWAY!,2016-07-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,there are NO pros for working in this company. this has been the worst job possible that i have ever had in my life.,"the supervisors watch you, they stand right over you while you are working......they have a power this power trip going on. the management & owners are muslim racists. you honestly feel like your in a prison. this is not a real job. its a ""for now job"" no future or advancement here..you have to ask permission to go to the bathroom..you have to LIE to these poor families just trying to help their family/friends in prison or jail.....its a BIG SCAM. management make you literally tell lies to these people soo desperate to just help these people...they wanted me to sign a paper because i took off 3xs because my son was sick and i refused so they let me go...got unemployment though!..do yourself a favor and stay away"
24,Aaron Bail Bonds,Don't waste your time!,2016-07-25,1.0,,There are no reasons I can think of that would be good from working here starting pay is 14....probably the only pro and I personally don't find it worth working in this company for 14 an hour.,"Worst job I've ever had!, At least when it comes to management.! The supposed supervisors are micro managing know it all's who shouldnt even be in their positions to begin with! The supervisors are IMMATURE and talk more behind employees backs than they do their own jobs. NOTHING IS EVER GOOD ENOUGH FOR THESE PEOPLE. Your job is ALWAYS on the line, no such thing as security there. IF your not aggressive enough, FIRED.. IF your not pushing for more money, FIRED, If your phone is not ringing, FIRED. If you use the restroom too frequently, your not doing your job. FIRED! There's no winning ever. Even if your top dog one week and bringing in more money than everyone else and you have a bad week the next, it's never acknowledged. Employees are treated like crap and can't even ask simple questions without receiving an attitude from the supervisors. Some employees even get fired for doing what they were told to do. CONTRADICTING MUCH? I'm surprised they haven't lost their business years ago especially with the way they treat their clients. A majority of the reasons why there's never enough money coming in is because they deny payments that are less than $200. I mean if your in the business of helping people and these people are trying to put something towards their balance because they don't want any negative consequences, and you deny them of even making a $50 payment because its not good enough, what makes you think that these people are ever going to bring their business back to you let alone pay off their balance.?!"
25,Aaron Bail Bonds,Production/Bail tech,2016-05-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Able to put office experience on my resume. Only expected to work your shift. Overtime actually frowned upon.,Soul crushing amounts of lying to the friends and families of inmates. Degrading management. My supervisor at my next job laughed at how I felt compelled to report why I was leaving my desk each and every time I did so. I will be a lifelong advocate for the abolishment of the bail system. This company is the very portrait of predatory lenders.
26,Aaron Bail Bonds,Probably the worst company I ever worked for...,2016-05-28,1.0,,Getting an hour break to get away.,"You sit at your cubicle being stared down by 50 security cameras, The owners , HR ready and steady to fire you , and these wack as supervisors (with the exception of one) that seem to get the little title of supervision to they're head when really they're doing the hard work for the big dogs. This company is a SCAM and a JOKE. You need to ask permission to use the bathroom, dont even try asking for a sick day cause youll get them after 6 months UNPAID , no vaca until a year. Saturdays are really on who they want to give off, they dont like you expect to work Saturdays. No appreciation and raises!? Think agian people been here for 2+ year and get raises DENIED!"
27,Aaron Bail Bonds,I fill out other job application everyday trying to escape.,2016-05-25,2.0,,Easy to get hired. They have different shifts. If you work late shift it's more money. They also offer Part time.,"Sooo unprofessional. You're treatment is based off your likeness, the supervisor are nerds that finally have a little power and take it over board. Hovering over you and hopefully they like you because if they don't they're writing you up. Vacation, ha! Not until you work 1 year and it has to be Janurary. Example: Hire date: May 2016 One Year: May 2017 now I have to wait until January 2018?!. So sick, oh but after 6 month you can request 5 days UNPAID. Drama from all the girls in the office, they dating each, gossip, gossip, and pressure from management to bring in more money. They lie to their clients. I feel guilty working there. They dont appreciate you. People that work there 5+ years always tells me ""Don't ever expect a thank you"" They tell me how hard they've worked and went above and beyond and instead of Thank you, the Owner or upper management would say ""next time do better."" No benefits."

30,Aaron Bail Bonds,Just Horrible,2016-04-12,1.0,Customer Service Representative,You get to wear whatever you want and as long as you make friends with certain people you can get away with literally anything and everything.,"Management is the worst kind of management I have ever worked for. They constantly have meetings to let everyone know how much of a horrible staff they have due to not reaching the weekly goal. The owners will say everyone sucks and everyone needs to get fired. Owners constantly yell at supervisors and tell them if the weekly goal isn't reached they will get fired. Management is racist as well, and I have personally heard one of the owners say to a supervisor that there are ""too many black employees"" implying thats the reason for the lack of productivity. Management hires and fires in bulk, I always saw people coming and going in that place. No positive reinforcement whatsoever even if you do well. There are no employees reviews, ever. I met employees who worked there for years and are still at the same rate of pay even if their positions changed and require more responsibilities. There are so many reasons to not work for this company. Do yourself a favor and if you receive a call for an interview say ""thanks, but no thanks""."

34,Aaron Bail Bonds,Worst company ever.,2015-11-11,2.0,Production,The $14 an hour and easy job.,"If you have any respect for yourself DO NOT work for this company. Lets start of by saying they lie to all clients that call in and that they can get their family members out for only $50. They make us as employees tell the customers anything to make them come down to the office and drop off their money. You become a lying scam artist just like them, it isn't about customer service it is about getting a person into the office. On top of that the work moral is terrible. Managers do not care what you have to say they just care that you are working. You are a slave to the company and get suspended for 2-3 days if you call out. If you ask management a question they yell at you and suspend you. You have to sit in a cubicle for 8 hours making calls. You cannot talk to fellow coworkers they have cameras at every cubicle and microphones recording everything you say. If you have to use the restroom you have to sign a sign out sheet, and if you take more than 3 mins they will come up and ask you why you took so long. You aren't even allowed to have your purse or bag on your desk. They do not care about their employees at all and will fire you the second you voice your concern and not give you a reason."
35,Aaron Bail Bonds,Worst Management,2015-09-08,1.0,,14/hourly was the only ok thing,"Get yelled at if we got up to stretch, timed to use the bathroom, had to lie to people on phones for sales, got spoken to as if we were 5 years old."

38,Aaron Bail Bonds,customer service,2015-04-10,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Yhe $14 an hour pay was the only good thing about this company.,"Tye way they treat their employees is just as bad as they treat their customers. I could not believe they they were as big a scam as they were. I would have to lure the innocent family members of the inmates into my office and get the, to start a bail. They would make me play upon the family members ignorance to get them to start the bail. I would have to take their money from them and put it into a draw and tell them that they would have to wait to recieve a refund, even though it was right in the draw next to me. I have seen mothers, wives, sisters, cousins and friends of these inmates burst into tears because of the run around that they would do to these poor people. I can honestly say that I have gone out on a limb for this company and never got so much as a thank you from any of them. Then eventually they cut off any way for us to tell the family members the true bail amounts. (Sometimes.the def doesnt know the amounts) but wanted us to go by what the defendant said... and then knowing all along the bail is really more or less then what the inmate said i was not allowed to tell the family which would be another run around process for them. It was such a dishonest business and It made me feel like I was a horrible person.. I want to help people not keep them locked up."
39,Aaron Bail Bonds,the worst job i ever had,2014-08-11,1.0,Call Center Agent,"none,there can be nothing good about it","everything is a challenge here,i have seen so many employees jus not returning after the 1st day of work.they advertise office assistant job but basically is a call center position where you have to solicit inmates to have us bail them out,you get cursed out by inmates,there are authorized walking up and down ,they will stand next to u and look at u with a death stare.they will keep yelling"" answer the phones"" every 5 mins.there is no downtime,u have to tell a superivisor that you are going to pee ,and they note down the time you spent in the bathroom.they will have meetings to tell u , how bad you are at the numbers,no one has a clue how much they have to do everyday to make the numbers better.

there are 10s of thousands of cameras and hidden microphones everywhere,bad policies, if u submit and employee grievance, it comes back to u , showing how bad u are and how the other employee is more contributing than u.

BAD,BAD,BAD management, too much micro management, the person who got hired 2 months before will be made a supervisor and they will stand behind u,asking you why are you talking that way to someone or you should have said this, or this is how its supposed to be done.

Also they dont tell you at interview that you have to be 10 mins early and be on phones at 7:59:59 and not to leave phone untill is 5:00:59, if u even get free before that, they will make a note of it.

They alot specific people to come look at who gets up first,now a days the bosses do tht. they should do something more constructive

it is so difficult to voice your opinion here, you do not matter, ur jus another random person they are paying to solicit someone,
if u ever have any questions about a



nything, u can never reach the head personell, u have to keep calling their assistant for a rude voice saying they are not here or busy

they will send threatening emails all day long that"" it is ur job to do this"" or ""why we are so bad at our job"" or answer the phones thts what you are paid for etc etc, or threatening notes are left on your desk with these same things 

they have 4 vacation days, after you work a whole year staring January to December--it is very less likely for anyone to stay that long"
