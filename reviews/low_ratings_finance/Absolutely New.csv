3,Absolutely New,Looking Back a Good Company,2017-11-08,5.0,Operations,"Company was filled with smart people operating in a tough market. CEO had a good vision and kept employees informed on a regular basis. Started to get wins at companies like Walmart, PetCo, Target and Bed Bath and Beyond.",It came to light the former CFO was embezzling millions of dollars out of the company (he is now in federal prison). The company was forced to close just as it was starting to make a presence in the market.
4,Absolutely New,Worst Company I Ever Worked For,2013-08-22,1.0,Marketing,"Some of the most talented people I ever worked with came out of this company.  A number of people were approachable and easy-going.  Working here made everyone feel like they were a group rather than a bureaucratic company.  CEO was very effective at keeping people informed about news within company, positive or negative.","The best way to describe this company was that it was a roller coaster ride and each day was not predictable.  Never a dull moment but not dull for a bad reason.  There were good accomplishments company made and CEO announced them via e-mail.  However, the accomplishments were outweighed significantly by company's financial problems.  Pretty much the majority of people at this company just got disillusioned and low morale was prevalent, except when a new CFO was around from 2009-2010.  Every contribution each employee made never made much of a dent in getting this company greater revenue nor even beyond the 40+ staff it had.  CEO seemed to have his sight on making this company the next Proctor & Gamble.  He went in way over his head."
5,Absolutely New,Not One of the Better Companies I Worked For,2013-06-09,1.0,Sales Support,"-Company's retail division was filled with great talent previously from Sharper Image.  Developed some top selling and awesome products.
-Everyone worked together and you got to know people one-on-one.","-Company shut down in August 2012.
-Working for the company was like working in a sweat shop:  You worked hard but there was really no reward and real end in sight.  Often times you'd be given tasks in no way related to your position but that's because no other opportunities to contribute where there.
-Pay was low and not worth the hard work.
-Company had a cash flow problem that was persistent for the 4+ years I worked there.  Every employee faced at least one instant where their paycheck bounced or there were delays in receiving their checks.
-There was always a fear every week the company would go down and it kept on going for years."
6,Absolutely New,Company is gone. Nuff said,2013-04-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The people are great. Fun work envirmonment.,Low pay. Big guy is scary and affects work enviroment.
7,Absolutely New,Never a dull moment!,2013-02-28,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Met some really great people, creative, and just overall well rounded. Very diverse staff. Richard (CEO) did a fairly good job of always keeping the employees informed on the big decisions taking place and how it affects them.","Pay is below market. Always felt like the company could go under at any moment. Some employees really don't care, and it sucks b/c if you want to do your job well, it requires them to do it well. Employee turn over is fast (esp in sales dept). Departments were very siloed."
8,Absolutely New,"Great employees, terrible management",2012-08-15,1.0,Sales Director,"it's a job... easy to get if you interview well. pay is decent, but definitely not good. they pay overtime. it's a fun job at first, until you realize how stupid the inventions you work with are and how little the inventions have to do with your job if you're in sales, it's all about making sales doing whatever it takes. They teach you sales strategies, but if you have a conscience, not all of them are good sales strategies. Many times they teach you to be brutally honest and if the customer wants to purchase the service, then sell it. However, the services being offered are not productive or worth anyone's money","management does not share vision with employees, management lies to employees, company is a ""legal scam"" - they sell services that they know will not help the inventors that are paying from $695 to $26k+. Some inventions are so bad (it's the inventors fault there) that they don't market them as they promise they will when they charge $10-26k to do so. Many products do not go to trade shows and are never shown to anyone at all, so therefore they're not fulfilling the services they promise inventors."
9,Absolutely New,Absolutely New has potential if management can get their act together.,2008-06-20,3.0,Senior Product Marketing Manager,You get to work on developing new products for the marketplace.,Management could be better but I heard recently that the old management was replaced.
