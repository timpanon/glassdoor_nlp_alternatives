5,Advanced Equities,Investment Advisor,2013-12-12,1.0,Account Executive,Interesting private equity transactions. Worked with some of the best VC in Silicon Valley. The founders and entrepreneurs would give interesting presentations about their companies.,All the deals went bad. All the investors generally lost all their money. Never had a big winner at all.

Management is street smart, but clearly lack the ability to run a VC firm/investment bank or whatever it is they want to call themselves."
