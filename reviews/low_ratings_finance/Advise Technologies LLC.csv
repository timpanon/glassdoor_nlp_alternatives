1,Advise Technologies LLC,SOFTWARE SALES,2021-04-04,5.0,Sales Executive,"Great CEO, Startup. Independent work ethic. Results-driven compensation",Renegotiation of contracts every 3- 6 months
2,Advise Technologies LLC,Good,2021-01-24,3.0,Analyst,Dynamics role. People are okay to work with,Salary hikes are a big issue.
3,Advise Technologies LLC,The employees and...Management needs wake up call,2018-08-06,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Nice colleagues, decent hours and we are given snacks on a daily basis.",Management in certain areas is questionable..the CFO is verbally abusive to staff. The office is drab looking and the culture is low energy
4,Advise Technologies LLC,Analyst,2018-03-14,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Small organization. Good for entry-level employees to learn. Colleagues are nice.,Space for growth is small
5,Advise Technologies LLC,Decent place to work,2017-08-07,4.0,Product Manager,"- Great colleagues, friendly and open environment. Lots of smart and intelligent people.
- No red-tape, things get done quickly.
- Individual units/divisions such as software development, sales, legal are extremely efficient and full of smart people.
- Lots of visibility, everyone knows everyone, informal and casual environment.
- Company has seen a positive change after its recent acquisition. This has definitely added some energy among the management as well as employees.
- Management took some good steps recently to improve culture by providing some benefits. E.g. Good bonus/hike, One week paid holiday during new year, summer event, year end event, pension in Amsterdam office.
- Great lunch for a reasonable price (in Amsterdam)
- Flexible working hours.","- The company's whole future growth relies on limited set of products (some don't even exist). As I see company may struggle to move out of a startup mode unless it finds some huge contract. Positive outlook is good but retaining it is critical.
- Company is trying to sell and then build while it should be otherway around. It just reflects a bad impression in front of the client and stress for the delivery.
- Certainly a fast paced environment and not a 9 to 5 job but then there is hardly any additional benefit to compensate for it.
- Huge disparity in salaries. I know, every company has it but here it's different and disappointing.
For E.g. Person A with 1-2 years of experience may be getting 70K while Person B with 8-10 years of experience is fetching 50-55K with zero benefits (both giving their 100% in the role). Definitely, the job will ""fit you like a glove"" as long as you are Person A.
- Unnecessary cost cutting in areas which would hardly make any difference."
6,Advise Technologies LLC,Fits me like a glove,2017-04-21,4.0,Middle Management,"I worked in this company for almost 3 years and feel quite content here. No bureaucracy, casual friendly atmosphere, everyone knows each other, can easily get help from colleagues, vast opportunities to learn, real opportunities to make impact if initiative is taken,  no ridiculous restrictions or rules that normally exist in big corporations, management is constantly trying to improve in various areas to make employees feel comfortable and appreciated, realistic performance measurement criteria, unlimited sick days, international presence.","Very fast paced work and strict deadlines which come with some stress and occasional long hours. If you want laid back 9 to 5 lazy corporate environment, this place is not for you. However, amount of stress and long hours for me personally is comparable to those in investments banks where I worked before. But here my effort is much more visible and appreciated than in big corporations where upper management has no idea that you exist. In fact, last year the whole company was given Christmas week off in appreciation for hard work. Company is still growing both in the number of new hires and in general corporate development, so there are definitely some hits and misses, trials and errors, but it makes it more interesting to be part of this still evolving thing."
7,Advise Technologies LLC,Worst management I've ever seen,2016-10-13,1.0,,There is none.The people in here have no idea what culture is and the product is boring and clunky. Very little ingenuity going on in here.,Terrible leadership. No culture. Highly recommend them to close shop. You are ruining people's lives.
8,Advise Technologies LLC,There is a common trend,2016-06-15,1.0,Junior Software Developer,You have the opportunity to learn which is good for entry level developers.  Friday lunch is a nice perk.,"Pay is subpar, long hours, management has no clue, CEO has no presence, the loss of market share is causing lots of layoffs, turnover and overall a toxic culture.  Take a look at the compilation of other negative and positive reviews.  It's really a no brainer to figure out which ones are legitimate.  Nobody is really happy here."
9,Advise Technologies LLC,Not Recommended,2016-06-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"potential for a student looking for some experience on their resume, but set your expectations or salary, role and management. This is not how the real world works.","Maturity level of organization and management is lacking - starting at the top. Staff  are required to play along with the game, no concept of what an organization is or how it should be run."
10,Advise Technologies LLC,BA,2016-05-19,3.0,Anonymous,Nice environment to learn about regulatory reporting. Good starting point who chase up financial career and regulatory reporting.,"Need to be diligent, highly challenging environment."
11,Advise Technologies LLC,Growth Pains Proliferate...,2016-04-27,3.0,,"Colleagues really try to provide inter-office support for each other.  
The AdviseU learning sessions are great for continual learning support. 
The establishment of an on-boarding process has helped to ease the burden of support and integration for new hires.  
There has been some significant strides in product development. 
Pay is fair, but benefits are not.","There have been two company layoffs--not a healthy indication for an organization that is barely 6 years old.  In general, turnover is HIGH.  The question remains, why the company hires people for their innovation and talent if they are just going to sit them behind a computer and tell them what to code or write?  This counteracts exactly what they’ve paid good money to acquire. 

I have also never seen an exit interview yet which tells me that the feedback of departing employees’ does not matter.  It should be viewed as an opportunity to learn what’s working and what's not, instead of negating the attrition with “these are not our kind of people”!

Entrance into the EU forecasted 60 new employees. One year later, there have been around 10 additions which has already experienced a higher turnover rate than NY!  Clearly, this needs a rethink. 
 
While most IT and global companies have moved to increase WFH and flex time as a cost-savings measure, Advise has moved backwards.  Physical proximity does not make a team! These types of short-sighted HR policies just further undermine employee autonomy and trust."
12,Advise Technologies LLC,good environment,2015-12-20,5.0,Developer,they took a chance on me and I grew in my career path. benefits are decent. it is a small company which gives you opportunities,didn't like the office chairs.
13,Advise Technologies LLC,Good company to start at,2015-08-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Constant learning, exam support, good people to work with.  The brand is growing, market share is increasing and the opportunities for growth and career development are very good",Some projects are not the most interesting type of work
14,Advise Technologies LLC,A work in progress,2015-08-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Good opportunities to learn new skills and work on interesting projects and grow as the company grows.,The pace can be fast and the customers are hedge funds.  It's not for everyone.  Some of the negative reviews here sound like people who are not a good fit for a finance industry position.
15,Advise Technologies LLC,Business Analyst,2015-07-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I had a great experience in my first year at the company, when it was still growing and moving offices to accommodate more staff. Hours could be long and there is definitely not a sense of camaraderie but the pay is fair and the on the job learning and responsibility given to junior staff is great.","In truth, this is not the best working environment. Senior management is curt with everyone and while I have always been treated fairly, ever since the company stopped growing they are usually in a bad mood. I have only seen the CEO in the office once in the past 10 months. There have also been a lot of departures recently, including all of the ny based sales/marketing team. New hires have been mostly in Europe and dont have a lot of interaction with the ny office. Product cycles have become more and more stressful. Clients complaints have multiplied lately. 
While most of the complaints on this site from employees are accurate some are a bit exaggerated. Worse though are the posts on glassdoor and other sites from management wanting to bicker."
16,Advise Technologies LLC,Good place to start for the work minded,2015-07-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Strong opportunity to work in a changing and flexible environment where you have the opportunity to directly contribute to the development and life-cycle of a product.  Not a ""big-box"" organization and your words have meaning and you can be listened to, if you present your ideas in a logical fashion.  Ability to show autonomous skills while still contributing to the whole.  Great global product potential","Current employee that has read multiple negative reviews and some valid points are made.  Yes, there is little company culture to speak of.  Yes, there is little ""back-patting"" or ""kudos"" and the only benefit of doing a good job is NOT getting harshly spoken to.  Yes, there have been certain issues in the past, and not all of them are fixed.  If you are a person that needs to hear ""Good Job!"" or get a hug when you do what you're paid for this isn't the place for you.  Many of the managers take a peer level stance with most things and if I had to describe the culture it would be ""frat level.""  If you don't know what I mean then again, this company probably isn't for you.  

However, steps are being taken, actively, to address the negative reviews on this site directly.  You can see it in the active focuses that they are placing in the company, expanded company ""employee temperature"" taking, and attempting to build a culture and some level of transparency."
17,Advise Technologies LLC,Bad work culture,2015-04-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There wasn't an option to give zero stars. Do your own research about the company. Ask a lot of questions before you consider taking a job here. I wouldn't recommended to my friends or enemies.,"If you are reading this, you should read the rest of the reviews. It seems there is always either a positive or negative review about this company. Why isn't there average? Could the positive reviews not be from employees? I am writing this review hoping you will do your own research into this company. My opinion is don't come work for this company. Save yourself the trouble. It is not a company where you will grow. Nor is it a place that will make you want to come to work everyday. Work schedule is hectic. Management attributes it to being a start-up. Plenty of start-ups exists where employees are treated well and collectively contribute. Management is horrible at planning and doesn't listen. When told certain things should be move, it is like talking to a blank wall. If you value your dignity and self worth, stay away."
18,Advise Technologies LLC,Stay Away - The Company is in trouble,2015-03-30,1.0,,Lunch on Friday. Easy to get time off because they don't care about employee health.,No on-boarding. No training. No company goals. No culture. No future. HR are poor. CEO is never present in the office. Employees are expected to work hard with no reward. There is no review process in place. Upper Level Management (for the most part) don't care about the lower level employees.
19,Advise Technologies LLC,Stay far away.  You've been warned.,2015-03-30,1.0,,"Potential to learn a lot, free lunch on Fridays and some cool coworkers.","I was reluctant to join this company after reading the previous Glassdoor reviews but nonetheless tried to see the good in the company before getting hired.  What a mistake.  The posts about profanity, CEO being absent, respect level and lack of professionalism are very accurate.  Hours are long as they are short on resources, thus you will be overworked.  You're not going to have much of a work/life balance.  Think you're going to get compensated extra for those extra hours?  Nope.  They pay below NYC market rates.   Avoid this place at all costs, it's worth waiting for a better company."
20,Advise Technologies LLC,Caveat Emptor,2015-03-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Getting a foot in the door for junior programmers or technical writers.,"Advise is a 1 trick pony that was quite successful when Form PF caught the hedge fund compliance world flat-footed. Since then, growth has been tepid and the products are too cumbersome and convoluted for most of the firms they service. There are simpler (and much cheaper) solutions and competition is fierce. Despite what interviewees are told, Advise is not the top or number one service provider in the field anymore. 

Senior management consists of former back office personnel from banks and hedge funds. The CEO is literally absentee, employees all say he has not been seen in months. The rest of senior management is tough to deal with, ranging from anti-social to crass. None have any experience managing people or running a start up, and it shows.  

The office environment is one of complete silence, all day long. People sit quietly and work diligently, do not expect to learn or collaborate with your co-workers or develop real or lasting relationships. Management is extremely focused on meetings, process, box-checking, and back office issues. There is a high reliance on scheduled meetings in order to learn about or convey ideas and information. 

Advise is a start up in name only, it is not fun or laid back at all. The subject matter is boring and despite what management thinks compliance reporting is not a top priority in the industry anymore."
21,Advise Technologies LLC,Horrible Company,2015-03-06,1.0,,There are none. This is truly a horrible company to work for. Please don't waste your time.,"Overworked, unpaid and no work/life balance."
22,Advise Technologies LLC,Terrible place to work,2015-03-05,1.0,Software Developer,Some decent co-workers but thats about it,"Terrible leadership and managers. Work long hours and paid consistently late. Employees are bullied by management and the turnover rate is very high.   

Also no personal growth, poor benefits and no work/life balance."
23,Advise Technologies LLC,Intern,2015-01-29,5.0,,"Relaxed work environment, Flexible hours, People who work here are nice and always willing to help, Good mix of youth and experience",It may seem unorganized sometimes
24,Advise Technologies LLC,"A Rare, Overwhelmingly Negative Review",2015-01-17,1.0,,"Pros are employee perks, like free lunches Friday, a candy bowl and friendly employees","This company has been known to refuse recruiter candidates because of the price. Similarly, should you fail in your foray in this company, expect no support from the management or from government services, as they will contest this aspect, as well as send you off with no severance pay. It is a poor choice for someone not in the industry. as the possibility of failure is significant. They are still (as other posts describe it) in start-up mode, and will perhaps be better with age. The pace is breakneck, which is fine if you're a robot."
25,Advise Technologies LLC,Opportunity for Those Who Will Grasp It,2014-09-21,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Fair compensation and benefits.  Challenging problems to solve with much latitude in how to go about doing so.  Casual, upbeat culture of friendly and smart people.  Lots of room to learn and improve one's skill set.  Little bureaucracy and no office politics.  Opportunity to contribute directly and substantially to the success of an actual industry leader.  Very flat structure with direct access to highest levels of management including CEO.  Opportunity for advancement as the company grows.","Start-up status and lack of bureaucracy can mean little structure and less direction.  This company is not a good choice for those who are not driven and self-motivated, which is reflected by many of the negative comments you see on this board.  Certainly, there's nowhere in a nimble, fast-growing start-up for the average to hide out while riding the coattails of productive colleagues.

With frequent deadlines and demanding clients, hours can be long and there is pressure to deliver, although improvements are gradually being made on both fronts.  Working for a young, industry-leading software start-up in the financial sector presents obvious benefits, and what should be obvious drawbacks.

Honestly, the accusations of foul language being directed at employees, people being dressed down and humiliated, Friday night drinking binges, and employees going unpaid are gross exaggerations and out-and-out falsehoods.  Ask yourself if any company could survive, let alone be successful with a culture such as that?"
26,Advise Technologies LLC,Not bad but if you don't love financial/wall street material then you will not like it here.,2014-08-09,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good place to get your start, but only if you really really love financial/wall street related material. The tasks that are asked of you are not too difficult and also not way too easy.","You will be required to go to useless meetings almost everyday where the management get into arguments, some people are very crass and unfortunately these meetings took time away from getting stuff done.

You will also be required to go to ""Advise U"" where every Friday they have someone teach the whole company about something they don't want to learn about to begin with. These could be interesting but they simply are not done well.

You are going to be forced to learn about financial material even if you are a programmer working on the back end."
27,Advise Technologies LLC,"A Challenging Environment, yet Good Experience Overall",2014-07-01,4.0,Software Developer,"I've worked with the smartest types of people, and managed to learn a lot from most of them. There's a lot of opportunities to deal with many different technologies and aspects of programming. from architecture, to design, to databases, to managing other jr. developers. and more. you will do it all. it's a good place to be if you are independent enough and willing to work hard to grow and take yourself further.","The feeling is of a flat start-up firm on a constant basis: long hours, pushy deadlines. not much of recognition and incentives. so-so benefits. it's not all bad, but there was a lot of place for improvement on that front."
28,Advise Technologies LLC,horrible,2014-06-22,1.0,,nothing is good about this company,benefit is bad &long hours
29,Advise Technologies LLC,Great Learning Experience,2014-03-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Opportunity to be exposed to a broad array of arenas (software production, project implementation, financial services regulation). I felt compelled to write this partly contradict some of the previous reviews. I worked there for over a year and was never yelled at or spoken too in a disparaging manner. Profanity if used, was used in to describe situations or actions, but not insult employees. No one ever attempted to intimidate me, nor did I witness that happen to any fellow employees. It is a small company that went through some lean times, but by no means the horror show some have depicted it as. Hard work, even if bad was always appreciated.","Though it is moving forward, it was still in start up mode during my time there. This provided for some uncertainty, but in todays world that could be said of not just start ups but also well established companies. Benefits were not the best, but salaries seemed more than fair."
