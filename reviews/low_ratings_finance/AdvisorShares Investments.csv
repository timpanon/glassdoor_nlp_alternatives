0,AdvisorShares Investments,Investment Consultant,2018-09-21,5.0,Investment Consultant,"Great people and access to management because it is a smaller company. Questions are encouraged and management is open to new ideas. People are not constantly looking over your shoulder, so is great for self-starters.","If you enjoy speaking to people over the phone and are willing to work hard, you will enjoy your time and be rewarded. If you do not, I would not recommend the position."
1,AdvisorShares Investments,"Good Company, Growing Industry",2016-08-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I am not typically one to leave reviews, but given the many negative reviews, I thought it would be worth while to illustrate an alternative view point. I was reading some of the other reviews, and while they are colorful, they are very inaccurate. I found the one referring to a manager that farted particularly funny, but I seriously doubt it ever happened. It is a small company so something like that would have spread - no pun intended.

While not perfect, the company was a great place to learn and grow in the fund/investment management space. It is a place where if you work hard, you will be rewarded. For me, this was bonuses and base salary increases. While I wish my starting pay would have been more (doesn't everyone?), I believe it was a fair offer based on my experience. 

The firm's management is in itself a compelling reason to work there. They have great institutional knowledge of the industry, building investment products, and running a business. They typically do not micro manage your work so you have to be a self-starter. I had more autonomy at this company than any other in the past, and while most would agree that is a good thing, I think few people have ever actually experienced it. No one is looking over my shoulder. No one is yelling at me. If you need a manager that is in the office 9-5, don't work here. The managing directors often travel and are in and out of the office for various reasons.","Benefits are good, but if you work at a 100+ person company, your benefits are probably better. I had healthcare, 401(k), paid time off, and all the other things most companies have. Overall, I would recommend this company as a great place to work."
2,AdvisorShares Investments,This company makes Dunder Mifflin look good,2015-10-10,1.0,Investment Consultant,"This question assumes that all jobs have something good about them.  Not sure about this company.  There's no dress code, but if you come into work with a suit they assume you've been interviewing other places and interrogate you.","I could write a book on this.  It's not a well run company in any way, shape or form.  Most executives there could not work in any capacity at a larger company because they have such poor intellectual, emotional, social and organizational skills.  A bullying culture defines the firm.  It does not have a startup feel at all.  It's definitely not a meritocracy Basically, the people who joined in the beginning have all power and they will never be disciplined, no matter what.  Managers seriously never listen to feedback.  Some MDs come in 5 hours late every day and no one can say a word.  If a normal employee comes in late, they are screamed at and threatened with termination.  It is by far the least ethical organization that I have ever worked for and as a result the company and its senior executives have been involved in many litigation battles, which you can find doing a simple Google search.   The company goes out of its way to make sure employees can't develop their skills.  Instead of doing things that grow assets, the managers spend a large portion of their time reading employees personal emails and looking to make sure they aren't posting resumes on job sites.     Also, it is a very unprofessional environment.  Certain managers make sexist, racist and homophobic comments regularly.  They also drink alcohol at work.  One or two are complete creepers and should not be allowed to work in a company with women.  The pay is so low that you're barely above the poverty line for the area where the company is located.  The job contract is overly restrictive and even has provisions that aren't legally allowed in Maryland.  The company tried to sue an employee who accepted a job offer with a client of the company.  That's right, they sued a paying customer.  In fact, their largest customer.  And AdvisorShares lost and that employee now works at the client and earns a much better salary.
Notice that AdvisorShares is an ""Engaged Employer"" on Glassdoor?  The bosses noticed all the bad reviews and tried to get them deleted.  They asked every employee to go on the site and write a review if they liked the company.  Obviously, no one did."
3,AdvisorShares Investments,"A miserable place to work, plain and simple",2015-02-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"You're next job will be a huge step up, because almost every company is an improvement over AdvisorShares.","It's quite simply the worst place that I've ever worked.  It's a completely toxic environment.  Everyone is depressed and hates being in the office. I feel that I'm a slave while I'm working there.  You work longer hours than anywhere in the financial industry and for lower pay and benefits.  You don't get the overtime or bonuses that you're owed.  
The managers are not honest and have awful personalities.  They don't say hi to people when they walk by, they always criticize and never praise employees and they certainly don't lead by example.  They come in very late every day and expect employees to be on time.  They don't treat me or my coworkers with respect.  The managers for the most part can't control their emotions and when they're in a bad  mood, they scream at and write incredibly nasty emails to their subordinates.  They threaten to fire people all of the time.  One time a manager even came by his team's work area just to let out a loud fart and then made some crude comment.  It was the most disrespectful thing hat I have ever witnessed in a work environment."
4,AdvisorShares Investments,Worthless mess with horrible management.,2013-09-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,None - McDonald's has more career upside.,"Everything: horrible pay, lies about bonuses, horrible leadership that treats the employees like indentured servants, etc, etc, etc.

Completely clueless."
