Unfortunately management is not part of this group. Expect to be micromanaged. Expect to be work 9+ hours, lunch is frowned upon, and to be expected to come in early or go to dinner meetings. Expect comp to be changed and lowered every year. Expect, if you are a woman to be harassed, and for HR and management not to care, and to ignore any issues around harassment.

If you bring in the moolah they love you.","CEO profits from bond UITs at the expense of investors by having his trader purchase bonds, them ""move"" them  into CEO's private LLC where he marks them up for his gain + sells back in UIT. Investors get highly marked up bonds & pay fees too.

Job has some potential if you have strong relationships on the Street.,"I worked for this company for 3 years and never recieved a raise. Managemnt talks a big game but when it comes time to reward employees, to agreed upon contract terms, AAM did fullfill their end of the bargin.

34,Advisors Asset Management,A long (mostly) fun journey,2014-07-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"There is lots of opportunity for growth.  Recent changes to some team structures have led to more control over your career.  Now you have a territory to yourself instead of having a split territory with ensuing friction between salespeople.  Like all sales jobs there is plenty of work but the reward is there.  There is more focus on accountability to ones self and their team.  If you want to coast you won't last.  

The UIT/fund side seems to be growing very quickly and we have great products to sell.  New partnerships with several industry leading firms are working to help growth as well.  There is plenty of opportunity to stand out at the firm if you are a good salesperson and willing to work.  I take time off when I need to and have found many of the people who have been unhappy here would be unhappy almost anywhere.  Thankfully many of those people are gone or getting moved out.",It is a small but growing company.  There have been some missteps in the past from leadership.  This does seem to be getting better and is to be expected from most growing companies.  In general it's been a good place to work and I do see things getting better.

Very charismatic CEO who has his pulse on the markets
Wholesaler division on the ""street side"" (wholesaling to wirehouses) is the best division to be in.","The culture deteriorated to ""let's make money at any cost"",even if it means doing the wrong thing. 
Many producers on bond desk look for loopholes just so they make $ for themselves (excessive markups, placing commission new issues in fee based accts so sales guy makes more $) at expense of advisors & clients. 
Little training for new people, not selective on who they hire & many people (not all) have questionable ethics."
36,Advisors Asset Management,Fixed Income Sales Trader,2014-04-17,1.0,Fixed Income Sales Trader,"Hands off supervision. This company is either in micro- or macro mode, depending on profiltability.","Very poor benefits, small comapany, atmosphere lack professionalism."
