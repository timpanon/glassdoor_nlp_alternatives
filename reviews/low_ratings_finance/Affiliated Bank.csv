2,Affiliated Bank,Popularity Contest,2019-11-25,2.0,Teller,Get hired on easily. Since this bank is practically unknown nobody ever applies or interviews.,"They hired me easily with several broken promises of learning and taking on more task to advance. Also if the head of deposits doesn't like you for whatever reason, you will be gone.  Tons of racism and what appears to be money laundering with no holds on deposits."
3,Affiliated Bank,Great company that takes care of their employees!,2017-08-15,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"They take good care of their employees. They make it easy to enjoy coming to work everyday.  Decent compensation, could be better but they give yearly raises.","Very limited training. One person is responsible for tasks that normally would have multiple different people or positions for. The higher ups tend to have the ""better than you"" attitude. There is definitely a power struggle within the company. 
Not much room to grow within the company. Little room for advancement."
