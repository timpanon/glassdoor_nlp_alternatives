0,Albridge Solutions,"Good culture, freindly people, new challenges every day",2021-08-20,4.0,Senior Business Analyst,"Exciting work,excellent interview process, hard working and helping co-workers, caring managers and flexible work hours","This company is using still outdated technology, processes. There are not enough employee growth plans."
1,Albridge Solutions,Good people but no growth,2021-01-19,4.0,"Director, Product Management",Dedicated people at mid level,Parent company does not want to invest growing the product
2,Albridge Solutions,The times they have changed,2016-12-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Dedicated, hard-working associates in the IT and Business departments.  Good collaboration between functional groups.  Good annual bonus model and 401K plan.","Low ratio of onshore to offshore staff is not sustainable, onshore teams are being over-worked and stretched.  There is a lack of a sound business plan, most of the work done is reactionary not strategic.  Firm has lost a lot of senior leadership and intellectual capital over past several years.  Replacements from the parent company and competitors have not been able to successfully fill the void.  Annual salary increases are miniscule, well below rate of inflation increases.  Work-life balance needs improvement."
3,Albridge Solutions,Financial Services Intern,2016-10-12,3.0,,"Very laid back atmosphere, company bought lunch for everyone once a week, very friendly people","Feels like you are almost stuck there, minimal mobility. Pay is not that great"
4,Albridge Solutions,Culture and people are high negatives,2016-03-05,1.0,Senior Business Analyst,Competitive salary - but comes at a price - your pride. Pay is decent and many people are overpaid for what they bring to the table,Everything else. Horrible mgmt.  a parent company with Pershing that is even worse. All politics. No respect for the employees. Dirty office. No talented people. No passion.
5,Albridge Solutions,...,2016-02-24,2.0,Service and Operations,"The location, Central Jersey, is ideal for commuters and recruiting talent that avoids traveling  in to Philadelphia or NYC.  The starting salary is competitive.  The product is certainly one to be proud of, specifically in how it services the financial services industry. Some decent middle managers. The firm is very educational from a technology, financial services and project managdement perspective if you are willing to learn.  There is an opportunity to learn many skills if you take advantage of the roll up your sleeves and get dirty atmosphere.  The stability of a large bank and clearing firm as affiliation and parent company creates an overal stable environment for employment.","Middle management is either dead weight or hands tied.  The backfill of open positions is a delayed process and one that prohibits backfills  on a 1:1 basis. Politics plays a major role in any form of promotion.  Salary caps cause position based promotions to be lateral in compensation, unencouraging.  Most of those who built Albridge out from the award winning start up it originated as, are long gone, except those looking for glory and recognition versus a true successful company and product with engaged employees.  Many who did not confirm were managed out."
6,Albridge Solutions,Insight,2015-11-01,1.0,Project Manager (PMO),"John Brett will give an Amazing speech about the wonderful success and progress.  Senior managers will excite you with a vision they have of the progress about to be made.  And with a pulse, you can be a VP...","When the going gets tough, the tough get going.  The smart left long ago.  The little kingdoms the managers have set up for themselves work well said no one ever.  Managers want to protect mort than contribute so don't cooperate. The good employees of old who built it left for Scivantage, Billtrust, and others. As a Project Maanager, teams were more concerned with overestimating time and then undelivering results.  Or tie up projects in processes created as you go."
7,Albridge Solutions,Down hill,2015-10-30,2.0,Analyst,People you work with are nice.  Good flexibility to work from home.  Good vacation and 401k policy.  Small environment so people can get to know each other .,Poor Management   company is trying to save every little penny and they are treating their employees poorly.  Bad raises even if you do well on your performance review.
8,Albridge Solutions,Intern,2015-10-19,4.0,,"great work life balance, never had to work over time in the group. Had a great boss and worked at my own pace. Was only a handful of other interns in the office.",Limited projects you can take on due to the business model of the company so I didn't come across any projects I was very interested in. Didn't have much work to give to the interns.
9,Albridge Solutions,Snr Management couldn't care less about employees but they read a lot of books with catchy buzzwords and slogans,2015-08-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- There are a handful of very smart, hard-working individuals that have previously and can still make a difference, provided they don't leave
- a few good middle managers are left that care about their staff but they aren't part of the Pershing inner-circle so they have very little influence
- free ice cream when the AC broke for the 4th time in 2 months","- the smart, hard working mentioned above are relied on too heavily and are burning out.  When people raise concerns they are essentially told ""if you don't like it you are free to look elsewhere for work"".  then when they take that advice and leave, snr management gets pissed off and offended that somebody dare leave the magical world of Pershing
- inconsistent with making counter-offers (although I'm not a fan of counter-offers at all).  they counter the people they should let go and don't counter the truly valuable employees
- mostly incompetent management from top to bottom
- senior management constantly contradicts themselves (e.g. ""we're a total comp company so your bonus will drive your comp increases"" then they say ""bonuses aren't guaranteed"") WHAT?!?!
- snr management plays favorites and protects ""their guys/ladies"" despite blatant incompetence
- individuals with absolutely no people manager skills are placed into management position
- snr management only wants ""Yes-men"", they don't want people that offer additional points of view or have the ability to think critically
- decrepit building with less modern conveniences than Fred Flintstone's cave
- unprofessional CEO that will berate people in meetings in front of their peers and teams for seemingly no reason other than to remind everyone that he's the boss
- too disenchanted to list any more, I think you get the picture"
10,Albridge Solutions,Not good,2015-02-14,1.0,,"Salary is fair, but other companies in the area have caught up.","Where to start. I work on the IT side of the house. It's fairly horrible. Bad managers who love to throw around words like agile, devops, cloud, but have no idea what they mean, much less how to implement. Most live to just kiss the ring of the cio's. All the good people have left, the ones who remain are either afraid of change or are just the crap left from the old regime. The facility is horrible. It's nice to see other companies renovating in the building, but our suites are shabby, dirty, and old. It screams the opposite of technology. So many people without a clue making decisions. The sad thing is that with a few good hires, it could be turned around! But with the current managers in Dev, good ideas are not recognized and visionary changes are too much for them to get passed through the CIO chain and massive beaurocracy. Get used to the same people on the business side being recognized every single meeting. Its embarrassing at this point. With the market picking up I see lots of resignations on the horizon."
11,Albridge Solutions,Used to be a great place to work,2015-01-28,2.0,,"There are still some very intelligent, hard-working people, though fewer and fewer as time goes on. Competitive pay for the location.","Too many of the people mentioned above are doing all the work, while others sit around and collect paychecks. Senior management plays favorites and doesn't really know what's going on in the trenches. The culture seems to be moving away from getting stuff done and more about making it look like you're doing something. 
CEO has a very high opinion of himself and doesn't have much time for the ones doing the heavy lifting, regardless of where his office is."
12,Albridge Solutions,An example of a good company acquired that becomes bad.,2014-08-07,2.0,Product Manager,"Holiday and Summer parties are fun.  Although there have been several layoffs, they are not significant nor frequent.","The company changed culture with the change in leadership.  I understand times change, but there are way too many managers and not enough workers.  Turnover in the past two years for employees 5 years and over was amazingly high.  John Brett, the CEO, doesn't even sit on site.  He's an absentee landlord."
13,Albridge Solutions,Mediocrity defined,2014-06-23,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Pay and benefits quite good for central New Jersey.  Work life balance average for the financial services industry.,"Corporate leadership focuses on cost cutting rather than innovative new products.  Senior contributors who really know the product are often treated like children rather than trusted partners. Innovation is held to a select few, and few dare challenge senior management on choices that have been made as far as outsourcing models and technology."
14,Albridge Solutions,So much potential thrown away,2014-06-03,2.0,Anonymous Employee,The pay and benefits are very good for the Lawrenceville area.  The CIO is smart and knows the business.  Still some great people left on the front lines despite high levels of attrition over the past 2+ years.,"Budgets are always tight due to BNY not doing well in this interest rate environment.  Many positions have been lost due to attrition.  The rare spot you can try to fill will take 3-6 months to fill, if they get filled at all, and when you do get it filled it will be with a more junior person than who you are replacing.  While front line managers and senior management try to find navigate a tough environment, the middle management cadre actively destroys their efforts.  Middle management seems to only care about shining the spotlight on themselves and playing corporate politics. Product quality and consistency goes down the tubes while they play their games.  Work life balance is very poor, expect over time and weekends constantly. If you are in technology expect many 7 and 8am meetings with offshore development.  The offshore model is very poor and attracts only the bottom rung of talent in their Indian offices, which just adds to the onshore technology burden.  Few growth opportunities are available for your career, expect to be stuck in your level for many years."
15,Albridge Solutions,Good place to work,2014-03-24,3.0,,"Competitive pay and benefits
Flexible work - work remote when necessary
Good product; opportunity to learn technology and business",New management and company future direction unclear
16,Albridge Solutions,Albridge experience,2013-12-23,2.0,,Some flexibility and working remote options,"Too much politics, too much work and very few people to actually do the work. Mid level Managers are not at all helpful."
17,Albridge Solutions,People keep blaming it on the acquisition but that isn't the full truth.,2013-06-28,2.0,Analyst,The people on the ground floor are great as well as SOME managers.,"Unbelieveable amount of politics and backroom shady deals for employees they deem ""worthy"" which is hysterical because those same employees are the ones leaving the company.    Promises about compensation rarely if ever kept.  Some teams are horrendously overworked with no backfills in sight for the people that have left.  Exceptionally high amount of turnover in all business units with the expectation that work can just shuffle around as needed."
18,Albridge Solutions,Used to be a great product... great company but all good things come to an end,2013-05-29,2.0,Analyst,The people are smart and professional.   Some large clients have remained loyal in spite of service delivery issues.   Good benefits outside of compensation which increases at a snail pace. Worklife balance is good.,The bureaucracy has taken its toll.  The things that kept employees happy are no longer there and the future of the company under BNYM Management remains to be unstable because of the lack of morale. Turnover rates are increasing.
19,Albridge Solutions,General review of the company,2012-11-14,1.0,Software Engineer,"Good work life balance

Generally speaking there is rarely crazy working hours. Most likely you can have a regular based work hours.","Poor moral and poor work ethic of the management.
Out of date technologies."
