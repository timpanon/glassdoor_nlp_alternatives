1,Aleutian Capital Partners,Boutique IB Analyst,2019-11-19,5.0,Investment Banking Analyst,Small team so you get a lot of exposure to deals.  You also get to work on many different industries.  The firm seems to be growing various aspects of the business which is exciting to see.,Pretty long hours which are standard for the industry.
2,Aleutian Capital Partners,Not on Top of their Stuffs,2019-05-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The view and some of the co-workers are nice.
Get to learn about M&A transaction","There are so many cons I don’t know where to begin.
-	Management team does not keep track of what they say when they want you to do work or any meetings they want with you
-	Whenever you greet someone there such as good morning or hello, they would greet you on the first day. But after that, they ignore you like you don’t exist.
-	You MUST eat lunch at your desk due to call and no set lunch break
-	Sometime there are times where there are no work for you to do and when you ask, they’ll say “work will be available later” which really means nothing. They also give work right before you leave so you have to finish  before you go.
- Long hours yet little workload so what the point of coming in so early when I can use that time to get an extra hour of sleep"

4,Aleutian Capital Partners,Great place to start a career,2019-02-26,4.0,Analyst,"This is a nice place to start a career in banking and learn about the industry especially if this is for you or not. There is a lot to learn about all industries, whether you like it or not. I definitely enjoyed the learning aspect and the industry exposure.  The people were also nice. Compensation is great if you work hard and are ""in"" otherwise you are screwed.","The firm is very lean and although there is a lot to learn, it definitely will not be a fit if you are not intense like some people there who are super dedicated. It is inspiring, but not sustainable in the long term, and especially if you want work life balance. Also you have to do so much on your own without guidance, or if you are open to asking and not afraid, go ahead. Compensation is unfair unless you ask and negotiate and argue."
