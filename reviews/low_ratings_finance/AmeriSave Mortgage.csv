0,AmeriSave Mortgage,This Place Will Suck The Meat Off Your Bones And Toss You In The Trash Like A Chicken Wing,2022-04-04,1.0,Analyst,"Remote, but at what cost?","This company does not care at all about your wellbeing. I was given a big raise at my review and let go almost immediately after for the sake of outsourcing mine and my entire department’s job to a company in another country.

The employees here are in constant rotation with entire departments being cut or outsourced on a whim, and the new replacements brought in have absolutely no idea what they are doing and are terrible at trying to keep to regulation standards for a company giving mortgage loans to people. 

Everything is constantly backed up and full of errors, and any attempt to correct them is met with the heaviest pushback from other departments you can imagine. 

If you work here I promise you will bot be trained adequately, and even if you are you will log in to work one day just to find out you’re being cut in some mass downsizing effort to balance out the fact that this company is drowning because of it’s horrendous customer service and incapability of training its employees to do their job correctly and efficiently.

I fear for them in the event of an audit. I know they have been attempting to make thousands of old loans sitting dead in their system disappear so they don’t face hellish consequences for their negligence."

3,AmeriSave Mortgage,BEWARE: They talk big and run you into the ground,2022-04-01,1.0,Junior Underwriter,"Work from home

Production bonuses

Limited customer interaction

Low threshold to entry.","Gaslighting (Changing rules very suddenly, and then berating you as though you should've known all along)

Last-minute ""mandatory overtime"", often times 10-15 hours a week

Sudden, unexpected layoffs (I was hired in a mass hire and then laid off 9 mos later, despite the fact they said that I was doing a great job)

EXTREMELY anal about ""productivity"", but half the work you do doesn't track on their broken productivity monitoring program."
4,AmeriSave Mortgage,walk away,2022-03-30,1.0,Mortgage Originator,not much pros to list,"be careful, they will change the source of the lead, to pay less."
5,AmeriSave Mortgage,Not great,2022-03-30,1.0,Remote Loan Officer,"Started in 2020 on the operations side of the business. Because they overhired they had about 1000-2000 randomly selected to move over to the sales side and then were provided an ultimatum take the position or be without a job. We were made to interview, take the NMLS test, and if at any point we didnt pass the last step we were let go from the company - keep in mind that this was all happening during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays and any vacation time we were suppose to be allotted or used up during that time was cancelled and lost. 

After passing and receiving our mortgage licenses, training on actual sales wass the next part. This is by far the most difficult thing to do especially when the majority of those transferred had never worked in sales in their lives. And managers selected had never been managers before and were really only chosen through nepotism since they knew or previously worked with those hiring or because they were number 1 in their former employer as a sales agent. But they had no ability or experience in training others how to do their work. 

Employees were constantly being let go or just burning out and quitting. Or were given a 3-6 month performance evaluation and told if they didn't produce more sales the following month they would be let go - but that didnt matter those who reached those goals were still let go. Even managers, some teams went through 2-3 managers within a 3 month period. Those managers who were once the peak of sales were now leaving or returning to their former position due to the additional stresses of learning to become managers.","Overall the sales side is not a great fit for those who have never worked in sales. But if it is your chosen profession, then go for it. 

Pay structure was ok - its fully commissioned now with draw, when we were there it was a base hourly + bonus + commissions. 

Benefits are decent but a bit pricey. 

Make sure to be in the top 10% otherwise be looking for other work."

- Company continues to invest significantly in technology
- Supportive management/leadership","- AmeriSave is struggling to adapt to the current market and making the shift from a refinance lender to a purchase lender
- Sales Managers are stretched too thin and don't have the bandwidth to adequately support Loan Officers
- The lead system is very inconsistent...quality leads are few and far between
- The turnover is unlike anything I've ever experienced...at all levels"

My team leads were some of the kindest, most helpful people I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with.","Pretty much everything else. Management is very inexperienced and clearly in over their heads. 

Constant mass layoffs based on a metric system which they admit isn’t accurate whatsoever. Accrued PTO is not paid out once you are let go. Many positions are now being outsourced to India.

Promises for growth/promotion opportunities which never came.

The system is terrible, outdated and crashes multiple times per day, yet they refuse to invest money to update it."

15,AmeriSave Mortgage,Worst Company,2022-03-21,1.0,Mortgage Loan Officer,None. I did not see anything from this company to add to my knowledge or expertise.,"Worst company I ever worked for. They lie to you about how they are growing and looking for Loan Officers to join their mission with opportunities to move up in the company. They make you work 12+ hours a day and expect you to work weekends as well. You mostly receive leads from those who pulled their credit with other lenders and you are expected to change their minds to work with AmeriSave. You are constantly evaluated and managed with meetings and reports throughout the day. After just a few months, if you don't meet their unrealistic expectation, they let you go. The compensation plan is weak."
16,AmeriSave Mortgage,Poorly run,2022-03-20,2.0,Loan Officer,They kind of leave you to your own devices,"No training, no help, no one to talk to or ask questions"
17,AmeriSave Mortgage,Okay company,2022-03-19,2.0,Warehouser,"Work schedule, bonus pay, time off",There is no real job stability. This company has multiple layoffs a year. Unprofessional work culture. If you don't fraternize with your co-workers you will be shunned.
18,AmeriSave Mortgage,"Layoffs, poor communication and the bottom line.",2022-03-18,2.0,Junior Underwriter,AmeriSave will give chances to people without prior experience to train them up. Compensation is decent but not great. Lower and middle level management is usually fantastic (at least for the Junior Underwriter roles.) Work life balance is ok for Junior Underwriters (WFH / flexible hours.),"AmeriSave’s upper management simply does not care about its hard working employees on the frontline. This company is what some would call a refinance “chop-shop” and will lay anyone off at anytime if they deem it hurts their bottom line. Very sad, because the people they hired in Junior Underwriting to begin with were almost all laid off for overseas workers that do not give the same effort or quality of work, but the bottom line is the only thing that matters to upper management making these decisions. The worst thing about the layoffs is that upper management who hired everyone doesn’t take the time of day to let them know themselves. It’s on lower management to tell good workers that they’re being let go. Job security is abysmal at AmeriSave. Compensation is quickly falling behind and there doesn’t seem to be any plans of ever catching it back up with the current industry. No raises for Junior Underwriters so expect your pay to be static. Poor communication from upper management on just about every subject. Lots of issues relating to this between lower and middle level management because there is never any clear path given from upper management on the future of the company. Never once received any sort of mass communication or info from the CEO. Felt like he doesn’t even work at the company. Overall AmeriSave is one of the companies that puts on a good face for LinkedIn or other sites, but in reality the core is rotten. I would suggest really asking these tough questions if you ever interview to see what your perspective department might be like."
19,AmeriSave Mortgage,Do not work here,2022-03-17,1.0,Team Lead,Having the ability to work from home,"Every bad review is true. Positions are severely underpaid, management does not care about their employees (coming from someone who was in management) and turnover is crazy. They call them performance layoffs so they don’t have to pay severance to those who were fired. The only good department is with IT and data analytics. Any other position is not good for a long term position, since you will have no opportunity to move up. (And if you do, you could be demoted when layoffs happen)"
20,AmeriSave Mortgage,Great Culture,2022-03-17,5.0,Corporate Recruiter,"Autonomous, hardworking team, helpful management.",Benefits could be better but still works for my lifestyle.
21,AmeriSave Mortgage,My experience at Amerisave,2022-03-17,3.0,Loan Processor,Working as a processor was an enjoyable job. Working from home was a great plus and the pay was better than expected (for the first 6 months). Co-workers and managers were helpful and willing to take time to address specific problems. Most work items or loans were easy to close in the first 6 months. The system you work in is incredible and the tech the company runs is top notch. Great benefits and PTO.,"Was laid off based on a random cut and not performance. Went through 6 managers in less than a year, each having different styles of management but all were overall good and reasonable. Underwriting/closing from the outsourced positions is a joke and difficult to communicate problems and solutions. my last 6 months each loan was a crap shoot whether it would close because of MLO's and borrowers fabricating numbers to approve the loan. Pipeline went from 70+ in the first few months to barley over 30 in the latter 6 months. Upper management changing commission seemingly randomly and unfairly."
22,AmeriSave Mortgage,Great for anyone who is breaking into the mortgage industry,2022-03-16,4.0,Licensed Mortgage Loan Originator,"Great Training, Pays for licensing, uncapped compensation",no manager support - a lot of people in 1 team that is too much for a manager to handle. Managers often are focusing on the newer recruits.
23,AmeriSave Mortgage,Great culture,2022-03-14,5.0,Full Stack Developer,"Working with great people, fully remote, business cares and shows appreciation to employees, lots of opportunity to learn and grow.","Onboarding is a little hard, but I don't blame them since they're fully remote and hiring so many people. They've made significant improvements even since I've started and they truly try to make your experience the best possible. I was forced by Glassdoor to list a con and this was the best I could come up with. I really love working for this company."

32,AmeriSave Mortgage,Sold a dream,2022-03-07,1.0,MOrtgage Loan Originator,"I was able to get my mortgage license, only thing good about this company.","Where do I start? From the very beginning we were all sold a dream of making the most money we have ever made. We were told they had the best equipment ,processing, and believe in work/life balance. Come to find out it was the exact opposite. Management expected you to work 7 days a week at least 12hrs a day. If you didn’t they would blackball you and wouldn’t help you process loans, answer questions etc. In a commission based role we would only get paid when the loans funded. Management didn’t care to help you with questions on your pipeline, they only cared about new business. The phone systems crashed about 5 times a day and they expect you to use your personal cell to call clients. The expectations are just plain out unrealistic! Their philosophy is “this is a what have you done for me lately business” if you have 1 bad month they will let you go! Being on the same team for over a year, I’ve seen over 60 LO’s get fired. They will hire another group of 100 and weed them out. There’s absolutely no job security at this place."
33,AmeriSave Mortgage,The worst Mortgage Co. in the industry,2022-03-05,1.0,MOrtgage Loan Originator,Training. free. $10 / hour salary limited.,LOWEST RATED ON GLASS DOOR AT 2.6. Manager held zoom meetings in a ball cap and tee shirt...sometime with food stains on it. Liked to send out carton memes as motivation which I found childish. Dropped the F Bomb several times on calls to the zoom team. About 85% turnover rate. 60 hours per week were the norm. High stress. Personal life was not any concern. Actually all but one person I encountered internally showed class. .
34,AmeriSave Mortgage,Amerislave,2022-03-04,1.0,Loan Officer,If you have no life outside of work you might be able to make a livable wage,"You’re paid when your loan closes which isn’t a problem but when all management wants you to do is simply focus on front end business all day and completely disregard your pipeline then how are you supposed to make money? Phone systems are terrible, and they falsely have promised to fix it throughout my duration with the company. It was never resolved. Management has their head in the clouds when it comes to expectations/goals and being forced to work 7 days a week is not a solution. No type of work/life balance. Processing is non existent you as the LO will be more knowledgeable as to what docs are needed more so than a processor. They sell you a pipe dream and then you realize nothing they said early on is remotely possible even with them pushing you to work 15hr days."
35,AmeriSave Mortgage,Trash,2022-03-04,1.0,Loan Analyst,"None, literally none. Do not work here","Pay is trash in every dept
No one has been there a long time besides management of like 3 people. 
People are constantly being let go in large groups. They moved our dept without telling us, then outsourced our old work, then moved us to another dept where we received no pay raise for the changes. Then they let go of half of the dept right before Xmas & the other half of us in January. Management is all fake and constantly make up lies, are very rude to their employees and customers

Very difficult to actually close a loan and that’s 100% what your pay is based off of. Over promised and wayyyy under delivered
46,AmeriSave Mortgage,The work environment is not inclusive and respectful of all people,2022-02-25,1.0,Junior Underwriter,I really cannot offer any pros at this time,"I am in my 60s and was the token senior aged employee at the company until my termination on 2/16. My termination is suspect since I filed a lawsuit 8 weeks earlier for ageism, age discrimination and a hostile work environment. Whistleblower retaliation is very illegal. It was very bad for me there and I did not make the charge lightly. In addition, I recently lost my husband to Covid. Those at Amerisave were aware of this and this knowledge was weaponized against me. The moral of the story is-if they are not going to look out for someone like me that has federal protections in place. They are most certainly not going to look out for you. Hold out for the employer that has both empathy and offers an inclusive workplace. Your dignity is just as important as the paycheck. I am hoping my lawsuit will shed light on what goes on behind the scenes in a meaningful way. I hope it inspires Amerisave to clean house and rid themselves of the managers and team leads that cross the line on a daily basis. I hope it inspires mandatory bias and sensitivity training for all leadership."
47,AmeriSave Mortgage,DO NOT WORK HERE,2022-02-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,You can work from home if that is your thing.,"Don’t work here if you value your self worth. You will not get trained, you will get a bunch of “resources” given to you to figure everything out yourself. Not to mention leadership does not have time for you, if you ask a question it won’t get answered. They have also been firing all of the people who work domestically so they can outsource 90% of the jobs for sole reason of having to pay the cheapest labor possible. That also attributes to the monthly cuts where they will fire you at random with no warning. The people who run this company have no morals. They will fire you and replace you in an outsourced person instant. I have no doubt in my mind that this company will not last. Amerisave barely has anyone working for them from America, even the name of the company isn’t realistic."

49,AmeriSave Mortgage,Horrible management with zero  work/life balance,2022-02-23,1.0,Mortgage Loan Officer,"pay was fair, but not worth the squeeze","They have extremely high turn over because they expect LO to work 9:00AM-10:00PM everyday, if you need off for anything managment gives you a hard time. Mandatory Saturday's even after regular long work weeks. Several managers are only 25 years old and are not emotionally mature enough to be leaders, and often coach LO's to pressure borrower to lock today with basically bait and switch method's over promise and under deliver, or explain later why loan details have changed. Culture feels like a frat house, office is full of bro's with sports center on all day."
50,AmeriSave Mortgage,Toxic Workplace,2022-02-18,1.0,Junior Underwriter,Working from home is great,"Promised so many things, almost 2 years here and nothing has been given.

51,AmeriSave Mortgage,Don’t care about their employees,2022-02-17,2.0,Mortgage Underwriter,They have their own sort of system which reviews some documents for you which is helpful.,"They don’t care about their employees. They will hire you on at a minimal salary with “commission” incentive based on how many files you underwrite and different types of loans (conventional, FHA, VA, etc) receive different rates for the commission. However, when I was there, I was hired on at a certain rate/file and within a year they made everyone sign a new “compensation” form as they lowered the commission/file which ended up costing me approximately $400/mo in income. Additionally, they do not have annual reviews and this no annual raises and they don’t even match 401k. It’s pretty frustrating when you’re on a call and they are telling you “we had our best month yet” over and over yet no raises and benefits were very minimal."

If you have doctors appointments, even with a doctor excuse you will get written up. 

You are required to put in an additional two hours per day , after your shift. 


You are required to do this between the hours of 7-11 p.m. central time, then go back into work the next morning between 7-8 a.m. central time. 

Training is terrible, no continued education.

They keep changing the pay structure. 


They promise to move you up, and this never happens. 

Management is shady. 

If you have any questions that you need help with good luck getting the answer. 

They tell you, you are doing outbound calls (100) a day, that was a lie, we have taking 1000 a day! 

Customers are lied to about the different types of loans we offer. 

Customers are also lied to about the application refund of $500.00 dollars. They owe so many applicants a refund, and still have not delivered this. 

Zoom meetings are terrible! No structure at all, so they force you to play stupid kid games. 

Their remote server constantly shuts down, and you are held accountable for their systems messing up, in turn this brings your system time down. They will write you up for this, which in turn brings your pay down. 

They are constantly changing your pay! You are promised $20 an hour then, they find ways to punish you bringing your pay down to $15.00 an hour."

This is definitely a great place to get started in this line of work. I’d recommend it to anyone newly licensed. PTO, leads provided, CRM is better than most places and benefits are good. Base pay and overtime is rare in this line of work so it’s nice that it’s provided, however it comes at a price.","10+hour days, plus half a day on Saturday if you don’t meet quota each week. Granted, the quota isn’t necessarily unreasonable, they change it each week, but if you’re in a slump, forget about a personal life. At times, it’s unrealistic. 

It’s not required, yet somehow expected that you’ll work more than the 10hr shift each day. If you have a family, it’s tough to be at this company long term. You won’t be able to have dinner before 7pm, you won’t be able to get your kids to and from school, you won’t be able to attend their extra curricular activities. Etc. granted, if you’re a top producer, and you’re numbers are good for the week, your direct manager will usually cut you a little slack when it comes to family. If you’re average, good luck. Have a serious conversation with your SO before accepting this job. 

Extremely, almost insultingly low commission. The base pay and overtime is nice, but for what is expected of their employees, the comp plan should be reevaluated. Granted myself and plenty others have earned well here, but with the market slowing down, rates going up, and again, the work life balance being non existent, we deserve more in commission."
92,AmeriSave Mortgage,Unethical company,2022-01-20,1.0,MOrtgage Loan Originator,Great rates and cost compared to other large lenders.,"This company is almost as unethical as GoDaddy when I worked there. Today I resigned after finding out there there were a few waves of mass layoffs in processing. I had been wondering why all my files got assigned new processors, then the new ones disappearing from the company two days after being assigned. Turns out there was a bunch of people laid off. My VP thought an acceptable answer was “we make cuts as the need for their position becomes less”. That’s not a good enough answer for me. I find it odd that the underwriters are in India and hardly speak clear English, while extremely helpful processors are being let go. It leads me to believe that the company has a plan to start outsourcing the processors like they do the underwriters. It’s ridiculous that it takes 60+ days to close a refi for a client who’s on social security and has great credit with literally NOTHING making the file difficult to close. The problem is poor communication between underwriting and LO’s. When I say poor communication, I mean that it is very obvious that English is not their first language and they are clearly using google translate just to send an 8 word email out. I’ve had files suspended because an underwriter ran DU/LP and didn’t understand the error. I have had loans denied for income I’m final sign off when they could’ve reached out to me to restructure the loan. No one knows what they’re doing except for the people in sales ironically. It’s disgusting to me that not even the CEO of the company, or my direct leader even acknowledged or addressed the mass layoffs that happened within the last week. I know the door is always open for me there considering I was a top producer only being there for 2 months, but I will never work there again. I would rather shovel snow for $5 an hour than work for a terrible and unethical company like AmeriSave."

You HAVE to be in the dialer for dealing with inbound and outbound calls.

Our manager is on Teams calling people out who are not In Ready Time on a consistent basis.  We are adults, not children!

Leads are scarce too.  No fresh leads, recycled!

If you happen to get a lead, chances are that qualifying is not possible.  You have to try and snatch whatever you can receive.

And to top it all off…IF you do not get either 2 credit pulls OR a sold loan, you have to work up to 2 additional hours, no exceptions!  Where’s the work/life balance??

There’s about 100 plus LOs in the area I work in.  About less than 40 locks a day!  The rest that doesn’t lock, we have to hear that we don’t take advantage of the “opportunities” on a day to day basis!

Of course, my manager and his up line always reminds us, we’re here to help.  We are working with you during bonus time…lol

I addressed the fact that the leads a recycled 18 ways to Sunday up the chain.  The leads are not the problem, it’s our “attitude” lol!  Furthermore, I was told if I don’t like it, make up my mind to decide if I want to make the effort to adapt or do what I have to do.

The consensus is that “it is what it is!”  My recruiter hasn’t had the decency to follow up with me when I voiced my concerns.

It won’t matter, but “It’s the leads, stupid”    Clearly people are here to consult with borrowers and earn accordingly.  How leadership can best help are providing better lead opportunities as opposed to recycled leads that hang up or the call drops.

It’s a turnover environment.  Those who stick and can somehow muddle through and make it happen will be fine.  Otherwise, after that forgivable period, if you are not producing, you will probably be sacked and they will burn through more recruits."

There have been at least 5 down-sizings in the last 15 months. Job security is non-existent. Company hired third country nationals to perform the junior underwriting tasks and told the remaining US workforce that they were ""safe"" as the foreign workers would be used to upsize and downsize as needed. This was a fabrication. 

Had set hours to work, but others would log in at off hours and pull the available loans so there were no loans available during the work hours that I was assigned to. Loss of loan completions led to layoffs. Everything is metric driven. Which I understand, but if there are no loans, then other things need to be taken in to consideration."

2. Directors don’t care about helping someone who has questions if it doesn’t pertain to a loan that’s being sold
3. Recruiters say they pay on 40 BPS, however after finding out after being hired there are more ways to get paid and it’s incredibly less and more frequent your loans

It's pushed you do so many documents per day. Add documents and work for no raise. Work tons of overtime which is a nice paycheck but sometimes the overtime is mandatory (20 hours). Do all that work and get no bonus. You just get emails about how good the company is doing, how much money they made, etc, but don't expect a raise.
Over all its stressful and you will be stuck at the same pay forever. Even when you go to being a team lead you get offered a dollar more,but you will be doing the work of multiple people. Not worth it.

Paid training and licensing that can be transferred to other companies.,"Everything. Systems and sales training was minimal and awful, demands were high and ridiculous. Overly competitive amongst staff, internal communication could be condescending and downright insulting, they cut our pay twice while I was there and then increased demand, systems constantly crashing. If you work for a place where your boss tells you that you need to start smoking weed or drinking in order to cope you know it's not a healthy place to work. This place sent me into a spiral of depression, anxiety and self harm. ""Remote work"" but you have no life. They claim family first, but don't give you any time off or leniency to actually care for your family or yourself. You're required to be chained to a phone for an average of 10 hours a day, without pay -- commission only. If you don't make their ridiculous quota by the end of the week you are required to work all weekends. This place is an assembly-line prison. I did recommend this place to a friend when I first started, but still cautioned them about the stress. After I left and they stayed it got even worse across the board. AS laid off all US processors to outsource to India who were ultimately unresponsive and difficult to work with for both MLO's and clients. Many clients were lost simply because of the horrible process. They'll take anyone with a pulse since their training is so terrible, everyone is replaceable. Your soul is worth more than this place."

Insurance benefits available immediately upon hiring.,"Most middle management are not qualified to be in the positions they are and none of upper management apparently went to business school because none of them seem to know what they were doing. There is constant miscommunication between the departments and it creates a hostile work environment despite everything being remote. As long as you are on the good side of your team lead the job isn’t that hard but the departments lack of direction makes trying to do your job frustrating as they are constantly rewriting the rules and expect  you to have a crystal ball to see into the future of what they’re thinking. Mandatory OT of 5 hours a week was the Outlook for the foreseeable future. Expect to be looked down upon by both the Senior Underwriters and the mortgage sales department and expect to do half of the work of the outsourced workers since they hired them without having systems in place to do their jobs properly. Be prepared to be told not share your salary information with the outsourced members on your team so they don’t see that they are being grossly underpaid.  Overall the cons definitely outweigh the pros. If you desperately need a job, take it, but keep actively looking because they will throw you out on the street without a care.

193,AmeriSave Mortgage,An honest review,2021-09-13,1.0,MOrtgage Loan Originator,"If you are an experienced loan officer, this is not the place for you. You will be much happier elsewhere.
If you are new to the industry, Amerisave will get you licensed through the NMLS, assuming you pass the test after their training course. They will train you to sell loans. You have the opportunity to make money.","The cons, unfortunately, are lengthy. You will be expected to have a minimum 45 hour week during the regular week and a minimum of 3 hours each Saturday or Sunday. And that is the minimum. So if you usually eat dinner with your family, go out for happy hour with your friends, or have any type of life outside of work, you can plan on waving that goodbye. Unless your family and friends will wait until after 8 pm for dinner or happy hour. Hours on the weekend are a mandatory 11-2, so if you had plans of going anywhere, those are gone as well. If working 50+ hours per week is your thing, this is the place for you.
Of those 50 hours a week, you will spend a minimum of 38 hours telemarketing. Your call blocks from from 9-noon and 2-6 pm on weekdays, 11-2 on the weekends. Pure telemarketing. If you sell a loan, the only time you will have to work on it, to ensure it closes and you get paid, will be for an hour between noon and 2 pm (assuming you actually take lunch during that period as well) and after 6 pm (except processing and underwriting have left for the day, so nothing will actually get done).
Service is not the priority here. Do not expect referrals from clients because you'll never really talk to them again after the loan is underway. 
Processing and underwriting are horrible (which, unfortunately, you do need if you want the loan to close). They will constantly miss deadlines, loans will stretch out for weeks at a time unless it is the simplest of files. This could also be due to the fact you're not really allowed to work on your files most of the day. Purchases will consistently not be ready by closing date, drawing the ire of the borrower, their realtor, the seller and their realtor. Again, you can kiss referrals goodbye. Amerisave's solution is to just get back on the phones and find someone else.
Management, despite their empty words, is not there to help you in the least. They will not teach you to get better at selling loans, tips on clearing conditions on your files in order for them to close, etc. They will only be concerned with how many hours you were in the dialer. There is zero room for flexibility. Micromanagement is extensive.

Again, if this is your cup of tea, then Amerisave is the place for you."

You are disposable to them and they don’t even try to hide it. I work in management and am forced to do crappy things all the time- such as make employees work OT at the last minute, give write ups for performance although I have no time to get their performance up as I’ve been given a ridiculous task to do on top of the rest of my actual job title.

Very low comp compared to industry averages per loan, and most of the underwriting is outsourced to Jr. UW's who don't know what they're doing, meaning you'll have to do their job for them most of the time or they'll kill a good loan (there's a few good ones). Very little training/support, if you need help expect to wait a few days for your manager to get back to you, if they do at all.

They laid off about 20% of the domestic staff in my department and replaced them with outsourced people that they pay $5/hr. When they realized the outsourced people wouldn’t actually be able to process the loans (about 1-2 months after the layoff) due to lack of understanding as a result of English not being their dominant language, they scrambled/are scrambling.

I had a great manager and team lead as well therefore I had a good experience until I was suddenly cut. Your experience there will be determined by your manager.,"They had 5 big mass layoffs in underwriting in the year that I worked there. I got cut on the 5th one. Now they are hiring new employees like they didn’t just lay of 70% of the underwriting staff. You are disposable. I was told I was doing great and 4 days later I was cut with no severance package. I liked working here but going into work and not knowing if I would have a job by the end of the day was stressful. They also track the time you are on the server. If your time card to activity ratio was low even when loans were not coming in, you had to have an excuse why. There is really no guidance or direction on how you are doing here. There is also no 401K match and you are not eligible to start a 401K until you are 6 months in."

This was my first job out of college and the training was top notch and I was able to become a loan officer in just a short few months. If you are not a good loan officer and don’t write loans, yes you will be let go but they obviously give you time and space to develop especially at first. You are really thrown into a water full of sharks and there is definitely a learning curve at first that will leave you overwhelmed. You are expected to learn on your own and adapt. I was able to pick up pretty quickly but I did struggle for sure at first that lead to mistakes being made but it is really a make a mistake and learn from it kind of deal. Get past this part and the job becomes actually incredibly straight forward and easy. I would say the most trifling part is dealing with people and doing the work on the back end of your loan to see it through.","Not necessarily long hours but you have to be working weird hours to accommodate people’s time zones

235,AmeriSave Mortgage,Sub-Average Job with a Revolving Door,2021-08-10,2.0,Junior Underwriter,"-Decent pay for the work. Started with a solid commission structure and hourly rate. It was $19.23 an hour and you could usually get that up to around $30 after commission. However, this was short-lived and the commission got worse and worse each week.
-Some nice people (really depends on your team)
-Remote work
-Mostly low-stress work. This kind of depends on the module you are in, some are stress-free others are higher stress. Also depends on your manager, all of mine were solid, but I ran into a few from other teams that were extremely rude and arrogant. 
-Gave good opportunities to advance. I saw a lot of people get promoted within the remote department, or get different opportunities. However, they were sure to remind us that the whole department was an experiment and could be shut down at any time.\
-The firings were largely performance-based. However, towards the end of my employment, it seemed to be more of an overstaffing issue. When they let me go they stated it was because they did not have enough work.","-The company has a revolving door, a lot of people being hired and being let go. My hiring class was huge and there were several others to follow. They ran out of work for how many they hired and were suggesting some to switch to another company, transfer departments, or be let go. 
-Very poor training, kind of just throw you in and expect you to learn
-Was a brand new department so there were big changes often. I was promoted one weak and transferred/demoted a month later because they promoted too many people.
-Hired far too many people and promised them things they could not deliver. They pitched it as each of us would be given experience in each module and then become full-time underwriters. It was obvious they could not deliver because they hired so many people, sure enough, I worked in the same module for the entire 8 months I was there and left with almost no transferable skills within the mortgage industry.

Not many people in the company have ever worked in the Mortgage industry and it shows when you have to work with someone working a different part of the loan. There is zero company culture even though the company constantly posts about how good it is. Managers only reach out to their teams really when there is a problem. Be prepared to get daily emails from people asking for things when the answers are right in front of them but they don't want to take the time to look. This position is very underappreciated and undervalued and this is the main reason they will eventually loose all their best workers to companies that appreciate their work and compensate accordingly. Also, hired with the promise of being trained to be a full UW within a year but after almost that time, have yet to be trained in any other areas. When asked about this, managers stated that they don't need more UWs, and this promise was made to the Jr UWs when there were 5x the number of us.

A large number of people was hired at once. Amerisave promoted people to management that were not ready. Different teams received different information on how to complete tasks. There was a lot of deceit being talked about between teams.
Every employee was to meet certain quota but there was not enough work to go around. Many of the team members would beg their managers for work (they could assign work to individuals). 
Just as there was a mass hiring event, there was a mass firing event. For some of those that weren't fired, they were offered lower paying titles (same work plus more responsibilities) or they were forced out."

The team supervisors (AR) and team leads are great! Mine truly was amazing and I will always remember her for being so helpful and encouraging during my time there. My team also was so helpful whenever we didn’t understand how to handle something, they were always open to helping. I got accepted into law school and after my six months of working here, I changed my career to apply for business school and I got in! This company is always changing, you get to learn something new all the time especially if you aren’t a homeowner yet.","Upper management does not care about their employees. They truly look at their employees as disposable. Please do not read these bad reviews and think they are lying. Although, this could be a good place to work, the problem is their lack of moral. They have no morals and you can tell on the employee and customer side. Just look at the reviews. This company honestly needs to be sued, because their actions are heinous. They mass hire and mass fire and will not give your any notice. You will just get a call one day and you will be on the spot locked out of their systems. They are doing this because they are outsourcing from India. So, even if you are doing a good job it doesn’t matter because they are looking for the cheapest labor possible. Please do not believe the HR message responding to each review because they block your email once you email the HR email. On the day to day, their systems don’t really work so they crash constantly. They are always running out of loans, but will still use their quotas to fire you. Upper management never talks to anyone below a certain pay grade, so they never build a real connection to anyone. They will add new things to your job description, without changing your pay. They also don’t match 401k and their health insurance is expensive.

297,AmeriSave Mortgage,Not worth your time!,2021-06-13,1.0,Mortgage Loan Officer,You meet good LO’s like yourself who are all trying to help each other because management won’t! The pay is okay if you sell the right leads.,"There is no work life balance. You will be told to work from 10-8. But your morning meeting is at 9 and they expect you to have a deal before the meeting begins and will pressure you into logging on at 8. If you have the quota they will say you’re not committed and try to guilt you into working later and almost always they will make you saturdays. Your manager will have favorites, usually the pretty girl on your team and will never answer your questions. You stop learning after training because there will be no manager to help you. The system crashes every single day, the leads are awful and you will be talking to someone who already refinanced or has been called by Amerisave 20 times before. If by the off chance you do get someone on the line they usually have a sub 500 credit score. And just wait til you actually sell loans but they don’t pay you because it was a “self serve” lead. It’s astounding how they can not pay you commissions because it’s a certain type of lead. Then when you stop taking those leads obviously you’re going to get written up. 

 There is a complete lack of communication I had my managers switch twice with nobody ever saying a word as to why or where they went. Of course, after word gets around you hear they stepped down. 

The culture is like a frat house, a bunch of egotistical college drop outs who are obsessed with money, partying, drugs, and stepping on whoever to get a higher position. I’ve never experienced anything like it in my life. You wake up everyday not knowing if you’ll have a job by the end of the week and even if your numbers are there at any moment they will let you go to bring in the next batch of 19yr old kids wanting the 500k a year dream they sell you."

The only constant in your schedule is your shift start time. 

Managers are constantly changing the metrics that are tracked/your daily requirements. 

It is basically an expectation that you're up in the middle of the night when all the other LOs are asleep so you can snag leads to work the next day.

304,AmeriSave Mortgage,Toxic Work Environment,2021-06-09,2.0,Mortgage Specialist,"The ability to work from home and earn a comfortable wage (where I live) was unique and exciting. The team-based environments made day-to-day operations bearable since you were surrounded with people around the same age and experience level. If you like tons of grunt work and are able to get on management's good side (with minimal interaction, you may be able to advance.","There's a lot of negatives for working with this company. Almost exclusively so. Performance is valued over employee well-being. To the point of constant ""mandatory overtime"" thrust upon you at the last minute on Friday. You must be willing to give up a lot of time, the company is careful to never incriminate themselves through the way they deal with employees.

A lot of employee health and safety rules are bent by management so that the company is not explicitly requiring you to work overtime, float around to new roles frequently, or use their complicated forms of communication. However, failure to comply will lead to a pretty swift termination. Even high performers are coaxed into believing that their coworkers were lazy and justifiably let go. Until these high performers are also let go a few months down the road.

In my specific case, it was glaringly obvious that AmeriSave intended to hire remote workers en masse during the pandemic in order to capitalize on the situation with NO intention of keeping a vast majority of employees. All the while management was adamant that this was a career opportunity and not a seasonal hiring. It's the selfish deception of ownership and management that were exposed during this time.

AmeriSave has no interest in developing 99% of employees careers. They hired en masse in order to execute a seasonal increase in sales but presented it as a career opportunity with the company. Within 10 months, 95% of the employees were ""let go due to company performance."" However, mid and upper management saw none of this downsizing. Their mindset is that hopefully out of the pack, their statistics will allow high performers to bubble up to the top.

Communication tunnels are intentionally confusing in order to keep lower-level employees' knowledge on company operations limited. This company reeks of outdated old money workplace environment where friends of friends excel, diversity only seems to apply to entry level positions, and growth is near impossible. Management are clearly self-interested and self-preserving. You are very expendable. 

If you work here, I recommend becoming very acquainted with your immediate supervisor so that you can obtain a good recommendation for your next job. That's about all you'll get out of AmeriSave."

Work the grean peas for 5-6 mo till they burn out. They micromanage you to death, and on top of that, want you to work past your already 12 hours a day shift.

My first biggest red flag was that all the managers are young, there are 2 things that come to mind with that 
A- the only people that can handle the hours are younger people
B-Turnover is so high, that only a young fool will take the opportunity. 

Also its on a tier system, so if you’re not buddy buddies with management you’re screwed. Same with the text leads where majority of the business is. I have never hated a job before. But this one is terrible. 

Long hours, terrible management style, and on top of that all the issues with IT, and having processing/underwriting hired and fired much quicker. Which slows down your loans.

They also outsourced Underwriting to india so you have people that don’t understand programs asking for pointless stuff. 

One more thing, the CSS agent transfers, the transfers are absolute hot garbage, they are paid per transfer, but also will get fired if they don’t send enough transfers either, so if they have someone with a pulse, they will send them. They will lie to customers saying they are their other bank, they can help with no down payment on a house etc(non va) or work with bad credit.

320,AmeriSave Mortgage,not a company that cares about its employees - or its customers,2021-06-02,1.0,Loan Analyst,"in my experience the management and leadership here really do try. the team leads, the manager, and even the avp all try very hard to be there, go to bat for, and support their employees. it is painfully obvious that their goals are not shared by upper management because they are not empowered in the least by those executives to do so and when that's the case, even the best of intentions really end up not mattering so much. i know no one at any level that actually *is* empowered to create meaningful change cares about these reviews, but i hope someone can learn from this experience by my sharing it.

other pros: data entry is generally easy, working from home is nice, relatively flexible hours.","the loan analyst department used to have roughly 250 people. for months, we had between 10-15 hours of mandatory overtime a week, the queue of documents was in the thousands daily, and there was more than plenty of work to go around. data entry is a boring job by nature but working remote is important to me and to many others for MANY reasons both personal and professional, so i ignored some pretty glaring red flags. a few examples:

•	how weird it was to have to keep refreshing a screen every three minutes like clockwork because reading guides as we were repeatedly told to do, or emailing management about questions, or searching through emails to find an answer so we didn’t repeat a question that had already been asked made it appear to the system as though we weren’t actively working. 
•	completely insufficient onboarding and training which lacked even a slight overview of the job we would be doing or what any of the documents or information we were working with meant - which maybe would have been reasonable for a job that required any experience in the field, but this one did not. 
•	the flawed matching/mismatching system that can make it look like you’re inputting things incorrectly if you’re the only one inputting something the right way and two other people input it incorrectly the same way - which negatively impacts your accuracy if not caught, which was one of the key stats used to determine whether you could keep your job or not. 
•	constant confusion and conflicting answers to questions which also negatively impacted accuracy. 
•	a huge layoff that happened last winter because i was lucky enough to make it through. 

i should have listened to my gut when we were told a third party outsourced group was being hired to alleviate some of the workload. we were all told that it was just to make our jobs easier, that we would still be able to get overtime if we wanted it, and that it was a genuinely good thing for all of us as employees. i believe that our team leads, managers, and even our avp truly thought that to be the case based on what the people above them - who were actually making those decisions and knew very well that it wasn’t the case - led and allowed them to believe. within just a month or so, there was no overtime one week and more layoffs and cuts of low performers the week that followed. some people were moved (with raises) to either customer service or to another company in which amerisave’s ceo has a financial interest. it continued that way for months. no more overtime. more cuts. the queue was hitting zero daily which i thought at first was because rates had risen and we just weren’t as busy HOWEVER, after our workday ended and before that of the outsourced group began, the queue would rise to the hundreds - and then be nearly back at zero by 9 am. there wasn’t a shortage of work, there was a lack of willingness to continue paying even the highest performing employees to do the jobs they had fought for and had been doing for years in some cases. 

we were told that the cuts should be over with and not be nervous about meetings happening anymore because everybody was in a good place and that we were all going to get trained on new things. not even a month later, our department was slashed once again from about 30 (out of the original ~250) down to between 10 and 15 people total. after rounds and rounds of cuts throughout the last six months, being told that anyone left was there for a reason because they were the “highest performing employees in the entire department“, and after even the management, team leads, and likely the assistant vice president, were led to believe that we were safe from this once again, the department was cut nearly in half. 

given the fact that this last round of cuts was reserved for those who were among the 30 highest performing employees in data entry out of an original number of 250, you would think there would be plan to potentially promote them or put them somewhere with the opportunity to earn more money than the $15.49 an hour (no performance evaluations, no raises, no bonuses) they were paid to transcribe documents – especially because the first round of cuts for the lowest performing employees even came with raises for those who were moved. not this time. those given the option to stay with the company will be given a lateral (sort of) movement opportunity to the sales support role at the same rate of pay with less flexible hours to interact directly with angry borrowers and LOs on the phone, which doesn’t seem entirely equitable. the sales support role in and of itself is one of the reasons that amerisave has so many abysmal reviews and comments on facebook and other platforms as borrowers are sick of being harassed every single day for documents to be provided that have, in a lot of cases, already been provided or are erroneously invalidated or are even lost in translation somewhere between the multiple people they pass through on *hopefully* their way to processing. 

those being moved would have likely been better off being laid off (although they would have been cheated out of any and all accrued pto) and able to claim unemployment as they looked for better jobs with more opportunities for growth and better pay than they would just being shoved off to sales support, but i assume that is precisely what amerisave was trying to avoid - why not just stick the people you don't want to pay severance or to be on unemployment in a bad role out of nowhere and hope they quit on their own? it is obvious that the company’s entire goal right now is to outsource as much of their operation as they possibly can without any regard for how it affects the lives, structure, or livelihoods of their employees because they don’t care. maybe it’s because they spent too much money on an expensive ad campaign that hasn’t yielded any higher rate of business than they were doing before, maybe it’s because word is getting around that they are not a very responsive or even a vaguely competent lender to work with, per the many people who have been robbed of the $500 deposit they paid to begin the refinance process only to find they’re unable to get in touch with their loan officers or to move the process along for SIX MONTHS in some cases, at which point the “locked in” guarantee has expired and they end up with a higher rate anyway. maybe they’re trying to save money for all of the impending lawsuits that are being threatened by both customers and the Better Business Bureau based on their dismal experiences with the company and shady practices like taking people’s money and then ghosting them like a bad date. maybe it’s so all the executives can make as much money as they possibly can before this company inevitably goes under due to their lack of ability to run a streamlined operation and their total ineptitude when it comes to dealing with their borrowers. it’s very weird to see a company that treats both the people making them money and the people giving them money so poorly.

is this just how things just work in business sometimes? yes. do they have the right to outsource this way without any regard for their employees? yes. however, had i known that this was the kind of company that i signed up to work for, i probably wouldn’t have stuck around for so long assuming that they cared enough to have a better plan for their “top performers” than to just exploit their abilities only to drag them along with false promises and let them down as they do their borrowers. i truly hope no one else makes the mistake of placing any trust in a situation like that.

tl;dr cons: rapidly outsourcing with little to no regard for consistent and high achieving employees, illusion of opportunities to advance when in reality, you have almost no job security, expensive sub par benefits, no 401k match."

Working remote with no micromanaging, getting paid a ton for fairly easy sales, and actually feeling fulfilled in and rewarded for the work I was doing, it was a dream.. until 2021 hit.","Hours were long from the start and LOs were doing work that should've been done by Processors or Underwriters. However, the extra hours and work were totally worth it for the pay. Once January hit, we got a comp decrease (even though they attempted to call it the opposite), we saw lead flow drastically drop, and the bottom 10% of Sales, etc. was let go with no warning. Needless to say, morale plummeted. Then, rates jumped and everything blew up. As an experienced LO, I no longer feel supported here nor do I feel I'm being compensated fairly - I hardly get any leads anymore and my pipeline is almost gone.

It's a group effort to understand new requirements and changes that happen all the time. Upper management promises updates that never happen. They have unrealistic goals that require you to work a ton. To maintain goals, you had to work ridiculous hours (65hr) or extra days in the week, such as Saturday and Sundays. This becomes challenging if you are caring for a family, but great for people who are independent of family expectations. Managers say they will have a one-on-one with you to help with your business, but they never do. You have to fight to get what you need. Suppose you are not bringing a ton of loans in; they will not help you as much and will drop you even if you are hitting their minimum goal. They will give you no warning of it.

Expect to work 10 hour shifts (including a 1 hour lunch break) Monday through Friday and a 4 hour shift on Saturday. The only way out of your Saturday shift was if you made 7 sales during that work week. You will be chained to your desk at this job. 

The work culture is very salesy, albeit, this being a sales position it makes sense. But you will constantly hear ""everybody finds their win"" no matter what issues you are dealing with.

Trust me when I say, go work at loandepot or any other bank/lender. This ain't it. Managers suck and drop like flies. I'm so ready to leave. They say they do price matching and then you go to your manager and they literally will spit on your face. It's almost like they don't want you to succeed.

Don't necessarily have to have mortgage experience.","Background: Recentish graduate out of school and was really excited to start a career in underwriting/real estate

Was ""let go"" along with 100s of others because Amerisave couldn't properly figure out their workload. Worked there for just under a year and was often working 55 hours two times a month. Literally, out of the blue no warning or anything was told I am no longer employed. (was working OT last month) I was in the top 1/3 of production and still got let go. It's total BS we got no warning of this and then their marketing budget has gone through the roof. Honestly have never heard of them until I was hired and now they're throwing millions on advertising during NBA games and Nascar events. (Im sure there will be a hiring surge in their future)

Management I worked with was always there for less than a year. (Red flag right there) Manager almost wrote me up because I didn't reply to a teams message within 30 minutes when the work system goes down quite often. Im sure their situation isn't much better, I actually enjoyed my first manager until they got ""promoted"" but was assigned a new one within the first 90 days. It's just very chaotic with their system/management movement. 

Never happened to me, but they will call you out in zoom meetings with 100+ people. Super unprofessional 

Benefits are not great either. Dental and health were ok for me, but im in my 20s and healthy with no history. If you have pre existing conditions it seems a little expensive. NO 401K match, by far the worst thing. You have to work 6 months and then they don't match. What exactly is the point of using your retirement system.

Training is poor. They claim their ""new"" way of working through loans is changing the industry. They will only train you to do a very specific part of a loan (verify income, verify title, employment history, etc.) and that's it. The training videos provided aren't the best and a lot of times don't properly explain what you are actually doing. It's just enough to tell you what you need to push the loan through. While they take chances on new people, it's also a con. You will work with people who don't understand PMI, loan rates, earnest money etc. Which is fine you will learn as you go, but way too many people were touching loans and messing around with THOUSANDS of loans and perhaps didn't really know what they were doing. The training probably takes you a few weeks and then they throw you into the fire with little experience. If I knew what was happening getting the loan, I would be very concerned... This was my first job in mortgage lending and Im not sure Im prepared to find a job similar to this because of how it was done at Amerisave. 

Coworkers: Kinda like I said earlier it depends on manager and people not having proper experience. Working across departments is something you never really want to look forward to. For example, if a loan originator emails you to change the loan amount you can only do it with certain guidelines. In a lot of cases they asked to push a loan over 80% of the loan to value. If you go past that point they will have to pay PMI which is basically just insurance because 20% needs to be putdown. We were told to never push it pass that threshold no matter what but then the loan originator would get frustrated when we wouldn't change the loan amount or know what we are talking about. If you are the loan originator I shouldn't have to tell you why that is! (especially when they can change all loan terms and are directly talking to the consumer about 100s of thousands of dollars) 

Compensation: The pay is decent enough. You only get paid by the hour around 18-21 an hour. But you will get a bonus and if you keep busy and get your stuff done you can get about $3500-4500 a month. When I was initially hired they told me I would get a raise shortly after training... never happened."

- they provide technical equipment to most people","- No communication in terms of company cuts
- They work you like a hound and expect MORE when you're already giving over 80 hours of your week to them
- Benefits aren't the greatest

The company is constantly hiring people and the immediately doing lay-offs. It makes you wonder who is making those decisions if they think they can handle hiring over a thousand employees at once and then on a whim decide ""you know what.... we can't afford that abort abort."" When I say on a whim, I literally mean you started working for two days and then they laid off hundreds of people with the same start date as you with little to no communication as to why it's happening or any sort of heads up. I worked in several positions. Don't go into Loan Origination. For your sanity, just don't do it. Every single person who works here minus the recruiters or VPs/SVPs will tell you exactly the same."

All they said was that the rates were going up and not enough people getting the loans. They laid everyone off during our lunch break by removing us out of Microsoft Teams leaving us all confused. I reached out to my trainer and manager and got no response. It was so unprofessional It left my family and I in a hole. I hear this something they do pretty often...

Last minute, we were made to rescind all employment offers we had recently made, and most of the employees we had recently hired were laid off in a giant Zoom call. Most had not even finished their first days, and several of these people had left their long-term employers to come over the AmeriSave. It was heartbreaking.

They did not follow through will having enough HR available for questions on adjusting to the change. Matter of fact, majority of the laid off workers were simply ignored after the decision was announced. We were told because the rates were going up less leads were coming in, however, the current rates were not consistent with this explanation and the phones were still busy.

You spend your day trying to calm upset borrowers as to why the company makes so many mistakes, and their loans just don't seem to close. We are paid on funded loans. I had about 10 loans get scheduled to close and the company never sent the documents to title. So borrowers expect to close and nobody shows up. While you and the borrower want that loan to close. The company just seems to want you to keep writing more loans and not worry about borrowers withdrawing. Thats just the tip of the iceberg. They are a sinking ship.

Essentially they have to roles going an MLO role and a licensed role 
one pays lower base 24k and other 40k 
 , if you accept higher , they dont let you go to the lower and higher commision.

They've also just mandated we work 4 hours some Saturdays. The job isn't at all what we were told it would be and the incentive structure is disorganized. They ride all of their employees about keeping numbers up and clicking on a screen but their own reports aren't accurate and it screws people out of their deserved bonuses. You'll be shamed if you bring up that your pay is wrong, literally had a manager tell us if we kept complaining about bonuses being wrong that they may just take bonuses away. The system they use goes down every single day but you're still held accountable if you can't get your work done.

Seriously, if you read the reviews for Junior Underwriter positions you can see the same issues repeated over and over and over and HR offering some platitude about ""emailing HR to address your concerns"". We're addressing our concerns right here. Fix your reports so that QC loans give incentives as we were told they were. Hire more people instead of working your underwriting department to the bone. Give a crap about your employees instead of just treating us like machines.

I came in thinking they would have much better technology over the last lender I worked for that used Encompass and Velocify. The tech here is so bad, that was enough for me to leave. The leads were not nearly as good as sold. You basically process your own loans. Once its ready to be approved, it goes to underwriting. I was sold on being able to sell more and process less. I ended up having to sell more and process more, all for being paid less. Do yourself a favor and become a real salesman that doesn't need to offer the cheapest product and make 90-125 BPS per loan. AmeriSave wants you to slave your life away giving customers crappy service, but low rates and low costs. At the end of the day I just wasn't a fan of the culture. The high pressure - sell, sell, sell all the time, as much as you can, for as long as you can, all the time.

In the past month our responsibilities and workload has increased greatly, yet there has been no increase in compensation, and abysmal training. This also comes a couple months after half our department was laid off. Team leads are approachable and are trying their best, but are managing teams of 15+ people who are all learning and we do not receive enough 1 on 1 time with them to get adequately trained. Policies and the way you are told to do things changes every day. Tech is terrible, and the remote server constantly goes down, making it common to have days where you can't work from hours on end.

Their process is incredibly tedious for borrowers, with unnecessary emails sent to clients multiple times/day in process. Leadership will treat you like a number and change expectations regardless of what you were hired on. At the end of the day, sales is impossible if you are trying to sell something you do not believe in, and if you believe in an easy, transparent, and user-friendly mortgage experience for your clients, you will be disappointed to see your results if you join this company. 

One last part would be the technology- while I joined this company fairly late into the pandemic, I was truly shocked at how bad their infrastructure is. There have been tech outages where you cannot get work done for hours at a time EVERY DAY since joining the company (months ago).

That quota becomes hard to hit when you have to deal with 40+ existing clients (calling them to get documents, telling them there was a new document they need, uploading their documents, contacting underwriting, contacting insurance, etc.). You also have to process some of your own loans (they have people for that, they just choose not to use them all the time) so you have to teach yourself how to do that job as well with no training, no extra pay, and the stress of deals not closing because people wont get back to you, title messed something up, etc. and now you are the one getting cussed out because of it :) No work life balance. you will have nightmares about this job."

Some modules have been on mandatory 55 since november because company just works their employees to death instead of hiring
Paychecks are wrong a lot. 
Incentives change with no notice and I currently don't know what the pay rate is for my module because no matter how many times you ask your manager nobody will tell you. 
The job is stress. People are leaving due to the lack of organization and the being worked until you drop. Management assures us they don't want us to be overwhelmed but mandate overtime indefinitely. 

As long as they continue their current practices of mass hiring then mass firing, it won't get any better. 


 HR really needs to check the JR UW department management before they lose a lot of talented people. At minimum we deserve to know our own incentives. If amerisave really cares like they say they do they will drop the mandatory 55 and at least move to 50 or less ."

There weren't enough loans for everyone to even remotely meet their quota. Managements solution was for us to begin our shift two hours earlier so we had a better chance of finding loans to work on.

You will be told that you are literally just a number in a spreadsheet and they won’t hesitate to replace you with a new hire. 

AWFUL System issues and management’s only response is to “Deal with it”. You will be mostly cold calling “warm leads” and be prepared to have everyone you speak to on the phone complain about horrible audio quality and not being able to hear you. You can expect your remote server to be down 2-3 times a day without any compromise on management’s expectations. 

Management takes no accountability for the system issues and expects you to perform as if everything was fine. 

Be prepared to be a slave to your computer 12 hours a day 6 days a week. The company has a daily minimum of 5 hours of phone time - NO EXCEPTIONS. They just want you to stay front end focused just to bring in sales with no respect to your current (sold) customers.

This would be feasible if we weren't in meetings every day for multiple hours. Overall I love what they are trying to do. I believe in the system and the goal, but we need breaks, we have lives outside of work, and instituting mandatory 55 hour weeks back to back to back are going to make your goals impossible to reach.

The process is terrible. They tell you to tell your borrowers it'll take 30-60 days for a refinance to close and you're lucky if its 60 days or less. So your borrowers get mad at you and no help is given to you in return. You are sh** on daily and cussed out daily.

Training Phase- Expect to have training to be wasteful. You spend all your long hours learning over a zoom call and the training you get from these amazing trainers are amazing . However you move past training and all your managers will tell you to NOT do things the way the trainers explained (who also were MLO's before). I should have seen that this was a red flag and not ignored it. 

Past training and getting ready to take your test you are then separated into locations and teams. Our first zoom call  while STUDYING for the NMLS we were  threatened  with our job within 5 min no one knew who they would call to fire claiming that some were not meeting our ""education test scores"". AGAIN we were studying and this was our FIRST meeting Everyone was shocked after it ended the call abruptly after 5 minutes leaving no time for us to respond as we all sit at home mortified at the disgusting manner and threatening our jobs with no introduction. No excuse coming from someone who represents the company. SECOND red flag if you are still reading then wait... there's more. 

We passed our test and then we all assume things will be great we get to work from home they had previously said it is flexible hours and had said Saturdays are optional like we had heard before. EXPECT these upper level to be vague and LIE . He continued to motivate us and was vague with everything he said beating around the bush. You are NOT going to have flexible hours guys, get this through your head now and Saturdays are required. 

Being on the job we have managers who would help walk you through Loan Estimates and try to help. But managing all of us is hard work no doubt for them. They will micromanage you until you now don't see the difference in harrassment and micromanaging. ""Where are you? why are you not in the CCT"" (Call center), literally we are using the restroom or taking our deserved breaks! They expect 5 hours of call center no matter what. They DONT take into consideration that their technology is BAD, always crashes, people cant hear you 90% of the time so they will hang up on you, the server crashes all the time. The tech people you will recycle talking to and will get annoyed and continue to say it is your internet even when you purchase the best internet your ISP has to offer. No responsibility , and NO consideration . You WILL stay 1 hour longer if you do not meet the call center hours or sell a loan in a day . PAUSE ....WE ARE STILL NEW AND YOUR SYSTEMS SUCKS HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO WORK ???!!!! 

The managers have unrealistic expectations and hey also NOT EVERYONE HAS ALL THEIR STATE LICENSES! Some do have California and do way better than other. But they don't care, you don't produce you are not of value. This company has no sense of how to treat their employees. Anyone with a conscience and decency can tell you, this is not ethical. Choose yourself, your health. We are now being threatened with our jobs if we do not sell consecutively a certain number of loans. OH and by the way did I let you guys know we only get paid hourly then $250 per loan when it funds? THAT is BS guys when we are doing essentially the same thing, we still get leads that are not self serve which is another big fat LIE they said. 

I hate being lied to and consistently having people tell us to push through the system issues when they push this idea at you that we have the ""best technology"" compared to other companies. LIES. Run away, take another job if you can. This should be a career, not a place that causes your hair to fall from stress . Choose to be happy and carefree, this job will destroy your mental health. By the way they said there are only a couple of people in HR department... guys a billion dollar company with basically no HR, now you know what is really wrong with this horrible soulless company.

At the end of the day, it's all about money, despite managers efforts to make this seem like a fun competition and we're on a team.","There's opportunity to move up, but honestly, if we're regularly being asked for 20 hours of overtime, as well as hearing from my manager that she works 9am - midnight and hardly has time with her kid - then I'm not interested in moving up."

585,AmeriSave Mortgage,BEWARE,2020-10-09,1.0,Mortgage Specialist,"- Work from home
- Friendly team members
- Decent bonuses","- MASS LAYOFFS 
- You feel like a cog in a machine rather than a valued member of the company 
- Crappy pay. Seriously, paying barely above minimum wage while expecting your employees to have 4 year degrees and work 40-50 hours a week is ridiculous. 
- God awful benefits 
- Constant, confusing changes to work policies without warning
- Overbearing upper management 
- So. much. micromanagement . 
- The activity tracker they use to monitor employees is not accurate but they will penalize you for low activity anyway.
- HORRIBLE tech. it’s slow, laggy, and you will get logged out at least once a day but STILL get blamed for low activity. 
- Because of the way this position is set up, you don't leave the job with very many transferable skills, so I would not recommend it as a way to improve your career outlook.
- As others have said, this is a VERY temporary job. They layoff employees as quickly as they hire them and unless you're an extremely high performer who’s willing to put up with plenty of BS, don't be surprised to get a call from management saying you're being let go.

If you really need the money, I say take the job. Being able to work from home is important in these times and the work itself is fairly simple, albeit tedious. However, DON'T get comfortable. If you're hired, keep job searching and find a real company that actually values you. Or at least one pays better."

Customers have backed out of deals because they can’t understand you. The company wants 5+ hours of talk time a day but it’s difficult when the phone lines aren’t clear and when you act as the processor for a good portion of the day. Older loans just sit there while newer loans are being pushed through much faster. If you need help from management you are going to be waiting a while or until the customer files a complaint.

601,AmeriSave Mortgage,Work from home while you enjoy wondering if and when you're going to get laid off.,2020-09-17,2.0,Mortgage Specialist,Work from home. Honestly that's it. The pay is ok. I had to choose a location but the job is remote.,"I know it's not because I have seen my first hourly paycheck and we are provide an actual service, but everything else about this place feels like a really weird mlm: 
*Growth is UNSUSTAINABLY fast. 
*Inspirational speeches have been many and uncomfortable. My first week we had a meeting with over 300 people that included: an inspirational speech from management extolling the virtues of working hard and then working harder and also having a ""good attitude""; announcements of promotions plus having the new team leads/managers to tell us how long they had been at the company (most of them only months or as little as two weeks) and how they got here; talking about how exciting an opportunity this is and how you can go anywhere (at one point one of the organizers said ""the sky is the limit"" and one of the employees put ""no, space is my limit!"" into the chat I think unironically, and the organizer read it like that was an excellent contribution); infinite scrolling text chats saying congratulations or talking about how excited people are to be there.
*It's painfully obvious that with the speed of growth that people who got in 6 to 8 weeks ago were promoted to management or team lead because they were there. They went from a handful of people to over 700 in a matter of months (which they talked about as if it was a good thing!), of course there was opportunity for promotions. Coming in now will not be the same. See the MLM parallel?
*If you're not doing a good job, it's your fault. They won't always come out and say it but it's obvious. Not getting what you need from the vendors you work with because their B2B relationships are terrible? Literally ""That's on you."" Now go contact the same person you just contacted yesterday to ask for the same thing. 

I want to reiterate, they are definitely paying us by the hour, this is not an mlm, it just has many of the worst features of them.

Management sends out emails that alternate between unreasonably positive and vaguely threatening. Usually multiple emails a day cajoling or berating us for performance, including sharing all numbers for everyone in the dept instead of speaking to people individually if there's a problem. They periodically present new metrics for evaluating performance and they *could* be using these to try to tell us how to do better, but instead seem to be just trying to motivate everyone by fear.
 
They have no idea what they're doing because they're building the system from scratch. This would be totally ok, except see above, if you're not doing a good job, it's your fault. They have made so many changes in the last two days no one knows what's going on. Every other time they roll out a policy change they phrase it as if we had been doing it wrong all along, or we were just confused.
 
The motivations are such that you shouldn't care about the overall system or anyone outside your little area. That's fine if you like that, but I hate waste, inefficiency, and screwing people over.
 
They have told us not to use the productivity tools that they insisted we use. People who have been here for 3 weeks are told they should know everything they need and should mostly keep out of the team chat. Don't ask questions, don't learn from the questions of others. 
 
""Bad attitude ruins the team's moral, and I will not tolerate it."" Have you ever heard anyone say they won't tolerate bad attitudes who didn't have a bad attitude? It's specifically negatively phrased. People who are kind and respectful are generally able to inspire the same in others, and at least speak to problem individuals directly instead of doing the email equivalent of vaguebooking. And let's just ignore the typo. But the point of this is what ""don't use the team chat"" and ""no bad attitudes"" mean put together is ""do not acknowledge problems or try and get support from each other."" 

I'm sure many of us will be laid off. They hired what has to be over a thousand people by now (this is just for my area, I'm sure the company overall has hired more) so they could catch up on their backlog, and they're saying they expect continued growth but I would be *very* surprised if the growth is sufficient to meet this enormous hiring surge. The charitable explanation is that they're unrealistically optimistic and bad at planning. The less charitable explanation is that they hired far too many people so they can drive off the people who don't want to be treated badly, find out how much staff they actually need, then fire the bottom performers. The evidence for this is the changing metrics for performance and the often impossible/inconsistent requirements. 
 
There are so many other little petty things about this job, but that's the bulk of it. The work is structured in a ""proprietary"" way that will prevent many people from transferring their skills to another company in the industry, if the nomcompete agreements don't force you to change careers anyway. The insurance is overpriced and Cigna is terrible for my area, but that's the least of the problems.
 
If you can't get better work, take this job--you get to stay home and be safe, and that has real value right now. Just keep looking for something else because this may not be long term and long term probably isn't great for your mental well-being."

Kind of enjoy doing the work.,"Mass hiring, very quick hiring process, both red flags that there is very little stability here and mass firings are likely in the near future.

608,AmeriSave Mortgage,Don’t Give A Two Week Notice,2020-08-02,1.0,Mortgage Underwriter,Able to work remotely permanently.,"I worked at Amerisave for a little over a year, and everything was great until I gave my two weeks’ notice. I gave my two weeks’ notice on a Monday with the intention of working until the following Friday (two weeks). The next day my manager terminated me effective immediately without pay. I brought the matter up to HR, and HR refused to help. I then reached out to the COO, and CEO of Amerisave who forwarded my complaint to legal, which was ridiculous. Amerisave should have done the right thing, which was to pay me for the two weeks instead of getting legal involved. At the end of the day my employment was at-will, but I wasn’t terminated without pay due to poor performance or excessive workplace complaints, I was terminated without pay simply because Amerisave has/had the right to do it. With that being said, just because Amerisave had the right to do it doesn’t make it any less vindictive. I did the right thing by giving a two week notice, and I was punished for it. Amerisave is not a company that practices what it preaches."

LOS does most of the work for you.,"Company does not treat employees with the same respect when the employee leaves that they did when the employee was still employed. What I mean by this, is that when I gave my two weeks' notice the company let me go immediately, and refused to pay me for the full two weeks. I understand that employment is at will, but the company should be transparent about their two week policy. Obviously, they're not because the company wants to be in control. As stated in the headline I did not work in sales. Other companies that I have worked for such as Wells Fargo, and Bank of America paid you for the full two weeks if they let you go early. Maybe what Amerisave does is common practice, but just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. It's a nasty thing to do to employees who want to work out their two weeks. The employee is then left to deal with trying to get unemployment which in most cases is substantially less than what they were making."

Rule with an iron fist is the mentality. Mandatory monthly meetings where you are asked extremely private questions about your friends, family, love life, and life growing up to help ""understand the employee as an individual"" for more effective management. A bad day might consist of being fired and sent home, and then called the next day and rehired. A bad day might be having your desk moved away from everyone else so you sit alone if you get on someone's bad side. A bad day might mean your performance review sent to the entire company to chastise you. A bad day might be helping your boss into his car because he is drunk and throwing up in the parking lot. Meetings are scheduled at 7am and often cancelled at 6:50am, after you are already at work. A bad day might consist of being told at 4:59pm that you are obligated to stay til 11pm because the company isnt performing that well. Schedule is ridiculous, mandatory 2 hour lunches and 12 hour shifts. Pay is horrendous, recoverable draw deducted from your commission.    Turnover is off the charts"

Several management employees were covered with tattoos, many DJ's, members of bands, makeup artists, etc worked there and were embraced for their differences. You were allowed to talk and.socialize while you worked or, like me, I could put on my headphones and jam out to music all day, what mattered was the quantity and quality of your work.  We were required to sell every one of our loans to investors within 10 business days, meaning clearing underwriting conditions set by various investors which could be very stressful. Thankfully when we ran into stubborn borrowers or settlement agents, our team leads would jump in and escalate the issue so it didn't always land squarely on our shoulders. I was recruited away from there and have been trying to get back ever since. I didn't realize it at the time, but I  was very happy there. Plus, their snacks out of the vending machine are only $0.25!","Some very strong personalities full of negativity could get the better of me some days.  The team leads held themselves to an impossibly high standard and their stress was palpable. Therefore, their reviews of my work were harsh, albeit true; sometimes the truth hurts and they could've gone a little easier on me; the message was clear, why beat me over the head with it?

For some employees, the ability to work from home is a plus, however this option is only available if you are on commission.  The IT at this company is very advanced compared to other mortgage companies.  However, the advanced IT comes with being very limited in being able to offer a new product or make an exception to a rigid process.  If you are a self-starter and are in a commission / paid per file role you may be able to see a little success.","There is very little room for advancement at this company.  Working here feels as though the view of management is that the employees are little more than robots who exist to work their process.  If you are salaried, you cannot work from home full time because there is no trust that you will do your job even though the IT at this company is very advanced and they can easily keep track of everything you do.   Amerisave also received a large fine from the CFPB for deceptive advertising practices.  I would encourage you to read the entire action against Amerisave on the CFPB's website as it will come up with customers.  The company’s business model leads to many boom and bust cycles depending on the movement of mortgage rates. This leads to cycles of hiring and layoffs which seem to happen regularly.

727,AmeriSave Mortgage,Frustrating,2011-06-13,2.0,Loan Advisor,Genuine W2 work from home opportunity.,"supervisors held too much power over my production. They might lock a loan, they might not for you. If pricing changes before they lock it and you loose the loan, you get blamed for low production.  Sense of urgency must be shared from the ground up."
