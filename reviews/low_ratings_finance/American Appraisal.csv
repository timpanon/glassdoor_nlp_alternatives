Poisonous company culture
Management does not manage 

Overall, just a very poorly managed company."
7,American Appraisal,Talented Employees,2017-05-24,3.0,Manager,The company has a lot of talented and skillful employees.,Seems to be stuck in time. Need to invest in technology and infrastructure.
8,American Appraisal,Consultant,2016-09-08,4.0,,"Lots of travel, small office with good work-life balance. Interview was easy. Ability to develop and move up there if you push.",Lots of travel.

11,American Appraisal,Overall Good Experience,2016-01-20,3.0,Technician,Travel benefits such as hotel points and airline miles. You get to see the whole country (and world in some instances). The daily per diem is nice when you are out in the field. Some projects are better than others.,Unpredictable work schedule. One week you will be working and the next you will not (without pay).

Normal amount of in-fighting, territorial behaviour, resulting in the need for diplomatic buffers."
17,American Appraisal,Poorly Managed,2015-06-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Salaries are usually on par with fair market. Work/Life balance is usually fair. Acquisition by Duff & Phelps may help remedy the poor management of the company. The people you work with are great.,"Too many ""leaders"" and little, to no accountability. There are no incentives for non-management employees (other than not being fired), so many employees tend to fly under the radar and do just enough work to ensure their job security."
18,American Appraisal,Manager,2015-05-26,2.0,Manager,"Good people, focused deleivery teams and sales professionals with limited direction and motivation to perform or out perform the marketplace.","Litlle or no business planning. Lack of motivation, expense reporting is to funny to describe, sales force is still on a draw, thank goodness for D@P or this ship would have sank. Joe V is a solid leader."
19,American Appraisal,Lack of IT investment,2015-03-11,2.0,,Excellent environment to work. Very skillful team. Good opportunities to make the local operation grow.,"Too much procedures to do without IT support. From finance to project controlling, everything is done without a properly ERP.
Don't has formal training for the employees."
20,American Appraisal,"Good technical team, poor internal management and internal strategic plan.",2015-03-04,2.0,Senior Manager,"Good leadership from the Brazilian office, great technical team and good local environment. It is actually a good place to learn more about a 100% consulting firm","Lack of investments in the Brazilian subsidiary, along with poor leadership from the Spanish Branch, specially from the CEO, diminish the Brazilian subsidiary chances to flourish in terms of building up a strong team basis and client portfolio"

Generally speaking, nice and skilled  colleagues and very interesting job. Possibility of changing roles. Good training.","It's a very demanding job, so it's difficult to balance the work time with the life time. Not real possibility of career, unless  turn over or resignation of the upper levels. Not a real network spirit, quite the contrary. Lack of ""useful"" communication."
23,American Appraisal,Wish I could give negative stars..,2014-08-23,1.0,FAMIS,"The clients are fantastic.  It is rewarding to meet and get to know people from all walks of life, all over the country.","Management is the worst I've ever encountered. They allow a hostile working environment, harassment of employees, intimidation and verbal abuse - all regular situations that management fails to successfully address.  Instead  you are told to keep you mouth shut, keep to your self, do your work, and only speak when spoken to even after seeking help from other managers and HR.  Nobody is there to champion the employee.  They will push you around with little regard for the law so it's beneficial that you know your rights and know how to contact the Equal Rights Division of EEOC.  But once you stand up to management, by yourself, you are completely on your own..  You will be lied to and beaten down.   When you encounter professionals from other organizations they will tell you how much they dislike American Appraisal because of their underhanded business practices.  It is embarrassing to tell others in the profession who you work for.  The dealmakers in the organization have left sour tastes in many peoples mouths and they don't forget."
24,American Appraisal,Ok.  Not a career if you want to have a life,2014-08-06,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Travel, hotel points, work mostly on your own. Co-workers in the field are good people","Sunday travel required thur Friday night. Remote middle of no where areas with no co-workers. High turn over. Little training. Very little room for advancement. If not in the liked ""inner circle,"" life can be made miserable. Low pay for the amount of work and sacrifice made to ones own life."
25,American Appraisal,Terrible company,2014-07-21,1.0,FAMIS Associate,airline points and hotel points,"This company does not care about their employees at all.  they take every opportunity that they can find to nickel and dime you out of the pay that is rightfully yours. they make you work long hours for little pay.  they make you leave for a business trip on sunday afternoon, and you don't come back until late friday night.  so saturday is the only day you'll have at home. there in no training, and no room for advancement.  the only times I ever talked to senior management- they were belittling or lying to me. I have worked for a lot of companies in the past, and this has by far the most toxic culture I have ever seen."
26,American Appraisal,On a Path Straight to the Bottom,2014-05-02,1.0,,The people in the trenches are easy to work with and are truly those who give the firm its value.,"The childlike mentality of the senior management team is absolutely shocking.  If you are liked, you will become a member of the firm’s inner circle and nothing you do will ever be framed in a negative light.  If you are not liked, your accomplishments are minimized and seen as a threat to senior management, and will lead to your untimely exit.  

This is an organization which takes employment at will to an entirely new level.  Longtime loyal employees need to watch their backs after achieving a certain level of experience and salary.  The Grim Reaper has frequently visited the offices of these employees in the interest of saving costs, while failing to recognize the value of these consultants to providing a superior level of client service.  The number of people shown the door over the past 12 months is absolutely shocking!  Some people in senior management, contrary to their words expressing regret, clearly enjoy carrying out the executions.  Such a toxic environment is the logical end result when accountants are permitted to run a professional services firm.  

Disagree with management?  Rather than use criticism as an opportunity to initiate a healthy level of discussion, senior management’s approach is to terminate the person attempting to facilitate change for some contrived reason to eliminate dissent.  

Using the firm's characteristic penny wise, pound foolish mentality, senior management grants very few employees unemployment benefits in connection with their separation, in order to save costs necessary to maintain their lavish lifestyles.    

Another penny wise, pound foolish strategy relates to the amount permitted for meal expenses while travelling on the road for business.  This guidance has not been revised in at least 30 years, and would require employees to eat at fast food restaurants in order to comply with the letter of the policy."
27,American Appraisal,Great Place for Education,2014-04-29,4.0,Associate Appraiser,Company pays for education needed to become a licensed appraiser. Learn about different types of real estate.,Not enough PTO. A lot of turnover.
28,American Appraisal,Associate Appraiser,2014-04-14,1.0,Associate Appraiser,The experience looks good on the resume,"Lack of team interaction, poor project scheduling, inefficient workflow plans, no training"
29,American Appraisal,Stay away!!!!!!,2014-04-08,2.0,,"Friendly, rather informal environment
Small size, ease of communication","Lack of procedures set in place to allow for the broader picture of the company
Lack of formal training"
30,American Appraisal,"Overall excellent people, terrible management.",2014-04-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Great coworkers and many traveling opportunities.,"Short-term thinking and no vision from management. The company appears to have no direction.
The IT department is a disaster (extremely small for a company of this size and it is centralized in Milwaukee).

There is a constant sense that the company is about to be sold in the near future and people with over 15 years in the company will cash out and leave (probably taking the big clients with them).  

Management has a centralized and small town mentality.  You can't expect to be recognized outside of Milwaukee when you can't see past Milwaukee.  It feels like a big town company, not a global company.

Each department solely focused on their own interests and there is a massive disconnect among the various sections of the company. The greatest example of this is the ""Business Development Managers.""  These employees are purely focused on getting their commissions and, accordingly, will underbid projects in order to ensure that they get the client to sign on the dotted line.  However, this puts pressure on the employees that actually work on the project and who are expected to deliver the final project on an unrealistic budget.  When budgets are exceeded, management focuses on the employees working on the project and not the Business Development Managers who grossly underbid the project."
31,American Appraisal,Burn 'em and turn 'em!,2014-04-02,1.0,Associate In FAMIS,"Hotel and Airline points.
Your co-workers are good people, just watch out for management!","Poor quality of life.
Lack of training.
Terrible management that will make your life a living Hell!"
32,American Appraisal,GREAT!!!!,2014-02-18,5.0,Associate Appraiser,Great opportunity for young professionals to grow and get the experience that would be unavailable at a smaller appraisal firm.,I have only been with the company for a few months but I truly have no downside and I do not see any in the near future.  Great company with exceptional co-workers.
33,American Appraisal,Senior Appraiser,2014-01-26,2.0,Senior Associate,Allow analysts to work on projects independently with minimal supervision.,Growth opportunities are limited. This company has been shrinking the last 10 years. Cutting costs and employees is the only thing that keeps them profitable. Have not kept up on new products and services. Have not provided a company match on it's 401K plan in the last 6 years.
34,American Appraisal,American Appraisal is a good springboard.,2014-01-02,4.0,Fixed Assets Associate,"Ability to travel the United States, and manage your own projects or work collectively with individuals from various offices.",Not knowing when and where you will be. It can be very tough to plan your life when you do not know what city you will be in or when you will be home.
35,American Appraisal,Limited opportunity for advancement,2014-01-01,2.0,Associate,Helpul training. Good starting salary with little or no experience.,Very little personal time. You are expected to work overtime and on weekends. Very little incentive for going above and beyond.

Good between work/life balance.","No willing to improve the services and poor consideration of the employees. No training, you have to learn in your free time."
38,American Appraisal,Company with giant potential being held back by its own problems,2013-09-18,3.0,,"- A lot of the consultants that work here are skilled, knowledgable.
- Reasonable salary (especially if compared to Big4).
- You have the opportunity to work with very senior people (not much hierarchy-based). Great learning opportunities.","- Administration/ processes are disorganized.
- Communication is lacking - employees do not know where the company is at and where its headed."
39,American Appraisal,Won't be around very long.,2013-08-02,1.0,,A line on a resume,Agree about lying about benifits. No one gets tuition. Loyalty is employee to company never the other way. Told you're doing well and then you're gone. Too many hours working and not on your life. Smaller than when I started. Emphasis on lowering costs and making share price move up and not on growing.
40,American Appraisal,A Slow Painful Death Spiral,2013-03-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flexibility, generally good people in the trenches, and I can't think of any more pros but it requests a minimum of 20 words.","Awful management, terrible benefits and compensation, no strategy for growth, leading the race to the bottom of the profession.  If you're considering employment here, run away."
41,American Appraisal,Senior Associate at American Appraisal in business valuation group,2012-11-06,4.0,Senior Consultant,Good work and life balance and collegial atmosphere among peers.,Rewarding top performers of consultant pool.
42,American Appraisal,Good,2012-05-03,4.0,,Balanced work and life there,Limited space for future improvement
43,American Appraisal,Poorly run company that over promises,2012-04-21,1.0,,"Like others have mentioned, the staff in the trenches are great down to earth types. I've made many friends here and am still in touch with them.","You’ll work long hours and have very little time to live your life. No respect at all for a personal life. The hierarchy makes little sense. Why would you have the legal department in charge of the Administrative Assistants or I.T.?!? Corporate policy regarding business processes is regularly written, but rarely followed or enforced. There are groups that just ignore the rules and do things the way they want without concern for what’s best for all departments involved in a project. I felt bad for anyone that wasn’t billable; they were viewed as lower class citizens and treated poorly. 

Others here have said it’s like the company is in a constant state of restructuring and I completely agree with that. This company is always looking for ways to reduce costs, but not in a sensible way. Redundant departments are all over the globe. Resources are geographically isolated from each other. Poor leverage of talent; it’s hard to find out who you can engage on a project based on their skills in a specific region. I can’t speak of locations outside of the U.S., but here offices kept moving to smaller suites and people are starting to feel packed in. Employees are catching on and jumping ship. Their best talents are leaving regularly for other firms. A few people told me that months after I left they fired the entire I.T. department, except for one guy, leaving them to mostly fend for themselves. And it wasn’t like the technology was current! I can only imagine the problems people are dealing with now.

You’re paid less than market value and get poor benefits. You certainly don’t get what they claim. They hadn’t made a contribution to 401(k)’s in years. While they say that they offer tuition reimbursement, anyone that asks for it is turned down. Health insurance costs are reasonable if you’re the only person on the policy, but quickly get out of hand if you have a spouse or dependents. 
Before I left there were signs that they were trying to communicate the financial strength of the company. However, there were still too many cases of silence in the overall direction of the company. You’re either a made man and in the know or expendable and kept in the dark. 

In the end, American Appraisal is poorly run. This is not the same company I started with."
44,American Appraisal,If you have another option?  Go with that other option.,2012-02-09,1.0,,Small company where life-long friendships are likely to be made.,"American Appraisal likes to reorganize.  Growth is not the goal -- rather reduction of expenses is the goal.  The company has been without c-level leadership for at least 3 years.  The ship is sinking, and the marketable employees are jumping as quickly as this economy allows."
45,American Appraisal,No longer the #1 Independent Valuation firm in the world,2011-08-17,2.0,Valuation Consultant,"At the beginning of my tenure there, the company was a great place to work.  Training opportunities were there for the asking.  Management actually knew (and cared) about the employyee as a person","Once Ron Goergen left the firm and Joe Zvesper  took the reins it just wasn't a the same place.  Joe is a nice enough guy, but not suited (nor tried for that matter) to the company's corporate culture.  Employees used to be a top priority then.  Certainly not now.  Zvesper has detached himself from almost any interaction with the staff other than the upper management people he bought in from the outside.  He often refferred to long time employees as ""legacy employees"".   Like being loyal was something to be looked down on.  Slowly over the last four or five years, they have moved out anyone who had long term ties with the firm and gotten away from their original appraisal firm model.  They have bought in a lot of people from accounting firms who don't have a filed view of the industry and are constantly making decisions based more on how much money they can save rather than how much money they can make.  Poor, very poor management model"
46,American Appraisal,Not good,2011-07-13,2.0,,"Pay is good for junior level employees
Location is great","No respect for work/life balance
Upper management doesnt know how to communicate with lower level employees"
47,American Appraisal,"American Appraisal - appreciate the experience, but quickly learned that this is where careers go to die.",2011-04-25,2.0,Senior Manager,"Overall your peers will be very friendly, helpful, and down to earth. There is truly a great pool of personalities here and as a relatively small firm, you will likely form close bonds and lifelong friendships.

A good stepping stone right out of college.","The executives don't seem to understand how to grow the business as evidenced by many failed endeavors. Very quick to give up on an idea instead of seeing the process through. A complete lack of vision on their part and an environment where no one is willing to stand up and make decisions of any kind. As a result, not much ever really gets accomplished. There was always the sense that they were in a constant state of restructuring. 

American Appraisal will commonly create a new position, go through the recruiting process, even convincing someone to leave their current employer, only to decide a few months later that they should not have created the position at all and fire the new employee. The termination process can also be very cold. I don't know the actual numbers, but it seemed like there was always a high amount of turn over. 

In most cases where someone leaves the firm, that position is rarely restaffed, so this would not be a circumstance for someone else to move up the chain, most of the time. There isn't much chance to move forward in your career at all. This might be a good first job out of college, but you'll quickly out grow the company and need to start looking elsewhere."
48,American Appraisal,An opportunity to gain experience in challenging work assignment,2011-03-29,4.0,,"It is a medium size firm, a safe private employee ownership firm, has a global international coverage, has good work environment, has well IT support, and opens opportunity for continuous professional development and education.","Though some company decisions and acts seemed to slightly lost in touch in the last view years during the bottom of the recession, overall everything is still in control.  I have no cons against the executive decision."
49,American Appraisal,It was a hard place to work long overs for bad pay.,2011-03-12,2.0,Review Manager,The company has lots of turn over so if you don't like your manager wait a week. I would never work here again,"It was just to much work for too little pay, i hope to find something in the same industry sooner rather than later."
