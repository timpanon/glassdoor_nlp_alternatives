1,Amherst,Not recommended,2022-03-26,1.0,Senior Accountant,"Average health insurance, other standard benefits.","60 days in and I could not get outta of there fast enough. Zero technology, terrible training, lousy management skills, over critical and threatening, and no useful communication. Always, daily, getting negative comments, way too much workload for one person, mandatory overtime which washes out the decent pay. Burnout is rampant. All my coworkers were yes, and do what you are told. Mis-representing job description and unrealistic expectations. It was a miserable experience. In accounting you will spend 7-10 hours a day using Excel… a miserable data entry clerk! Why spend millions on Yardi and use Excel?

8,Amherst,Mass Exodus Underway - Toxic Environment,2021-11-09,1.0,Director,"Pros:

1. Work from home option
2. Company provides work from home stipend","Cons:

1. Executives have Us vs. Them mentality regarding employees.
2. Processes are antiquated. 
3. Very hard to get your work done when there is a lack of support. For example, if you contact the Help Line for a computer issue they may email you back in 3-5 days. 
4. Chronic shortage of staff due to mass exodus. 
5. Executives have unrealistic expectations. They want you to produce but there aren't adequate support systems and processes in the company to allow you to do so. 
6. The benefits sound good but they are sub-par. For example, I've always had VSP (vision insurance) but at Amherst, it only pays for an exam the first year - not contacts, not glasses, just the exam. 
7. When you see 5 star reviews, please know that hiring managers have been asked to give the 5 star ratings to offset the bad employee reviews."
9,Amherst,Toxic. Look up 996 work culture that is banned in other countries to get an idea of what it is like,2021-09-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The friendships you build lasts a lifetime. Thats about it.,"Outside to investors looks great but inside, well...

This is a 996 work culture and/or black company. This was largely my and few others experience. Overworked, under-appreciated, underpaid, no respect. 

996 work culture: The 996 working hour system is a work schedule practiced by some companies. It derives its name from that employees work from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm, 6 days per week. By following the '996' work schedule, you are risking yourself getting sick and possibly into the ICU.

Black company (Japanese term): A typical practice at a black company is to hire a large number of young employees and then force them to work large amounts of overtime without overtime pay. Conditions are poor, and workers are subject to verbal abuse and ""power harassment"" (bullying) by their superiors. In order to make the employees stay, superiors of black companies would often threaten young employees with disrepute if they chose to quit.

Surveys every quarter get worse and worse and nothing is done except ""we're listening to you and you should say something"". Yet when you do say something, its suck it up and be a man/woman about it.

We've lost so many top talent people because of this poor culture and shift those responsibilities to others who are designed to fail because they don't have the support."

Toxic culture. Because asset prices keep rising the place looks well run despite making 0 progress on anything material.

Operations are a complete disaster, the whole place is run on duct tape, offshore labor and good fortune that housing prices have been rising the past 10+ years

Their 'great AVM' is a swat team of 30 analysts punching numbers into a system that looks like a government website. Embarrassing. 

Do not work here unless you are desperate for a transition from NYC and need to maintain those pay levels for a while."

16,Amherst,"Go Elsewhere. Save yourself from the Stress, Frustration and Disappointment. Not Recommended.",2021-06-24,1.0,Management,Interesting and exciting business idea but pros overshadowed by poor execution and management. Generous PTO but hard to use due to workload and unreasonable expectation that you will work all the time.  Some great people but many have left.,"Too many to list.  People are leaving and even without jobs because they are so burned out, demoralized, mistreated and devalued. Very, very stressful workplace. Management needs to make changes to retain good people. 

(1) I feel that they do not value the work of the employees who work extremely hard
(2) people go way above and beyond and their contributions are either undermined or you are made to feel like you don't matter
(3) the culture and morale is very, very low. (due to a variety of things such as high turnover, poor management and leadership, compensation, lack of transparancy and lack of appreciation for working at all hours and foregoing time off, false sense of urgency) Also many positions have been outsourced to CostaRica and Honduras
(4) the company says that they want to develop and promote from within, but from what I have seen executives do not seem to stay long and their replacements are not internally promoted but hired from the outside (So, if you join, I would say do not expect a huge upside or room for growth and promotion)
(5) the compensation is low end and I believe that this combined with feeling highly underappreciated has resulted in many, many people looking to leave and leaving. It is highly challenging to maintain a positive attitude
(6)New intiatives are announced out of the blue and the expectations coming from them are not reasonable. Also you work on things on top of your already overwhelming work load and they decide not to do them. 
(7) HUGE sense of false urgency about projects and deadlines. Does not matter if you are on vacation or what time it is, you do it - no thank you in sight. Unpredictable work needs causes high stress that never goes away. 
(8) HIGLY POLITICAL and the things people have said about top leadership hiring friends and family is true. It is very boys club with events that certain people are invited to and if you’re not, forget it. Problem is the closer you are to that, the less you seem to do right. 

I was treated in a very unprofessional way, brought to attention of division head and nothing was done about it.  Not even an apology. Some  managers are not held accountable and there is no one to talk to about problems that will actually do anything. Terrible feeling. 

The company’s values are nice, but they do not live by them. I agree with previous post saying people can be rude and condescending without consequences and no 360 review. There is a good reason for that - just read these reviews. Many Managers do not take time or know how to manage, some are downright condescending and dismissive and do not even display common courtesy. 
All of these things result in a negative workplace envoronment that is hard to take and I would not recommend it. This could be addressed and is not."

21,Amherst,My Experience Here,2021-04-23,5.0,"Senior Vice President, Finance","I have read a few negative reviews that have been written about Amherst lately surrounding racism. I do not write this in any way to dismiss or minimize what some of you have felt or experienced, but to give my point-of-view on the company.

I have worked for this company for nine years and am a minority. When the company was smaller, the Chairman/CEO personally took a group of us out to celebrate Lunar New Year. When hurricane Katrina happened the Chairman/CEO and his wife immediately wanted to help the victims in anyway they could after watching the devastation unfold on the news. 

Years after the hurricane, the company’s not-for-profit organization still provides endless support to countless neighborhoods ranging from organizing backpack drives, coat drives, free tuition assistance, toiletries, teacher appreciation, etc.. These events are held in the areas where they are most needed. This giving has only grown bigger.

Amherst is the only company that I have ever worked at where the head of the company openly supports the BLM movement sending a tone from the top against discrimination. Today, we celebrate even more cultures by dedicating each month to a particular topic of awareness. However, these events are not new. They have only grown. We have celebrated cultural diversity for many years.
 
I say all this to ask that you please not let an incident that has happened to you to lead you to believe that this is what Amherst stands for. Please look at what the company has done in the past years. Incidents like this should be reported to HR so that it can be dealt with.",I have been here for a long time. The company has grown tremendously. There are growing pains like any other high growth companies.
22,Amherst,Fast Paced,2021-04-04,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,A lot of new stuff to learn and very fast paced.,Business tends to rush developers to deliver software with tight schedules. This contributes to bad code quality.
23,Amherst,"Great people, but not a well managed company.",2021-03-19,2.0,Investments,The team was amazing. Small and every person there really cared about the success of everyone else. The leaders did great at developing their analyst's skills and setting them up for future success.,"Senior management has no insight into what actually happens at the employee level and all choices are made by a few individuals at the top, not allowing middle management to do their job. Decisions are made in a sense that everyone is expendable (to an extent you are), but this ultimately hurts the company as they are losing all of their talented employees. Many false promises as well."
24,Amherst,Want no work life balance? Then this is the place for you!,2021-03-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Decent benefits package. Good and competent coworkers who are overshadowed by awful managers.,"The company culture is all about results in as little of a timeframe as possible. And who cares if the results are of quality as long as you get it done right? Working some overtime, weekends, holidays is normal in most jobs but at Amherst this is the expectation all of the time. No telling how many times upper management had a task that just had to be done that day whether that be after hours, on a holiday or a weekend. And middle management does not ever push back because they either do not care, are too scared that they will lose their jobs if they say no or they are likeminded and think it’s acceptable to blow up your chat/inbox/phone at all times including nights, weekends and holidays. I used to think this only happened in the department I worked in but in seeing other reviews and talking with those still there it is company wide. It is the company culture.

Being away for a bit now has helped me to realize what a toxic environment I was in at Amherst. I am happy to have gotten out.

Advice to those thinking of applying: if you don’t have a family, don’t want to see your family or want to work all the time then Amherst is the place for you. If not, then RUN AWAY! If this review helps one person avoid sharing my awful experience then I’m glad I wrote it."
25,Amherst,Amazing Company to be a part of,2021-03-18,5.0,Treasury Operations Supervisor,"great working environment, understanding and flexible",no cons to share at this time
26,Amherst,Management doesn't care about employees,2021-03-17,2.0,Analyst,Coworkers on my team are good,Management decisions are terrible and not communicated
27,Amherst,Forced to go into the office during Covid  /// Very poor Management,2021-03-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Free lunches.... Oh wait. Never mind, those were taken away.","The best option is to stay away due to aggressive facetiming, overworking towards meaningless deadlines, transparently fake leaders, uncompetitive pay, unimaginable turnover... these are only a few. In my time with the organization in the Capital Management Group so far I have experienced the following specific red flags. 

Red Flag 1 - Throughout Covid as cases continued to skyrocket my team has been encouraged to come into the office by Managers. Amherst wants to create a sense of normal in a world that is currently far from. Management thinks people are inefficient from home and it’s easier to keep tabs when everyone is visible and in the office. My Manager delivered this same message to employees with families without child care and employees living with medical situations. If you pushed back because you were not comfortable due to Covid, you were constantly nagged/harassed. At the end you give in, because the nagging reaches a point of exhaustion, and you eventually oblige for fear of losing your job / getting paid. This level of Facetime is something I have never experienced in any organization. Employees shouldn’t have to fear companies at the expense of their personal safety/comfort, companies should fear its people. The worst part is that after obliging, because office space is low, many are forced to sit with masks on the floor. The CEO meanwhile has carved out a new office for himself that is > 1000 square feet and recently touted how easy it was to work in the office during Covid. He could be a leader and split that obscene space into 15 rooms for his employees to work without masks if he so desperately wants them back. 

Red Flag 2 - The great state of Texas had a state of emergency that left millions without power, water and extensive damages via pipe bursts. Roofs collapsed. Homes flooded. Peoples lives were torn. Despite this my group was told to keep working.... which is understandable if it was actually possible. While there were Corporate messages that we should focus on families and be safe, they were negated by Managers expectations to maintain deadlines that could have been moved. We were asked to turn deliverables almost immediately after the storm as power and water just started to roll on for some, a time where we should have been encouraged to get our lives on track trying to find basic amenities. 
 
Red Flag 3 - The organization does not have any form of 360 feedback in place. There are no annual surveys about reviewing your manager or reviewing the company in general. Glassdoor is the closest medium of review. I did not understand why this was the case when I started a while back, but it was clear after spending time there. Everyone I spoke to on my team has had more negative things to say than positive. If we had any anonymous survey no one in a leadership position in the Capital Management Group would probably be rated well. 

Red Flag 4 - Revolving door. The organization and management know they can get away with treating employees poorly because people want to live in Austin. Management knows the revolving door will bring the next chump in, where Management will dangle the promises of a promotion or compensation, and make said chump work very hard, only to be let down and eventually quit or be pushed out. I’ve seen this happen to good colleagues.

HR will write their standard message to respond to this review, but HR is not helpful. Writing an anonymous message via email to HR is not anonymous. HRs failure here is as severe as the failure of Management."
28,Amherst,Toxicity at it's finest,2021-03-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are good people who work here. But this gets eclipsed by all the cons mentioned.,"Working at Amherst has been the worst experience I’ve had in my career. 

The social culture borders on toxic/illegal. There would be frustrated complaints from people inside the organization when someone leaves for a family event (maternity leave, paternity leave, death of family members, etc.) And the following verbiage after that is either in agreement with the complaints or utter silence.

The work culture infringes on any type of work-life-balance you’re thinking of—you will get messages at night, on the weekends, on holidays of tasks that always need to be done ASAP. The culture of ""urgency.""

The level of reward you get from your work is almost zero to none. When you ship off a project, you can’t always say you’re proud of the work. The ‘we need this done ASAP’ allows no time to proactively plan or produce good work or even average work. This is for ALL projects.

Middle management should seriously go through training on how to manage people. A good percentage of middle management speaks to others in a very condescending way. The result is the work environment is very unprofessional and demeaning. 

The pay is on the lower end.

While HR has been trying their best with new policies but the sad reality is that these thought process that defines the culture comes from the top down and cannot be changed.

If you desperately need a job, then I would say take the job here. It’s a place to be while finding a better opportunity out there. While you’re on your job search, stick to the mentality: less terrible, more pay."

People: You’ll be surrounded by the most passionate and knowledgeable people in the industry. There’s a perfect mix of traditional developers with core understanding of the business and new talent with fresh ideas and experiences.

Project Diversity: The spectrum of projects to work on is wide and diverse. There’s an idea or a technology that will fit your likes across existing and new software.

Accountability and ownership: Each team member has an important stake in the core business. They can immediately see their efforts put to work by receiving constructive feedback. Hard work will always be rewarded. 

Technology: The latest software and hardware is either present or next in line for implementation. Management will also spare no expense for any tools or lessons that help achieve a faster and better end product.

Physical Environment: Office location and open layout are perfect for team work and peer-to-peer interaction. Everyone is up to date with the latest news and events. Team building events are always present in and out of office.","Concurrent Projects: There are always multiple projects that are worked on in parallel, which can affect productivity. However, that can also be a lesson in efficiency.

High Expectations: Employees are expected to perform at their peak. These high expectations can also create self-motivated team members.

Incomplete Requirements: Not all projects have full specifications listed upfront. This can cause some confusion initially but also invokes employees to think outside the box and bring their ideas to the table."
56,Amherst,High Octane Environment,2016-09-14,4.0,Senior Data Analyst,"Amherst is a high octane institutional investor environment.  The company has assembled a vast array of data sets -- beyond what I am familiar with any other real estate-related company having assembled (I would speculate Zillow may be close, in terms of data assembled -- the breadth and depth of the data sets here is truly impressive!).  Amherst is a very fast paced environment.

Amherst is not for everyone.  People that fit in here usually fit in very well; conversely, people that do not fit in here are typically pretty misfit.  Whether you fit or not becomes obvious to everyone pretty quickly.  In my experience of several years here, misfits usually leave less than a year after they start; just about everyone else hangs on for years and years.

Specific Pros:
- BRILLIANT colleagues.  At Amherst, you'll be surrounded by the very best in their field.
- Hardware awesome enough to support analysis and modeling of the multi-terabyte mountains of data.
- Lunch is catered every day.
- One of the goals of management is to bring in the very best people and then get out of their way.  Management does not constrain your ability to achieve.  In general, your own ability and work ethic will determine your level of success.
- The company is not afraid to invest further in the business.  Need a more powerful computer?  Is it necessary to acquire an additional data set for a new process you are building?  Do you need a new software license for a project?  Not a problem -- Amherst will make justifiable investment in the business.
- This place is ALL ABOUT innovation in the technology, data, analytics, and investment decisioning spaces.  Clever solutions and revolutionary ideas are not merely welcome -- being successful here without them will probably not happen.","- As stated above, Amherst is not for everyone.  If you are a poor fit at Amherst, it will be very obvious to everyone in short order.
- Amherst is probably not a great fit for people that want to leave at 5 PM everyday.  It is a pretty flexible environment in terms of hours (which can be very useful for the necessity to run an occasional errand during business hours), but this flexibility is a two way street.  Both a pro and a con.

57,Amherst,Hostile work environment and bullies galore,2016-08-30,1.0,,"Catered food daily
Beautiful office location
Lovely conference rooms
Snacks of all kinds
Free coffee","Aggressive/hostile management
Incompetent managers happy to lay blame and insult you if something goes awry
No established processes of any validity
""Wall street"" atmosphere - very much a ""If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen!"" attitude towards everything
No work/life balance - the expectation is that you work until you drop since most of the management and senior staff are workaholics who stay until very late."
