5,Andrews Federal Credit Union,Most unprofessional and bias place to work,2021-10-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,None honestly. They provide you with the fake “We are a family” narrative and then do the opposite of everything .,"The HR department is corrupt. Unfair treatment, never responds to employee concerns, favors management over any lower positions. Also the pay is like stretching pennies! They don’t value you as a person or a worker. The raises are extremely low and once again penny pinching! Management also has corrupt spirit as in they take favoritism over over certain coworkers... you will either get ignored, pushed to the side, unheard and most of all feel uncomfortable in a hostile work environment that tries to portray otherwise to lure in great employees with great potential. It’s unfortunate that this company has a bad reputation of having people come and go so go ahead and take the risk... you’ll find out why a lot of people don’t stay for long..."

There are senior managers and C-level staff hired not for competence but because they are compromised in some way, and can be forced into compliance. 

Have a 520 credit score? You too can become a Chief Lending Officer. The irony being no loan would be given to a patron with such a score. 

Ostensibly in charge of corporate ethics? What if the employer knows about your testy and difficult divorce proceedings? Might that temper your resolve in handling ethics violations of senior staff? 

Do you want to steal $30k from your employer in credit card fraud and get away scot free? This is the place for you.

Make $200k - $450k/annum? Have the company buy your personal phone, laptop, and various electronic toys that have no business justification."

And actually helping members.","Senior executives. They are not homegrown. Mostly from Florida and California. Out of touch with their membership. Behind the scenes there is a bullying culture. A certain member of the senior executive team is not held accountable for her attitude and treatment of staff. She smiles in your face and talks behind your back. She’s argumentative. HR protects the senior executive team. There are no protections for staff. Until this organization is investigated for their treatment of staff, it will continue as most people need their job to support their families."

34,Andrews Federal Credit Union,Looks are deceiving,2018-03-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Ummm, let me get back to you on that one.  Oh, there’s a break room on every floor, and ample parking.","All cons point to the senior leadership team, except the Chief Lending Officer. They are a bunch of whiny babies, especially the Chief Retail Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.  The Chief HR Officer is a piece of work. She is extremely passive aggressive, manipulative, arrogant and only does what her friends (senior leadership) wants her to do. The CHRO should not pick sides. She will always side with the senior leadership.  One would think that you could trust the CHRO, but she is untrustworthy, known to discuss personnel issues with others outside of the HR Dept. The Senior Leaders are not approachable. They say that they want the employees to talk to them about issues and bring solutions, but they do not even want to hear the issues. They talk about their employees behind their backs and smile in their face when they want something done.  I could go on and on, but hopefully you can make an informed decision about working here."

Executive team are a group of elites who pose with staff on social media so it appears they are engaging and active in the work the staff does. 

Certain members of the executive team are tyrants.  A lot of finger pointing, they take no responsibility and are not held accountable for their actions.

HR is basically non-exisent, they are not there for the employees.  

Several executives feel as though they have to be the smartest in the room.  Treat people beneath them as if they are stupid."

These goals can be extremely hard to meet in general and being in a small community makes it that much harder. Extremely high turnover due to military community.
