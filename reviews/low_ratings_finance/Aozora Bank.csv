5,Aozora Bank,Friendly atmosphere but sometimes frustratingly slow to change,2020-08-10,4.0,Translator,"- Friendly atmosphere with more of an international feel than similar Japanese banks/companies due to history of foreign ownership

- The new offices in Tokyo are state of the art and have great transport links",- Internal procedures and decision making feels antiquated and time-consuming (requests for authorization made via paper that must be literally rubber stamped by all members of a vertical hierarchy before something can be done) - which seems at odds with their focus on FinTech in recent years
