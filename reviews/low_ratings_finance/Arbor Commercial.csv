0,Arbor Commercial,Great Leadership,2019-04-22,5.0,Vice President,"Strong leadership/decisions are made correctly and efficiently, great ceo, good benefits/pay","Culture is lacking, maybe because of multiple offices"
1,Arbor Commercial,Landscaper,2018-02-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Honest group of men. Made arduous work as fun as it could be. You are held accountable for your work and earn respect.,"Long, hard hours on hot sunny days. Coming from little experience, there was a learning curve. It is not rocket-science, but the owner is meticulous and takes great pride in quality no matter how small of a job."
2,Arbor Commercial,Professional,2016-11-11,3.0,,"Family oriented culture in the Uniondale location. The benefits are competitive.  One of the Arbor company became public, so they will stricter deadlines to meet.   The Uniondale location has a diner- type restaurant and gym in the building.",None major to discuss in this site.
3,Arbor Commercial,Servicing,2016-08-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"good question, still thinking of one","Team work only applies to those that are in a tight ""clich√©"" otherwise look out. They are deceptive in their offer to help only to turn around and use it against you.  Don't dare ask a manager on what you can do to improve in your job, that sends up a red flag that you might have an actual brain in your head.  Don't be fooled into joining this company because the salary might be higher than a bank.......  everything comes at a price.  BEWARE"
4,Arbor Commercial,Director,2016-07-29,4.0,Director,Entrepreneurial spirit and good work/life balance and flexibility. Management is open to having people explore different opportunities within the company.,There is a bit of politics that can get in the way of growth opportunities.
5,Arbor Commercial,Analyst,2016-06-07,3.0,,Nice manager.  He pushed the members of my team to produce,The employees seem to filter in and out quickly.  More people need to stay
6,Arbor Commercial,Portfolio Manager,2016-05-19,4.0,Portfolio Manager,"Laid-back culture, friendly environment, Great place for entry levels.",More training needed for new employees.
7,Arbor Commercial,Ok,2016-02-23,3.0,,"work environment, opportunity for growth are not ideal in the very least but there is different treatment for different people","hours, pay, work life balance"
8,Arbor Commercial,Ok Place,2015-12-12,3.0,,Rapidly growing company where your knowledge and skills can be developed,Excessive individual work load with systems that do not aid in effective work flows
9,Arbor Commercial,Great place to work,2015-08-17,5.0,,Great team of people to work with. You will learn a lot.,"High turnover rate in Underwriting, which causes bigger work load for everyone who stays."
10,Arbor Commercial,Stay Away,2015-07-16,1.0,Supervisor,"Good salary, dress down, bank holidays off, free parking, free coffee and that's about it!","Awful Management, even worse HR. Absolutely no room for advancement. They will just keep throwing titles at you, but there's no actual growth. They treat their employees like they are completely disposable and beneath them. The only reason they have employees is because they suck you in with a good starting salary. Not a ""team"" environment. Management changes their minds and procedures like the Buffalo weather. No communication or respect. No work life balance, you're expected to live and breathe Arbor."
11,Arbor Commercial,Great company.,2014-12-20,4.0,Accountant,Great place to work really nice people,So many cubicals I get lost
12,Arbor Commercial,A place like no other,2014-07-31,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Most of the people and the individual departments are great.  Fast Paced and never a dull moment.,"The silo's are unbelievable.   The change of pace in the direction of the company changes daily, and everyone in on a need to know basis, which in managements position is NEVER.  Company does not value its employees or hard work.  Company spends money on the wrong things."
13,Arbor Commercial,Analyst,2014-04-19,3.0,Analyst,small company with good exposure to commercial real estate nationwide,Long term tenure and benefits are tough
14,Arbor Commercial,Just don't do it,2014-04-09,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Being an underwriting/screening analyst is a great first job out of college. You learn a ton since you see so many deals and work through so many issues. In the Boston office, there is a great group of people right out of college all going through the same thing. It's like doing a post-grad year. Plus it sets the bar ridiculously low for any other job you might have throughout your life, and gives you access to the extensive network of other dissatisfied former Arbor employees.","Training is non-existent, they throw you to the wolves and fire you if you get eaten alive. 
The company culture is dog eat dog and management encourages in-fighting. This creates a total blame culture and if you are wondering who the next scapegoat is, it will probably be you.
They invented the term ""penny wise and pound foolish.""
Management...excuse me, ""Management"" changes their minds every few months about the direction of the company. I've never seen anything like it. Like the weather, if you don't like Arbor, stick around 5 minutes, it will change. 
New company ""directives"" are poorly communicated and thought out. There is no long-term plan, and if they ever had one, they would change it in a month or two anyway.
The upshot is that it's a very transient and impermanent place, which is driven by ""Management"" ."
15,Arbor Commercial,Shirking upper Management,2013-12-28,2.0,Underwriting Analyst,The hours were more then decent,"People there only exist to pass the buck, the culture is lacking, there is no energy on in the office"
16,Arbor Commercial,"Unorganized, unprofessional",2013-11-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,None - No one in any upper level position understands the full circle of what they're responsible for.,"HR department is incompetent. God forbid you have to leave on disability. Forms requested numerous times that were never sent prior to leaving, needed to get them from another employee who had a baby. They say they never receive faxes/emails - even when presented with their own read receipts. When going over their head to the actual insurance company, you get contradictory information. So either HR has no idea what they get from the insurance company or they don't know what they should be following up on. Consequently, the doctor had to waste their time with multiple sendings due to HRs incompetence. Oh, and the last conference, the CEO made it clear that they have better lawyers than you do, so don't bother suing. 
Management makes processes more complicated than they need to be - theres a reason for the acronym KISS. It seems like 10% of the people do 90% of the work. I've never seen people take so many coffee breaks and long lunches. Very unprofessional environment - dressing formal doesn't make a professional office. If you have no dignity and can kiss managements butt, you will be promoted. Otherwise, there is no room for advancement - what  you get hired as is what youll be."
17,Arbor Commercial,I greatly enjoyed my time at Arbor. Very talented and professional group of finance professionals.,2013-11-13,4.0,,"The people that work at Arbor are very talented and aggressive. It created a very rewarding working environment. On the occasions that I was able to visit the main offices in NYC, Uniondale and Boston were very informative and enjoyable.",I was located in an office in Atlanta at a time where FNMA was very tentative to underwrite loans in the markets I covered. This was more a function of the current market dynamics at the time than a position taken by Arbor. I would consider working for them again in any market and in almost any capacity.
18,Arbor Commercial,Devalues your resume,2013-10-28,1.0,,None - do not bother working for this company.  It will devalue your resume.  I would rate this company zero stars across the board if there was the option.,"1.) Unprofessional environment; 2.) No opportunity for career advancement - there are clear favorites who know very little about real estate & only appear to work hard when certain people are around yet they get promoted; 3.) Employees including management frequently throw other colleagues under the bus; 4.) Management only appreciates & favors employees who kiss butt - work ethic & quality comes second to how well you can kiss butt; 5.) Worst ""so-called"" management in the real estate industry - they have no clue on how to manage people & promote a positive work environment; 6.) Management lacks communication skills & has no patience to help others when asked unless you are considered a ""favorite"" as they only want to see certain people succeed."
19,Arbor Commercial,Underwriting Analyst,2013-08-18,1.0,,There are no pros to working in the underwriting department.,The company is a revolving door. Either people are always leaving or they are firing employees for no good reason. They under-pay and overwork their employees. I would say that more than half the underwriting division was looking for a new job. Worse company I have ever worked for.
