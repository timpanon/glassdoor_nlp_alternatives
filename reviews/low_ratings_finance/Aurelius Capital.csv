0,Aurelius Capital,Analyst,2016-06-16,1.0,Analyst,"Ashamed - looking at Bloomberg headlines ""Billionaire hedge fund managers to Puerto Rico: Close schools to pay us back"" and BBC ""Hedge funds tell Puerto Rico: lay off teachers and close schools to pay us back"" made me question why I would devote my talents and energy here. The economy is not more efficient due to these actions - there is no social good, no benefit, other than a few well-off members who are literally destroying education in Puerto Rico, and devastating many countries.",Everything is a mess - I don't know how this place sleeps at night - pure devastation. Think about how your work affects others' lives. How can you be so cruel and self-fish? Find another job!!!
