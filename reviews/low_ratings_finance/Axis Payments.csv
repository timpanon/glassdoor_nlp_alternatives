0,Axis Payments,Never Work Here!,2017-01-18,1.0,Field Sales Representative,Nothing!! Nothing at all. This is a JOKE not a JOB.,"If there was a zero star option I would input it for this company.
First off, this is a horrible company to work for.
The leads are NOT qualified! The team leader send you the leads through email and don't know anything about the leads themselves. After you are hired they tell you how they actually qualify leads. Which is a load of crap. Both the process and after you've invested all this time they finally tell you. 
The businesses don't even know you're coming, nor why you are there, nor what you are offering. In some cases the leads were at peoples houses or the owners weren't even there.
I would get a lead at around 10:00am and it was a drive from my house, then the 2nd lead would be close to the 1st lead but not for another 4 hours. So you are just sitting in your car doing nothing.
Save yourselves gas, time, money, headaches and driving back and forth.
False advertisement.
No matter how much they tell you, the leads are NOT qualified!!
In the end it turns into a door-to-door sales position which they assure you when you take the job that it is not. Lots of deceitfulness going on. 
I would NOT recommend this job to my worst enemy."
1,Axis Payments,"""Axis? Really? So... like.Osama?"" Quote  from ""qualified lead""",2016-12-15,2.0,,None really. Made various bonus's and such but still averaged less then part time somewhere else.,Company is a total joke. Everyone i spoke too lied though their teeth about everything I asked. You will go door to door cold getting rejected after rejection. The leads are NOT verified as they promise. YOU ARE CREATING LEADS FOR THEM. Company has had 7 different names in the past 5 years. There's much better company's that are much easier to pitch then something that immediately inspires thoughts of war and terrorism.
2,Axis Payments,Qualified Leads - No,2016-12-02,1.0,Sales Advisor,Can't think of any at all,"Eight hour webinar to start - very distracted trainer, constant long pauses - maybe she was reading her email? I don't know. No real advice on sales, except  ""make them like you.""
Was told I would be given qualified leads - all three of the first group had never heard of Axis, and had no idea I was coming to visit them, total waste of time. When I reported this to the group leader, he said ""well, you can go anywhere.""
100% commission job - no draw or base,"
3,Axis Payments,This company is garbage!!!!! Horrible leads and waste of gas...,2016-11-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I assume the money once you make a sale but Im still trying to make a sale, its not easy.","I went on 5 leads and the all were scattered everywhere, the lead had me go 15 miles out then 13 miles back from where I came from then 10 miles back and I was just going back and forth...all for nothing. All the leads were either not willing change, not there, or didn't need it. The city I'm in is horrible selling this equipment and Im debating weather to leave the company or give it another chance to see if my luck changes."
4,Axis Payments,Regional Sales Advisor,2016-11-18,3.0,Trader,You're your own boss. Team leaders are professional. Organized.,Leads are suspect. Lack of effort will result in a poor result.
5,Axis Payments,Sales rep,2016-11-12,1.0,,Sales manager was nice and hours were flexible. They were really good about helping reps close sales and were easy to work with.,You only make $75 for a sale and the ticket has to be closed before you get it.
6,Axis Payments,Good money!,2016-11-11,4.0,Anonymous Employee,They give you good leads to work off of and it makes it much easier to close a sale with three help from your tear leader.,Alot of driving is my only con.
7,Axis Payments,This is a scam,2016-11-09,1.0,Regional Sales Representative,"So, I sat thjrough a semina where I learnt nothing and the trainer said you do not need to knwo anything in order to sell their product. ""Just show up ..."" dressed like JoeDicky and if they like you they will sign up with you. Just get them on the phone with me"" says the Team leader, ""Tthats your job, real easy, show up and get them on the phone with me"" 
 show up and get them on the phone with me""

How can any self respectin sales person do such a job and thrive, then come the wacky leads, have you running around the country like a chicken with your head ciutoff chasing after vacant lots","You will chase vaccant lots and show up to businesses that obviously said they were not interested. Tese people at axis hope that by you showing up with a smile business owners will sign up with you.. 

""hey, I am a regional sales rep, I dress liek Joe Dicky and have a great smile, give me all your business info and trust me with your all of your money. I know nothing of rates, the company, or the process. In fact they hired me off the streets, over the phone  yesterday."""
8,Axis Payments,"Customer Service Rep, Sales!",2016-11-09,2.0,Outside Sales Representative,"Friendly Manager, Eric Brown!
That's it!
Flexible","Terrible Webinar 8 hour training!
Very poor leads!
Tough sale!"
9,Axis Payments,Genius idea!,2016-10-31,5.0,Regional Sales Advisor,So they set us leads up so it takes the numerous hours away from cold calling.  And management helps us makes the sales so we are guaranteed to bring in income.  Good products.  Decent training and continued support not to mention how good the schedule is. I can spend time with the wife and kiddos. Not any complaints here.,Not any complaints here whatsoever
10,Axis Payments,It's sales.,2016-10-25,5.0,Salesman,"I like how I can control my own check.  If you aren't motivated or good at sales then you probably shouldn't be in sales or blaming others for your down fall. It's has been easy for me,  but then again I'm a natural.  My bank account is nice right about now.",Don't hire ungrateful people.  Mcdonald's would be a more suitable choice for some.
11,Axis Payments,extremely flexible,2016-10-25,5.0,Outside Sales Representative,"I am no longer with the company due to moving out of the country but when I was there I thoroughly enjoyed it. Worked my own hrs and had plenty of time, not to mention the money was fantastic getting paid every day. I don't nearly make as much now",The fact that I had to move away.
12,Axis Payments,Legit so far,2016-10-25,5.0,Sales Representative,I like it so far.  The teamleader has been really supportive and has helped me close several sales within my first 2 weeks. The recruiter was very nice.,I don't have Anything negative to say.
13,Axis Payments,Axis payments.,2016-10-23,5.0,Sales,"I've been with Axis for only a month but I'm so grateful to have been granted this opportunity. My team leader is extremely helpful and patient. I really appreciate him letting me learn at my own pace while also helping me close sales. Thanks to him i git my extra goods start $800 bonus within 6days..it's prob all going to my kids Christmas though! Outside of that, in this first month I've made about $3400! Awesome training and help from my awesome leader!",Wish I could make every sale but I know I can't.  I had a  few mix ups where I was talking to the wrong person but my leader was able to turn that around.
14,Axis Payments,Sales Reps,2016-10-21,5.0,Sales Representative,"Flexibility of Schedule. 2-3 leads a day. The more you work, the more opportunities you'll get. Unlimited earning potential!",Nothing to complain about this so far
15,Axis Payments,one word amazing,2016-10-19,4.0,Sales Representative,Making good money and loving it. Thankful,No cons at all at this time..............
16,Axis Payments,Single mom and loving it!!!,2016-10-18,5.0,Account Manager,"My earnings at previous jobs wouldn't even allow me to take a family vacation.  This job has allowed me to do all that and more!  Great support system.  The appts make things alot easier,  but I also found a few on my own.  I've made over 5,200 in my first month.  Without Axis I don't know where I'd be.",Only thing I'd say is give me more appts. More appts more money for me
17,Axis Payments,This company is a blessing,2016-10-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Team leader support, preset leads. Got 2 sales my first day totaling over 700.00. I couldn't believe it! Got paid 2 days later. I think any negative review must be a competitor, or either they aren't good in sales so they need to blame anyone but themselves. I ended up getting one more sale my first week but had several in my pipeline for the next week, because I didn't just rely on the leads they set! I went and gotâ€¦",No cons thus far. I'm really loving the support from the team leader and the freedom.
18,Axis Payments,Waste of Time,2016-10-17,1.0,,"None, unless you like wasting your gas and time for a few dollars in return",Recruiter will tell you the leads are triple qualified.  Not one person expected me to walk through the door.  Most times the owner/manager weren't in the building.  Went to a few leads where the business was out of business.  You need to lease equipment to make any kind of money.  The only problem is most of the companies out there give the equipment out for free so to compete you need to do the same.  Expect to make $75 per deal or $125 if you generate and close the lead yourself.  I've been in sales for many years and this was definitely a waste of time and gas.  Keep looking for another company.
19,Axis Payments,"Don't waste your time . You're a 1099 employee. You'll waste time, money and gas",2016-10-14,1.0,Sales Representative,"None , unless you are reading this and decide to stay far away from this company. They are located in Tx and if you pull up the address you will see multiple businesses listed. All of which have horrible BBB ratings.","This place is a scam, don't work here and don't do business with them. I can't believe I wasted 7 hours on the phone ""training "" with them."
20,Axis Payments,Great,2016-10-12,4.0,,"Nice compensation plan, nice scheduling",no cons for this job
21,Axis Payments,This job is terrible,2016-10-11,1.0,Regional Sales Representative,"Nothing at all. Zero. Everything was bad. Making your own schedule is cool, but when you aren't making money it's completely pointless.","No one knows you are coming. Maybe 1 out of 30 leads knew. Didn't sell a thing. No one likes sales people. Team leader was pushy and got mad when I would leave even though the owners were basically chasing me out. Got sent to random towns 30miles away that's stores didn't even take cards and were closing down. Got sent to tons of towns that had no no phone service.  Had some ""leads"" that sent me to the wrong zip code and the business didn't even exist. Waste of gas. The training was 1 day. Knew nothing about what I was selling. Paid attention the entire time. You basically get thrown out in the field with a product manual not knowing anything about the products."
22,Axis Payments,Up date from Aug.3 2016 post,2016-10-05,2.0,Sales Representative,The hours and days were great!.,"I live in a state that is hard to sell stuff in esp. if the owner has been using something for a long time and dose not want to change. I drove to other cities and still got nothing. One of the team lead filling in for mine got mad at a business owner. I found another company that has their apps on line. I got a web site, business cards, and flyers I can hand out. I would not recommend this company to anybody, unless you get your own leads."
23,Axis Payments,Useless and cheater company,2016-10-01,1.0,Sales Representative,no pros only cons to do work in this company.,"They will tell you for business to business marketing but it is same as door to door marketing.
They will tell you, you will get the salary but you will not get anything.
You will also not get commission because no body will buy their swiping machine for plastic card. 
They just check it from google and tell you to go for job but when you will reach for marketing, people ask you who are you? We didn't call you to come here. Please get out from here.
You have to ready to pay your gas cost from your pocket. Salary is also not enough to cover gas cost or car cost. 
This job may be for associated degree students.
This job is not for graduate or master's students. 
I did job just 1 day and I leave the job. Even I didn't get any salary for that day."
24,Axis Payments,sales,2016-09-01,3.0,Sales,MONEY!!!!!!! i mean come on what else also i love being able to make my own schedule.,leads take a while to get a hold of thats really the only complaint i haven't been here long enough to notice anything else.
25,Axis Payments,Decent,2016-08-17,3.0,Regional Sales Advisor,"Would rate 3 1/2 stars of it would let me Good training, my TL is helpful, provides the materials and some warm leads not always the best but decent enough, good commissions, products are competitive. Pay is really the best about the company if you're able to get a sale the commissions are lucrative, just have to figure out how to get one.","Doesn't provide a badge or tshirt or anything which would help when meeting with the leads, 2-3 leads per day really isn't enough for me...I have over 15 years of experience so I wish they would give me more, but I just create my own get referrals etc"
26,Axis Payments,sales,2016-07-28,5.0,,good money . good people. it give you the opportunity to be a boss. work hard get good [pay. I recommend it to anybody. er,none I had no issues yet. hard work will pay off. you get what you in. nothing bad to say
27,Axis Payments,Company review,2016-07-18,3.0,,A lot of home free time,Leads don't know you're coming
28,Axis Payments,Regional Sales Advisor,2016-06-28,4.0,Regional Sales Advisor,I liked how quickly they got me out working. The training was pretty straight forward. I was a bit suspicious at first of how quickly the hiring process was but I have been with them for months without incident. I love that they process sales as they come in and I don't have to wait weeks for my commission check. The management is supportive and I feel like I am supported.,Some of the leads aren't great but merchant processing is easy to sell so I learned quickly to not depend solely on leads. I wouldn't mind when it's not the best lead I'd just like to know its cold going in
29,Axis Payments,Great Place to work,2016-06-23,5.0,Corporate Recruiter,Great company.  Really supports their salesman with great leads.  The bonus structure is the best!,None.  Great company  Fun to work for.
30,Axis Payments,Sales,2016-06-21,5.0,,Great company that knows the needs of small business owners. Fast start to a high paying commission. Must be dedicated to hard work because it definitely pays off at the company.,You want close every sale although that's what you want. The average of about 3 sales per week to start is realistic.
31,Axis Payments,Appoitments for leads,2016-06-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The training was good and explained everything about the company.  Team leader available to help you close deals on appoitments. Schedule Monday-Friday with weekends off and run three appoitments daily.  This company have a great system in place, but needs improvement a lot with the marketing department scheduling leads.","The problem I have is with the market team who is scheduling the appoitments with the business owners.  I'm doing everything I'm suppose to do with the presentation, but when finish the business owner just purchase a equipment or my team leader calling me telling me we couldn't do anything for the particular business because of the equipment software. Why am I being sent on appoitments if we can't service them? I've been here almost a week and all I've been doing is burning gas and I'm working the leads."
32,Axis Payments,Don't Do It!,2016-05-23,1.0,,None I have nothing good to say!,"They tell you there is a $800 bonus but, don't tell u it's after I make 3 sales that close. They have you running around tying to sale a product that most companies have. Waste of time!"
33,Axis Payments,sales advisor,2016-05-17,3.0,Sales Associate,so far so good no complaints,NOTHING AS OF YET juat started
34,Axis Payments,Sale,2016-05-10,1.0,Saleman,ZERO - RUN FROM THIS COMPANY !!,"The Lead are a Joke and your totally Screwing the customers, With 3 or 4 year contracts. and high rates. The service after the sale is awful, For both the salesmen and the customer. Run away from this company before you screw up someones business"
35,Axis Payments,Out sales,2016-05-03,2.0,Anonymous Employee,I like to travel and the freedom,The weird part working for them is you have to get your client to talk to your team leader. A lot of owners show me the expression of not buying anything then get out. My question is so you still get paid if you don't make a sale.
36,Axis Payments,Terrible,2016-04-18,1.0,,Nothing is good about this company at all they are frauds.,Everything is wrong with this company it is all fake. They post their own good reviews.
37,Axis Payments,Horrible and please step away,2016-04-06,1.0,Sales Representative Without Sales,None get out. Not the right company and nothing good to say other than u will enjoy driving around circles.,"All reviews here are fake. I work for them and had my butt scream at many times. Stores don't want u there, I left after a few days could not waste my time and gas on no results."
38,Axis Payments,field representative,2016-04-06,1.0,Field Sales Representative,The only pro I can list is the ability to make my own schedule.,"The appointments that were set were not appointments at all.  they give you a day's worth of training and expect you to go and sell their product.  These small business owners struggle with day to day expenses and in today's economy, even fight loosing their business.  The information fed from the upper management office in TX seem to be legit, until the contract is sold, then the angry calls started.  I even had to pay a merchant 650 bucks to end a previous contract because the company said they would, manager said to note right it on contract, then the customer service line said I was lying about it when the customer heard the whole conversation to begin with.  DO NOT work for this company.  They have no idea how to build legitimate trust with the merchants and really do not focus on the company.  They focus on how many contracts a day they can get.  Plus, the bonuses were really crap to begin with. I could not support my family of 4 on it, and just ended up wasting gas."
39,Axis Payments,Account Manager,2016-03-31,5.0,Account Manager,"I love the company, and have made a decent amount and supporting my family for the past 5 months.",I do not have any
