If you’re in college second or first year this is a decent start for a business major.","Like the title says, it’s not your knowledge of the banking industry that’ll get you promoted, or your degree it’s getting into the click/group. You can be here for 5+ years and at most you’ll move up a once on merit alone if that."
14,BCB Bank,Okay Job,2019-05-02,3.0,Bank Teller,BCB Bank is a small bank and you can easily get to know everyone fairly quickly if you are social. The employees I work with are pretty cool. Management worked with my school schedule.,"If you have connections to upper management, that is how you will move up. It's more about whom you know than what you know. There is a high turnover rate because of poor management. Can turn into a toxic environment."
15,BCB Bank,Stay far far away,2018-10-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,They will entice you with a higher pay but it is like cheese in a mouse trap,"Holidays - they do not recognize 4 federal holidays (even the govt is off)/ Nepotism - if you are related to the CEO / board member(s); you could kill someone and still be employed/ Senior Management - clueless, distasteful and surprising inept/ Lack of Communication / Hierarchy non-existent/ Medical Benefits - HORRIBLE/ Just stay far far away and do not fall for their gimmicks in the hiring process"

17,BCB Bank,Teller,2018-02-16,1.0,Teller,"Ummmmm... yea, about that. You get 20 days of PTO. That’s literally the only benefit to working here. If you’re looking for more pros out of a company, I highly suggest you look elsewhere.","LONG hours, no yearly raises, pathetic amount for a yearly bonus, low pay, favoritism among senior management, corporate office is disorganized, high turnover, horrible management and hostile work environment, horrible systems, lack of communication between corporate and retail, nepotism, etc.

Don’t have enough time to list everything wrong with this “bank”."

19,BCB Bank,#metoo,2017-12-07,1.0,,"Very familial culture, made some great friendships and company seems to be growing.","Stay away from CEO if you’re a female. Avoided making eye contact or shaking his hands at various events throughout my time  after being propositioned by him a few times. I know I wasn’t the only one and many feared for their jobs if they said “no”, reported it (He basically runs HR) or didn’t flirt back (there goes that raise or promotion)."
20,BCB Bank,Bank Teller,2017-10-25,2.0,,Great experience if it is your first time in a banking environment to learn the basics.,Very poor training and the management places a premium on customers over employees. The hours are difficult and they are not very lenient or flexible with scheduling.
21,BCB Bank,Under appreciated and under staffed,2017-10-21,2.0,Loan Administration & Closing,"Decent amount of vacation days, meet lifelong friends, good place to start out, accommodating to school/kids schedule, office is quiet for the most part","Understaffed, not appreciated for all the work you do, only see what’s wrong and not your accomplishments, favoritism, bad pay"

-Unfair salary pay
-Incompetent front line staff, giving bad information to customers"
25,BCB Bank,Teller,2016-09-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Promotes internally, pto, and not a stressful environment. Most other banks have quotas unlike bcb. Upper management is easily accessible and are always nice. If you work hard they will promote you fast.",Doesn't really have much cons besides pay. Because of low pay there is a high turnover.
26,BCB Bank,Avoid at all costs,2016-08-03,1.0,,None that I can think of,"Where do I begin, from the BOD to all levels of Upper Management, this institution breeds back stabbing, empty promises and most importantly a culture of inefficiency."
27,BCB Bank,Beware,2016-08-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Great health benefits and certain people are trust worthy.,"Bank plays favoritism starting from the president.  You get to move up if he likes you or if you do favors.  They don't compensate hard work, upper management will not survive in real world as all positions have been bribed or votes fixed even board members."
28,BCB Bank,Not worth it,2016-07-22,1.0,Lending,"great coworker's, great hours, overtime available if doable","Poor management, low Compensation and too political."
29,BCB Bank,Extremely Political,2016-04-27,2.0,Assistant Vice President,"Paychecks never bounced, good salary.","C-level management works on the ""good ol' boy"" system, and the current CEO (Tommy) runs the show.  Lots of backstabbing, backdoor deals that get broken more than they're upheld, and empty promises."
30,BCB Bank,Decent,2015-11-27,3.0,Teller,"Growth potential, hires from within, small bank, upper management is reachable, adequate semi thorough job training, decent company to work for","Long long long hours, only major holidays off, very cliche, needs to cross train all employees, update bank system, lots of paperwork, better employee incentives"

32,BCB Bank,Great Potential for Growth,2015-03-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I like working close to home and interacting with people I know from town.  The bank is very involved in the community, and that was a big draw for me.  I always see their logo on all of the kids' sports teams.  The bank is also big on hiring from within and helping employees grow. There are always job postings for different positions, and many managers have worked their way up from the branches. I like knowing there are other opportunities for me if I want to leave the branch. There is a good health plan.",It is a small bank and does not always have everything that Bank of America or TD does; it can be difficult to explain that to customers who don't want to hear it.  Customers can be hard to deal with in general at times.  The dental isn't that great.
33,BCB Bank,Great working environment and nice people,2015-03-03,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"work and life balance, nice co-workers","low pay, employee turnover rate is high"
34,BCB Bank,Extremely poor management,2015-02-21,1.0,Human Resources,"CEO SEEMS like a nice guy. Nice work hours, no weekends for me at least. They hire and allow advancement from within the company first before looking outside.","I've never worked for a dept that was as poorly geared as this one. For such a growing company it's still driven on horses and carriages. They have such outdated standards and procedures and refuse to listen and change with a more modern process. Welcome to working with type writers instead of the internet. Sad when you have to forget how things run in 2014 to how things ran in the early 90's to work for a mediocre company. I understand backstabbing is also in every company but the amount in the hr dept especially hearing about sensitive information is ridiculous.  I am glad I don't work here anymore because it's a sad environment.  Also, I am wary about working under a manager who is also vice president of an important dept who is as clueless as this one."
35,BCB Bank,So much potential.... If only the company really cared...,2014-05-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Great place to start a career to gain experience.,"Great co-workers and the customers are wonderful with the exception of a very few who think they can get away with anything and everything because ""they know someone"".

38,BCB Bank,Horrible Bank to Work at.,2013-12-18,1.0,Loan Closing,Small Community Bank  easy commute,Poor management especially loan administration and loan closing. Management very clickish and will discuss personal information about other employees to subordinates
39,BCB Bank,Horrible place to work,2013-06-13,1.0,Teller,If you live in the Bayonne/Jersey City area it is easy to commute to.  Good start job for high school or first time job seekers. Branch managers are great people to work for if it was not on this company.,"You are hired as part time but work full time with no benefits. There is always someone getting fired or leaving. No way to advance unless you are family or friend of someone in a higher position.  Always fear not given that special customer what they want because they will call a board member and get it done even if it is against policy, which will in turn cause you to get reprimanded."
