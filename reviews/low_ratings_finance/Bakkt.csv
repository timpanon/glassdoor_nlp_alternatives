0,Bakkt,A startup digital currency company,2022-03-31,3.0,Dev Lead,Flexible hours; well funded; some revenue generated.,"Business plan not very clear, or realistic."
1,Bakkt,Management needs to open its eyes,2022-03-29,2.0,Director,You get to put crypto on your resume,"In short, Bakkt has no idea who it is or what it wants to be. For such a long time, it was the app, the app, the app, everything about the app. When the app launch bombed and didn't perform like they wanted it to, the story changed. Supposedly it was never JUST the app -- the app was just one piece of the Bakkt platform and they've always been a B2B2C company. That's what they'd like you to think, but the story changed every few weeks when the message wasn't getting across.

It's very much so a top-down culture. Particularly, every single week the executive team had a new hire -- a new EVP or SVP of this, that and the other. Meanwhile, people who are actually doing the work are desperate for help. And it's not a matter of not vocalizing that need because when people complained about needing extra help, the executive team liked to just focus on all of the open positions and claim that they're trying. Positions go vacant for months on end because hiring is a joke and absolutely not a priority, which leads me to my second point.

Because of this culture, there is absolutely zero room for growth. If there is an open position that you'd want, well they're just going to bring in someone. And that was happening since the day Gavin Michael came on board. There's no internal promotion because he's bringing over all of his buddies. Just look on LinkedIn. Practically every single person came from Citi or worked at Citi at one point in their career.

Diversity and inclusion was a joke. Because it's basically just all of Gavin's friends, there was zero diversity of thought either. When he came in and couldn’t actually make anything successful, he just reverted to what he knew — banking. He was even pushing for a return to the office even for employees who started at the company working remotely before he joined. 

The company just went through a reorganization and leveling exercise. HR will tell you they brought in an outside consulting firm to handle it all but that seems like an odd coincidence that downgraded a lot of the original employees and boosted all the new ones.

My advice? It's a fine place to work for a few months and have that crypto experience on your resume. But, it’s going downhill fast so don't even think about it as a long-term career choice unless you're already friends with Gavin."

3,Bakkt,Entry level only,2022-03-26,1.0,Travel Helpdesk,"Benefits, time off, schedules(for some, favorites can be played).","Racist environment, no meetings with direct manager, low pay for higher roles, company values having incompetent people over people who can actually learn to do the job correctly."
4,Bakkt,I would not recommend anyone to work here.,2022-03-13,1.0,Director,"Pockets of good teams and good micro cultures, inconsistent though.","The C-Suite, new CEO (first time CEO) has brought in people who are not qualified to build programs, products, close deals, etc. additionally. Significant creation. of a clique-ish culture.

Employees are NOT valued accordingly within the company, the top of the house straight up does not care ( or perhaps know how) to provide support to teams via staffing, clear strategic direction, professional development, etc.

As an example, look at recent departures over last 8 to 10 months, nearly all of the previous leaders have left."

10,Bakkt,n/a,2022-01-11,4.0,Anonymous Employee,It is a start-up company.,There are a few organizational issues but they are actively being ironed out.
11,Bakkt,Run,2022-01-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,You get to put crypto on your resume,"Terrible leadership who don't ask questions and think they know best, then they're surprised when they learn something in front of a customer. The CEOs buddies don't push back and think everything is easy because they came from a large bank. ""Leveling"" exercise was teased for a year and ended up being a great demotivation tool, so now everybody is leaving. When they ask people if they can be saved with cash or title, the answer is always no, which tells you how bad the culture is."
12,Bakkt,Bad place to work,2021-12-22,2.0,Engineer,"The company is trying to do something very unique and interesting. Lots of potential just the wrong people in leadership positions.
 good on a resume
Generally nice people","CRO is INCREDIBLY unorganized and unqualified
big talks about big name partners but deliver partners like mansqua (sp) bank????
unclear goals for the company this year, next year, next 5 years?
high turnover at the company because people are fed up with the lack of direction
weekly all hands doesn't allow for anonymous questions because leadership knows they will get drilled. instead you are forced to have your camera on and ask live which makes it hard to really ask questions you care about."
13,Bakkt,A sad future,2021-12-22,2.0,Product,Working on new product relating to loyalty programs and crypto.,"Since the CEO has taken the helm, he's insolated himself with an executive team of idiotic new bankers. These people are dinosaurs, lack any vision. Number one priority was to go public, even though our product has terrible engagement. They try to trick investors on how many users are actually doing anything of value across the platform. Hint, not much. Due to this, they don't care about the mobile app at all, and instead try to convince the rest of the company that we're a B2B2C company, and always have been! Now the focus is try and embed Bakkt into partner apps.

Every week we have these terrible Thank You all hands meetings. A bad joke where the CEO runs a clown show of a presentation, reporting on metrics that don't matter to try and convince everyone we're on the right track.

They delayed a reorganization for months stringing along the employees. When we went public, the leadership team enriched themselves and now we're seeing founding executives leaving. There's been an egress of many of the smarter people, and I can't blame them."

16,Bakkt,This is not a crypto company,2021-09-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Company is backed by ICE, so there is no way it will go under. As it is going public lots of buzz around the name so good time to exit using the crypto affinity.","All execs are now bankers focusing on building a top-down banking culture. If you want to work at a company where they don't value your talent but say ""thank-you"" every Friday but then backstab you for promotions or pay hikes go work at Bakkt.

All the original people who built this company are leaving at a rapid pace as it becomes into a bureaucratic nightmare with red tape everywhere from workstations to getting anything done.

More importantly this is not a crypto company at all. They are only focused on pleasing whatever the hot take of the day from the CEO is without any decisions based on reality. From NFTs to Loyalty assets, everything under the sun is a priority one-day and forgotten the next."
