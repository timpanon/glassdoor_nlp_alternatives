3,Bank of China - New York,Toxic Place with less respect (in one of the risk management department),2021-11-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- They will organize the virtual departmental social gathering events and requires all employees to attend. 
- They will schedule so called ""career development catchup"" with you which is more like a brainwashing session. Instead of giving you the real career coaching, they try to make you believe you are good for nothing and here is the only place you can survive.","- They will give you work without reasonable timeline. They never care how long you need to spend on the work. They only care if you can finish the work by the date they committed which highly relates to their promotion. If you fail to complete it, you will get into trouble. On the other hand, you won't get any credit if you stay up late and complete the tasks, because it is still below their ""expectation""
- Most of the time, the manager does not fully understand their job, but I would say they are pretty good at playing office politics.
- They will give you a call or message you whenever they want (usually during lunch hour or after 6pm). If you don't respond, they will give you a hard time.

Cheap cafeteria lunch, but hat's about it for the pros of working here.","The Bank would rather save money and work their employees to exhaustion than hire more staff. They also hire so many consultants to save money, but it would probably benefit for them to hire more full time employees to save time and resources on training and constantly having to replace them. Hierarchy here is toxic. Not enough training for newcomers. It is pretty normal for everyone to work well past 5pm because there is too much work to do and not enough people to do it. It also takes an average of 3 years to get promoted, sometimes more. It's a joke. Salary is low."

I don't believe this is a representation of the healthy corporate or social culture in China (not what I experienced in living in China) and it is not a typical representation of healthy corporate America (I worked in corp Am for years as well).

The management is bad, don’t have expertise, can’t make decisions, play a lot of politics. The atmosphere is discouraging for young people."
46,Bank of China - New York,Worst place ever,2019-08-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The only pro is their benefits.  Competitive salary is only paid to people they like.,"So many:
1) poor culture - no one wants to take on responsibility.  Everyone plays the blame game and loves to gossip.
2) incompetent management - majority of the SVP and EVP just attend meetings and shout slogans.  No meaningful guidance  or useful support is given to subordinates because they don’t know what to do.
3) little recognition - if you did a good job, the credit goes to the manager.  If you mess up, then you take the fall.
4) poor professionalism - witnessed many shouting matches in the office.
5) no promotion - I’ve known some people that have been AVP for over 20 years.  Small salary raise.
6) HR is God - the HR Dept can reject other Dept managers’ hiring or promotion decisions.  The bank doesn’t rehire former employees <- very few in the bank knows this because there’s no transparency to what HR does.
7) lack of technology - the most manual bank I’ve seen.  For example, you have to manually fill out a request form and chase down signatures to get access to a system.  No remote access is given to employees; only EVPs can have that.  On a snow day, you have to either come to office or take a vacation day.
8) petty rules - you need to be at the office by 9am sharp.  If you are late by 15 mins, you need to provide written explanations along with supporting evidence to why you are late.
9) head office monitoring - each Dept has a management level person from head office to monitor you.  That person doesn’t do any actual work. His or her only job is to make sure you don’t abuse any office supplies and you adhere to #8 above."

Oh wait... probably another good thing, cheap cafeteria and free dinner if you stay beyond 7pm.","Too many cons and the biggest con is that HR wields too much power in this organization. These people do not even understand the business or the sense of urgency or even any form of risk management. They would rather jeopardize the bank with their antics. They also have processes which are unclear, not transparent and changes faster than the weather, not informing or updating departments on the new processes.

In addition, poor compensation, long working hours, no progression route and everything is paper and pen. You need to obtain like loads of signatures to get something. Seriously, just build a simple routing system or go buy a software? It is not that difficult, more efficient."

62,Bank of China - New York,"Disgusting Environment, Mean Managers and Co Workers",2017-07-09,1.0,,"None,except the fancy building and the Bryant Park location.","BEWARE, THIS IS NOT A PLACE FOR ANY SECOND GENERATION ASIANS OR AMERICAN PROFESSIONALS. Period. Once inside the building, a totally unexpected experience awaits the unprepared. A really backward and unprofessional environment, reeking of third world state owned corporations and a semi-unionized feel resides here. Backstabbing is very common, unseemly arguments between employees and also with their managers are frequently seen, Everything negative gets characterized as ""culture"" and thus rationalized.. There are a lot of interns who are recent Chinese graduates in need of a visa to extend their stay in the US. Around them are mostly incompetent, rude and immature workers with poor standards. Meetings are incredibly badly managed as there is no real authority that works except the CEO's.

The department heads as well as EVP's are Chinese expats. Aside from lack of adequate knowledge and skills in the disciplines they are sent to manage (by western standards) they suffer from poor English abilities and with little knowledge of the US marketplace and norms of doing business here as well as treating employees.  As a result, employees who do not know Chinese are often misunderstood, have little influence and are not treated well.   

In general employees are borderline belligerent and very hard to motivate and manage. It's as if they know the bank can't do without them. A big part of their day goes towards blaming others, speaking ill of others, questioning and avoiding responsibility and ownership.  People literally walk out of restrooms without washing their hands and the pantry areas are hard for the janitorial staff to keep clean and hygienic. 

What else? BOC has a bad reputation among 3rd party vendors and consultants. Most have had a very bad experience working with the bank's employees. 

To sum up, my advice to any job seeker  (Chinese or not) is simply do not work here."

They don't have the TAP (Tuition Assistance Program) like other banks within NY. You can cash any unused sick/vacation days/personal days at the end of the year if they are unused(unless you leave before then then you it will be paid out on a prorated basis).,"You don't really learn that much here. Work is too easy/light/not challenging. Most of the tasks is handed to more senior people from china leaving new hires moping around all day with nothing to do. They hire too many chinese and not enough diversity here. Most of the people hired aren't native speakers which causes a language barrier. The pay is severely underpaid for the many roles here. It is too hierarchical here too.

You have to wait 6 months for the following:  PAID vacation days, 401k contribution, personal days, dental, vision and a few others. This is unacceptable. You are basically hired as a ""temp"" with zero benefits until at least 4 months into the job and thats when you get your sick days and medical benefits."

Another major con - the whole company is lack of management. Senior managements are ALL sent from China, and will change every 2-6 years. Therefore, there is a glass ceiling for local employees. Managements have no understanding of the local market and the business, nor they know how to manage the employees professionally. If you don't know how to please your boss, or help your boss to please their boss, you won't be given opportunities. They see employees as tools of them, instead of a human or a friend. Most of the time, your department head has no experience in the particular area, so they rely 100% on you to know everything, bring in the business, solve all problems and finish all the work. Another word - no coach and training, you will have to learn everything and finish everything by yourself. Lastly, you will be assigned to a lot of redundant and meaningless work, which are out of your job responsibilities."
