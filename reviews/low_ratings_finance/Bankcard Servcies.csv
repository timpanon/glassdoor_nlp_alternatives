1,Bankcard Servcies,A good company to settle down.,2021-08-17,4.0,Marketing Coordinator,"Comfortable & flexible. Love my team, but it will depend on which team you join.","Low pay, not too much room for growth. Not to much company benefits, but it's ok."

6,Bankcard Servcies,"If you do not speak Korean, do not bother",2020-02-07,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Never fires you because employee turnover rate is huge.,"Out of 150 HQ employees almost everyone is Korean except for 1 filipino and 1 mexican.  Without using Korean, communication is just impossible. Employees are heavily cliquey. Unless you are Korean grown up in Korea or Koreatown, you will have to eat your lunch by yourself. Every day is a  just battle here regardless of your title and duties thanks to broken internal processes and bunch of sloppy in-house developed tools that employees themselves don't use fully due to their bad design and utility. Finding a customer's phone number needs at least 3-4 different windows popped open. Office building heavily smells bad. Heaters do not turn on unless its below 45F. Air conditioner do not turn on until interior gets above 85F.  Salaries are well below other company of this size because the merchant processing industry itself do not pay well. If you are one of OG who stayed with CEO Patrick since the beginning of the company when it occupied a corner of a office building on Wilshire blvd in Korea Town  20 years ago then you get decent salary. Any one new should not expect bright future here. If you are a middle aged Korean person with almost no English skill and trying to avoid serving bulgogi at some Korean restaurant then this is your perfect spot. By the way, this company only closes for NYE, X-mas, July 4th, and Labor Day weekend. Some president or famous reverend's birthday? Come to work!"
