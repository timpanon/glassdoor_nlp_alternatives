1,Bederson,Senior Accountant,2018-07-16,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Small, helpful, young environment,  different types of jobs, summer hours","Unorganized, segregated, every boss has favorites"
2,Bederson,Terrible,2018-04-03,1.0,Senior Accountant,Very nice staff that you work with. CPE is provided,"They won't hire enough employees making it stressful year round. No dental. No vision. Average medical. The technology is old and goes down frequently, entirely due to the IT consisting of a single overworked employee. Employee policies are inflexible and outdated entirely due to the lack of not only an HR department, but a single HR professional. Sometimes employees will not get a raise, not a bad raise, no raise."
3,Bederson,Better CPA firms in the area,2017-09-29,1.0,Senior Accountant,"Benefits like tax season meals are par for the course, but I suppose that counts. I had a poor experience here and can not recommend it to anyone","Poor culture, inflexible working arrangements, mandatory suits is an archaic and outdated policy, partners may slam doors, managers rarely are willing to offer guidance"
4,Bederson,Terrible Experience,2016-11-16,1.0,Accountant,The only thing I would say this review is based on my experience a while back so hopefully things have improved since then.,"- No real training for junior staff.  Left to figure a lot of things out on your own.  Luckily some senior staff were nice enough to help me along.
- Most (not all) partners acted like they were better than the staff and wanted to be treated as such.  A definite structure that partners were the kings and staff were the peasants just lucky to be there.
- Someone mentioned a ""family atmosphere"".  The non-partner staff were pretty cool so I guess maybe in that respect.  But given the way partners treat you I find it hard to categorize it as such.  I guess its like a family where you have some cool siblings but terrible uncaring parents.

Again I hope things have improved but I can assure you it wasn't just myself who had a bad impression of Bederson.  I spoke to people who interviewed and had business dealings with Bederson and always walked away shaking their head."
5,Bederson,"Small accounting firm with a family atmosphere, friendly staff and caring management",2016-09-30,4.0,,"Flexible with time off, free lunch and dinner during tax season, good health insurance, friendly staff and partners, very professional environment, overall fun place to work","Not many company holidays, clients are mostly small businesses. Not much exposure, no training. Not the optimal place for someone looking for a lot of opportunity for growth or promotion"
6,Bederson,Small CPA Firm with very friendly staff but lacks of good management,2013-11-06,2.0,Staff,Good salary. Fine coworkers. Free food on tax season. Reasonable Hours. The Administrative staff was very professional and friendly. Some of the partners are nice and supportive with time off.,"There is a very clear line between staff, managers and partners. There is no training at all, and there is a Closed Door policy. No Manager o Partner have the time to explain you anything or is willing to help you develop your knowledge and grow in your career. The clients are small businesses and every year the same stuff, not that much exposure."
