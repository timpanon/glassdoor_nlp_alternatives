1,Bell & Company,Don't Even Go There! Warning! Turn Back!,2022-01-22,1.0,Account Executive,There are NO Pros At All!,"Everything is a Con! Seriously!

When I was told by my interviewer that he 'hated people' in my interview, I thought he was trying to be funny. But who says that to an interviewee in their first meeting - or any meeting - for that matter? Turns out that it was TRUE and he does hate people, especially everyone in the office - including his own bosses. But he's under their spell as well.

Management will promise you everything and end up giving you nothing at all.
They will dump on you from day one, not only with work, but also with insults and accusations.
You will Not get trained properly - if at all - and once They think you are ready (you don't get a say in that matter), you're at their mercy.

It's kindergarten class where they watch your every move. You're micro-micro-managed and stuck in office until 5:30 until you are ""ok'd"" to leave after you hear a chime go off. That is, if they don't ask you to stay late - which is almost all the time. If they don't see you staying late - even if you're all caught up on your work - they'll put you in their cross-hairs.

You Never meet any clients, there is No Gala and there are NO Bonuses, or even a Review. Like I said, they promise but never deliver.

Don't work there even if you are desperate - YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!"
