0,Bettina Equities,Management sucks,2021-07-17,3.0,Staff Assistant,"Decent work environment, but not shy about overworking. Bosses are really nice and make sure to reward employees with nice incentives.",Bosses are great but management is not. Cheap with giving bonuses and are sure to deny pay increases when they are more than well deserved. Don't expect to get a promotion here.
1,Bettina Equities,Bait and switch,2019-01-09,1.0,Bartender,"Great food, awesome owners. The bar manager was awesome, everything was measured and controlled, definitely a recipe for success. Still managed to be laid back individuals at the same time. Bar manager was awesome, despite one of the owners being a micro-manager nightmare.","I did more than anybody could have asked, considering i was being compared to cocktail experts, after clearly indicating i was coming from a background of beer and wine only, operating a small venue solo, but willing, and able to learn cocktails. 

I was hired as a full-time bartender, experienced with beer mainly, and wine also, needed instruction, cocktail-wise, but improved by leaps and bounds. Apparently not quickly enough though, despite never having any serious customer complaints brought to my attention. I received no pertinent feedback prior to my demotion to bar-back, and, although i was assured my hours wouldn't change, that turned out to be a lie. 

I'd be called in to bar-tend, even after my demotion, some days, only to be told minutes from arrival that i was not needed. 

Okay, I'm open minded, maybe i need to get better at the work flow and get promoted back to my previous position, as promised?

After being again, reassured i was being paranoid, they didn't want to get rid of me, and they appreciated me as a person...

Nope, now I'm running food, not even bar-backing anymore, being condescended to because i don't inherently know how my boss prefers i carry the silverware to tables, or how i prioritize the three tasks she's given me within the span of 20 seconds.

In addition to being reduced, again, without warning, and against their word, working only one day a week, around four to six hours. Not sustainable. After being hired for full-time, and quitting my full-time job to work here."
