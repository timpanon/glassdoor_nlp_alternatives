1,Bizfi,Executive management was out of control,2021-05-31,1.0,Underwriter,nice office schedule and hours.,high pressure sales and conflict of interest was SO PRESENT when it pertained to the business loans. Several rules and lending regulations were being broken or not followed. Even client's personal information and protection of privacy and personal data protocols were lacking. HR was a joke and I'm sure if some former employees sued they would have won their cases. Executive management was sexist and paid women terribly. The owners was shady and had a criminal record. Look him up. Not surprised the place closed down and everyone got laid off. I heard terrible stories regarding the female workers and how they were treated.

I heard they took all the Friday free lunches and monthly socials away now due to ""budget cuts"" and laying off people",Departments have been halved left and right for no reason.

15,Bizfi,Bizfi,2017-02-22,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Great opportunity to grow with a company that is doing very well and constantly expanding.  Good work atmosphere and the company invests a lot in its employees.,The fast pace atmosphere and nature of the business can sometimes be stressful.

Take a sick day and show doctors note to your boss next day. Take sick day for family or kids, they wants notes for that too. Too much micro management.
