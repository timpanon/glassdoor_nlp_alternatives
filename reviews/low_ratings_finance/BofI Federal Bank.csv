9,BofI Federal Bank,Wholesale/Correspondent AE,2018-09-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I can think of none.,"Management is vulgar, profane, denegrades staff, and is sexist.  The feel of the place is of being in the middle of a melt-down, each and every day.  There is a lack of professionalism from the top down, and if you are one who values a professional environment, you will not find it here.  All disputes are handled openly, and aggressive personel thrive.  There is no professional privacy, no professional courtesy, and no thought to handling individual employee concerns in a in a manner that does not involve absolutely everyone on or off your team.  Any employee can be overwhelmed all day, every day, by loud, vulgar, aggravated conversations which flow straight through the phone to the client.  Rather than this being considered the height of unprofessionalism, it is constant behaviour.  Management denegrades personnel in a sexist, vulgar manner.  I cannot comprehend this still going on in 2018.  In my time at BofI, 4 top producing colleagues left, one loudly, and with much vulgarity and dissatisfaction - which by the way had been tolerated for a long time.  Unbelievable.  Just remember - commissioned  employees do not leave well paying jobs at this rate EVER.  These are jobs people rarely leave, so enough said.  I'll move on to working for a company who knows how to handle a professional staff."
10,BofI Federal Bank,Mixed feelings about this organization,2018-08-28,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Trying to be innovative, nice technology and toolset.",30% turnover and management could care less. Not a place to look at if you want any work/life balance.
11,BofI Federal Bank,Stay away,2018-08-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Nice location in San Diego. Met a few nice people.,"How did I end up here?  Over a year of dealing with managers' and UW's attitude, that's all I got out of this job."
12,BofI Federal Bank,Another BofI employee dissatisfied with the mid-2018 bonus and merit raise,2018-07-17,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"There is always plenty of work to do.  Coworkers are generally kind and gracious.  The coffee machines and water coolers are nice.  Other than the company headquarters off La Jolla Village Drive, facilities have abundant hassle-free parking.  Most people in senior management including the CEO are affable and accessible.","The ""self-evaluation"" system may have made sense years ago when the bank was small, but it has degraded into a charade in which managers jigger their subordinates' numeric scores so that annual merit pay increases and semiannual bonuses fit a predetermined budget.  Mid-level managers seem to have their personal objectives weighted heavily toward cost control, with little emphasis on talent retention.  Pay has become quite disconnected from actual job performance, extra effort, long hours, dedication, loyalty, etc.

To anyone who has studied psychology, it is obvious that the compensation system at BofI is based on principles of Operant Conditioning originally described in B. F. Skinner's classic text ""Science and Human Behavior"" originally published in 1953.  Skinner's fundamental discovery was that behavior is controlled by consequences.

The use of unpredictable bonus amounts paid out at surprise dates roughly every six months creates what Skinner described as a ""variable-ratio and variable-interval"" schedule of reinforcement (i.e. pay) in exchange for work done.  Payments to employees are treated as the equivalent of rewarding a pigeon for pecking a target (work) by giving it kernels of corn (pay).  Skinner discovered that randomizing the amount of corn paid out and randomizing the timing of payments tends to increase and sustain the rate of pecking (work done) as compared to a simple schedule of a fixed amount of corn per peck.

But it seems that BofI's senior management read through Chapter VI (Shaping and Maintaining Operant Behavior) then dropped out of college (or at least Psych 103) thinking they had all the information they needed to get the most work out of people.  Later chapters of Skinner's book deal with the particular complexities of trying to control human behavior, one of which is a need to provide meaningful increases in reinforcement (pay) over time.  This need is partly addressed by BofI bonuses being paid partly in Restricted Stock Units that vest incrementally over three years.  That provides some incentive for people to stay past the next scheduled vesting date, and also creates an ever-growing pool of potential earnings that some people find difficult to walk away from.

But the very short median duration of BofI employee tenure demonstrates that people can and do walk away.  BofI has more than a typical rate of involuntary terminations, but by far most people who leave do so of their own free will.  Especially in an environment of very low unemployment, BofI is putting itself at risk of a mass exodus event.  Good people cost money.  Replacing them frequently costs a lot more money."
13,BofI Federal Bank,Dont make your life miserable,2018-07-13,1.0,Whatever They Felt Like That Week,I made great connections through BofI,"It's crazy to me how the reviews indicate how much better this company is treating their employees for the last year. I wonder if its any correlation to the fact that they finally hired a PR person to try and make their company look less like a disaster... Anyway, I'm going to keep this short and sweet as BofI has wasted too many years of my life. It's a mess. An absolute disaster. None of the departments communicate with each other, important things are getting half assed and items like ""checklists"" are being put on a pedestal. For the last 2 years of my employment there, I felt like they went to management and said ""make your good employees leave in any way possible"". They bring in outside people who know absolutely nothing of the department they are working in and have some crazy ego that prevents them from being decent human beings and learning what they are going to be in charge of. They encourage cliques and push people out if they don't fit in them. if you need a foot in the door then by all means, join the team and learn as much as you can and get out. if you've been there over a year and feel like you're having difficulty waking up in the morning to come to the nightmare that is BofI, just do yourself a favor and leave. It's worth it. Does anyone else things it's weird how high the upper management turnover is?"

16,BofI Federal Bank,Mortgage Consultant,2018-06-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Leaving work for the day,"Everything. It doesn’t matter what is said here, just read the responses by Bofi to see that they’ll use their response to blame your “attitude”, or to say you’re a “short-seller” because of their “growing company and stock”. Bottom line is that this company couldn’t care less for their employees and only wanted to squeeze every last bit out of you. They praised those who would work 12 hour days, and come in on weekends, but still give them nothing in return (oh, except stock options that vest in 3 years so you’re stuck with nothing anyway). Almost each manager is connected in some way (ie: frat bros, in each other’s weddings, etc) and may not even have a successful track record.

22,BofI Federal Bank,Beware,2018-04-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Independence and self-starters encouraged.
Lack of micro-management.
Most of the workers are kind people.
If you're a hard charger, thrive in a competitive environment and insults from management don't bother you, you'll do very well here (see Cons below).
Great free coffee machine.
Filtered water cooler 
Nice break room with free snacks and a vending machine.
Free gym access.
SD locations are in beautiful La Jolla.  Great place to walk at lunchtime and many good restaurants within 5-10 minutes.
Performance bonuses with cash and company stock.
I recommend Bofi for athletes, former military, and those with a capitalist mindset - thick-skinned individuals who thrive overcoming difficulties to achieve goals.","Many of the managers are not kind people.
A lot of changes underway, there's a lot of turmoil and instability here.  You have been warned.
It is not uncommon for someone to get so fed up and angry they quit on the spot.  First time I ever saw that.  I'm talking about experienced professionals, not snowflakes just out of school.
Cubicles don't have the privacy wall.  Completely open environment.  Only certain managers get an office.
Everyone is a VP of something.  The title is so diluted it means nothing.
These are not necessarily cons, just how it is:
-It's a capitalist environment, you're expected to do more with less 
-It can be very stressful and demanding 
-Managers like to work...a lot, including weekends, and expect their teams to do the same.
-Huge employee and management turnover.  If you work here expect to be burned out in less than a year.
-They'll sell you on the bonus.  For the uninformed, the government takes 55+% of any bonus pay.  Company stock does not vest for 3 years.  If the bonus is your motivation, expect to be disappointed with the take-home amount.
-Political skills definitely matter here.
-Don't miss this:  if you and your superior don't see eye-to-eye, there's no coaching.  You'll be marginalized and stripped of your duties until you quit or you'll just be fired if they can find cause.  Like I said, it's a competitive capitalist organization, just like the marketplace.  Don't expect to be coddled.  There's no hand holding here or layoffs.  It's dog eat dog.
To review, there are definitely positives to be found working here, but the reason for my negative review is I consistently saw good people treated poorly.  Don't be arrogant enough to think you're immune."
23,BofI Federal Bank,Salesperson,2018-04-25,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Top Bank in its class - always top of charts for Banking innovation and very high profits.

Read other review because they are not lying (except for the positive reviews that were obviously written by PR). Everything is based on fear and threats. Massive overtime is required. Daily yelling and berating people are daily occurrences, and the lies go on and on. Seriously, I would avoid it like the plague unless you are so desperate for money that you have to sell yourself as an indentured servant.

What you find on glass door that is negative is tame in comparison to reality but he pro is its true,They buy customers through acquisition and lose them once people find how customer service and products are non existent. For an internet bank they are antiquated in their technology.  Absolutely no collaboration. Silod lines of business. They are a third tier bank. No one uses them for daily banking. They lose 90% of their opportunities because of lack of capturing their clients whole business. Senior managers have absolutely no experience in relationships so they are shopping for the next sale while losing the clients they do have.  Managers walk around at 7pm to see who is and who isn’t still working.  Senior management is never held accountable. They call it a meritocracy when it’s really a dictatorship.  While it produces great returns it has no value. At some point they will hit  the wall as they can’t retain clients or quality employees. They recently hired someone to respond to glass door instead of fixing their problems. They have more positions open than any institution and it’s not tied to growth but turnover. People look over their shoulder wondering when they will be walked out many hoping they do. They stalk employees to see if they have posted their resume online on job sites.   They rule by fear.  If you have a family do not work here. You won’t see them.
31,BofI Federal Bank,Loan Servicing Representative,2018-01-04,1.0,Loan Servicing Representative,The Pay was really great,There are so MANY CONS WITH THIS BANK. Management does not take responsibility or want to assist with escalated issues. I felt I was treated differently than the other two loan servicing representatives. If you personally try and fix and issue for a customer it can take up to 3 weeks if it all to get  the internal request  completed. It seems like people don't care that our technology didn't work half the time and when you needed IT help it would take 2-3 days to get resolved.
32,BofI Federal Bank,Low pay and toxic culture,2017-12-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Free Corporate Chalet tickets to the annual Miramar Air Show (a limited amount and if your department actually announces when they are available)
-Free unsalted mixed nuts, trail mix, pretzels, animal crackers, coffee (though only refilled once a week and unsalted mixed nuts will be gone within 2 hours)
-Free parking
-3 weeks of annual PTO
-Interesting work and good experience (if you're in a department and have a supervisor that actually cares about your growth)","-Horribly low pay
-I was lied to on my offer letter about promotions. I was hired in February 2016 and the actual language on my offer letter was: ""You will be reviewed for a compensation increase in June 2016."" June comes around, and surprise, I was not even given the opportunity to be considered for a raise. I was told the Bank only gives raises once a year in June ONLY if you've worked there for a year. So for example, if you started in July 2016, then you would NOT be eligible for a raise in June 2017 because you would not have been there a year yet. You would only get your raise in June 2018 once you've passed your anniversary in July 2017. I accepted my job offer thinking I would get an opportunity to increase my insultingly low pay within a few months. Had I known this were the case, I would've definitely reconsidered accepting the offer. And when you ARE eligible for a raise, you are basically given a ""take it or leave it"" number (also below industry standard). No room for negotiation.
-The culture is toxic. You will constantly overhear people actively complaining about their job responsibilities and incompetency of coworkers. I've also seen backscratcher/teacher's pet behavior being rewarded over people who are actually there to do their jobs at WORK. I never actually realized all this until I started at my new workplace and discovered that wow, these are actually not normal behaviors to expect from your coworkers??"
33,BofI Federal Bank,Solid Place to Work with Opportunity for Growth,2017-12-06,4.0,Software QA Engineer,"The Bank provided stable, consistent growth that means job security, especially in software engineering. The VP of Quality Assurance in IT was excellent, and provided opportunities for growth and advancement within the team. The compensation and bonus structure is fair, and the review process it easy to tell how to meet the targets to get those bonuses. With regard to Software QA, there was a definite commitment to expanding those capabilities and creating positions specifically for that.","As with any highly regulated institution, there are some processes that are more difficult than they could be somewhere more casual.

You really got out of it what you put into it.  On top of that there were some great people working there when I was there.  If you needed help from somebody in another department there was always somebody available that could answer your question.  It took collaboration from multiple departments to make deals happen.

Training was very hands on and if there was ever a time a refresher was needed you could always refer to constantly updated procedures and process maps for anything related to your job role.  

BofI also knows how to throw amazing Christmas parties!","Really the only con that I could think of was the type of people chosen to be managers.  When I was working there I had a manager that was very proficient in micromanaging and it really got to the point where I did not look forward to coming to work everyday.  If I needed to take time off for something (which was something I rarely needed to do) I was given grief about it.  It was like walking on eggshells around this person, instead of constructive criticism I was given very vague and snooty feedback .  Not really a place I saw myself staying at for longer than a couple years.  Was just a resume builder for me.  Not only that but this was the first place in my extensive work history in banking where I actually would get panic attacks on the job, due to the hostile work environment that was caused by a member of management.

Additionally, trying to advance in the company also proved to be difficult as I needed my immediate supervisor's approval but was always denied opportunities to advance even with good performance reviews.  It was very discouraging to keep being denied, because early on when I first started working there it was emphasized that BofI believes in investing in their people and promoting from within.  I even expressed an explicit interest in moving up in a company and establishing a meaningful career and they promised me that when I had initially interviewed for the position, but that proved to not be the matter."

Having a background in sales and customer service I know there is a layer of crap you have to put forward to customers with anything you sell, but speaking highly of Bank of Internet products makes me question my morals and on most days just makes me sad. The policies do not benefit the customers and it is extremely difficult to make any of them happy and there is no escape. In the customer service department you are required to to log your every move for your metrics and you must always be in a ready status to answer your next call. Aside from required breaks there is no leaving your cubicle, so you are always available to talk to the next angry customer. There is no support from the management team when you have a difficult customer ( they are always off in meetings ""improving"" the department) so if you don't learn to deescalate a situation then you have to quickly get comfortable being blamed for every wrong doing of the bank that you have absolutely no authority to fix. The best solution I've found is evasion ""operations will have this solved in 1-2 business day"" and when they ultimately don't you cross your fingers and hope when they call back someone else picks up. However, it's highly unlikely because the team is severely understaffed so at least for that moment you get to hang up and stop the abuse for 30 seconds, until the next call comes through. 

And that's just the day to day, in the department bonuses have been removed so there is no bi-annual incentive to ""just hang on a few more months"" because an extra $1000.00 will help you pay some bills that you couldn't afford because "" raises aren't  given until July"" and the average hourly rate is $5 less then similar roles out there. 

Goals are unattainable and there is almost no way to ""exceed expectations"" taking on more responsibility will not reward you, it will only make each day even more unbearable. Being a top performer will give you gloating rights, but nothing more."

You must carefully assess your own objectives risks and constraints: Con artists, deplorable managers, fraudsters, and the inbred unite! It is that time of the year again the annual exodus of people is hitting the bank! This time Satan’s minions have gained a modicum of IQ points and have either denied or pulled back the bonuses. Any hint that you may be leaving and your bonus is severely cut or taken away! (Sounds like a class action suit to me) The lowly paid workers are rushing towards the exits. The inbreeds and highly paid remain. Wonder what that will do to the net interest margin? Oops that hurts Greg. The bank has recently hired a lot of highly paid workers with impressively fake resumes thus massively increasing G&A and making the bank less competitive. Oops there’s goes the banks “completive” edge of being a branchless bank. Unfortunately, because of inept management missteps the people that have been there for longer than a fort night have gotten a significantly smaller raise and bonus. Backstabbing nepotism galore. Zero training or any kind of communication between departments. Cross selling? Try again. There are no monetary incentives to increase/cross sell business or assets; therefore no one tries and no one cares.
In all seriousness look at the 10k before you come here: Massive employee turnover, CAGR of G&A, loan loss reserves levels vs similar competitors, where your business unit is located on the P&L, etc. The bank is buying deposits and other business units for a reason: management has spread their manure and can’t figure out why the bank won’t grow organically.

Management lacks ambition, direction and integrity. The Specialty Finance department has very deceptive practices, not only towards employees but customers as well. First off the advertisement for the job states well above what you will actually get paid. You will get paid a non negotiable 30k which they will only tell you about on your last interview or in your Offer letter. They will tell you that the sales reps are making anywhere between 50-90k when in fact if you ask people on the team what they're making, no one has made over 39K working there, a total of 39k is what the top sales person has EVER made there. It will take an average of 3 to 4 months to pay your commission. There is absolutely no sense of urgency to pay your commission. If you leave before your commission is paid out to you, the management team will gladly create contest, rigged so that only they can win so they can get your money. 

Also, you will learn nothing, you will NOT develop a skill set, you will NOT become smarter. In fact you will lose brain cells talking to customers who have no internet, no goals, and sit at home all day watching day time television. 

Also be prepared to deceive your customers and tell them they will get paid on certain dates, which you and management will know they will absolutely not get paid on. You will make promises  that Bank of Internet will not deliver on.

The tools you should have for sales support are constantly having technical difficulties. The inside sales software is constantly down, for hours at a time. It was a daily nuisance. You are expected to make at least 180 calls each day or 2 hours of talk time. You are also expected to come in on Saturdays at least once a month. That's 12 Saturday's a year with no additional pay increase. 

If you are talented, and looking to grow your skill set, if you're looking to challenge yourself and have a successful career, do not work here! If you have a college degree DO NOT work at BofI. This is where brain cells go to die. 

Also, those 5 star positive reviews by upper management are there to mislead you."

Do you crave the monotony of a dead-end job?  Bofi is the right company for you!  After you pass their wunderlic test, hang your brain up at the door because you won’t ever need it again.  Bofi doesn’t want you to think too hard at your job because once you do, it becomes painfully obvious that this bank is a giant shady cluster.  

If you’ve ever tried to open an account with them, it only takes a whopping 40 minutes of sitting on their new account-processing page for one to contemplate where their life went wrong and how any sane human being would want to open an account with a business called ‘Bank of Internet’.  However their in-house marketing team is quick to boast how big their numbers are and how many leads they generate from their eyesore, 75-box RMI forms.  But how can marketing be blamed? It’s just run by perverted old men breathing heavily over hot bimbos who wouldn’t know the difference between their head and a hole in the ground.  Sadly, hiring incompetent attractive people is not limited to marketing, but for all departments.  Just look at the kids hired for the Chief of Staff in the OCEO’s department.  This is what happens where there's no HR.

In summary, Bofi just needs fresh meat to keep in their grinders until they sell the whole thing off to some other bank. They will lowball you on the base salary and lie about how big your bonus is.  What ends up happening is that you will be let go before bonuses come out or tell you that you suck and only top performers get a full bonus. It won't matter what metric you put in for measuring your performance, it will be fleeced by your boss, their boss, and the department head to pad their own bonuses. This company's philosophy is ‘put out big numbers, lie their rear off, and pray someone will buy this worm-eaten, rotten apple while the skin appears red and shiny’.

Walking distance to great lunch and shopping options at UTC mall and nearby if you're at the HQ building. There are some truly talented people working there. Good place to learn about the banking industry, but not much else. I wouldn't wish this place on my worst enemy.","This is the absolute worst place I've ever worked. For starters, they low-ball you and offer a below market-salary, but try to entice you with a bonus (half cash, half stock). What they don't tell you is the stock takes three years to vest, and virtually no one is with the company long enough to realize any profit from that, not to mention their stock price has tanked in recent months due to a regulatory scandal.  You are a commodity; senior management sees everyone as replaceable, and as such, the pay reflects that. And has been said previously, no HR department. If you have a problem, you're pretty much on your own.

Bizarre, narcissistic, egotistical senior management; you are expected to drink the Kool-Aid. It's the BofI Way™ (read the values pamphlet written by the CEO you're given when you're hired, it's like reading a Chick tract). Virtually all of the decisions, including hiring, and technical, are made by the Chief of Staff, and as such, the company is very slow to make decisions, or invest money in it's infrastructure, people, or business development.

For an internet bank, the technology is subpar. When I started, I was given a 3 year old laptop that was inadequate, beat-up, and woefully underpowered for my work. When I asked for a newer one, the response was ""The Chief of Staff is trying to save money, so we can't order new laptops. And we have to swap people out who haven't connected to the VPN in over 30 days with desktops."" Seriously? One day in January, the whole office network went down, and there was no e-mail, or access to file shares. No failover, so the whole company was at a standstill the whole day, but they didn't send anyone home. Cost cutting strikes again.The applications that most of the employees use are straight out of 1995 and should have been retired years ago (I'm looking at you Silverlake/PC Lender).

High attrition seems to be the norm here. I started with a group of 10 other employees on the same day. When I left, only one person from that group was left, all of the others had left for better opportunities. And because of the high attrition rate, not many people know how to actually do their jobs, there is no staff continuity. There is zero training, zero career growth. You will stagnate."

I am surrounded by kind, supportive, highly talented coworkers, and the pace of work is fast without being overwhelming.  Every day introduces a new challenge, and I appreciate the ability to think critically and know I am contributing to something larger than myself.  I can see that many people who have voiced their opinions on Glassdoor have had experiences very different from my own, and I cannot speak to why there is such a discrepancy in our perceptions.  I can only state that, without exaggeration, I have never been this satisfied with a position in my professional life, and while I do not reasonably expect never to have a bad day, I can definitely foresee myself sticking around for the long haul.

The office location is stunning, by the way.

I imagine this company is not well suited to people who require a lot of guidance beyond their initial training, which I mean as a put-down neither of people who do nor of the company.  They expect the people they hire to be independent thinkers who will take the initiative to figure out systems and propose solutions on their own, asking questions when it is absolutely necessary.  This seems fair to me considering that, at least in my case, I wasn't brought in at the entry level.  I have been provided with the appropriate level of support and encouragement, but I am more than capable of paving my own trail most of the time at this point.  I'm quite pleased that I work in an environment in which I'm allowed to prove that I can do so.  I think most of my colleagues are.  They're whip-smart, and I think they would resent undue hand-holding.

I was in a pretty senior role and when the guy I had been reporting to left the firm, I was left completely on my own with no direction or any responsibilities beyond the ones I took on myself.

Despite supposedly reporting directly to the VP of my department, I didn't even interact with her until about 3 months into my time with the firm.

The good breed the good, and the bad breed the bad. Apple doesn't fall far from the tree, birds of a feather stick together, monkey see, monkey do- works both ways.

I've witnessed managers and supervisors discourage their employees from taking initiative, passing the buck because ""it isn't your job"", and have actually heard an supervisor say to another,  ""we don't go the extra mile here"".

I have been here for 3 years and have seen the bank double in size and that is very exciting.  I can't wait to see what the future holds!,Like I said the pace is fast and the hours are long at times.  I believe the long hours are partially due to our core system being less than optimal.

The management is frightfully inadequate and the CEO sends inappropriate and demeaning, company wide emails at all hours of the night.  You are ""encouraged"" (to be read as obligated) to create your own obsolescence through hourly work logs and step by step picture diagrams of how to do your job.  since you get paid well below market, you wont miss your job when you either quit or get laid off due to finding a cheaper hourly employee to take your spot.  The insane politics here start at the top and that koolaid is drunk far down the ranks to anyone too inept to get a job elsewhere.

They hire about 5-10 people a week and 3-6 people a week quit or are fired.  I worked on these all the time, so I know the turnover is roughly 40%.  You will probably work the longest hours of any other job you've had.  

I submitted an expense report for a short trip to a seminar before I quit, it was for about $100.  They refused to reimburse me for the mileage expenses.  This is how the company does business and treats employees.

131,BofI Federal Bank,Challenging and rewarding.,2015-03-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I work at BofI because of the opportunities that arise. BofI is a small financial institution in the big scheme of things. Small enough to where an individual performer can make a real and meaningful impact. If you focus and drive yourself to take on challenges that are outside of your comfort zone then the rewards and advancement opportunities are there for the taking. I speak from personal experience.

I've worked at big national banks previously, BofI is a far better place to be. I hate being micro-managed and thats exactly what my experience was at the ""big banks"". At BofI you work for the most part autonomously. Although the more interaction with other departments the better for you. It exposes you to more facets of the bank, which in turn provides valuable experience you can use in your job/career.

My best advice for someone considering working at BofI is that you have to be willing to take a risk, do something you are not used to doing. Take on a project or challenge and immerse yourself in it until you know it backwards and forwards. Be the expert on that subject, then repeat. That's what gets attention and gives rise to more opportunities. It's served me well so far.

The compensation is good. Salaries are competitive and the 2 bonuses each year make quite a difference. The bonuses are performance based so they can be quite good if you choose to be a high performer. Bonuses are both cash and stock.

Overall I am very happy working at BofI. My co-workers are great and there is never a dull moment. The environment is fast paced so bring your running shoes, you'll need them. If you challenge yourself and work hard it will be rewarded.",Honestly the traffic is my biggest complaint which has nothing to do with BofI. The offices are in La Jolla near UTC which is a very busy financial hub. For those that take the 805 to and from work everyday it can be a bit of a pain sometimes.

The company has a very entrepreneurial spirit and encourages employees to think critically about their work and to constantly improve. My advice to applicants and current employees would be to not shy from a challenge. Step out of your comfort zone and be willing to take initiative and demonstrate your value. 

Every team I’ve worked on has been supportive and happy. I’ve developed life-long friendships and a strong professional network at the bank. I have loved the company softball team, working collaboratively on interdepartmental projects, and interacting with great people every day at the bank. The bank attracts a great crowd; many employees are young, smart, hard-working, and fun. 

The reason why I’ve stayed at BofI so long: the supportive leadership. My concerns have been heard, my feedback has been appreciated, and I am supported every day in my professional growth and personal development. 

Also, as a young woman, it is refreshing and encouraging to see many female executives at BofI. There is no “glass ceiling”. Hard work is hard work. Results speak for themselves.",UTC area is challenging to get in-and-out of with traffic

You could be working with someone one day, then the next day (or even the same day) they are no longer with the company. It's hard to feel welcomed at BofI Federal Bank when the higher-ups feel you are no longer needed and there's no explanation about those who are fired. And when you are told of someone's absence, it's in a hush-hush manner and brushed off like it's nothing.

Second, this place has terrible leadership. People in charge act like they know everything, but it gets delegated to the peons who mean well but get screwed over if things don't go well. 

Third, there is no HR department. That's right, no HR, so if you have any issues within your department, you either suck it up or risk getting fired (see the first paragraph).

The procedures that are in place hardly resemble procedures at all so there's nothing to fall back on when people have questions about how to do something.  There's absolutely no training.  New hires are expected to learn by jumping right into work.  There's no training phase or training structure so it's really up to you to make sure your know how to do what you need to do.  People are constantly gossiping and whispering about upper management as a result of upper management's failure to create an environment that encourages teamwork and the flow of creative ideas.  The work load is insane. The place resembles a sweat shop more than any sort of bank.  As an internet bank you'd expect their technology to be up to par but I hope by now you guessed that it's not.  The programs used in the bank are so out of date it's stupid.  They're a huge pain not only to employees, but also to the customers!  The bank isn't even close to being user friendly but they think it's okay because they offer good rates.

By the way, did i tell you pay is minimum wage and commission on each file is $300 dollars? this isn't a loan originating operation they have, what they have is a slave shop.  There's a rule in business that if you're not paying your employees the compensation they deserve, at least provide the necessities to harness a good motivated office with great leadership otherwise how can your business thrive?

They look for talented and dedicated individuals, and present opportunities to them.  The rest is up to you.  It's a breath of fresh air compared to old school banks, nepotistic corporations, and legacy employees welded into their cushy positions.  Furthermore, the company has strong growth, so opportunities often come without the traditional requirement for attrition.","Work life balance can be difficult, but that's often driven by many employees' own dedication to pursuing the next opportunity.  On the few times I've had to throw my work-life balance out the window, it was at least for a brief window."

Bonuses and pay are a joke, you are always replaceable and the philosophy in the handbook is not adhered to. No loyalty or praise-you're never good enough and they wonder why people leave left and right. If it were up to the CEO, robots would replace all the humans--all that matters is process and that someone else can do your job if you walk or when they replace you. 

Office politics a joke and ever present. Fear based management philosophy."

-  Lenient lunch hours 
-  Easy work
-  Not much supervision","-  Compensation was highly exaggerated during interview process
-  Deals are extremely hard to obtain and something is guaranteed to go wrong in the process
-  Tons of other companies doing the exact same thing - very competitive environment    
-  Making 250+ dials a day and not speaking with anyone is extremely discouraging
-  Questionable leadership and poor training
-  Lots of bad mouthing of other employees by managers

It seems like the only reason the managers and other 'tenured' individuals make any money there is because they hire a ton of new people, have them make a bunch of dials and then take their deals when they are fired or quit.  Extremely discouraging work environment because people quit or get fired pretty much every week.  Upper management seems to be completely disconnected from their employees and the environment the work in.  A few of the managers are allowed to get away with a lot more than they should be simply based on their relationship to other executives."
