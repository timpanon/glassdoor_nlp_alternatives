2,Bridgeway Federal Credit Union,Not a good place to work,2014-12-20,1.0,Financial Services Representative,Paid time off. They observe a lot of holidays with pay. A lot of downtime at this company. They allow for employee feedback and suggestions. Privately owned.,Salaries are lower than the norm. There isn't any room for advancement. Health care plans are not very good and they don't offer family coverage. The company doesn't match or contribute anything to the their 401k plan. Very stressful work environment. No overtime available. The administration can be unfriendly at times. The IT department does not have a ticket system setup and they are very slow to respond.
