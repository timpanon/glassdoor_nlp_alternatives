27,CFSC,Where to begin - SERIOUSLY,2020-09-22,3.0,Customer Service Representative (CSR),"Let me begin by saying I’m in my first 3 months there (probation time for most companies) 
Supposedly they promote from within 
And encourage current employees to further their careers and set goals which I fully believe all companies should do. On the work hours are flexible and there is a sheet called “ I’m available” which allows you to sign up for additional work hours (not necessarily at your location though, you might have to travel even far out of your way if you want to take those shifts) but you’re not obligated to even if you said you’re available. They offer medical/dental and 401(k) once you’re eligible. Unfortunately I cannot think of any more pros at the moment.","And this could certainly be a long list but I’m going to try and keep only the serious matters. I can only speak about my location to be fair other locations may be the complete opposite of mine so that should also be taken into consideration. I started there about 2 1/2 months ago. I interviewed with the regional manager for all of maybe 10 minutes behind the glass due to the Covid I situation we are currently dealing with. I was told I was tired and then I reported to work almost immediately which I was excited about. There were no training or orientation classes or meetings before I started. Considering how much work actually goes on there you would think that a one or two day orientation and training exhibit would be required. My first day I sat and I watched as another CSR did 100 different things throughout the day, the second day I sat and I watched the other CSR doing the work and this was expected to be my training. I cannot learn that way, I’m a hands-on learner and I need to be way more involved than just sitting and looking over someone’s shoulder being expected to learn that all that goes into a day there. As I said earlier there are 100 different things that go on there are different products sold, different services offered, and Western Union and all the other transactions require the use of a POS system and then the website like Western Union or another website for paying bills. So it’s not just like here I want to send a Western Union here’s the money bang bang boom it’s over no that’s not at all it so if it was a simple as that then maybe I could’ve observed and learned but I need to do it myself to learn it. I did take notes however like I was in school but by day 3 I couldn’t take it anymore. I was BORED out of my mind. So my “trainer“ allowed me to do a few transactions as the day slow down but this was frowned upon by some of the other staff and the regional manager. Now since my store didn’t have a manager at the point I started only the regional manager was around and the regional manager comes by the store once maybe twice a week to fulfill certain duties but is otherwise at all the other locations he is responsible for I could be 10 or 15 other places he has to visit throughout the day. So it is not like there’s any senior person there to help you you have to rely on your peers and and as you have all experienced once someone is doing a job for a while they develop their own system or style of doing it. So again learning from all these different people I had five different ways of doing the same thing sometimes more. It was very overwhelming and frustrating. It’s very difficult when there’s no set hierarchy and you don’t know whose opinion matters the most and the one person who is ultimately responsible isn’t getting any time with you isn’t getting to experience how you work on a day-to-day basis or seeing you come in early or stay later or asking the questions that you know are important that show that you’re interested and so unfortunately any error you make is highlighted to the ultimate because of course that Hass to be reported to the regional manager. You could do 150 great things in the day but all that will stand out come end of shift will be what you did wrong. And unfortunately for me I dislike that very much. I was a manager for a period of time and I always made sure my employees knew had they done something wrong and they were giving constructive criticism and all of that of course but also they were reinforced positively and were told they were doing a good job from time to time because I’m effective, good manager I feel will dish out both good and bad. And not make you feel like you’re not doing a single good thing or right thing and all you’re doing is making mistakes. I’m gonna leave it at that for now because I wanted to kind of balance out I said some nice things I’ve given my honest opinion about my probationary first few months there. I don’t know how much of the company’s policies were affected by Covid I’m talking about the training maybe there would’ve been an orientation and a training day and it wouldn’t of been where you were set right at the store to just look over someone shoulder for ours an hours you know I don’t know how they started at a different time would’ve been any different at this particular location. But these are all questions I would certainly ask if you’re considering starting there because I didn’t know I had to ask them and I wish that I did."

Schedules are fairly flexible depending on your supervisors, you can often convince them to allow you to work fairly close to home (though that is not company policy - see below). 401K match is on par with most other companies in general.","Health benefits are expensive, and becoming more expensive every year. Human Resources is literally two people, in a company with several hundred employees. They break their backs to try and keep up with the demands of employees in a company this size, but ultimately it just isn't enough, and nearly everyone I have ever worked with (dozens of people over the last five years) has generally felt that they are ignored. Terrible salary, beginning at or near minimum wage with laughable consideration for prior experience and incredibly diverse workload, which takes several years to break the 10 dollar mark. I know several people who have been working here for over a decade who make less than 11 dollars an hour, and that is the norm, rather than the exception. Low consideration for work/life balance. Little to no room to advance within the company. Company policy is NOT to allow people to work within their own communities, so commutes are often long, and uncompensated."
