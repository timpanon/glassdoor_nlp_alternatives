0,CPM Group,"Poor management,  dull work",2021-12-29,2.0,Human Resources,"I worked there when they were in the financial district. The location was descent in terms of commute.
Other pro was that I had access to a lot of useful stock information.","My supervisor was lazy. He did not train me which subsequently lead me to being laid off down the road. The boss, placed plenty of pressure on the CEO but the CEO seemed unmotivated to do anything but collect his absorbent salary. The boss asked me to work beyond 8-5pm but didn’t want to pay me overtime. Smh.
There is no work culture, also no diversity at all."
