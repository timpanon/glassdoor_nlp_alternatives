8,CRFS,Poor Work Experience,2019-07-07,1.0,Claims Specialist,Very few pros to list,"Exceptionally poor management including HR
Significantly broken infrastructure to the point of weak communication between operational management and strategic execs
Constant reduction in direct employment and increases in temporary employment for the same jobs and workloads
No competitive wages 
One HR exec has a reputation for brownnosing and pretending to be a concerned person when she actually uses an employee's knowledge against that person. 
Much office politics to the point of lies told in order to damage a person's image
Too many unprofessional women catfighting with each other and especially men"
9,CRFS,A great place to work!!,2018-07-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I am partial to smaller companies (rather than the big banks) so I love working here.  The work environment is causal. It can get stressful at times, just like any other business striving to meet month end and production goals. I started working here 5 years ago and have been promoted three times so there is opportunity for advancement. The company is also growing so there will be growing pains along the way as with other businesses. Emails from Senior Management are sent out giving us company updates which is appreciated to know the companies progress.  I am grateful for someplace like this to work locally instead of commuting an hour each way with traffic. They also have good benefits.  So, yes, its a great place to work if you are a hard working professional.",I don't have anything negative to say!
10,CRFS,"some good things, some not so good",2018-02-15,3.0,Administrative,"Close to home, some good perks","Got very stressful when we got behind, some employees acted like they were still in high school or even elementary school (gossiping, tattling), pay was too low. My position recently got eliminated."
11,CRFS,Bad company,2017-12-14,1.0,,none they are a bad company that takes advantage of orleans county people.,dont care about employee's and underpay them.
12,CRFS,"The company takes advantage of workers-Low Pay, Excessive Hours",2017-11-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Generally nice coworkers
Consistent work
Not much else","Poverty Wages
Jodi Gaines takes advantage of workers desperate for a job and pays them 1/2 their worth
Management does not take employees concerns into account
Rigid schedules and deadlines
No say in job preferance
Regular mandatory overtime, with little to no concern for employees
Bonus structure magically ""under review"" during times of promised bonus payouts
Little to no room for advancement"
13,CRFS,Ok,2017-10-13,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Professional work, good experience building, full time employment and a reasonable salary.",Occasional unprofessional coworkers. Different culture and environment dependent on the department.
14,CRFS,Oh there's a new HR team?,2017-09-25,3.0,Claims Manager,Most of the employees have known each other side high school so you have some friends to spend your day with. When Jodi is walking around she always has a smile on her face and greets you. Shes a wonderful lady. The hours used to be decent until they changed them.,"In the 3 years i was there the entire HR department changed 3 times. The VP changed 3 or 4 times. All of upper management is constantly being changed. No one knows what they are doing. The higher you go the more you have a target on your back. Its not about what you know, its who you know. You have to kiss butt to get ahead. Clients are never happy even though upper management pretends they are. New clients that could save the company are pushed away before signatures are on paper because the VP and CFO dont know how to make deals. All of the good people are pushed out and all that is left are useless people. The wages are so terrible that a majority of the building is on DSS. Every time they have bad news they buy the building food first so you know its coming."
15,CRFS,Horrendous company to work for!,2017-08-02,1.0,QC Analyst,Ability to listen to music while working but that's about it...,"Working at CRFS can be very difficult at times. The rules/regulations change constantly and the lack of communication between management and operations makes the job very stressful. If you are looking for a place with lots of opportunity for advancement this is NOT the right place to work. There is very little opportunity to move up within the company unless you are related or good friends with the management staff. HR is very unorganized and extremely incompetent with any complaints employees might have. The workplace culture for the most part is decent. Although a majority of the employees have a negative view point about the company because of management and the overall inability to listen to employee needs rather than client demands. FYI management constantly lies telling people what they want to hear (if it's not in writing it didn't happen). CRFS management consistently let's down hard working employees. They don't value hard work, education or even being a loyal employee. Bad pay and awful raises (they constantly force employees to learn multiple jobs and don't provide additional compensation for it) . Forced overtime for months at a time and then will be taken away unexpectedly. Unless you enjoy being a suck up or are related to management I advise you not to work for this company."
16,CRFS,Processor,2017-07-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Hours, benefits, remote, overtime as needed",Workload was awful when there were only a handful of us
17,CRFS,Processor,2017-07-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Offered remote work ability to workers,Management would forget about workers and communication was non existent
18,CRFS,Absolutely horrendous,2017-06-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,It is close to home. I honestly do not have any other pros. Hours used to be flexible for kids but they changed that as well.,Pay is completely unfair. You get the same pay rate as people who do nothing all day. The overtime is forced. Constant changes cause confusion with no steady way to communicate changes. Procedures are inconsistent and incorrect. Managers and job coaches are overworked and underpaid.
19,CRFS,Sadly One Star is the Minimum,2016-12-19,1.0,Quality Control,"Honestly, there is no good reason to work here. Aside from being continuously amazed at awful coworkers and the handicapped management, there is absolutely nothing worth applying to this company for.","It is hard to pin point somewhere to begin. The pay is so bad that people qualify for welfare. Its an embarrassing thing to say you work here. Enjoy your 25 cent raise every year. Employees are not valued based on merit, rather who they are friends with.  It is not uncommon for a high school dropout to be making more than someone with a masters simply because they are there longer. Forget about moving up as you need to be friends with management. Regarding moving up: there is no reason to have any sort of education as this company does not value educated employees. High school dropouts are placed as management above people with masters. This is a joke of a company that should be closed. They take advantage of the poorest county in New York State with embarrassingly low wages. They match 5% 401k with 4%... but 4% of nothing in terms of pay does absolutely nothing for a retirement plan.  

The work is just downright repetitive and boring with no sense of fulfillment. Even if you ask to be challenged, all you do is end up with more of the same boring work. This is not a healthy work environment for someone that wants to take pride in their work and look for more to life than a minimum wage paycheck. I ended up not caring at all and just whatever because there were no real rules. There wasn't any sort of repercussion for doing right or wrong, which led to my lack of care in the quality of my work."
20,CRFS,Treats employees like dirt,2016-12-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Early hours so you can enjoy the rest of your day,Always trying to find a reason to let you go or not promote you if you have a strong opinion about anything. Watched many get let go before me. .. Just wants everyone to be underpaid sheep..
21,CRFS,okay,2016-10-02,4.0,,Dress code causal; weekends off; overtime; friends,"Management too secretive, also says one thing and does nothing then months later is completed"
22,CRFS,Claims processor,2016-08-19,2.0,,One of the better employers in the area,"Low pay, limited opportunity for growth"
23,CRFS,Just a job...,2016-04-29,2.0,Claims Processor,Steady hours and schedule and overtime available,"Under  staffed, employees are not appreciated and are over worked."
24,CRFS,Truly no regard for their employees.,2016-03-23,1.0,Claims Manager,"At this point, a pro is tough to come across. Possibly location.","Very low pay scale.
Expectation that you will work 15 plus hours of overtime, and 7 days a week in most cases.
Salaried employees are not paid on scale with similar positions in other companies, yet are expected to work countless hours.
CEO has lost control of the company, new investors have driven the company into the ground.
Unable to meet the standards for service that they promise their clients.
Physically and mentally draining environment that is only worried about their bottom line and does not have any care for employee well being or home work balance.
This company was once a place that stood out for being on the side of its small town employees, but that mentality has gone out the window, and with it the company has lost the trust of its employees and clients alike."
25,CRFS,"Average  pay, poor benefits, lots of stress",2015-11-13,3.0,Claims Analyst,Average pay right. Good 401k benefits. Overtime usually always available. Nice break room. Weekends off if overtime is not demanded,"Poor health insurance benefits. Very stressful work. ..even went it's not your fault it still is your fault. They monitor you bathroom use, phone use, and breaks. No cell phones."
26,CRFS,Worst Company Ever,2015-10-19,1.0,BOA Processor,"You can wear headphones while you work, worked around my school schedule.",The company is a joke.  Poor management.  The Owner is a liar. Pays enough to keep you poor
27,CRFS,Claims Processor,2015-10-08,2.0,Anonymous Employee,hours of operation are from 7 am-4 pm with overtime available as workload increases.  headphones are permitted.,"insufficient training
inexperienced supervisors
Cell phones are restricted.
Most of the employees are related to each other therefore, gossiping and favoritism rule this environment"
28,CRFS,It really used to be a great place to work,2015-05-01,3.0,Processor,"They really do have good benefits.  Close to home so not driving more than 20 minutes to work for quite a few employees,","Size does matter.  The morale has completely hit an  all time low.  More & more has been taken away from the employees, no incentives to meet or exceed your numbers except to have a job & really pizza gets old after awhile."
29,CRFS,A company I will never work for again!,2015-01-19,4.0,Claims Processor,Not being foolish but honestly I can't even think of a Pro for working at CRFS,"Poor training, lack of communication between staff, supervisors, departments, company.  Favoritism is present in every department.  If you are not part of a certain group you are no one.  If a worker does their work incorrectly and that worker explains they were taught that way the worker is not listened to and is at fault.  Raises are little to none.  People are unhappy and you can see it in their faces each day.  The CEO is not the same down to earth person she once was.  The list goes on. CRFS is NOT a great place to work"
