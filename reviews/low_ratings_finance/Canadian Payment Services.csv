1,Canadian Payment Services,Beware,2020-02-13,1.0,Sales,"Residual commissions can add up & provide a monthly income. 
Appointments are provided.","The company lied. 
The interviewer told me 10-15 prequalified appointments are provided per week. 
That sounded wonderful until I learned that most appointments are crap (the contact person doesn’t speak English,  the contact person isn’t interested, etc.). 
When I complained about the latter to a VP,  she said that most bizz owners will say anything to get off the phone. 
That was a complete contradiction to what the person whom hired me said. 

Also, numerous times, I had to argue at length, just to receive me Eaned-income. 
I left with them owing me money."
2,Canadian Payment Services,You get back what you put in,2019-07-29,5.0,Regional Account Executive,"Honeslty this company isnt pulling your leg when they tell you it's a lucrative business. The money is out there, you as a individual need to be motivated enough to go make it. I've seen it. I live it. I earn it. If you expect to make tons the first week your setting yourself up for failure. You need to learn, and use your management to build your self up. A snow ball always starts out small but if you keep pushing it it can grow to a monster ball. Remember that.",They don't provide the company shirts I was promised. I ended up getting my own made from a business I sold to.
3,Canadian Payment Services,Complete Scam,2019-05-31,1.0,Inside Sales Manager,This is a completely illegitimate company from top to bottom,This company is completely illegitimate.  From merchants getting tricked into $4500 leases for a $600 terminal to not paying employees.
4,Canadian Payment Services,Great company,2019-03-22,4.0,Sales Executive,Work on your own hours. No clock to punch in or punch out I do recommend working 8-5. Get under a good manager that makes sure you get paid what your told.,Accounting person sucks she always tries to take a couple bucks here and there
5,Canadian Payment Services,Misleading and false promises,2018-12-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flexible hours are available and you can block days off if you need to. Leads are provided however they are mostly garbage leads that are ""falsely pre-qualified"".","They do not pay you what they tell you they will.  There is very little training, just a pressure group call a couple of times a week to advise of the ""success stories"" of other sales people and then they tell you to go out and do the same without any proper training, marketing material, business cards or prepared  knowledge.  Basically fake it till you make it type of attitude. They start off offering $50 per statement that you can ""capture"" and send in, and guarantee 3 leads a day. After your first week, you will find out it's more like 2 leads a day, and a lot of driving to appointments that are no-shows or no statements, and then they retract the initial contract offer of $50  a ""captured statement"" after a couple of weeks and tell you it's only $50 if you generate your own lead. I worked for them for 3 weeks and was told I had a $100 coming to me for captured statements, then they changed that to $50 because they had provided the leads...which they had guaranteed in the beginning anyway...then they paid me nothing at all after 3 weeks of driving around to their set appointments. It's an absolute garbage company to work for unless you like working for nothing other than false promises of ""wealth in time"". They try to convince you that it's a lucrative commission after you become established, but if they can't even pay $50 then that leaves a lot of doubt about future earnings. I quit after 3 weeks of nonsense so didn't waste enough time to find out that they would find a way out of paying any commissions as well.  If a company will screw you for $50, then there is no doubt it's a bad place to work. There are much better companies to work for that have proper training, proper presentation materials and a solid commission and payment contract.  And they will actually PAY you, not find excuses not to.  Based out of the US, claiming to be ""Canadian"".  Such a bad experience with this company."

10,Canadian Payment Services,AVOID! AVOID! AVOID! CHURN'n'BURN place!,2017-11-20,1.0,Sales Exe,A nice carpet and logo.,"Company is a dime a dozen high-interest cash-advance company. Predator-""advancing."" Training is one day, I was hired on the spot, and told the next day they didn't need me. Horrible culture, a lot of contempt and otherwise tension. I saw a fist-fight break out inside. ""Management"" are a bunch of frat boys who are all just friends of management. They flat-out say they're not managers, have no experience, and growing with the team."
