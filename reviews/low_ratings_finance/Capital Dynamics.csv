0,Capital Dynamics,The best place to learn,2022-01-03,5.0,Equity Analyst,"- analyst has to be independent, but we can always seek for opinion and comment from superiors. I have learnt a lot from the fund manager and CEO throughout the year.
- for those who complain about minimal supervision, I guess you should be more resourceful and know how to find the solution by yourself. Everyone is busy on their tasks. There are so much of sample and a clear guideline for us to refer to complete a write-up. If you have any query, just approach to your senior/fund manager or even CEO, they are more than willing to help. There is no spoon feed culture at here, even at other place.
- Able to attend Teng Boo's talks for free.
- Thanks again for giving me the opportunity, really appreciate that. There is not many investment firm is willing to hire an analyst with zero experience in investment industry.
- In term of work life balance, it is a lot better than audit.
- A lot of them complain about management, but for me, they are quite friendly and care about my family situation. So far I'm happy to work with them.
- CD is a reputable investment institution in Malaysia. When you go to other investment firm, everyone knows about TTB. And they knows that TTB has a very high standard on his product/article. Hence, those who can survive under his ""training"" will be a very competent analyst in a very short period of time due to the steep learning curve.
- colleagues are friendly.","- High turnover rate
- Involve in a lot of activities (eg. marketing, roadshow). But you get to learn some different stuffs from there."

4,Capital Dynamics,Ridiculous management team,2021-09-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. Friendly and lovely colleagues who are willing to help you all the time
2. 90% Fresh grads, so you can have common topics, especially all of you work together in such a brutal and inhumane working environment
3. Convenient location, you can take the MRT and LRT to work, and Petaling Street is right behind you
4. You can take a nap at any time","1. The management team will not value all the efforts you have made, instead, they will keep criticizing you once they find a little mistake you've made
2. OT is VERY common, especially for translators, equity analysts, economists, IT, researchers (If you are an accountant it will be better)
3. Everyone I just mentioned has to spontaneously stay until 8 pm on a Friday night to wait for their financial publications to come out and in fact, at that time you are hungry and tired, and the company does not provide you with food
4. outdated working way, they will give you an article to translate first, after that they revise the article, you have to revise the translation, they determine the final draft of the article, you also have to determine the final draft of the translation accordingly. You have to do a translation three times over, which is very time-consuming and inefficient
5. I don't have much interaction with the CEO so I think he is actually okay (except for he is authoritative), but most of the management is very ridiculous and unbelievable.
6. They will ask you to finish the work you didn't manage to at home instead of coming to the office the next day and continuing to do it.
7. They seek speed, hope you finish super fast, but when the quality is lacking, they will scold and blame you
8. Work on SAT is a kind of torture because you have to stay until 8:00 on Friday to get off work, back home is already 9:00 pm
9. Saturday like to call a last-minute meeting, possible to have meeting from 12pm to 2 pm
10. Signing in is very inconvenient because you have to open your computer and fill out the login form, and if you are a minute late you have to send an email to the CEO and senior management to explain
11. The most ridiculous point is that they don't allow you to listen to music or watch a video during your lunch break. Because the company's network is the company's, not yours, and cannot be used for entertainment purposes. (you still can watch and some workers do but be careful not to get caught) 
12. All emails from the CEO must be answered with 120% respect and gratitude: Noted, thanks
13. No reunion, no team activities, no annual events, no celebrations. There is nothing but WORK. Don't dream about it.
14. They won't take any of your advice, any of it. I've tried to cite a bunch of evidence to prove that it's all over the internet, but the supervisor didn't listen in the least and insisted on using her own way.
15. You have to lock your phone in cabinets, even can't take it for lunch. (Contradiction: I'm not allowed to use the company network to watch dramas at lunch, and I'm not allowed to take my phone, which means that you eat while working and don't think about entertainment)
16. They won't voluntarily fire you, but they will force you to leave on your own. For example: ignore you, don't assign you work, don't talk to you
17. 6-months probation and longer. I have a colleague who is not confirmed yet even working for 8 months.
18. No respect for your time off, sometimes tomorrow is a public holiday and management will say: meeting tomorrow through zoom.
19. If you tell them: I have a date tonight and must leave on time, they will not only ignore it but also talk to you a lot of nonsense.
20. Very funny, they think you can do everything. So even though you may be just an analyst, you may need to do marketing, do HR, help with Interviews, help with publicity
21. Management won't patiently tell you what they want, but they will taunt you if you don't meet expectations (in their way)"

You can also learn a lot about what a management failure is.","You will have a lot of dark days doubting your capabilities but the problem is actually the few people in the management. Your supervisors won't be able to guide you because they also don't know what the boss wants. Your boss will not tell you what he wants directly either because you are meant to learn. And the boss is so busy, he will demand whatever things he wants to look at whenever he wants. And this will most likely be the reason why you are working overtime."
7,Capital Dynamics,A good platform if you want to sharpen your all-round skills,2021-05-19,3.0,Assistant to Chief Executive Officer,"The company will involve you in private events organizations although it's out of your job scope. The CEO gives his guidance and advices on how to solve problems.
You will be given many opportunities if you prove your capability and willingness to work.","Heavy workload, OT is very common."
8,Capital Dynamics,It's not a place for everyone,2021-05-16,3.0,Analyst,"Capital Dynamics (CD) is not a firm for everyone, some may find working here (or the CEO) bearable, some may not. My comments below are solely based on my experience in CD, I hope you guys will find it helpful. 

1. Official working hours in CD is 8am - 5pm, Mon to Sat, except for Sat where we only work until 12pm. Having said that, employees on average leave office around 6.30-7pm, depending on their roles. Going back on time is not encouraged in this company - the CEO himself doesn't believe in work-life balance. I can't speak for everyone in terms of workload as it varies from department to department, but the company tends to call last minute late meetings, eg: 4.30/5pm meetings on weekdays or meetings after 12pm on Saturdays (mainly because the CEO has a tight schedule and is only available after working hours, and/or the company doesn’t have enough meeting rooms) Also, the company doesn’t pay OT, so yea….. If you're someone who has other commitments after work, you may need to think twice. 

2. The working environment in CD is quite dull, essentially it's just work work and work. They rarely organise team building activities, no team lunch (as far as I know), festive celebrations (not even CNY), nothing. We just turn up to work at 8am and work - there really is nothing much to look forward to aside from going home after work. So working in CD can be a little demotivating, depending on what your goal is - if you're someone who looks for a good working environment that motivates you, have networking sessions or team building activities, this might not be a place for you.

3. Favouritism? This is something that appeared in a lot of reviews. I can't deny that favouritism does occur in CD. But I believe it is a very common thing everywhere - especially in big organisations. The CEO has his favourites, and he doesn't hide it. Personally, I've seen him treating two employees of the same role completely different. Well, maybe one was more capable than the other? That, I don't know. But it can be quite demotivating for those who aren't one of his favourites. That said, it's not the end of the world if he doesn't like you. I believe the CEO is rational and values people who are capable. If you don't give up, and continue proving your worth, he will for sure appreciate your effort - but maybe you just need to work extra extra hard as compared to his favourites.

4. No personal mobile phones during work- not even during lunch time. Apparently this is due to the nature of the industry, they want to avoid insider trading. So yeah, if you’re someone who is very attached to your mobile phone, you may need to think twice because the company takes this policy very seriously. You will need to deposit your phone into a locker and you can only retrieve it after 5pm. (Personally, this wasn’t a very big issue for me. The only drawback is you can’t use Grab food for lunch, imagine all the grab rewards that I’ve missed out T.T)

5. Employees are required to go to office during MCO. I think we even worked full-force. There are no team rotations or whatnot. YOU HAVE TO GO TO OFFICE. There are various reasons to this – the CEO just doesn’t really like the concept of working from home ( I believe you can sort of guess the reasons, it’s very normal for bosses to think like that). That said, breakfast and lunch are provided throughout the MCO period – so that’s a plus! But one thing I have to say is, we’re not allowed to step a foot out of the office during working hours, not even out to buy snacks, because they don’t want us to be exposed to the virus and bring it back to the office. So it can get really restless sometimes, having to stay in office the whole day. 

6. You’re expected to work very independently – very minimum training (for analysts), no handholding. They will provide you a manual, you have to read it and learn as you work. I guess the younger generations, us, are used to being spoon fed, hence feel like we need more guidance? I’m not sure.. But I definitely think more guidance should be provided, at least at the start, just so we won’t feel so lost and confused (speaking as a fresh grad). So, if you’re someone who expects more training or guidance by the seniors, this may not be a suitable company for you.","CD has a special working culture, so it all boils down to whether that person can adapt to the unique environment or not."

Got free breakfast/lunch cause MCO. 
Got public transport nearby. 
You get paycheck every month. That's about it","This one longer list:-

- Micromanagement: Official working hour from 8-5. But cannot leave early cause your phone still lock inside drawer. Sometime you get scolded by CEO if go back early. You go back 6 also consider early.
- Weird company policy number 1: They say you can choose working hour. but if you late after 8 and dont send email to manager and ceo telling why, must pay RM5 to company. 
- Weird company policy number 2: If you accidentally spill food on carpet, must also pay RM10 to company. So dont spill your foods
- Computer take long time to start
- Sometimes got sexist comment from CEO in meetings
- CEO dictatorship. Everything must go to him one. 
- Very unprofessional conduct from CEO. he will scream and scold if CEO mood swing. Ceo will sometime send email in all capital bold letter.
- CEO favouritism. If you in his good book, he will treat you ok. If not he will make you feel undervalue and not appreciate. 
- No training. You must do everything yourself one. No guidance also. Then give you work, you have to solve it. For them you have to show them result only. They say ""bring us solution not problems"". You got problem, solve by yourself
- This company don't follow work-life balance. CEO got say before. management also don't follow.
- Saturday also cannot leave on time one. There will be have meeting after 12 sometime.
- Management feedback on your work always destructive cristicism. Sometime they also got say rude/disrespectful thing.
- Management also show no trust in staffs
- Company belief everyone can do everything. So you will do work outside your job scope and knowledge. They think no limits, which can be problem for career growths
- No fridge in pantry"

5)	Casual wear
6)	Free lunch every Friday 
7)	Astro, Ping Pong, Piano. (rarely see people play though)

10)	Encourage long-term investment","1)	No trust, No respect from management. cold-blood management. no company/ team bonding events/activities but only WORKWORKWORK.
2)	One-(old)man show. One person approves everything and he is the one who evaluates your performance, even though your immediate superior is someone else. 
3)	30 y/o company but still calling themselves a startup company, yes, they are proud of it.
4)	They claim that they are open-minded. But no way they would accept your suggestions/ideas. They focus much more on being understood than on understanding others. 
5)	Even if you are a Christian, you will be addressed by Chinese name. Is a MUST. Reason? To not forget you are Chinese, where you come from blah blah blah. He is a big fan of China. However, still require you to speak English because he doesn't know Chinese lol
6)	You have to deposit your phone and ONLY can retrieve it when going back. Not even during lunchtime. Reason? To prevent confidential information leakage. Hello? if you don't trust your staff then just hire your family members to work with you. You know there are a lot of times when someone called me for urgent and I didn't pick up???? lol
7)	They may ask you to leave immediately without prior notice. they will “ask” you to prepare your resignation letter, so they don’t need to pay you severance compensation. Once you have agreed, you can't fight back your right anymore. 
8)	Working environment is awfully quiet. Even you could hear a needle dropped on the floor. 
9)	Work on Saturday sometimes seems not necessary. 
10)	If someone told you here don’t encourage OT, don't believe, it is just a joke, bro. 
11)	6 months or more probation period. all the best
12) short & medium term-investment is prohibited. 
13)	Once you have tendered the resignation letter, you are nothing here. They may treat you like..AIR

-Poor management - micromanaging - everything need to get boss’s approval no matter big or small matter
-For those fresh graduates, it is not a suitable job for you, because there has no senior to GUIDE you. They encourage you to explore yourself and if you did something wrong, they will blame you.
-Whenever you done your task, you need to record as evidence, in case boss forgot and you will get scolded or blame
-Poor water filter supply, it takes 3-5 mins to refill a 500ml water bottle

15,Capital Dynamics,The greatest irony,2020-11-20,5.0,Senior Manager,"I worked for 6 companies over 8 years. For nearly 9 years after that, I worked in the best company, rising from a junior executive to senior management. This was when I thankfully joined Capital Dynamics. 

In all my 9 years, I was trained intensively and extensively by the company. I was given opportunities that I never knew existed. There were very motivating. The rewards and benefits at Capital Dynamics were very generous and trust me, they were very unique and bespoke as well.

Not only is there no office politics, Capital Dynamics does not believe in and does not practice OT. Not a single staff is asked to do OT. The culture in CD is very results-based. What OT? You manage yourself responsibly. If you have to stay back after office hours to finish your work on time, shouldn’t you? If you can produce the results by the agreed deadline, you are free to go whenever. No bias based on gender, race, or age. In my 9 years, Capital Dynamics has been compassionate and even hired people who are seriously ill, like having cancer or with major disabilities.

The culture in CD is very caring. Capital Dynamics is under the “Essential Services” category. It has to stay open at all times, just like Bursa Malaysia or SGX or ASX. In order that its staff stay safe and still meet the legal obligations under Essential Services, staff are provided breakfast and lunch every day, all paid for the company. They can also choose various working times to avoid congested public transport or jams. Wow, these are so much better than some of the larger companies.

The culture at Capital Dynamics is very empowering for all staff – no micromanaging for sure (for the less experienced ones, do not confused between regulatory compliance with micromanaging). For example, the staff can wear whatever they find suitable. They can nap any time for whatever length of time they choose to. In the pantry, they can play the piano, , watch tv or play ping pong – anytime the staff chooses to.

Despite his huge success, the CEO of CD is very humble, compassionate, extremely generous and an unusually sincere person. Which CEO would fly to the funerals of his staff’s parents in KL, Singapore, Ipoh, Medan, etc? Wise, funny, open-minded, TTB is essentially a patient teacher to his staff rather than the CEO of a company. Is he perfect? No, he is human after all, but after 9 long and rewarding years in Capital Dynamics, I find him to be a wonderful human being. Unlike my previous bosses, TTB respects all his staff. Even though TTB is a very senior CEO, he is willing to listen to our opinions and ideas.

Why I am posting this in Glassdoor? I see few positive comments about TTB and Capital Dynamics in Glassdoor. This IS NOT the true situation and unfair to them. After nearly 9 years, I can safely say I know TTB and Capital Dynamics inside out and is therefore in an excellent position to portray the true picture. For those who want to genuinely know more, give me either your email or phone contact.",Why did I leave? The irony for TTB and Capital Dynamics is that they nurtured me so bloody well that the larger and richer financial institutions headhunted me like a gem. But my million thanks to TTB and Capital Dynamics for the best 9 years.

The only pros is I get to know many good friends. Because the employees are mostly fresh grads (super high turnover), we are close and will support each other along this tough journey. 
-Nice location, you can get many famous yummy food.","I'd say there is no any single fake comment about cons so far from all the reviews written in glassdoor. 
Unless you really need the salary, and you have strong mental to not to care about anything. Working overtime without feeling being appreciated (take for granted) and working on Sat are torturing.

20,Capital Dynamics,Unique experience,2020-09-04,4.0,Analyst,"Some people may find the place to be too tough and demanding, some may find it to be a good challenge and training ground, especially for the fresh grads. I joined as an analyst, I was a fresh grad, it was really a learning curve for me. All analysts report to the Head of Research, which is also the CEO. Thus, you really need to prove your capability.

The colleagues were friendly, we were more like a big family. We could get along with colleagues from any departments.

Naps are allowed in the office, and staff have the freedom to decide on their own attire. I didn't have to spend too much on formal wears here.

The company practices a flat structure, which I believe they still do. Reporting line is quite straightforward. We addressed each other by name, no sir or madam, including the CEO. I find it very good as it helps to remove the typical mental barrier we tend to have when it comes to dealing with your seniors.

The CEO is very generous in sharing his knowledge and life philosophies, which i found them to be really precious, coming from someone of his seniority. I enjoyed the learning whether it was for my research or personal development, even though it required a lot of hard work.","The firm has very high KPI for the Research analysts. It was really tough for fresh grad like me as there was not much handholding, we were expected to be independent, resourceful and self-disciplined."

23,Capital Dynamics,Untold Truth From Current Employee,2019-10-07,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've worked with Capital Dynamics since June 2008 to date.

1) Grow to be Intelligent, Independent, and with Integrity

Intelligent - we learn to take ownership and full responsibilities of our course of actions and deliver them even by mean of sacrificing personal interests. This builds up intelligence and resilience in problem-solving skills.

Independent - back by Intelligence, we learn to independently solve many obstacles, if not all.
If we are capable to solve the problems by being resourceful, why would we be micromanaged ?

Integrity - Personally, I grow up upholding the principle of ""My Word is My Bond"", which coincides with the company's principle too.
Having an integrity requires every staff to stay committed to deliver the tasks and projects, with no excuses.

2) Extend your family tree
We spend over 1/3 or even 1/2 of our time at work, therefore it is rationale that your office becomes your 2nd home and colleagues (whether senior or junior) become your extended families.

It may not known to many that the MD and senior management took all the troubles to attend funerals (even flew outside Malaysia) and paid respects to staffs' deceased family members.
Likewise, they attended their staffs' weddings held within Malaysia or outside Malaysia.
The only plausible reason why they do so is they simply treat staffs as their extended family members.

As a strong believer in cause and effect, it boils down to the fundamental principle: Treat others how you want to be treated. Have a sense of belonging and ask yourself what you can do to the company before you ask what the company can provide you.

3) Limitless exposure
When I first joined 11 years ago, the IT systems were immature and hosted on-premise. Fast-forward to present time, I am proud to be in the IT team that oversees the digital transformation of Capital Dynamics group.

Even though we rely heavily on cloud and world-class Data centre to run our IT systems, we still manage them ourselves. That said, the IT systems are still evolving and we aim to do our part in fighting global warming by targeting on green and paperless office,

4) Reading iCapital publication
One of the advantages in working at Capital Dynamics, staffs get to read the weekly iCapital tabloid although it is not always appreciated . Not only it helps to open up our minds on histories, presence, and future of our world besides the current market outlook. Simply put, it inspires us to be better persons.

Try us for yourself and experience how everyone works in Capital Dynamics for at least 2 years, instead of believing in hearsay or biased opinion.

Will you be the ones who join Capital Dynamics team ?","1) Due to the highly regulated industry where Capital Dynamics operates on, staffs have to comply with strict regulatory policies and procedures, which are implemented in the company.
This unfortunately may appear as micromanagement to some.

2) The company's appraisal standards are demanding and solely depend on performance and contribution.
Thus for non-performer or low contributor, it may be a challenging environment.

3) It is true that on certain occasions (events), all of us may need to work on tasks outside our areas of expertise, outside our work scope. 
Everyone is expected to help and contribute given that we have limited resources. But that also gives everyone the chance to bond and blend into Capital Dynamics family, which ultimately work together to succeed the events."

37,Capital Dynamics,Think multiple times before taking up the offers,2016-12-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,You will definitely get your pay cheque,"All the cons in the past reviews are valid. You will feel total lost of freedom during office hours. They have proper measures in place to restrict your connection to the outside world. 

A management who behave like a kiddo to manage the company. No proper email ethics, is a norm to receive email in CAPS, bold and red by copying to the a group of recipients, resulted monkey business culture."
38,Capital Dynamics,The simple truth from an analyst perspective,2016-12-05,5.0,Analyst,"1) Freedom to think independently

Many companies say they want this, but in reality, staff that voice different informed opinions gets ostracized. This is not the case at Capital Dynamics. As an analyst here, you are encouraged to get rid of the box entirely, not just thinking outside it and question established conventions. In the long run, this will make you a far better thinker. 

2) Culture of meritocracy

Again, many companies say this, but often times is riddled with office politics. At Capital Dynamics, schmoozing around will lead you nowhere - it is your skills, dedication and contributions that matter 

3) Opportunity to create

As an analyst, you will be able to be as creative as you want in your research process (with ethics + the law in mind). You will also be able to see your work get published and have the opportunity to participate/present in our annual investor day event whose attendance draws well over 7,000 people each year. As an analyst, you are able to through time and experimentation, develop your own investment philosophy and style (anchored to value)

4) Environment to test yourself

Whilst many companies speak about the merit in failure and making mistakes in the learning process, the reality is staff are often scared to do so - and worse, admit it - for their own job security. At Capital Dynamics, you will have the room to fail, and to learn from it. The benefit of this over the long run is immeasurable

5) Be part of a journey

Whilst we operate and invest globally, we are still largely a start-up. This means we are short on resources and must be creative in identifying solutions. But this also means everyone has the opportunity to contribute in the multiple facets of the business - all the way from recruitment to filling bags with goodies. The level of involvement and engagement will expose you to what the reality of businesses really is and make you a better analyst and also develop your character. Most importantly, you will feel part of the company, instead of just another number on a payroll.","Everything from 1 to 5 above, if viewed from another perspective are cons:

1) Freedom to think independently

Those who are used to the typical corporate environment of being told how and what to think will feel lost. This leads to the eventuality of blaming everyone but themselves.

2) Culture of meritocracy

Those who like and are used to the typical corporate environment of cozying up to the boss ""to climb the corporate ladder"" will fail here simply because the organisation is so flat and that anyone can be questioned. 

3) Opportunity to create

Those who are used to being given a brief of what to create with detailed step by step instructions - like what is typically done at many organisations - will feel lost and stressed when asked to be creative 

4) Environment to test yourself

Those who are used to being hand held and micro managed will view this freedom for experimentation and failure as no guidance 

5) Be part of a journey

Instead of viewing it as being involved, one can also view this as a nuisance i.e. ""it is not on my job list"""

48,Capital Dynamics,Felt shortchanged - Pls do not join the company unless you do not have a choice,2013-10-08,1.0,,"Must learn to be independent as there is minimal coaching/guidance from supervisors. 

Hierchary is very flat as it is a small company. All analysts report directly to the Managing Director (MD). But also means lesser chance of promotion and pay increment.

Location is very centralised. Fully sheltered from Raffles Place MRT.

Employees may seem quiet during work and only cared about their self interest but actually they are a nice bunch of people if you get to really know them; the corporate culture is the problem.","Pay is (much) below market rate

Long working hours

Poor corporate culture - no open communication and staffs are not treated fairly. It's a typical asian corporate workplace where if you talk a bit during office hours, you will be deemed as lazy and not doing your work.

Prolonged probation period/pay increment - some people i know were given a promise by the MD but he did not deliver his promise and employee felt shortchanged.
As an employee there, I shared the same sentiments as most of my colleagues; we felt that we were being shortchanged and made use of. There is no such thing as mutually beneficial relationship between us and the company. 

Extreme micromanagement - Strictly no mobile phones during work. All employees have to deposit their mobile phones before starting work and retrieve them after getting off work. All decisions are strictly made by the MD.

It is a relatively small company so you will have to take up other unrelated responsibilities which might be less interesting

High employee turnover"
