Fair attendance system,"Short training,  no help from management once they throw you on the floor. Your disposal they will fire you for the dumbest thing and replace you over night.  They don't care about you as a person,  only what you can do for them."
2,Capital Management,customer care representative,2016-02-05,3.0,Customer Care Representative,I learned a lot about what to look for when applying for a loan and what the interest rates for paying a loan company back are.

6,Capital Management,Worst owners and district manager ever.,2014-02-22,1.0,,"None... Honestly. Simply a terrible company to work for. They own most checkers on the island and the company has gone to garbage as of late. No managers in the company, overtime not paid out hours cut off checks..etc","Too many to list from the miserable owners the ""O'Hara brothers"" and the worst director of operations ever. They just come across as rude, un-grateful, no benefits offered no 401k no dental no health insurance, pay is terribly below other competitors pay rate..not to mention half of the time they can't pay their employees and they harass the managers like no company I have ever seen before. Worst work experience ever to say the least."
