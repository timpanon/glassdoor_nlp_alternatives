1,CareOne Credit,Payment Assistant Coach,2016-06-27,1.0,"Payment Assistant Coach, Telecommute","Telecommuting, average salary during training","Company didn't care about success of it's clients in the program, only cared about sales.  Some reps signed up people who did not understand the process and canceled a month later."
2,CareOne Credit,Best Company Ever,2016-03-18,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"They allow agents to work at home or in the Columbia, MD Home office.  Their benefits are fantastic, and their pay scale is higher than most work at home opportunities.  The people are wonderful to work with.  Management is tough, but fair.",Performance measures are all or nothing.  Very high performance standards must be met to continue employment.
3,CareOne Credit,Downsizing,2016-03-09,3.0,Customer Service Representative,Work from home job and the hours are good,downsizing and the CEO is allowing the CareOne brand and reputation to go down hill fast. Its like watching a train wreck
4,CareOne Credit,credit counselor,2015-11-20,4.0,,opportunity to work with and help clients all over the country in a fast paced and challenging environment. good earnings opportunity.,none that would not keep me from working there
5,CareOne Credit,Great Place To Work,2015-11-12,5.0,Certified Solution Coach,"work from home, benefits, great pay...","high turn over, closed business"
6,CareOne Credit,Client Servces,2015-04-22,1.0,,Work at home good hours and vacations.,Going out of business soon.
7,CareOne Credit,Great company.,2015-03-24,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work from home with benefits, PTO, 401k and paid training. Room for advancement or change into a new department.",Evaluations were brutal. You didn't always get the same QA representative so what they marked off for another might not and vice versa.
8,CareOne Credit,Just don't do it,2014-12-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working at home, some nice co-workers, and PTO. That's it.","Everything. 
The only good thing about the job was working at home and some of the other reps were nice. The company helps a small portion of customers and the rest are burned. The enrollment coaches give unrealistic expectations to customers. You will not feel like the company cares about customers or employees. Layoffs once or twice a year. Constant threat of termination even if you miss quota by a tiny fraction. The requirements are inconsistent and always change. You aren't really helping people manage debt, but rather answering calls and trying to help them, if you can, under 6 mins. 

Read the reviews under Ascend One. It's the same company. I wrote a more thorough review there."
9,CareOne Credit,Awesome place to work,2014-08-18,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"Virtual at home office environment, great benefits",prone to layoffs because of industry
10,CareOne Credit,Good while it lasted!,2014-07-29,2.0,Creditor Negotiator,"Medical Benefits, PTO, Worked from Home, & Not Micromanaged.","Was very stressful. If didn't hit goals in a month or 2 you should be worried about your job. Very high turnover rate,  very high layoff rate... (Was a waste...of 4 years... I could've found a lifetime job had I known the company would take a huge downfall)"
11,CareOne Credit,Decent experience,2014-03-19,3.0,,"Work from home...steady check, great experience","constant layoff, bonuses not paid out"
12,CareOne Credit,CareOne can be a great place to work if you're motivated to succeed.,2014-02-02,3.0,,You can work from home and the benefits are great. You can feel good about the service you provide to the clients.,"The monthly goals and overall pay are inconsistent. You're work can stay just a good, but your pay year to year can vary greatly."
13,CareOne Credit,Star one month out the door the next,2013-10-12,3.0,Credit Negotiations,Great people to work with,You are a star one month and garbage he next. They treat you like a number nota person
14,CareOne Credit,Beware Credit Negotiator Job- most leave within 6 mnonths,2013-07-09,1.0,Creditor Negotiator,"You get to work from home, so good for people who do not drive, have kids etc...","turnover rate is similar to fast food places.  Been here nearly a year and was hired in a class of 23 people.  Of those 23, only 6 are still here. And 4 of the 6 are actively looking for another job before they get fired.   Monthly goals are always changing, mgrs. in this dept are basically worthless, and you learn everything BY YOURSELF thru trial and error.  They teach you nada.  I dare say that what we ""do"" (settling client's credit accts or less"") is not true.  The company charges fees up the wazzoo from the clients, and all they care about is those fees wether we go to completion on those settlements, as most of the accts usually falter and the client pulls out.  But mgmt. doesn't care cus they already got the fee from the client.  Lastly, do not TRUST anyone, even your peers, as they will lie, stab, and cheat to get to their goals even if that includes ""stealing"" your accts."
15,CareOne Credit,Good Work From Home If You Can Handle The Pressure,2012-12-28,3.0,Customer Service/Sales,Pays on time.  Extensive training. Room For Advancement. Great Pay,"At times unachievable metrics.  Hard to get with the ""in"" crowd.  Most of training class got fired within a few months."
16,CareOne Credit,Working at Careone,2012-12-06,3.0,Sales Representative,"Working for Careone is great, because you get to work from home. Their are different hours you can work as well.",Very cut throat and if you are not performing they will let you go within 3 months
17,CareOne Credit,Not for Everyone,2012-09-05,2.0,Credit Counselor,"Getting to work from home, helping people with troubling debt, and hourly pay was decent.",The managers give you mixed messages on what's required or acceptable ways to sell products. Metrics are unrealistic and based on circumstances that are out of your control. They monitor all of your calls. It's a numbers game and late shifts will have less opportunities for you to get inbound calls (and less sales).
18,CareOne Credit,not as good as it seems,2012-07-04,2.0,Credit Counselor,"Work from home-it is a welcome relief.
 
Decent Pay","Managers micromanage everything even when you do well (Have met goal the last 4months in a row)

There is no good work-life balance. I work here now.. been here for the last 9 months and I have no where near 4 weeks paid vacation! (referring to the poster above)  And Im in the sales dept..more like 2.5 weeks really. Also taking into account that you will prob work one of the major holidays (due to the fact that you will be drafted if noone volunteers to work those days)

High turnover rate--been here 9 months and from my sales team alone Ive seen 4 people be let go. Kind of scary.

Bonus structure-- from the way the bonus structure stands only a hand full of people will get paid bonuses monthly. 20% is based on getting people signed up but 80% is based off of people making payments. Good luck getting people who are fundamentally terrible at paying bills to make payments in the program.

Alot of the calls are beyond your control-you will prob get about 12-14 calls a day and you are supposed to convert 4 to 5 of those a day. It seems easy on paper. Not easy in practicse. Per day atleast 7-8 calls are bs..(i.e looking for student loans, car loans, cash out or a mistake call which all counts against you for calls for the day) and then another 3-4 that will want to take a couple days to think about it.. thats not also taking the others that will not qualify due to income or amount of debt owed...
I would not reccomend this job to any friends.."
19,CareOne Credit,This is a challenging and rewarding work culture with a fun vibe.,2012-01-10,5.0,Social Media Manager,Strong emphasis on maintaing a work-life balance. Provide value added services for consumers so that I feel good about what I do. Thought leaders in this industry with a focus on consumer advocacy. Fantastic team cross functional team environment with a high caliber of working professionals.,"Resources can be a challenge, sometimes limited the execution of new ideas."
