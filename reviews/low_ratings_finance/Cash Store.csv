23,Cash Store,Decent Job,2021-01-28,3.0,Store Manager,You move up the pay scale quickly and have seven hours of built-in over time per week as store manager. Good money if you live somewhere the cost of living isn't too high.,You have to work every Saturday and have to be employed for one calendar year to get any paid time off. Companies like this are predatory to older people on social security.
24,Cash Store,Keep Looking,2021-01-26,1.0,Store Manager,"Paycheck is good. You get non performance based raises every 3 months so it'll take you from $16 to $18 in about a year. Managers make decent money, about $19/hr plus 7hrs of over time each week. So comes out to about $2900/mo.","EXTREME Micro Management- they literally watch over your shoulder and write their observation. As soon as you get off a call you can expect to be asked ""how do you think that went?"" and then you'll be taken to the back to do a role play. This is SO frequent that you get numb to the constant picking. It's not a reflection of you, but nothing you do is going to be correct, so just expect to ""suck"". 
Absolutely Terrible DMs and AMs- they do not care about you or what you have going on in your life such as deaths in the family, medical problems etc. It's like they have a pool of the most awful people and stick them into a manager role. 
The turnover rate is awful. They will create a schedule and give you days off or approve days off then all of a sudden maybe 3 days before that day off, you'll have your AM just decide that that's no longer going to happen.  They did this at Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. 
They do not adjust their metric goals to reflect the current economy and continued to stick to numbers that were projected from the year before. So of course, you're never going to meet those goals or get a bonus. It's very hard to stay motivated. 
Overall, awful place to work. The best thing about it was my staff, they were awesome."

Hours suck 8:45-7:15 and you cannot leave early. So, forget about having a life outside of work.

Nothing to do most of the day. No Support. They make YOU secret shop with a biased opinion vs hiring someone outside the company."

How about that IT had a breach of security and all of the employees working prior to Dec 2018 have had there personal information including ssn sitting in some previous employees laptop and haven’t told anybody that their information was compromised. I’ve been working here for 2 years now and I’ve fired countless employees for crazy reasons, and I don’t have a say. I’ve even been instructed to make up stuff to ensure HR approves the termination. We have to find something negative to say to our employees every audit. We discriminate against age and gender during interviews. Only pretty young females are in management positions with a great smile and no feedback to COC. We constantly talk crap about every employee and each other. And we’re basically trained to be manipulative. The only way to make it in this company is smile, obsess over metrics, shut up and agree to everything  your COC says. It’s like this in every state everywhere"

The type of things they spend time training you on will make you feel like a fifth grader but you can't blame them, that's probably the highest level of education your COC has. With this company, ignorance is bliss! The dumber, the better! No security and it is truly terrifying. I honestly wanted to move up with this company when I finished my degree but now plan on running as fast as I can. I've gotten in trouble for things that I was trained to do, numerous times. The only plus side is, they are firing people so often that just filling out the application will get you hired."

60,Cash Store,Gained invaluable experience but ultimately disposable,2019-01-20,3.0,District Manager,"Very competitive pay 
Opportunity for advancement 
Bonus and overtime opportunity 
Set schedule for lower positions","Taking a management position-DM position is salaried. The SM position is set off a 47 hour work week and is paid hourly. Once promoted to DM your scheldule goes to 60 hours plus. I often worked 70 plus hours a week for a year straight all paid salaried. You have a DM phone that must be answered anytime and employees often call before and after work hours extending time at work. If you are out you often are expected to still compete work tasks. All said the pay is great at the store level but once hitting salaried it’s not there. You’ll work twice as much and take home less than your hourly employees.  Upper management is often on different tracks with each other causing lots of rapid changes throughout the day. This makes it difficult to maintain a level of security and trust with store level employees who are constantly driven and then given new direction at the drop of a hat.  The directives could be great if upper management was on the same page with each other and didn’t change so often. After more than 5 years with the company I saw little opportunity for future advancement, corporate hires outside company for higher management positions, creating people making policy directives to be out of touch with day to day operations. There is also a constant culture of fear and negative energy that comes from constant monthly audits, written critiques of every employees area of development up to 6 plus a month per employee, the purpose is to support the stores and drive growth but often times due to it being a scheduled task it does the opposite. This creates a general sense of unease with all levels of employees because they all experience the same procedure and is why the company has such high turnover."

And they reel you in with bonuses, but you'll never reach the goal (maybe 1 out of 12 times.) They make it nearly impossible. 

- Co-workers are not all up to par, yet after many complaints to upper management 
nothing is ever achieved. True, not everyone learns at the same pace, but if you've been at a company for seven years, how do you STILL not know what you're doing? And how has nothing been done about it?

- Upper management doesn't see what truly goes on in a store, only the Store Manager, yet the store manager is not allowed to issue write-ups or ""retrain."" That doesn't make sense. When upper management comes in, the employees act on their best behavior and tip-toe around, but as soon as management leaves, it's back to old habits. 

- Sure, you work a half-day on Saturday, but you work 11 hour days (sometimes more) if you're a store manager. There is NO CHANCE for a life."

There is no freedom whatsoever and everything is THEIR way, from the family pictures you are allowed to have to the way YOU set up YOUR OWN break area...and these are just light examples. Any pass downs/experiences are passed through a ""chain of command,"" instead of someone just telling us what/how things need to be done. Which wouldn't be problematic if you didn't have Regional Managers who would rather lie about what a higher up said than just be honest. Honesty is not valued at all in this company. If you alert management of a co-worker coming to work high and selling drugs out of the parking lot, nothing will be done...but a TARGET will be put on YOUR back for causing ""drama.""

You are at risk of being fired at anytime without any reason or explanation. They will fire faster then they hire, leaving alot of stores short staffed which makes the workload a lot harder to handle. Even given the circumstances of being extremely under-staffed they still expect you to perform as well as a store that is equipped with a full staff as well as working systems. If you are a manager you are expected to work LONG hrs (830am-730pm) 5 days a week which leaves you no time for any other obligations!  They train the employees to basically talk customers into debt. Forcing us to push refinance options which will never benefit the customer. The customers range from single mothers working at minimum wage to people making $3,000 every 2 weeks so its sad watching these people dig themselves into a deeper hole than the one they were in when they first applied for the loan.

Working the 47 hours a week, without a lunch break also began to tear me up. The overtime is a bonus!!!! BUT, It wears on you quickly. I know it's not a state law but a lunch break would be nice.

Raises every 3 months for the  first  year.,"Working  6 days a week and when asking for time, never guaranteed that you going to  get time off. Always told "" well see if we have the coverage"". It sucks the life out of you physically and emotionally."
145,Cash Store,"If you know you are the best, give this one a chance! Don't be mislead.",2014-10-03,4.0,Manager,"Pay is great! Co workers are a plus! I have read all of the reviews regarding experiences with this company and it is very misleading. It is unfortunate that employees that are terminated choose to take their emotions online. The truth of the matter is what level headed company would choose to keep employees that aren't performing? I have, myself worked in a store that had low numbers at one time or another. I have seen many employees falter and pick themselves back up only to succeed later. This company gives many chances. Probably more than they should in many cases. But if your service or performance is hurting the greater good, it's time for you to go. We as people don't always make the best decisions in our choices so don't blame the company if you just came to collect a paycheck. This company wants passion and drive which is rare these days.","Honestly, things can get stressful. After all we are still dealing with the public."
146,Cash Store,"cool job, but upper level management sucks",2014-09-29,3.0,Assistant Store Manager,"the pay is really good, coworkers are great, 40 hours a week, easy to get hired, easy job once you get the hang of it","very high turnover rate, i don't think they honestly care about their employees, job is not secure,  not a long term career"
147,Cash Store,Store Manager,2014-09-05,2.0,Store Manager,tthe starting pay is 14 to 15 dollars an hour and increase 3  to 4 times in increments of .30 to .60 within the first year...  u will make good money...,"Stay assistant store manager because if you become a store manager its mandatory to work 47 hours, which only good for the over time pay.  But if your store do not profit due to people not paying back it's on you. The company have created this make a friend technique which is crap because u suppose to befriend customer. YOU can kiss @$$ to your customers all day all if they do not want to pay their not going too, eespecially if their intentions are not to pay the money back. If your is the an certain area... The store can profit or lose money. . As the store manager it fall on u...no matter how hard u work.... One more thing as a store manager you do not have the power to actually write the asst. manager  up only the district manager has that power. So in other if you have a lazy staff there's nothing you can do about it but as soon as the district manager walked through the door they're working their hearts out. And the district manager cannot write them up unless  seeing it with there own eyes.....If u choose to become a store manager at the company pick your store carefully do not pick first store they throw at u that store manager position is open for a reason.. If u in school company's not willing to work around school schedule..."
148,Cash Store,"Unstable work environment, unsecure, supervisors fake attitudes.",2014-08-25,1.0,Store Manager,"The pay is great. They sucker you in with the promise of being promoted, getting bonuses and usually hire single mother's with children.",Job security is horrible. Benefits are bare minimum. Work environment can be boring yet stressful do to slow times and being bullied to gain new business and retrieve bad debt from customers that will never pay or take out loans only to turn around and file bankruptcy. Incentitives are rarely reachable so the possibilities of bonusing are rare.  There is no open door policy so you pretty much put up and shut up.
149,Cash Store,You can do better.,2014-08-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"pay, they pay unemployment ( so I hear) THIS company sucks","Everything. I have been here for two months and this is the WORST JOB I have ever had. In my first week I saw FIVE people get fired. Everyone talks about each other. When I was hired I was told I would have time to spend with children that's a LIE. Everyone is required to close EVERY NIGHT with no exceptions. I was told I would be an  assistant manager, come to fine out everyone is a "" Assistant manager"". The Manager and Assistant Manager is just a title, the whole store is ran by the District manager. The store manager can't even do their own schedules. The customers are rude and per company policy we are to mistreated in order to keep customers happy. My second day of working there I was sent to another store to help out and I did not have a clue to what I was doing and to make things even worse I got a RETRAINING FORM"" How can I get a form because I messed up and I'm new. I have a job interview Monday and if I get the job I'm out o0f here."
