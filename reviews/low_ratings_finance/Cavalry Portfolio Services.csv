There are other insensitive for attendance,Not a lot of room to advance into management. Do note practice some of their own core values.
1,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Great Culture,2021-02-02,4.0,Business Analyst Intern,Actually looked forward to coming to work here everyday! Invaluable internship experience.,Sometimes a bit unstructured but could be a good thing depending on personality
2,Cavalry Portfolio Services,"Smart colleagues, great work-life balance",2019-12-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have worked at Cavalry for over 5 years and enjoyed my time here. To start with I have met some very bright people here - talented, skilled and know the right way to do a job smart. The boundaries to do a task is not rigid and that allows you to perform your job without much constraints. Work life balance is great with a simple logic- complete time sensitive projects on time, and no one would question you. No micromanagement which is great. Not much hierarchy when looking to get something accomplished but being in the finance sector there are certain processes in place to be compliant that could sometimes hinder your job. 
Very casual work environment, nice and friendly colleagues.","Benefits (401k, medical) could be better. No remote option."
3,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Great Company,2019-11-05,5.0,Resolution Specialist,Great coworkers and management truly cares about the employees.,No cons I can find so far.
4,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Not bad,2019-10-22,1.0,Attorney,The people are nice and helpful.,benefits package is not competitive.
5,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Awful,2019-02-17,1.0,Resolution Specialist,"Bonus potential, but only if you get lucky or happen to be among the absolute best debt collectors that ever walked the face of the earth.","Poor benefits, completely unrealistic goals. There is a tiered performance system that makes it nearly impossible to catch up if you fall behind. If you are a good debt collector or good in call centers, there are much better options. The company has zero loyalty to you, you are purely a number to them. Employees that have been there for years and years are let go without a second though if they have a few months of bad luck."
6,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Stressful and Negative,2019-01-08,3.0,Resolution Specialist,"Co-workers and Staff managers. Bonus potential, tho tough to attain.","At the end of the day, Cav does not care. You are truly just a number to them."
7,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Overall,2018-05-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great environment, with great people",Too much sitting too repetitive
8,Cavalry Portfolio Services,An evolving company,2017-06-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,It's a job with a paycheck.,"Rare upward mobility, heavily influenced by office politics
Work may be [very] mundane, depending on you position"
9,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Collection Manager,2017-06-21,3.0,Anonymous Employee,It is a Great company to work has a lot diversity,The Compensation changes too often
10,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Valhalla full time,2017-03-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great culture.  They work hard to promote teamwork.  Very focused on compliance.  CEO communicates very well.,Tough environment - lots of regulations.
11,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Terrible Company,2017-02-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,It is located close to my home.,There is a huge turnover. The senior staff takes credit for your work.
12,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Cavalry,2017-01-16,3.0,Customer Service Representative,Ability to work part time from 8am to 12pm was a plus.,The part time employees were not treated as part of the company by management or full time employees. We were made to feel like a number only. They sem to add work but did not want to pay more than $10/h
13,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Resolution Specialist,2016-09-28,4.0,Resolution Specialist,"I love  Cavalry.. I left due to a personal family decisions, but  It was a great company to work for.. From Managers, HR, Training and coworkers they are all great people always willing to help... Managers are highly knowledgeable about the collection field . You will be making about 250 calls per day, plus the incoming calls.. You need good listening skills, and must be able to multi-task ALOT,   Must have a thick skin for this collections type of environment. You cannot work here if you are someone who cannot take upset customers screaming at you.   You will get your great loyal customers and the upset ones too...  

One of the best parts here  was the money although the hourly starting rate is not as high as other companies, their bonus and commission structure is uncapped. If you are a good collector, customer service, and money motivated person its a great opportunity to take home great bonus and commission month after month!!!!! Another great thing is if you are a top collector you have the opportunity to set up your own schedule which worked great for me..","Unfortunately with this type of companies with a high volume of employees there is always people who come to work to gossip and do everything else besides collecting on those account.. If you are smart you will know how to handle it to keep a positive, professional environment."
14,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Not the place for me,2016-06-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"They do some good charity work, and support employees and good causes","Poor management, questionable business practices"
15,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Never Developed,2016-05-01,2.0,Senior Manager,"Not much. Some good people.  Can be opportunistic in its design, but value that you create can be fleeting.  There seemed to be growth and opportunity around the corner, but it never came to fruition.","Most people need to tear someone else down to create value or opportunity.  Highly impatient culture.  Analytics is done in an ad-hoc fashion with a heavy hand regardless of the business case.  Nobody feels secure in their position and even senior managers are probably better off undermining more talented people in order to keep themselves propped up.  The majority owner has made a lot of money in spite of himself, his petty nature has gotten in the way of the business growing and becoming a good place to work.  The CEO is very capable and a good leader, however he is crippled by the chairman and is not allowed to lead effectively, the COO is insecure / closed minded, the CFO is the most sound business person in the company but mostly at an eagle's pov, the legal department is an elitist frat, anything having to do with collections operations outside of legal paper has withered and died, even HR has lost its people and has only served as a blind agent, its generally a depressing atmosphere."
16,Cavalry Portfolio Services,RUN,2016-04-08,1.0,Legal,"Aside from being able to say ""i have a full time job"", there are no pros for this company. Employees receive a biweekly crap paycheck and benefits that make Obamacare look like heaven.","Very sneaky and deceptive (to customers AND employees). High turnover. Employees are not treated like sentient beings. Micromanaged. Bonus' and base pay are a joke. Noone knows what they are doing, including management."
17,Cavalry Portfolio Services,unsure what this is suppose to say,2016-03-23,2.0,Sorter,part time was good at the time,"low pay,no job substance,part time position was discontinued"
18,Cavalry Portfolio Services,make it hard to hit new money and bonus,2016-02-25,1.0,Resolution Specialist Front-end,"The Managers are Awesome to work with and I have met some wonderful people here that I call family.. The health benefits are good, the gym in basement is okay, grill is okay..","Bonus structure has changed, the majority of our accounts now go to agency..We don't make the money like we use to make.. 90 % of our inbounds go to agency or attorney or customer service questions.. The majority of agency accounts are paying but we see none of that money.. I been at Cavalry over 5 years and the last 2 yrs things have totally changed.. I have did collections over 15 years and I have never seen it as bad as I do now.. The money is out there but Agency is taking it all .. They hired the agency because we were told they were cheaper to work with.. This was said by upper Mgmt and across the floor.. We heard these words with our own ears.. I used to think Cav-Cares but now I'm not so sure of that.. I have seen a lot of good collectors quit because they weren't getting the bonuses anymore due to Agency getting them.. Even pre-lit isnt doing well anymore some of best legal collectors got put back on front-end due to not meeting their goal which makes it hard to do when Agency gets the accounts.. And when we get accounts their garbage stuff so old or they all speak spanish or some other foreign language we cant even pronounce.. They make it hard for us collectors..Also the audit structure isn't fair.. They ding you for everything sometimes foolish things.. We have to have $4000 new money before you can get your audit money.. If you pass all your audits and get 6 highs but don't get your new money you lose your $250 audit bonus.. It used to not be that way.. I remember when I first started with Cavalry they were announcing money everyday on the floor but now you rarely hear it much anymore.. I miss those days where I used to love my job but now it makes me want to leave.. I am totally dissatisfied with the way our company is going.. Things have changed so much and it's not for the better.. I don't recommend anyone apply for this company.. futhermore we haven't hired anybody in over a year makes us wonder if they are trying to get rid of the employees so they just have a small group to work with and can expand more with the Agency.. 
The career opportunities for advancement and growth isn't there..Your kinda stuck where you are.."
19,Cavalry Portfolio Services,bad company,2016-02-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,no pros company sucks needs new owners,the company itself sucks needs new management and the company could careless if you dying if you don't have sick time your fired and they don't care.

22,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Recovery Specialist,2015-08-21,3.0,Account Resolution Specialist,Great management in the Tulsa office,Not shared with all employees
23,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Run away....,2015-07-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Bonus could be decent.  Hours weren't bad because they don't want to pay overtime.  Location good if you want to avoid city commute.,"Pretty much everything else about working at this company.  Too much to list but horrible management, extremely low employee morale and management who could care less.  No matter what, you're never doing enough work.  Also, constant revolving door of workers either quitting or getting fired so everyone is always scrambling to pick up slack.  Employees constantly working to throw each other under the bus."
24,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Developing culture where you can make an impact!,2015-02-20,5.0,,"Key strengths:  financial strength and stability, core belief in what we do and how we want do it, interesting mix of work, exciting and challenging time.  

Cavalry’s core competencies enable the company to compete in an increasingly regulated and consolidating industry and provide opportunity for personal growth and development.  Cavalry’s Partners (privately owned) are sophisticated, prudent entrepreneurs. They capitalize on best practices of the past and recognize that businesses need to be agile to meet the needs of the future.",Developing culture in a challenging industry (debt collections).  Difficult to attract employees to build the desired culture due in part to the stigma of the industry.
25,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Work to be done,2015-02-13,3.0,Anonymous Employee,If you are able to meet the standards. You can work here for a long time. Commission is uncapped and if you can perform. You can make money.,"Compensation needs to be improved upon, they teach you about collections but lack negotiation training that will help you succeed. Management can be unfocused and lack direction. Information does not translate well between departments."
26,Cavalry Portfolio Services,One of thé worst companies in thé history of time,2015-02-03,1.0,Business Process Analyst,There aré no pros. Hard to find anything positive here.,"from thé moment you start working here, you will here How everone starts saying How much They hâte working here. None of thé department has proper organisation . Senior management talks to you like you dont matter and picks on you All thé time. There are no clear Work goal defined,There is no project management and sometimes you dont even know Who your boss is, still you might get yelled on for Work you were never given and did not do. They fire péople Who are logical , argue and do not follow things blindly.Dont ever think of joining this company."
27,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Legal admin/ audit,2015-01-27,2.0,Administrative Assistant,Flexible hours. No one really knows what they are doing so it is easy to fit in as a new employee.,"This company has been around for over 10 years yet still seems brand new. The management team at this company lacks professionalism and knowledge. It's difficult to work with a manager that knows less than you. They have a handful of managers that only received their title because of they made friends with the right people, not because they actually know what they are doing. They are over paid and under qualified. I would never recommend this company to anyone. You will not be valued, you will not be challenged and you will not be properly compensated.  Stay away!!!!!"
28,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Good part time hours,2015-01-12,2.0,Sortor,"flexible, can schedule days off and work evening shift to make up lost hrs.",luck-dial phone #'s 4 hrs
29,Cavalry Portfolio Services,My Unemployment Job,2014-10-28,1.0,Corporate Position,"They paid me every two weeks. 
Made me work even harder to find a challenging legitimate position with another company.","1. No room for growth although during the interview process they will tell you how there are so many opportunities to move around within the company
2. The corporate culture is borderline abusive. If you have a difference of opinion from your superior you are told that you have a negative attitude. If you have a legitimate question about procedure and actually try to ask it it can be considered as being negative. I was once told "" not to question things and you are to do what you are told [blindly]""
3. The office environment reminded me of high school where the senior staff would gang up on powerless subordinates in and effort to demean and demoralize their work.
4. There is no room to be promoted or to excel."
30,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Disorganized and Unnecessarily Stressful on Employees,2014-08-26,2.0,Legal Coordinator,Bonuses can be good but largely based on luck. Decent benefits.,Not sure what essential job functions were as they were constantly changing. Layoffs and disconnect with upper management was stressful to deal with always wondering if the next meeting would be your last.

35,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Humble paycheck it's just a job not a career here this place will stunt your professional growth.,2013-07-02,3.0,Collector,"For the most part the co-workers are friendly but like I said there is a hierarchy of favorites shown in who works what file. SSU-Pre Litigation, Special Projects, Second Effort, Front End Co-workers are fun and easy going and easy to work with.
The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers feel good about setting up arrangements and closing calls in a way that doesn't stress out the consumer.","I learned that company rules can differ from the regulations that can leave collectors open to liability i.e. foreshadowing etc. There is a high level of Bureaucratic co-dependence that makes it easy to play favorites that shows in file assignments. SSU, Special Projects, Second Effort, Front End account scores.Some of the managers do and say unprofessional things ,harass employees through coercive reverse psychology and slander. Some of the managers prey on sheepish subordinates. The ones I describe as bad apples make the core values appear to be a front and make the environment uncomfortable."
36,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Good place to start career but move on to grow professionaly,2013-07-01,3.0,,"Company gives Good compensation and bonuses to employees.
It offers relaxed environment with flexibility for work timings and leaves.
It's easy to approach executives to share ideas that you have.","Company lacks professionalism and lot of things are caught up due to intra departmental problems.
There is less scope of growth.
People you work under lacks exposure to corporate culture due to which there is no mentorship and no learning experience.
Due to limited use of technologies and new methods there is no o scope of enhancing your skills."
37,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Enjoyable company with a future of opportunities for expansion.,2013-02-03,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I enjoy working here very much.  It helps that I am in a support position and not on the front end collections.  They are working towards creating a favorable corporate culture despite the social stereotypes of a collection company.  There is a lot of diversity in the staffing of the support positions in the Phoenix office.  The Phoenix office is finally getting a remodel to make the facility looking new, crisp and clean.",It is a collection call center and I do not like the industry in general.  The front end has quite a high turnover rate as opposed to the support staff that have been there since the beginning of the company.  There is a large rumor/gossip mill that has not been addressed by supervisors or management which adds fuel to the fire.
38,Cavalry Portfolio Services,terrible company.  firing people became the norm. do not work here.,2012-12-19,1.0,,there is nothing positive to say about this place. selfish owners.,bad culture. everyone hated each other and was back stabbing.
39,Cavalry Portfolio Services,Glad to have moved on,2012-11-17,1.0,Legal,Lax dress code. It's a paycheck.,"The most disorganized work environment I have ever been a part of, from top to bottom. The company's philosophy is to do the bare minimum, including pay and benefits. Employees are given little guidance to do a job well done but are quick to be reprimanded. Poor employee morale leads to continuously high staff turnover."
