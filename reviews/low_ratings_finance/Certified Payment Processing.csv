All positions are sales.",All positions are sales with a base pay (minimum) and mostly commissions on getting outside reps to sell credit card machines.

7,Certified Payment Processing,How many times are they going to change names,2016-05-19,1.0,,The only pro about working for this company is you get to meet new people everyday,"They lie about setting appointments- They might set one or two, but the rest is just you walking in unannounced to pressure people into switching their payment processor. We got the cops called on us after they said they set an appointment at a beauty salon which was a lie. If you want to have a bad name in your community you should definitely work for CPP or whatever they call themselves now.
They lie about paying you- They find ways to swindle you out of your bonuses. They say they reimburse you for gas when you make a certain number of sales then find a way to not pay you. They also didnt pay me after I went back 3 times to a business because they kept ""losing"" a signature sheet (but the funny thing was without that sheet they said they couldn't charge him for service but they were already charging him.
They cheat the customers- I stayed in contact with someone I signed up for their service and they told me they have money missing when they batch out for the night.. I signed a very sweet Korean lady up for a POS (Point of Sale) system for her restaurant  which was awesome, or so I thought. See they already had her under contract under a different company name Which my team leader told me to go ahead and sign her up. I signed her up and they started double charging her, but they told me I wouldn't get credit for my hard work since she was already under contract. I go eat there once a week since I feel bad for helping them do her dirty the food is awesome. I told her to just go to Sam's Club for her payment processing and if she sues them I would help her explain what a dirty company CPP is.
They are just a very crooked company in general"

They should have never fired the former president and hired Andy Frankel.","There is not enough room to type, they overcharge there customer with hidden fees. They tell he sales staff to avoid he fees and lie. No bonus are ever correct on purpose. If you want to be a manager there check your paperwork they put you in a two year non-compete so if you want to leave you are trapped. They hire 1099 reps tell them they get good appointments when I fact they don't. They make fake Internet postings about people liking there company when in fact they don't. Andy cares more about going to Dallas National golf course then building a company. No training and they openly degrade people for sex,and gender.  I could keep going but I think you get the point this is bad news."

You would have better luck at making a single dollar if you begged in the street.,"Everything.  First off I saw CPP's rebuttal on another review.  They make it seem like the posters are lazy and don't put the work in.  This company is a complete scam.  Any legitimate company posts their processing rates.  Check merchant maverick out for real processing companies that list their rates.  Why don't they post their rates?  They go in low then raise them later on.  The people posting their reviews on here are not lazy they have seen through your lies and deceit.  None of the ""appointments"" are real.  You don't pay anyone what you promise.  You make people waste their time and gas and you are dirty liars."
13,Certified Payment Processing,"Don't believe the lies, door to door sales",2015-10-12,1.0,,No. I will keep typing so I meet word minimum.,"I decided to try these guys out because I was out of work and down on my luck. The hire was so easy it should have been a red flag. Hired over the phone in 15 minutes, then sent some paperwork in the mail and like sales forms. Did ""training"" over a web seminar with a bunch if other people with funny sounding names. Ones told their products basically sold themselves and it would be a breeze even without any previous sales experience. The ""appointments"" aren't real. They just tell you to go to some random business super far away from wherever you happen to be, and you show up saying ""May I speak with the owner"" looking like a sales schmuck in a button down shirt and you're lucky the owner is even ""there."" Like they want to talk to you anyway. Plus, these guys just want you to get your ""team lead"" on the phone with the businesses owner, which is super awkward and a backwards way of selling stuff. I made zero sales in one week, made zero dollars, wasted a whole bunch of gas, time, and not to mention being frustrated the entire time about the whole situation. The sale itself is like trying to sell a lifetime supply of green apples to someone who already has a lifetime supply of red apples, and trying to convince them why green apples are better and to get rid of ALL of their red apples as soon as possible."

The leads are better, the training is better, the products and service our customers get is better and the pay is better. We have great support and training for new sales reps also.","Your going to have some bad appointments here and there that just don't work out. But this is sales, it's unavoidable. You'll have good days and bad days here, in sales you have to be able to handle a little rejection. If you can handle some people telling you no you will see other appointments turn into sales but you can't give up the first time someone tells you no. If sales was an easy job everyone would want to do it and no one would make much doing it."
20,Certified Payment Processing,Sales rep,2015-07-30,5.0,MSC/Sales Representative,"The support I get from my manager is great, anytime I'm struggling to close a sale I can call him and he's usually able to turn it around. The training I got was very thorough and I'm doing pretty well. I've had 12 sales so far and I've only been here about 3 weeks. The process does work if you follow the training and instructions they give you. I really like it so far and I'm still learning everyday. I also like the payroll, I've gotten paid really fast for the sales I've made, that's a big plus for me.","Some appointments aren't that great but I think that's just the nature of sales, I have had a hand full of appointments each week that are a waste of time but I've still been making sales at other appointments so I think you just have to filter out the bad ones to get to the buyers."
