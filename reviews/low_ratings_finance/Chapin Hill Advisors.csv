0,Chapin Hill Advisors,Kathy Boyle does not deserve even one star,2020-09-20,1.0,Executive Assistant,You learn A LOT while working for Kathy.,"You're expected to work 60+ hours weekly with no guarantee of being paid. She pays you slightly above minimum wage for a $30 an hour salary expectations. I quit after 3 months when Kathy had only paid me for my first three weeks only after my phone broke & i needed to replace it. It had become very apparent that I would never see what she owed me in back wages. She often hires people with no experience & refuses to train them, then berates them for asking questions. She works out of her home, which is a glorified cesspool. I had people she worked with who would ask me how I could possibly work for her. When I quit, she attempted to push me down a flight of stairs then threatened my family & a family I knew nearby. I had to have the cops escort me to retrieve my belongings there. Kathy is an insane sociopath. I 100% do not recommend anyone to work with her, in any capacity."
1,Chapin Hill Advisors,Awful Experience,2020-05-04,1.0,Virtual Executive Assistant,the experience started out ok but i quickly realized that there was nothing good about this company or working here.,the CEO talks down to people. her expectations are unreasonable and she isn't willing to accept input. she never wants to pay the full value for your work. Kathy and her company are a lot of smoke and mirrors.

4,Chapin Hill Advisors,Big Ball O' Fun,2017-07-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I’ve worked professionally for jobs all along the East coast, and somehow, among them all, meeting and interacting with Chapin Hill Advisers and its President stood out as an experience worth jotting down on an expired coupon. Working for Kathy was not long and yet… too long. If you find yourself looking to ease your way into the professional field of “Anxiety Induction,” then look no further. The benefits have no end…or beginning, but take this opportunity to impress your new date smelling like dog and bragging about your new position as a punching bag, because at Chapin Hill they can guarantee both. Perhaps if one was applying to be the janitorial manager of the local dog fighting warehouse, having Kathy Boyle on your resume might put you on the top three applicants. Challenge your sense of smell, patience, dignity, and self-respect and apply to Chapin Hill Advisers TODAY! 
If you’re smart, weigh this option against volunteering with your local chain gang. 

But really, if you actually apply, god bless.",Can't really think of any...at the moment.
5,Chapin Hill Advisors,awful,2017-04-09,1.0,,"none, awful experience would not recomend to anyone.","terrible experience, terrible working conditions"
6,Chapin Hill Advisors,Deplorable conditions,2016-12-21,1.0,Intern,There are None!! Negative -5 STARS!!!,"Absolutely they should be ashamed of the way they treat their employees! Disgusting odor infused work environment.  Dog feces, urine, hair & mice nibbling away at everything!  The employees are treated like garbage, 0 cash flow. How can an advisor for other people's money even try to run a failing company when they can't even manage their own finances! Not paying employees in a timly manner, talking unprofessionally about other companies and former employees is absolutely dispicable.  If your ever offered a position? Run as fast away as you can. DO NOT even consider working in such an unstable environment!!"
7,Chapin Hill Advisors,Intern,2016-07-06,5.0,Intern,"Terrific way to gain experience in many facets of running a small business. My internship here was fascinating. I even referred 2 friends who alternated schedules with me. I learned about business planning, event management, marketing & a little finance. While my career path is on track in the medical arena, I enjoyed my experience here & learned applicable skills for the future",Day to day is a bit chaotic as there is a lot going on. The pace is fast & there are a lot of balls to juggle
8,Chapin Hill Advisors,Manager,2015-08-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Not one. It was a bleak experience.,"Inefficient operation, poor cash management, promises made and not kept, misleading forecasts of company goals and revenue, overall unstable environment."
9,Chapin Hill Advisors,Stressful and Challenging Work Environment,2015-03-14,1.0,Office Manager,Able to learn about various facets of the financial industry with out any formal training.,"There is a never ending list of high priority projects and heavy work load that have no follow through or organization with insufficient resources or time to accomplish the task. Frowned upon if you took your lunch hour in your 12 hour workday and if you ate in the office it had to be Vegan.  Exaggerated promises of benefits that never appeared. If you actually got to use your vacation time be prepared to receive attitude and negativity from the CFO.  The Office smelled horribly of dogs and ticks were on the animals and carpeting. There were insufficient funds to pay the necessary bills to run the business that was extremely stressful having bill collectors constantly calling.  Finally, the worst problem was the anguish if you were going to receive a paycheck when it was due or if it would have funds..."
