0,Charter School Business Management,Toxic Work Environment,2021-02-01,1.0,Senior Consultant,A good way to learn since they overwork you with various clients,Management pretends to value it's workers when their employee turnover says otherwise
1,Charter School Business Management,Great Company for Growth,2019-06-26,5.0,Financial Consultant,CSBM is a great place to grow and learn many different skills. You meet many people and their network is strong. The talent team is excellent with engaging employees and responding to suggestions. This company cares about the people who work here and actively encourages a pleasant work culture. The C-suite team is also filled with welcoming faces.  CSBM offers many excellent opportunities for growth.,I have never had a negative experience at CSBM.
2,Charter School Business Management,Manager,2019-03-02,5.0,,Great training program.  Respect to others is encouraged.  Company keeps up with technology.  Team oriented environment.  Excellent fringe benefits.,Working with different clients could be challenging at first.  The team is there to support you.
3,Charter School Business Management,Work in progress,2018-09-28,3.0,Anonymous Employee,The people are great and committed to clients and the children they support. More communication on what is going on in the company has been great. The bullpen seems less stressful and teammates are talking to each other without directors and team barriers.,"Some leaders need training on how to manage and talk to people.  I have seen changes over the last year like flex schedule and being in the office more but there is still favoritism that is hard to change. I think the explanation of the cuts to snacks, retreats and other changes seemed weak and instead too much attention on billable time."
4,Charter School Business Management,Used to be a good place to work...,2017-08-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,You will gain some charter school experience if you are eager to learn,"Work-life balance is disregarded
Directors/ Assoc. Directors do not really care about you
Directors & Assoc. Directors control most aspects of the entire company
Culture is EXTREMELY toxic... Tons of gossip and lying - you can not trust anyone
Do not expect to develop skills and experience unless it is convenient for management
There is no growth!!!! No opportunities to move up regardless of your knowledge and skills"
5,Charter School Business Management,Please don't lose your repetition as a Leader in CS finances,2017-08-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Friendly staff, hard working people. Company take care of staff during retreat, and invite staff to attend yearly Charter School National Conference.","the bar is very hight to get a promotion. I felt that I was just a Bookkeeper traveling from a school to another. I was underpaid, and felt that PTO where not enough.  The office is outdated and boring. I felt that some of the leadership team have no idea of what they are doing. I am not sure if they know accounting and finance. Managers in fact promote their best friends to the next level, no training,"
6,Charter School Business Management,Consultant,2017-06-02,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Team culture is great and everyone is friendly.,Little work/life balance. Pressure to learn quickly and acquire too many clients too quickly with little training.
7,Charter School Business Management,Stay away,2017-01-23,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Close to home and freeway,"Under paid, no growth opportunities"
8,Charter School Business Management,Horrible! Don't believe the hype when the last review was 3 years ago!,2016-07-07,1.0,,None that I can think of.,"I have been waiting patiently for someone to come forward and give an honest account of their experience at CSBM. Had they done so, I would have saved my time and moved on to something better at the time. First, there is a severe breakdown in communication between those who hire and fire, and those who are actually suppose to ""train"" you in the field. Management leave it up to the field managers and other ""consultants"" with backgrounds in accounting to ""train"" new hires. Apparently the field managers didn't get the memo because they expect you to hit the ground running. The job title is ""financial consultant"" which in this case is a misnomer. Make no mistake you are a bookkeeper traveling from one charter school to another sometimes in the same day.  You will have an assigned laptop with Quickbooks access to client accounts. Every school will have bookkeeping needs some more than others. The job is a logistics nightmare. You will work in a far out location in Brooklyn one day and in the South Bronx the next, and possibly back in some other location in Brooklyn  the following day, or Queens or possibly Far Rockaway. The areas are not very safe and the schools are often shared with untruly public high school students.  No one believes in taking lunch so you'll work 9-5 straight through and eat at your desk. With a schedule like that you may as well work for yourself with less stress and not so tiresome. You'll never really know where you stand with people who won't train you, don't have time to train you because they're too busy working yet need your help and miraculously expects you to know what you're doing.  Then field managers throw you under the bus to upper management to let you go. I've heard of many who were released the same way long after I was set free. It's a shame. Full disclosure is in order here and greater communication internally. I suppose the field managers will be doing it all."
9,Charter School Business Management,Pretty good experience,2014-11-02,4.0,Associate,You will learn so much working for this company.  You will be pushed and have a great team behind you. I loved the team atmosphere.,"On the flip side you will work really hard and as a lower end employee will feel pretty used at times.  Not much room for advancement because management level is pretty much filled with friends that get over average perks in a company, so they will never leave."
