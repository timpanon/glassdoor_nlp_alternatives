3,Check Into Cash,Heed my review.,2022-03-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The fellow employees of Check Into Cash. I respect them and would work with them again in a different environment.,"I initially thought Check Into Cash (CIC) was not that great of a place to work, but then we were merged with Community Choice Financial (CCFI) and I realized how great we had it. The ""merger"" as it was called which was a lie, was in fact an acquisition of the company. When this was announced there was no conversation or guidelines on how the company would proceed in any manner going forward. As such this led to a sizeable departure of employees from the start. Those that stayed around were still left in the dark and news of what to expect of the new company was non-existent. We condensed our several buildings down to two and of those two one was put up for lease, without telling the employees who worked in this building.

Next lets talk about the compensation, it is very poor compared to similar jobs and positions in the area. Not to mention the employees at CCFI make more than CIC even if they have the same title. There have not been pay raises in several years other than a promotion. No performance based pay raise, standard increases, cost of living increases, nothing that should merit a 
pay increase is done. Nevertheless the company wants its employees to work even harder now, due to the acquisition creating more work and most of the employees quitting. Not to mention they will take away most of your access to do your job without a warning and when you ask the people who did it they say make a ticket which will take up to an hour of your time on the phone to then be told they have to send it to someone else and you will get a call back in about another hour and then you are finally back to square one. Several talented people with ten, fifteen, even twenty plus years of experience
have walked out the door and the company has done nothing to stop it. To make matters even worse they have now updated their PTO policy to where if you quit or resign or are terminated in any way they will not pay out your remaining PTO balance like they used to. This is most likely due to so many employees quitting and CCFI not wanting to pay them out.

Upper management is inutile they are not qualified in any way to lead or manage employees. Most of them do what they will with no real consequences and there is nothing you can do about it. They act first without thinking, testing, or sending an email until weeks later or something breaks along the way. They do not listen to what you have to say or welcome any new ideas. Several complaints have been reported to human resources and managements bosses but it is not dealt with and just ignored. Management at CIC was respectable and listened and if not you could at least go up the chain of command and get an answer. Unfortunately there is no answer at CCFI and there is no chain of command or structured organization. 

All in all if you want to work here it should only be for a few months, this is solely a job now and no longer a career. There is no future at this company."

25,Check Into Cash,CIC is what happens if a dumpster fire and sinking titanic had a baby.,2021-11-26,1.0,Media Associate,"sometimes there were free cookies in the breakroom. my team was good, unlike most others at corporate","Where to begin. The CEO is completely disassociated with the company. He sits in his giant leather chair and lords over everyone. If you're in marketing, beware. He will find you and completely hijack your day (more like week) with stupid, not related to business ""tasks"" to boost his ego and wallet. Seriously. Who needs a website for a chicken that died 40 years ago? Or a made up goblin. The man bragged about having the same receptionist for over 5 years and never learning her name. The owners son decided that 2 handicap parking spaces were one too many so he took one so he and his dogs could park one space closer to the door. Human resources could care less about the employees. They're incredibly rude and make sure to take away ALL of your benefits by midnight on your last day. Most companies would let you keep your insurance until the end of the month (especially if you give a 2 weeks notice and follow through on it). But not Check Into Cash. The IT department would be great if the company would actually provide them with the resources and training to do their jobs effectively. There are some really talented people in IT but unfortunately they have to work off of old equipment that is at most halfway set up correctly. Most of the c-suite and the president are pretentious and could care less about anyone else. I was one of the few lucky people to have a boss that actually cared but most of the time their hands were tied behind their back. All of this was tolerable (and better than being unemployed) until August 2021 when they announced that we were merging with Community Choice Financial. The first few weeks of the merger were OK but we quickly realized that the merger was actually a hostile takeover and that we were the ones who lost. My boss was told to layoff half of our 7 person team to ""cut costs"" at the beginning of Q4 while the CEO of CIC and the CEO of CCF fly all around the nation in their private jets. Everything got incredibly worse and the culture shifted from ""tolerating your weird cousins at grandma's thanksgiving dinner"" to ""me versus you, every man for himself"". My boss and another (nice) c-suite member gave their 2 weeks notices and both were told to vacate the premises the next day. The company is a cross between a giant dumpster fire and the Titanic sinking while the string quartet continues to play Mozart. Anyone considering working here should run far, far away."

Conversation and genuinely helping customers with their problems is rewarding.

Compensation can be good via monthly bonus if you run your store proper and keep charges off down.

Always off Sunday and Saturday is a short day.","The company was recently bought out. Their is speculation that Check Into Cash may conform to the new companies hours and pay. If that happens and manager bonuses go away, it will not be a good paying job as salary is low and we depend on our bonus. It will also take away the incentive to grow your store and keep charge offs down which will have a huge impact. 
If they change to the other companies hours people won't be getting home until 830pm instead of 630pm.
As things currently stand, I worked for a DM that was a strong believer in delegation. It means I did my fair share of his workload. While I found myself resenting this at times, the silver lining is that it made me able to handle anything thrown at me at work. Still crappy of him, but you reap what you sow and I won't hold a grudge as there were good times as well."

Holidays and Sundays off. Paycheck every 2 weeks.  Potential to learn new skills. Reimbursement for mileage.","Some customers can be very rude, had an office manager threatened by a customer. Office politics here are complicated, to say the least. If you say the wrong thing to the wrong person, you'll be singled out and everything you do wrong is reported to management. Expect any confidential information shared with coworkers to become public knowledge, including personal/medical issues. Some coworkers are very intolerant and use racist slurs. Marketing is an obsession for this company, so be prepared to market in all sorts of weather, and regardless of how many hours you work. If you handle a busy center alone, you're looking at about a 50-60 hour week. Promotion from within is practically non-existent, unless you're favored by your DM. Expect also to get passed over for promotions, management will often change their mind, or hire someone from outside when the assistant manager is perfectly qualified to run a location. Very high turnover due to extremely stressful conditions. Had 2 managers quit in the span of less than 6 months. One of them quit a day before the busiest day of the month, the other quit while in the middle of processing a loan. Was told I had to reschedule a specialist appointment due to a manager meeting, so basically it was as if my health was secondary to their meeting. Management is usually pretty naive of the ""boots on the ground"" at store locations, and can micro-manage, which is incredibly frustrating. If you are unlucky enough to work alone at a busy center, be prepared to not only practically be too exhausted to get all your work done, but also to pull extremely long days. Good luck if you work alone at a store getting outside help from within your district. I had to threaten to quit to get help on the busiest day of the month, but to their credit I did get help that day, even though having to threaten to walk out and quit to get assistance for a busy store is beyond ludicrous. Work/life balance due to potentially long hours can be an issue. I got called on days off because the covering employee couldn't find a file, it's supposed to be a day off for a reason. Be prepared to hear gossip all over the place regarding coworkers in your district, whether you want to hear it or not. Mistakes can be criticized in an extremely hostile way at times, so do your best not to make mistakes. You may frequently have to double-check other employee's work, such as omitting signatures and/or other important documents, whether deliberate or otherwise. Little to no job security."

Training is ridiculous. incomplete programs and MANY holes in what they are telling people to do. and they won't give you an answer or fix their mistakes.
Really, everyone at corporate think themselves gods over the field employees.
With high turnover, end up working alone a LOT.
The amount of work they want done is so overwhelming, you can't possibly do it all. If you don't, you get in trouble for not doing the impossible.
PAY! Biggest problem. Even the corporate knows their pay is crap, and they are okay with it. Their motto is ""looking for the best person for the job, that will accept the pay"" because they know how bad they pay.
Stores mostly all have 2 employees max. the company won't invest in having enough people to help the company grow. Because of the workload people are leaving faster than they come in. And that leaves many stores with one person, or none. Then stores that only have 2 have to split their people to cover that store. In the end, everyone gets burned out and leaves.
If you like doing endless work and being told you are doing a bad job for not doing 3 people's workload by yourself, while being paid terrible, then this is the place for you.
Oh, and the owner likes to send a xmas card to every person in the company every year showing off his wealth that everyone earned him by being paid so bad. Just to let everyone know that they are dirt compared to them. They could send a blank white card that says Merry Christmas and get better response from their employees. Showing off your money while we are paid so little does not motivate people, it does the opposite."

They tell you you can receive extensive bonuses that they never actually give you and provide unrealistic expectations to achieve. They hammer in on these bonuses as if that's a decent chunk of your paycheck and that's why you're paid so little, to no real avail.

There is a very high turnover rate. Managers have quit and it's completely screwed me over, having been an adaptable and flexible employee that was relied on to cover several stores. When I put my foot down, they didn't really like that.

Hell with this company. Don't work here."

New reports we have to track every week then they disappear only to find out 3 weeks later after they are no longer needed. Get put on a new mentor program to help turn my store around. Promised 3 months only to get 2 before they decide to close the doors giving customers absolutely zero notice and leave the manager there with no knowledge of what to tell them. And then can't promise you a job afterward after all the hard work and time y7ou put in only for upper management to make a decision based of a report.

Paid holidays are a plus and the hours are decent.,"This company has been trying to improved it's overall job rating for sometime.  However, it's goes about it the wrong way.  Managers offers incentives  for positive reviews and have made doing a review on the company a requirement.  The manager also suggested the wording that should be used.  If you don't do a review they want to talk to you on why you didn't do it.  So this means that most of the positive reviews you see here could be coerced.   When I interviewed with the company, the recruiter painted a positive picture of the the culture here.  However I quickly found out  that is not the case.  The turnover is terrible.  The  management, in particular the regional manager,  is verbally abusive and you work in constant fear of your job.  I have seen people walk off their jobs or not even show up for work.  When that happens you have to come in on your day off and work open to close.  I was rushed through my training because the stores didn't have enough people to work them and keep them open.    I've been cussed at, yelled at, and asked to do things that I was never trained to do.   This is not a pleasant working environment and feel I was misled when I interviewed.  I regret coming to work here.   My suggestion to anyone considering working for this company is to do their homework."

There are constant policy changes implemented that can be very hostile to the customer service side of the business.  Collections can be challenging and frustrating to the uninitiated.  Once you hit manager status there's virtually no chance for a raise unless you can grow the business, but due to Center costs for operation, which you will have no control over, this is almost impossible to do.  Raises are based off of store performance rather than the employee's."

No real security in place to prevent robberies. Your senior customers are great, but some others are the most rude pieces of garbage.

I cannot emphasis how much being organized and diligent will make this job easier.  You do the same job every day.  As a store manager, you are in control of how much money you bonus.  The more transactions you do the more money the store generates the more you bring home as bonus.  Also, if you have a boss who is involved and supportive, it'll make your job much easier.  Bonuses are awarded once a month and as of right now it is based on whether or not you have reached your goals and how many transactions your store makes.  I reach my goals easily every month and bring home an average of $1.5k before taxes a month in bonus.","As store manager you are responsible for every thing that happens in the store.  This includes new employee hire and training, compliance, ordering supplies, cleaning/maintenance, marketing, etc.  If an employee makes a mistake, you must take responsibility for his or her negligence/lack of training.  Collection calls aren't bad, they are boring and mundane with the occasional crazy customer who will try to fight you over the phone (we no longer make visits to delinquent customer's home or work so that's a good thing).  The company sets monthly goals for you to meet in order to bonus off your transactions and some stores have difficulty meeting these goals.  I've been with the company for several years and I've seen several mangers come and go so I can honestly say that whether or not you meet your goals depends on your work ethic and how you run your store.  There isn't much room to grow unless there is an opening for Area/District/Regional Manager.  Wage increases are minimal.  The company will offer incentives, contests, and/or competitions to make work fun, but we all know it's a gimmick to get you to work harder and make the owner more money.

I have to say, I love my job!  Working here has taught me so much about the marketing world. Everyday is a new challenge.  I'm never bored, and I work with some great people. Plus, the company is growing right now so there's plenty of room for advancement.","The only major con I would list right now is, if you don't like a fast-paced constantly changing environment, then it's not the place for you. You have to be flexible to change to enjoy working with such a rapidly growing company."
428,Check Into Cash,"Not worth your time, find another job!",2014-03-12,1.0,Store Manager,My original store manager and district manager were wonderful to work for. Can build some positive relationships with customers and help them out at times.,"I started as a customer service rep and was promoted to assistant manager and then managed my own store. They did not hire me or attempt to hire me and employee to work my store for 3 months before I finally left. I worked that store 6 days a week 10 hours a day and made 23k/year! I was also commuting 30+ minutes every day. They are con artists. They will trick you into signing and authorization form to take money from your bank account with out you knowing(or they will lose their job due to store #s). Upper level management expects you to do ANYTHING to get ""their"" money... including sending young female employees to past due customers homes. They do not have any regard for their employee safety. Your success is based on your customers willingness and ability to pay their bill with you. Upper management is a joke, 99% of them have never worked in a actual center in their life and have no idea how hard it really is. The pay is not even close to fair for the amount of work they expect from you, not to mention is WAY BELOW any of their competitors employee wages where much less is expected. They tell you about these ""bonuses"" I worked their 2 years and saw 14$ of a bonus."

Terrible - but manageable.,2014-03-06,2.0,Marketing Department,"Co-workers attempt to build a sense of community, work flexibility, inter-department cooperation, salary negotiation was good in my experience","Benefits are meager and high deductible, awful CEO, mis-management at upper level, ""good old boys"" atmosphere, blatant sexism and racism, any of Allan Jones' friends or children, unreasonable work load (expects you to work for all his companies without increase in pay)"
430,Check Into Cash,At least this company treats their employees slightly better than their customers.,2014-02-06,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Lots of interaction with customers, opportunities to help people, some opportunity for advancement","Being trained in how to get the most money out of people who are already hurting, being talked to like you're 5 years old by everyone in management, having to work 50 hours a week alone because your manager won't hire anyone else, watching them close your store two weeks early to avoid having to provide your severance pay, and having your job performance based on how many customers actually pay their bills as if associates have any control over that."
431,Check Into Cash,Check Into Cash helped me gain much experience in the public loan sector. I learned much about collections.,2014-01-28,3.0,Customer Service Representative,Interaction with some of the customers and co workers was great at times.,Required to do more on the job than other companies with far less compensation

My pay was negotiated at 28000 annual with bonus potential.  The company never paid me correctly for 3 months.  I addressed thed issue with my DM who was ""looking into the matter"".  Then he was fired.  I addressed the issue with my new DM she began researching the matter, and in conversations with the regional manager, the regional manager decided that rather than take the high road and make certain I was paid at the rate negotiated she would force me out by making me resign my position. Of course I didn't resign and I never signed anything that stated I was resigning. I worked an average of 50-55 hours a week as a senior center manager with unpaid bonus and no overtime at a rate that was not what I was hired at.  The regional said if I wanted to resign effective immediately she would accept my resignation or she would allow me to put in my 2 week resignation, to which I responded I would consult with my attorney before responding. I told her that I would continue in my current position until I found a new position and then I would submit my two week resignation and she told me that she would accept my resignation effective immediately. I told her I was not resigning and would consider this an immediate termination, as she advised she would expect me to pack my things and turn over my keys immediately. Needless to say I will be consulting with my attorney."

They will let you run the store and figure out all the pros and cons that you run into on a daily basis.","I have only been with the company for a few months.

Only 2 to 3 people in the office at a time.  Able to sit down.",If customers do not pay money you have to hunt them down.  Sometimes you even have to go to their house and knock on the door to get in contact with them.   It does not matter if the customer lives in a bad neighborhood.

The collections are hard especially when your manager is never there to help you and when she is there she still does not help you. The security system is a joke. They have one camera and this old monitor to go with it. I really did not feel safe working here.

447,Check Into Cash,Really bad place to work,2012-06-19,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Nice schedule (9:00-6:00). Work experience will look great on your resume.,"You really work under a lot of pressure. You get tons of harassing e-mails (if u don't get the job done you'll get fired) daily from the DM on how to market all their financial products and harass people to come and pay their past due loans. Collections effort are just ridiculous.  You use ur car to withdraw money every morning and every time u need more money cuz they only allow u to withdraw a limited amount of money every morning. You have to go to the DMV everytime you get a new Title Loan, you r the one responsible to buy office supplies (for some reason the DM didn't approve to order that online at the store I used 2 work, maybe is different in another centers) so the money you get paid for milleage ($12.50 on every paycheck) DON'T compensate for all the money you actually spend on gas.  Managers are unprofessional. They won't pay for overtime hours unless the DM approve those hours, they expect you to work overtime for free. They also expect for CSR employees to work during their luch hour without getting paid. Their security system is the worst. You can really lose your life working on any center thanks to their security system."

-Bonus plan
-Building relationships with customers
-Easy job (mostly repetitive)","-Pay is not that good for basically risking your life everyday working (no glass at counters)
-Micromanaged on everything
-No room for advancement once you get to Manager position
-Seems like they change what they want you to focus on every month
-You are dealing with people who are crackheads, bums, most people are scum. Very few actually hard working people who just need some money until their next paycheck come in.
-Very political the higher you get up in the company. If people don't like you, you won't advance.
- Unattainable goals. 
-Went 3 years without getting a raise"

455,Check Into Cash,Changes for the worst,2011-02-27,2.0,,With all the changes there will be advancement opportunites,"Don't fall for the bonus program. When new managers are hired in they are promised they can make up their low pay with the bonus. Under the old system they could, but now it's being changed. The structure is being changed to have a ridiculous system of transactions combined with gross margin & it's all so that the stores where the headquarters are in KY & TN won't lose all their bonus. So those of us in profitable centers (mine nets 10-20K a month) are getting a pay cut. How do you tell someone who makes the company $ thanks, but we're cutting your pay? Oh, and to make it even better we now are rewarding the mediocre managers who have been driving away business with the ability to bonus. The managers who were making the company $ get a pay cut and those that weren't get a pay raise. Makes sense doesn't it?"
456,Check Into Cash,Stay away,2010-09-30,1.0,,"It's a job, which is hard to find in today's economy. Some of the customers are pretty cool. Free pens.","Low pay. They expect you to be okay with the fact that they are too cheap to even put a freaking gate up at most centers to keep someone from coming behind the counter, blowing your brains out, and stealing the cash on hand. Incompetent managers. They pay attention to nothing but the ""latest big trend."" If corporate wants checks cashed, then screw everything else, you had better get 50 new check cashing customers all of a sudden...Okay, finally, 50 new customers...Oh, they don't care about check cashing anymore??? No, now it is Western Unions that they want. 
You never get a pat on the back for a good job, only a threat for what will happen if you don't do a good job. The person was spot on that said that they try to ""scare"" you into doing a good job. That is the story of this business. STAY AWAY, DO NOT TAKE A JOB HERE NO MATTER HOW DESPERATE YOU ARE, IT IS NOT WORTH IT. It may seem okay for the first month or two...maybe three, and then it will hit the fan."
