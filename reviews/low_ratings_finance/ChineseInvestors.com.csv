9,ChineseInvestors.com,I learned a lot from this company,2018-09-17,5.0,Sales Representative,"I have been working at ChineseInvestors.com for 7 Months at Flushing office. As a sales person, I have to say that I really learned a lot, both from co-workers and from clients. I really appreciate this job offer.
    We have brilliant fundamental and technical analysts for our VIP clients, and we have high-efficiency management team and sales team which really helped our clients a lot.  I meet clients every day, so I know these Chinese investors a lot. They really need our help, because we always give them services that best fit their needs and budgets. They can really avoid lots of traps of the stock market with our help.
 And our CEO, Warren Wang is a reputable character among Chinese investors. Lots of investors love Mr. Wang with the reason of he helped them making profits from the market. And he is a talented and approachable gentleman who you can always learn something from. Most important of all, he has been endeavored to make this company stronger. 
My manager Cathy is a strong lady. She is tough because she cares, she cares about the clients, the media, and company, other employees, and herself. I worked with and learned from her day to day.
     I think ChineseInvstors.com is the company which may has huge potential cause I saw how enthusiastic our clients were and how hard our team worked.","This job involves very high volume workload, I have to work on demand and work on weekends often."
