0,City National Bank (Texas),Not a job I would like to stay at....,2017-04-19,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Not a challenging job, good hours, great job security and I learned a lot of ""behind the scenes"" of the banking industry. They are knowledgeable and professional.","Regardless, if you have a degree, the pay is HORRIBLE! They  will pay you as less as they can get away with.

No room for advancement, unless you know someone higher in the bank. It's all about who you know. -- and it is a very ""clickish"" bank. 

Not an enjoyable environment to work in. 

JUDGMENTAL employees, plus promises of raises which are never received."
1,City National Bank (Texas),DEMEANING ENVIRONMENT,2015-09-20,1.0,Mid Level Branch Employee,"Well, you are employed & not on a breadline...takes long time in this economy to find another job in these small rural communities.","No Human Resource Mgr. If you have an issue or problem or seek confidentiality on an issue or problem, you have NO ONE.  LOTS of hidden rules regarding pay & already low benefits they provide. Managers follow their own rules, change working situations, rules without any management or labor law training. Mgrs rule by intimidation, have ""pet"" and rest of branch left to suffer. Do & say what they please to employees. Several branches have very large turnover without corp office caring or noticing (customers do, that is why they are not growing as they could). Salaries lowest compared to similar jobs at other local banks. Raises throughout branches (as yes, we all talked to one another) at 2% to tops 50cent hr annually (their annual is about year & half between raises) no matter what additional duties are taken on by an employee. I am not disgruntled with co-workers, many are hard working, customer caring, team builders - shot down/mistreated by mgt. & ignored/forgotten by upper mgt. at corp. office."

3,City National Bank (Texas),"Could be better, could be worse.",2014-04-25,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The work life balance is good overall, but that's because I'm in a satellite office with some good local managers.","They don't like to invest in their infrastructure, specifically technology, unless you are in a high margin area of the company. The rest of us are left to suffer through attrition. They really use resource dollars poorly, yet always try to cut costs from areas where there isn't a large amount of waste instead, which is due to lack of any kind of definitive COO."

5,City National Bank (Texas),Professional environment with experienced colleagues. Low turnover in most departments. Good benefits with profit sharin,2014-03-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Professional environment with experienced colleagues. Low turnover in most departments. Good benefits with profit sharing in 401k. Good work life balance. Focus on client service.,"Not a lot of space for career advancement. If you get hired into a department, then limited ability to move unless you have an advocate in another department. Discuss developing colleagues, but focus is to hire outside to fill positions."
6,City National Bank (Texas),Needed to go out of business,2014-03-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,I got paid on time.,The business was very disorganized.
7,City National Bank (Texas),"Political Backstabbers, Doesn't pay Bonuses as Promised",2014-02-07,1.0,,"If you are running for politics one day, you'll get excellent practice here.","Management is extremely political and fearful. Some steal deals from their subordinates and put their name on it. The bank will find every excuse to not pay you your hard earned bonuses if you bring in new business. Upper management (like an EVP) will steal a deal away from an officer if her ""favorite officer"" happened to ""call"" that business 10 years ago and feels entitled to that business. Basically, your worst enemies are within the CNB walls. Territories are blurred and job security is null. It's impossible to do a good deal here since CNB is ultra conservative with its lending practices. The fees are high, the lending impossible. I always felt guilty luring innocent businesses to this bank when in actuality, there are better banks out there than CNB."
8,City National Bank (Texas),ok,2013-06-20,3.0,Teller,"Small Town 
Small Company, cares about employees
Decent pay","Hard to get full time status
Judgmental employees
All about who you are, regardless of how well/hard you work
Stop requiring certain part time employees to work six days a week, requiring them to work every Saturday is ridiculous"
