6,City National Bank of New Jersey,"Very unprofessional, no advancements",2019-05-21,1.0,Loans,Very very few employees were bareable to work with.. the few were nice and sincere which is about 1%. It was easy to commute to since it was in the downtown area. Free Kurig Coffee and Water.,"Almost everyone has an attitude and is rude. Except the groups of women who are like a squad of bratty teenage girls that are only nice and polite to each other.  Almost everyone in Upper Management makes tons of money but do not do anything. When asked to the something, they are lost and have no clue how to complete thier workload which ends up dumped on thier employees . I had to escape the circus and madhouse that was unfolding. I have spent many years working hard and pushing my limits to complete my ever growing workload and advance at this job but my efforts were always in vain as all the raises were freely handed to the more younger and more attractive females in the office. Also Upper Management somehow always gets bonuses and raises for no reason while many employees who have kids and families to tend to make absolutely barebones minimum wirh no raises or bonuses to compensate for the massive workloads given . Many employees here did work hard and almost 60% of the people that were here when I started left once they realized the never ending workload that hits because the Top Level employees just shove it upon thier team, meanwhile they continue to look good due to others hard work. It was really hurtful to spend 8+ years working tirelessly only to see a a person who has been there 1 year or less get 2 promotions and title changes with no justification."

19,City National Bank of New Jersey,Uncertain Future,2015-10-20,2.0,Personal Banker,The team you will work directly with on a daily basis will become like family because you all are going through similar struggles with the company. You will suffer but together with your daily team.,"Too many to count or mention. First, I believe employee's are overpaid, especially managers. For the skills they have and the way they work they do not deserve the amount they make. With that being said, managers upstairs carry themselves with a sense of entitlement that blinds them from the real problem. The problem is they are a bank that is relies on the monthly Social Security checks of retired and underprivileged individuals. They should realize that these benefits are dwindling and these receivers of the current benefits will pass soon. So what should be the focus for new customers...how about the youth? entrepreneurs? young businesses? They may be risky but that is where they need to focus, revamp the entire culture of the business and move forward! While I was there, there was no sense of movement forward and progression. All managers worried about was the mistakes made by lower staff and made it a point to criticize them in a demeaning way. You will feel welcomed when you begin but soon after you will realize that it's a very cut-throat business. I believe there is hope but something drastic needs to occur."
