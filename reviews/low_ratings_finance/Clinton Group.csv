3,Clinton Group,Innovative and Evolving,2019-05-22,3.0,Senior Director,Willingness to consider new initiatives and approaches.,Some lack of bureaucratic and institutional infrastructure might be an issue for more traditionally focused candidates.
4,Clinton Group,Mismanaged environment and unlikely to survive,2018-07-13,1.0,Analyst,Some decent colleagues but most of them have left,"1. This place is managed in an appropriate way. Though the company has many other investment vehicles in the past, the only meaningful place now is a equity statistical arbitrage group, led by a PM who has been there for long but not really clear with any research direction. The CEO focused on capital allocation and always make a shift toward certain strategy when he had a prompt idea, which is quite unprofessional way to manage fund. There are only a certain portion of people in the group who were doing real work but some others are keen to manage others work even though they had no idea. Insiders were aware of the situation but the upper management was totally ignorant of what employee may think. They kept pushing the hard workers to deliver and other 'golden girl' to please clients in an inappropriate way.  
2. The company has little integrity. They keep hiring people to 'steal' their strategies from outside. After they stay for a while and deliver the work, they would let those people go without paying any bonus. The company has becoming notorious in the industry and the experience in this company has become a negative asset in the resume.
3. Be aware of the positive comment. They are made up by the marketing people in the company. If you want to join the company or think about invest in this company, ask the insiders or those who left."

9,Clinton Group,Not stable at all,2017-08-07,1.0,Quant Researcher,They would make many promises they can't keep when they want to hire you,"- No respect to your research ideas/results. The time they get the details, the time your value is gone as a researcher. They will let you go at any time and won't let you know until the last minute. 
- No bonus when they are losing money (and they are now). Cross your finger to get something when they are making money, but when they are not, they only keep the people they know for years."
