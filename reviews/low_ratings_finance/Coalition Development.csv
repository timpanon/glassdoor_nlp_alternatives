0,Coalition Development,NA,2022-03-14,2.0,Senior Associate,"Good Salary, nothing else to talk about","Worthless work, fake analytics, not good for long term career"
1,Coalition Development,Good Place,2022-02-08,5.0,Associate,"1. People centric, 2. Benifits
3. Good Bonus, 4. brand image
5. Learning - markets and products","If long years experience in same process then no good hike, need to manage trainings and work life balance"
2,Coalition Development,Standard Company,2022-01-29,2.0,Research Associate,"Flexible Hours, though you have general Shift timings
Sometimes the environment is good
2nd half of December is usually free as deliveries get completed.
Applying for leaves and getting approve is easy(depend on manager though)
In non covid times, proper regulated drop services are provided to female after 9pm and to male after 11pm","Team Politics is too much.
Deserving will not get promotion, but rather promotions are given based on years of experience.
Internal job transfers are difficult if you want to migrate from Coalition to other Crisil Research department.
Your job be it in any department at Coalition it will become monotonous in one year.
Switching to other companies becomes difficult if you are not updated with new skills.
Even though you have flexi time, if you try to follow 10am to 7pm, leaving at 7pm can be considered a taboo most of days.
Salary for same job is different enormously from person to person.
Eg. If you are a fresher then depending upon your college you get 4 to 8 Lakh. If you are a experienced person joining from a unrelated previous role your salary will be still higher. Even though you don't have a clue of what the job will be."
3,Coalition Development,Great place to start career,2021-11-17,4.0,Associate,"1) Strongly recomend for Freshers who want to start their career in Investment Banking.

2) lot of opportunities if you are willing to put the effort

3) Work is always interesting and never Monotonous

4) You can pick up good project management skills

5) Compensation is at par with the industry

6) You get to interact with lot of Foreign counterparts depending on which team you are in.",1) Wouldn't suggest for some one looking for core research role
4,Coalition Development,Forget about life as a being,2021-11-15,1.0,Associate Vice President,No pros worth mentioning here,"You will forget that there is a life beyond this company. You will work till 3am on a casual basis and as an exception you will work till 1am. There is no advantage with crisil brand because the work you do is completely different from what crisil does and therefore it does not count in the industry and you will feel depressed of having to work here for lifetime without any end in sight. You will lose the time without spending with your near and dear ones even on weekends. The reason being, you work so late even on a Friday night that you wake up late on a Saturday. On weekdays, it would end up where you come home and sleep late at night between 1 to 4am and by the time you wake up, others in your home would have left for work and therefore, it is rare that you speak with them in person. And please do not think that it is a night shift, it is literally day cum night shift where you start your work at 10 to 11am and work for the next 15 to 16 hrs without any respite in between because if you take a break, you have to work and compensate for that extra time which means your leaving time from office would be further delayed. The staff have been working since long that they are used to working for these crazy hours that they don't even have the energy to stop and think about what's going with the sort of life. Need not comment about the detoriation or toll it takes on your health. The senior management which sits in London does not even attempt to change the work style inspite of knowing the ordeals in India because the staff is hesitant to assert something rather than on a formal basis. There is HR only for the sake of it. Don't start to think that pay package might be commensurate, you will be fooling yourself as the company cannot even pay industry average packages in Mumbai. And the crazy thing is there are only 4 holidays in a year and the rest of the 6, they have added in the leave balances. Which means you will have to be at the mercy of others' leave plan even for important holidays such as Diwali, Gudi padwa or Ramjan. In simple words, it is a quagmire and you join the organization at your peril for the sacrifice of your life"

2). CRISIL - Coalition. Brand value got a major boost (easier to get better jobs)","1). Management
2). 'Advanced' analytical financial research ( scam)
Estimates are based on any crap logic, at least in some departments. Lot of validation is required, which goes horribly wrong. 
3). Casual work environment. No one really cares.
4). Biased towards tenured employees.
5). Great boot licking culture, again in almost all departments."

27,Coalition Development,Pathetic experience,2017-07-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"You get knowledge on investment banking products.
Senior employees get opportunity to visit offsites, London office.
There were international offsites where company used to pay half expenses (which now they have scrapped.) 
There are quarterly team dinners.","During delivery time (which may last as long as two months), employees' normal working hours are 15-17 hours, which may again extend. I remember the day when I sat around continuously 26 hours.
No matter how hard you work, the appreciation and reward goes to few 'selected' employees. 
If you leave your office just after your scheduled nine hours, your supervisor and colleagues will look at you as if you have done something wrong.
Once you have logged off your system and went outside, you may have to come back again if your supervisor or senior employees call you back.
Weekend working is quite normal during delivery. (and yes even on weekend you may have to work 10-12 hours).
During deliverable, leaves will be granted if you are 'privileged' employee (study leave, vacations) and if you are not, your leave may get cancelled two weeks before.
HR-Ops executive- The operational work they do are excellent, however no actions are being taken on complaints regarding supervisors.
Any given day you may get warning letter and asked to leave the organization no matter if you have been in the company for more than 5 years.
There's very less growth after AVP.
No work life balance."
28,Coalition Development,Coalition,2017-06-16,5.0,Senior Research Analyst,"Very good learning experience, especially the investment banking world
Very friendly environment
Management is very much approachable
Earlier used to have good international off-sites 
Fun fun Fridays
Best performers get solid bonuses and chances to work in onsite offices during deliveries
Quarterly team dinners
People are easily getting absorbed in investment banks setting offices in India and rating agencies
Good facilities for recreation
Super fast promotions till AVP level","Few people are given long leaves during deliveries and rest are made to work on their behalf
People can be absent uninformed and no steps taken
For male employees who sit long hours it is difficult to get home drops
office full of rodents 
Promotions halt post AVP level for ages
Too rigid policies coming from parent company and the response time on things is getting slower and slower
Not much option for food outside the canteen specified timings also nothing pocket friendly in the building's vicinity
HR team practically empty
Retainers and people on notice period people can just play TT,  watch TV, go for long cigarette breaks, spend time chit chatting and relax. Poor impact on people who are working seriously."
29,Coalition Development,Coalition - A School cum Office,2017-05-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been working here for over 2 years now and the only pros in this company I found is the BONUS component. Some people get as much as 60%-80% bonus which is pretty high in any company however if you think of joining this company only for bonus then let me tell you, bonus and promotion depends if you fall in your manager's and VP's ""favorite"" category.  Yes, partiality exists in this company at a larger extent here.","As my review title suggests, this company works almost like a school with employees being tortured with late marks even after working for over 10 hours previous day. Employees' time is tracked to ensure they don't spend time playing Table Tennis or chit chat in canteen with colleagues. No flexible hours, Biased managers and TL's, Repetitive onsite opportunities for specific employees only, longgg working hours, no food after 10pm."
30,Coalition Development,Unemployment is better than working in this company,2017-03-31,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are no positive points for Coalition Development. That's the true fact. Its my bad luck that i am working here.,"1. Working timing is the worst. Employees work for a minimum of 15 to maximum of 30 hours during delivery period. Every employee is made to sit late night. 

2. Favouritism towards specific people who do not have knowledge of the process. These people are given better bonus and promotion because of their bootlicking behaviour. And the employees who are really working hard are given nothing. 

3. The management do not respect their employees. They are removing employees who have been working for them for past 10 years. That's their employee removing policy.

4. Senior employees are kind of having affairs with their juniors which again leads to partiality and favouritism.

5. Coalition is a subsidiary of CRISIL Ltd, but only in paper. Coalition is true sense is degrading the brand of CRISIL. 

6. Coalition is a company that provides research to their clients. But in reality they are just providing fake research to their clients.

7. Few employees are working late everyday just to show that they aee working hard even though the work is very less and can be completed in normal working hours. But neither the managers looks into it nor does the HR Dept."
