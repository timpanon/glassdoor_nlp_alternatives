3,Colonial First State Custom Solutions,Steer Clear,2022-03-05,1.0,Financial Services Administrator,The only thing I liked about working here is the fellow FSA’s. It made coming to work really nice and we bonded over the mutual dread of coming to work here,"The salary to start. Constant promise of bonuses and career progressions that never come. There are people still working there after 10+ years and are not any further in the company, despite being knowledgeable and with a fantastic work ethic. Unrealistic KPI’s and measurements from above. Zero flexible working. You clock on at your start time, clock in and out of breaks, and clock off. If you don’t adhere to that strict schedule your KPI’s will be impacted. Also had a manager say that if we made a mistake he was going to jump from the balcony."

7,Colonial First State Custom Solutions,Avoid this company it's toxic,2022-01-28,1.0,Contact Center Representative,Great colleagues from all walks from life.,"- Completely overworked staff 
- High amounts of politics
- Management is not supportive and prevents any further growth in the company unless you are in his circle.
- Terrible processes stuck in the past
- Team leaders are not experienced and capable of taking on their roles.
- This company needs to be reshaped and management needs to be replaced.
- No work life balance or compassion to employees 
- Staff Turnover is extremely high"
8,Colonial First State Custom Solutions,A company stuck in 1990,2022-01-25,1.0,Senior Product Manager,"- Work life balance
- Flexibility","A company suffering from active inertia. Where the new leadership are trying to bring back the glory days of 1990. And their method of choice is to change the company structure back to all the old ways of working that do not work in 2022. And double down on all the past failed strategies that have failed before.

If your competitors in the advised, high net worth space are innovating. And your competitors in the direct market have the scale to kill you on cost at every turn. Maybe rethink the moronic strategy that you can race them to the bottom on cost and fees. Because HostPlus and AusSuper will beat you direct to consumer with a cheaper, better offer. And you won't have focused any energy or time on the innovation required to beat your competitors in the advised market. HUB, NetWealth and Macquarie will innovate you to death and corner advice relationships.

Especially when the entire customer experience is a paper quagmire. Imagine. Asking customers to do everything on paper in 2022. With the strategies to fix it ignored and not invested in. The amount of consultants that have come through and said the same thing to the business and management is insane - fix experience, fix paper servicing, improve data quality, invest in digital.

Instead you have old Grandpa 1990 and his merry band of waterfall IT practitioners running the show. All thinking if you pre-pop some paper you're cutting edge.

This company is going nowhere and until the management is fired and replaced it will continue going absolutely nowhere."

15,Colonial First State Custom Solutions,Micromanaging,2021-10-20,1.0,Financial Administrator,"Initially it was good when associated with CBA, the first TL, she was really good knew what she was doing.","The management changed so did Team leaders and managers and the current TL doesn't know anything related to the department processing or work, no assistance given to team members except for dictating around and micromanaging with no flexibility or freedom. They should understand this is not a school or a militant camp and employees should be treated as an adult cause they have to have work life balance. Some people like to work at their own pace although KPIs are important it shouldn't merely depend on the tight work schedule of time what is important is work to be finished within deadline. 
Too much demotivation due to this and this will effect work efficiency. 
When the company itself is underperforming and has lack of discipline on a management level they complain of performance issues to the entry level employees with huge volumes and loads of work for less pay. 
I would say a big no to this Company."

 if they own this company, work environment is pathetic, complex system , tight deadline, less resources and without giving proper training they would put you in complex project and expect you to perform same way as experience people are doing. 

They will review your work closely and try to find out minimal issues say even if you refereed or copied few steps from existing test cases they will make  hue n cry. I found most worker scared of management.
