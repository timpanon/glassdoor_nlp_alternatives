9,Columbia Investment Partners,STAY AWAY,2017-11-06,1.0,Private Equity Investment Analyst,Rest of the staff are young and relatable. You get to meet people on the job.,"High turnover because company gives false information to candidates during interviews. Company advertises that you will be an investment analyst but you would have to start doing irrelevant work, you are better off working elsewhere if you want to do banking. 
DO NOT THINK YOU WILL BE DOING INVESTMENT WORK. 

They will give you the idea of going to New York during your time here, don't be fooled because they will give you a very miserable package. 

Boss overbearing and arrogant. Poor employee benefits, poor work life balance and no HR 

Everything is a scam, so are the good reviews on this page."
