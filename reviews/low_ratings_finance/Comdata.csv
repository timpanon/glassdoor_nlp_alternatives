Office is loud"
2,Comdata,Don't Work Here,2022-02-18,1.0,Sales,Good co worker environment just because working there was awful.,Where to start: Management has no clue what they are doing/underqualified. You are seen as a number rather than a person to them. Their training strategy is to sit and shadow nothing further. And overall Management just wants you as a quick buck and don't care about turnover rate.
3,Comdata,Really enjoy my job,2022-01-31,5.0,Sales Representative,Great teamwork. Supported by management to be successful.,None. They even have supported my work life.

6,Comdata,So far...So great!,2022-01-27,5.0,Outside Sales Representative,"I have been at Comdata (Corpay) for a little over two years, and it has been a pleasure. Not only do I have the best manager, but I am glad to be at a company where I am not micro-managed and I have nice work/life balance. If you are a salesperson with a balanced attack of prospecting, being strategic and showing value, the sky is the limit for commission.","I am not used to working at a company where there is internal competition within your territory, but this scenario has improved since I have been here."
7,Comdata,Have no words really,2022-01-22,1.0,Customer Service Representative,"Very stressful to work there, constant ringing. You will go through personal issues, three strikes and you are out.",When you leave you won’t get your holiday money.

10,Comdata,Don't believe a word they say,2021-10-11,1.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),They take you out for food and beer,"Was there for almost a year before I went to a better company and a better opportunity. They start their lies at the interview process and continue throughout your career there. They're in the process of merging with another company. Past managers have left and it's just gone DOWNHILL since. A lot of people are leaving, really the best ones are, and management is lying that nobody is leaving even though everyone is. Everyone who has a working braincell has realized it's a sinking ship with a sexist pig captaining the ship into the bottom of the ocean. They will promise growth, territories, and anything else you want to hear to keep you but it will all be false promises. They already know who they're going to promote BEFORE they release the job posting, make everyone jump through hoop after hoop for no reason since they're going to promote whoever kisses their butt the most. The rules only apply for a select few. People who can't even do their jobs, but have their directors do their jobs for them get promoted because their lips are firmly attached to the managers butt. The ""managers"", I say that loosely, are either the laziest individuals I've ever met or simply should have never been promoted in the first place. As a past manager myself, I honestly can't fathom how they got their jobs in the first place and are able to keep them. Don't ask a manager a question, because they will just talk to get you off the phone and give you a non-answer or the company catch phrase: I'll look into it. Think you're going to have a territory to call on? Well guess what? So will three other people. Some SDRs have 2 directors, some have 1, and the unlucky few are floaters and call on ""open"" territories. Hint, they're open because everyone is jumping ship. You should too."

-They will force you to be in positions you would never want to be in
- Low pay for job and responsibility, ignore standard raises by saying you're not a real PM despite professional consultations and case studies saying otherwise. They will lie to manipulate you into thinking you are not worth it, which is typical behavior.

You do some debilitating tasks assigned from a cartoon character of a bad boss. You then get a paycheck. Yippee!

Like doing hard work, not taking breaks, not having time to go the bathroom or even get a second cup of coffee? Look no further.

One big pro is it is very diverse. But there is a huge age discrimination.","Let’s be honest. You may have gotten contacted by a recruiter (I was) and are looking into this company. 

You see some good reviews. Those are well and good. But you see the bad reviews. And they are all true. 

80’s sales culture and technology stuck in the 21st century. By 80’s culture I mean every one of my coworkers were probably at this company in the 80’s, do not look here for innovation, conversation, or growth.
By 80’s technology, I mean the software we used was command based green text. Like what you see in Jurassic Park. No, I’m not kidding. They also just got Salesforce about 3 years ago.

Like Game of Thrones? Then you’ll fit right in. Everyone is related. The way you stay on/get promoted is have an aunt or uncle that works there. Plain and simple.

You do not have a say in what you do. There is no brainstorming, creative problem solving, or even effective training. You do what your boss tells you, and you are measured on whether you do that on time. Forget having an opinion."

The nature of the job itself is grueling and miserable."
96,Comdata,Read Before Accepting an Offer,2019-12-03,1.0,Internal Auditor,"Comdata offered me a decent bit of flexibility with my work schedule. I was able to work from home on days when I had personal appointments and I never had a request for time off denied.

Additionally, I developed a strong relationship with my manager (who is ironically serving his final two weeks as of the date of this review) and a few other bright individuals within the otherwise dull organization.","Management is unethical. I am aware of multiple instances where my VP as well as other VPs in the organization have made intentional efforts to hide known issues from external and internal stakeholders.

Management is unprofessional. As an auditor, I was placed in multiple situations where management openly rejected audit results after being provided with specific regulatory guidance and numerous examples of deficiencies. Management yelled at me and my manager without cause, insulted our intelligence, and pressured us to violate professional audit standards and could not comprehend why we refused to violate said standards.

Many VPs and managers are not qualified for the positions that they have and the company fails to recognize the individuals who ultimately drive value.

The vast majority of employees refuse to be held accountable for their professional responsibilities and management often assists with excuses instead of making simple process improvements.

To my knowledge, the Company does not have a mission, vision, or core values. In short, the Company has no direction.

The Company does not care about people. Customer concerns go ignored and in many cases the company deliberately attempts to take advantage of customers through the product fee structure. Additionally, employees are viewed as completely disposable. People are clearly disgruntled and management is either unable to help or does not care.

The pay and benefits are below average for the industry. The maximum retirement match of 1% is a complete joke.

The company recently renovated the office, but the seating arrangements are horrible. Departments do not sit together. My manager and I were forced to sit around a large group of collections people who were constantly on their phones yelling at our customers. It often was very difficult to focus on our complex and confidential tasks. Our requests to move were repeated denied and our VP legitimately lied to us concerning the status of our requests.

I felt undervalued, unappreciated, and unwelcome at Comdata."

105,Comdata,"You might be okay when you are healthy, but....",2019-09-12,2.0,Call Center Agent,They offered a decent pay.,"The reason why I resigned is that I had to fight three months as a physically disabled person to get my mobility scooter (three wheels) into the fully accessible building on the 5th floor. Three months they let me walk in the pitch dark (no lights at main entrance) after every evening shift to find my mobility aid, risking severe injuries by falling (I have CP and am completely blind in one eye and have low vision in my better eye). So a visually impaired woman who can hardly walk without falling. But they forbid me to use my scooter, which is the same as a power wheelchair, as I’m using it on the DLR to arrive at their company. 
No, if you are healthy, by all means take a call center job there but if you use a wheelchair or scooter, stay the hell out of there!
The only reason I did not take them to court for discrimination is because I was completely knackered every work day and I was not a member of any union at the time."

116,Comdata,Sales,2019-06-14,2.0,Sales,There aren’t many. They have a long standing in their space with a good reputation.,The worst culture I’ve ever experienced. I’ve been at some great places and some that were okay. I never met to the two people I worked for the first 6 months I was there. Very little infrastructure and support. Corporate payments is the real focus of the org and the payroll card side is an after thought. They are not industry leading in their technology.
117,Comdata,One star is way too much credit,2019-06-13,1.0,Sales,They pay you a non-recoverable commission for the first 3 months.,"Everything about the company. Seriously. 

You don’t get trained, but are thrown into the ringer and expected to succeed immediately. You cold call the same accounts - you rarely get new leads, and even those are usually not even legitimate. But when you have a lead, you have to check 4 different places to make sure it’s legitimate. The employees all whine and complain and the managers feed into it. They do not lead by example, because they, too, are complaining. Even talking poorly about other employees behind their backs! The managers do not manage. 

They brag about being the biggest and baddest and oldest in the industry and that customers will LOVE to hear from comdata and they’ll be open to talking as soon as you mention that you’re from there, but the clients are all just annoyed. Multiple departments are constantly calling the same accounts and even after they say not interested, comdata just calls again the next week. It’s harassment. Take a job literally anywhere else. This place is not worth the time, unless you need some good money for 3 months and can handle the whining and poor management. 

The company doesn’t care about its employees, just how much money they can bring in.  They don’t care about morale or the ethical way of people handling cases. As long as its in, it’s not their problem and it’s ignored. 


People are clearly unhappy here but management doesn’t care."

high turn over due partially to the difficulty of job (telemarketing) for some people and a lack of training for the rest.

Managers are not around much, so you are able to be on your phone or surf the web as long as you meet your quota on calls. Decent, albeit hard-to-track, pay, as well as PTO (Vacation, sick, personal days). The Brentwood office has its own parking, and has food delivered daily that you can order (not free).","This company has a reputation for being a revolving door to recent college grads and people switching career paths, and with very good reason. Managers are non-existent, always constantly in ""meetings"" that don't seem to actually produce anything. And, even if they are around, they are less knowledgeable than most of their subordinates on the questions you have. You receive little-to-no training right off the bat, and if you want further training on anything, later on, you won't receive any. 

Management keeps shifting roles and positions around to whoever is their favorite person of the month, which reflects how you will get promoted or rewarded throughout the company. Favoritism is rampant, with management rewarding suck-ups who don't meet the job requirements over actual hard workers. Unless you're a young, male recent college graduate, you won't find any success in this environment. 

New positions, functions, and products are constantly being launched without any sort of plan on how they should be run. As a result, all the different departments are disconnected and do no get along with each other, and customers are left in the dust. The company has supposedly been taking strides on improving the customer experience, but all Comdata has done is worsen their customer service to inexperienced and rude call center employees and sales reps who have no idea how the products actually works.

The pay is horribly structured and makes it almost impossible to track how much you'll actually make.

My direct manager is really great and does try to help us, but her hands are limited by the management above her.","Before Comdata was purchased by FleetCor, employees were recognized for their hard work. Employees and managers could give a ""kudos"" to someone to thank them for going above and beyond, but that program has completely gone away. 

Even though FleetCor is a large company, our health insurance benefits have gotten more expensive and have fewer features; they don't even cover annual physicals because their policy was ""grandfathered"" in before the Affordable Care Act and the company has decided against adding that feature. 

Remodel of the building has taken away the cafeteria, which had been a pro for convenience and lower cost, and it's been replaced by a tiny cafe with catering brought in from area restaurants; the cafe is too small to handle the number of employees in this building and the prices the restaurants charge are incredibly high. This is unfortunate as the Maryland Farms area is so busy that it's really hard to leave the building and make it back by the end of your hour lunch; this is made more unfortunate by the fact that they now don't allow employees to eat at their desks. They moved everyone into an open work area where we're more like cattle than people; noise levels are high and with the type of work we do it just doesn't work. There was zero communication to employees about the remodel; managers didn't even know what area of the building their groups would be in until the week before the move. It felt like they were trying to hide something, which doesn't make sense because a remodel should be the easiest area for transparency between a company and its employees.

FleetCor charges for everything. Can you imagine being charged for having your invoices faxed to you, when that's often a paperless option these days? It's $20 per invoice/report, which adds up really fast. They also charge you for making payments; if you want Comdata to ACH your account, you're going to pay each time they do it and your money isn't available to you until a couple days after. There is no transparency in billing, so unless you have a doctorate in accounting you're not going to understand what you're paying or how your billing works; forget trying to balance payments to charges. Our biggest competitor right across town doesn't do business like that, and I almost wish I could tell customers they'd be better off over there.

Customer service is atrocious! I came from a company that believed in 1 call resolution, so the call center was actually there to take care of the customer's problem. FleetCor believes that the call center needs to answer as many calls as possible, and to make it look like they're successfully doing that the CSRs must transfer calls to get them off their phones within a specified time limit. By the time the customer gets to someone who can actually help them, after being transferred multiple times, they're angry and take that anger out on the person trying to help.

I could go on, but basically this company is no longer employee or customer friendly anymore. FleetCor buying Comdata was the worst thing that could happen to morale, employee benefits, and customer satisfaction. I'm shocked this company is still in business, especially with legitimate competition here in Nashville that is actually growing."

Shortly after that, we were scolded for not making at least 70 calls a day!  My manager has a managerial style of treating the employees as children - if one person made a mistake, we all had to feel bad about it. I understand that as a new team, there is a lot of scrutinization from higher up, but that's not the employees' fault.  We were all trying our best and I really disliked feeling like I had disapproving eyes staring over my shoulder at all times.    This position is unecessary. It's nothing but telemarketing. I felt ashamed to tell that to my family and friends. I spent my day cold calling financial executives, trying to get them to talk to my ""director"" (the outside sales rep) and hopefully fall for a product that's ultimately a scam.

That's about it. 

They want me to write 20 words here so this is how I'm filling the rest of the box. I can't think of 20 words that are positive about this place.","Where to start with this company...

Let's begin with the obvious: the pay is mediocre. Despite what they'll tell you, $14 an hour is not competative. It's actually under the standard for this area now, and you'll be there for years before you make $15 if you don't move up. But, unfortunately, this is a drop in the bucket.

This is hands-down the most disorganized company I've ever seen. Like, they can't even figure out a seating chart so that you'll be near your supervisor, nor can they remember how many seats they have because they are always hiring more people and not buying more space. Oh, speaking of supervisors, there is a very real chance that you'll be trained in something that none of the supervisors have experience in. How do I know? Cause that is the situation I am currently in. What kind of a company does a hiring spree before teaching the basics of the systems to the affected supervisors? One that is in shambles, that's what. It is completely unacceptable to have one single ""supervisor transfer line"" and not a single person who answers that phone will be able to help you. I spoke to 6 supervisors trying to get a question answered, and in the end I had to tell the customer ""I don't know"". 

Let's talk dress code. It is an insane standard to make people who work in a CALL CENTER wear collar shirts and dress shoes. Seriously, what are we dressing up for? Ourselves? We all hate this place and everything in it. No one cares what other people are wearing.

Here's the biggest one: this company is (potentially) scamming their customers. Yeah, there is a lot of shady stuff going on in the background to fee and charge their customers in to sometimes double what their bills are. Seriously, an investigation needs to be done in to their buisness practices. Some bills will show a fee under one name, then the next month that same fee will show up as a different name. We actually have a list of all the fees that could show up on a bill, and some of the fee descriptions that show up on statements aren't even in our lists. It's a total crap-shoot sometimes to figure out what the fee is (and remember what I said about supervisors not being trained? Yeah, good luck getting help to figure it out).

Seriously, if you have a fuel card and the parent company is Fleetcor/Comdata (BP, ARCO, Speedway, Fuelman, Universal Premium, etc) you should cut your cards up. I'm not saying this as a disgruntled employee, I'm saying this as a concerned member of my community.

Do not work here, do not purchase anything related to this company. I hope that one day this company falls apart beyond repair and closes it's doors. We will all be better off."

If I could have stayed based solely off this, I would have never left. Unfortunately, that wasn't possible.","Where to start? HR. Unorganized, unprofessional and a complete joke. Human Resources should be advocates for employees, but instead it feels like they are only there to nitpick and uphold senseless company policies that cause friction amongst team members, tension within departments and frustration overall. Introducing new policies like taking lap tops away from employees who have had them for years, and forcing them to go to desktops. When employees who have had the luxury of working from home no longer have that option, it causes a lot of issues. Policies like policies that weren't policies until you apparently broke that policy and were given a write up for breaking that policy. Exhausting! Sales Leaders with egos that enter a room before they do. How many Vice Presidents does one company need?! Sales people who don't know what they are selling and refuse to admit mistakes, yet expect everyone internally to recreate and reinvent processes to fit their mistakes...the internal people are having fingers pointed at them, ""WHY ISN'T THIS RIGHT?!"" It's like the Twilight Zone, Groundhog Day. Over and over again. No accountability. No direction. Worst excuse of sales ""leadership"" I've ever seen in my career! There are a select FEW, and by ""few"", I mean 4...that are worth anything! The rest? Absolute jokes. If you want to work for a company that pays their internal people less than market and less than what they deserve, to be glorified ""babysitters"", then this job is for you!

-Job merit system is poor! I can only do whats assisgned to me and I personally feel that its not fair  that if i dont work a certain  number of accounts each day  it can effect my performance score at the end of the month when sometimes its really slow and there's not many accounts to work. It's not my job to find me work to do so why should I be penalized if I dont meet the goal at the end of the month."

Strong financials and secure employment if you're a ""doer.""
Line positions gives one plenty of opportunity to learn and grow professionally.","Hierarchical with good 'ol boy network that turns over every 5 - 7 years anyway. 
Spits out great people into WEX, EFS, Fleet One, and other competitors over and over year after year.
Often has trouble recognizing ambitious, hard workers. Execs eventually get canned so it makes it bitter-sweet.
Slow to recognize and act on market potential for even core strengths (e.g. healthcare and international payments)
The negatives one can hear about working at Comdata are usually from entry-level customer service ex-employees, not mid-level and up. 
If you're attractive or an athlete, you should have no problem getting a job in sales. If you're unattractive, they'll find you a cubicle and headset and let you come out for a pizza party now and again."

264,Comdata,Good job if you set your expectations appropriately,2014-12-12,2.0,Applications Developer,Technical opportunities have been very good lately.   AD management has taken things in a very positive direction from a technology and methodology point of view.,"Individual contributors have very little input in directional decisions.

266,Comdata,Lackluster Management,2014-11-25,1.0,,"Fellow workers, on site gym, and OK benefits.",Incredible supervisory turnover makes it very hard to get a good working relationship going. Change from focusing on the customer to focusing on typical call center numbers does the customer no good. Shady and downright untrustworthy management does more to enhance mistrust instead of trust. No real avenue to move up.

273,Comdata,Don't Trust Anyone!!,2014-08-06,1.0,Senior Customer Service Representative,"Promotions, see Cons. compensation, see cons, time off policies, see cons. One thng that I did see as Pro was the upper mangement (non Customer Service but Corporate) giving out rewards for attendance & compliments. Also, the medical benefits were really good.","You could not get promoted to a position you were really qualified for if you were in the call center. The reason would be a lack of experience in the company knowledge (although you would be told you are one of the best employees). Also, you would not get promoted unless you were part of the inner circle of ""Yes-men/women"". Once the hiring manager spoke to your current manager you were not selected. Also, tenured associates in the call center would rarely leave because that took bodies off the phone. ""You are too valuable as a CS Rep to lose"" was a common phrase after an interview. Compensation, pay rate, never equaled the amount of work you do, the stressful environment you are in, the level of training in different applications you earned. Time off policies were a joke. you could give ample time in advance for time off & it would get approved. As closer as time got to the leave you requested, you would be ""bullied"" that your request was never approved or they made a mistake. Office culture is that of another joke. The supervisors, managers & directors would micro-manage at every moment if you went to the copier, had to take a bathroom break, etc. Only those that would kiss up to managers did not get the attention as others. If family called the podium to give an urgnt message you were given that message right away but was kindly ""asked"" to wait until your break time to call back. Or if you took that call right then, the supervisors would hover nearby to ensure that it was an emergency. Training was crammed down the throats with no chance of sticking to the plan. Training would never be as long as needed to be proficient enough to take calls. You spent more time asking more questions and being told to read the manual."
274,Comdata,Comdata provides a solid overall experience for me.,2014-08-04,4.0,Manager,The culture at Comdata is unique and it drives me to do my best every day.  Our people are the organization and through collaboration with others we are able to be successful at meeting or exceeding our customer’s expectations on a regular basis.  There is a commitment amongst most who work here that encourages us to us try new things that will improve our overall performance at both a personal and professional level.,The company has so many product offerings that it is challenging to be informed about all of them.

The people work well together and support each other.  There is a great work/life balance for me and I have been with the company 34years.  Cafeteria onsite is really good.

When I first apply for my job I had  just 2 things in mind  ;
First ; it’s a big company .
Second ; I have the qualification to do the job .

285,Comdata,A Feeling of Family,2014-05-30,5.0,Corporate,I started my career with Comdata about one year ago and it has been an excellent experience so far.  I've received adequate training and support from my manager to successfully perform the duties of my job and there are so many long-tenured associates to help navigate your way.,"Parking.  The Brentwood facility appears to be growing tremendously.  That is a great thing for the business, but it makes finding a parking spot very difficult."
286,Comdata,"Great people, innovative products, unique culture",2014-05-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The atmosphere at Comdata is professional, but not stuffy.   I love the people I work with. The management team that I have experience with care about their employees both in and outside of work.  Work/life balance is a part of the culture and makes such a difference compared to what I have seen at other companies.  The products we offer are truly innovative.  It is great to see that this local, TN company succeeds in a National and Global market against companies that are significantly larger than us.  

I also love the onsite gym, cafeteria, business casual dress code and monthly casual weeks for charity.  The company is so involved with the local community and invites us to participate regularly.  

Time off and holidays are great.  Employee health benefits are pretty basic from what I have experienced.",As a company we change a lot.  When I first started working here it was challenging to adjust to new company structure or processes every six months or so because as a new employee it can make you feel uneasy.   I think the communication could be better from top management down in regards to these changes and in discussing big picture goals and direction for the company.

There is a cafeteria where you can have food made the way you want it. There's also a salad bar, and good selection of drinks and sides. It's a little pricey though. 
You receive all of your vacation time and sick leave up front, allowing you to decide when and how much to take.
Overtime for the taking. Great way to make some extra money during the holidays!","Let me start by saying this: I am convinced that the world known as Comdata downstairs, is not the same world known as Comdata on the 2nd and 3rd floor. On the call center floor, the metrics change every month. The standards change so much, they are hard to meet because you lose track of what you need to be doing.
In customer service, the QA standards you must meet as a call agent make complete sense. In the permit division, you will find them hard to meet.
Management is kind of lost on everything. This is not their fault as they only take the orders from senior management, but it's passed on to you as an agent and makes it stressful with your day-to-day requirements. Also, favoritism runs high on the call center floor and you will experience it sooner or later.
The training department for permits is not very helpful. They don't know the system, the state laws, or anything about the actual trucking world. Your experience in the training room will not be the experience on the call floor."

A few managers are good, but there is only lady in particular that ruins her employees lives and micromanages the oxygen out of the air.  In gerneral the whole place in under staffed and there are not enough internal resources to get the necessary jobs at hand complete and still make sales.

They worry more about dress codes than getting the job done. The same people get promoted so there is never any change, which means it's all about politics not work ethic.
