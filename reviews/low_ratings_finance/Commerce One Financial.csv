1,Commerce One Financial,Stock Broker Trainee,2016-01-15,3.0,Anonymous Employee,They get you set up for the series 7 and 63 exam,They throw you on the phone day 1 with a book and tell you to watch the guys around you (other trainees)
2,Commerce One Financial,Bad Experience,2014-06-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Not many the only thing the RXR building is a nice building.,"Its young kids playing wall street. 12 hours of cold calling, you get a two 45 mins breaks for lunch and dinner. Didn't find that out until the first day of employment. told training period was less than 2 months but when I got there, there were kids well in there 4th month of training with no sign of getting out."
3,Commerce One Financial,Worst experience of my life: Boiler room in working conditions and in terms of ethics.,2013-01-07,1.0,Former Stockbroker Trainee,It has a nice office space within a nice building. One feels informed within the atmosphere due to the constant live Bloomberg stream. Small boutique atmosphere. Other brokers are willing to help you with your cold calling skills,"Initially broker's have to work insanely long hours (13 hours per day) for less than minimum wage, forced to use overly aggressive sales  tactics with absolutely no autonomy or deviation from the cold calling script. Job is 100% cold calling and nothing else. Questions are discouraged and any question in regards to finance or as to why you are pitching a certain stock, or why you are pitching in a certain way is frowned upon. The senior brokers are all immature and have fun picking on new brokers while staying in the office for about 4 hours while new brokers work through the nights. The  job is tedious, repetitive, boring, and stressful."
4,Commerce One Financial,STOCKBROKER,2012-12-31,3.0,Stockbroker,"Potential for high income, if you can make the cut. Small shop so very tight knit work environment.",Cold Calling all day all night.  Not very informative off the position prior to employment. Help you with your pitch very well but any other questions about the industry are frowned upon.  Simply looking for high volume of calls by their new brokers.
5,Commerce One Financial,Lots of cold calling but fun environment,2012-11-15,3.0,Stockbroker Trainee,"The staff is friendly and like to joke around a lot. You must have a sense of humor to enjoy the environment. Management will congratulate you if you make a lot of sales. Not the stereotypical ""boiler room.""",The entire job is cold calling. You get in at 7:30 in the morning and don't leave until around 8:00 at night (sometimes later). The cold calling will get old very quickly.
6,Commerce One Financial,1 of the more ethical boiler rooms out there...,2012-08-23,1.0,Broker Trainee,"Easy interview process.
Easy job to land for recent college grad.
Will sponsor you for 7 & 63. Will allow you to retake if failed.
Friendly recuriter.
Located in a nice building (EAB PLAZA).","Little kids playing Wall St. are so hard to be taken seriously.
You feel the lack of professionalism as soon as you enter the office.
The ""senior brokers"" in the cubes are no older than 22 yrs old but act like they're 13, and snicker and insult new hires. They try so hard to seem cool with their cheap flashy clothes... even a hot dog vendor on wall st. would laugh at em.
No sales training.
No financial training.
High pressure sales tactics.
500+ dials a day, 6 days/week.
13 hour days.
TERRIBLE, OUTDATED LEADS! (D&B cards)
No leadership.
Zero management...
New kid worked there 4 months, and had no idea what the commission structure was like (goes to show u the level of person they would hire and the lack of training."
7,Commerce One Financial,Bad experience,2011-01-26,1.0,Stockbroker,Overall a negative experience when working with commerce one financial. As stated in the interview sections the company as a whole is just not a place where i would recommend.,"as i stated it was overall a negative experience.
cold calls for 12+ hours
No real Structure
Dont be fooled by there promise of cash and benefits
Don't let new employee find out what he/she will be doing until the day they start."
