2,Commonwealth Foreign Exchange,"Excellent business plan in selling foreign exchange to corporations, but you need to make 75 to 100 cold calls a day.",2014-08-15,3.0,N/A,"Laid back, compensation is good if you can bring a book of clients with you or are a great cold caller. Gary Chang managers the sales staff and is a stand up guy and treats everyone with respect.",The senior foreign exchange salesmen are extremely under paid. They have expanded and paid higher salaries to the new comers. It's a very difficult environment when there's a two tier pay scale and the older staff know.  Terrible synergy among the sales staff and partners allow too much crap to slide by/
