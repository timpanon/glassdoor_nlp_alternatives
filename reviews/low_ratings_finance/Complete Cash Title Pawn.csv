After you factor in hours worked ""Marketing"" which means calling corporate and seeing what they will bankroll, mainly flyers and community events (Under 100) because none of the marketing materials save for the 3 week turnaround on business cards and company branded pens are usually available...you'll make about 7-10 bucks an hour, opportunity for bonuses, but you will need to expect to make lots of calls...come to think of it, in one person stores your like a call center operator because you wont get in store help until you reach a sales level...all the while threatened with firing or store closure (In my first 6 months I saw 20 people terminated and 3 stores closed)"

Management, as other aspects is continuously improving.",The hours can be demanding at times.  There will be events and other activities aside from normal work hours that are considered mandatory.

Great Paid Time Off plan
Relaxed work environment

Employees are referred to as ""Store Managers"" but have VERY little authority

Company claims that their mission is to ""make money""  but when it comes to making decisions they always go with the ""this is what we always do"" rather than the ""this is what mathematically makes the most sense"""
19,Complete Cash Title Pawn,Best Company I have ever worked for,2015-12-27,5.0,District Manager,I've been working for Complete Cash for 3years now I started as a store manager I'm now district manager what I love most when I started is the fact You have the chance to market your location based on what works in your area. Your not forced to do events and promotions that may not grow your business you do things that work in your area . You get to come up with ideas on your own . Management understands customers do business with the people in the stores. Having the right people is everything . It's a open door when it comes to management everyone is willing to help you . Yours always being encouraged daily sometimes more than twice someone is telling you that you can do this ! This company only promotes within . If you come in with the mindset of taking ownership and marketing your store and perform well on both collections and growth you will make a lot of money . It's not a 9-5 it's a career you can go from level to level it's all based on what your willing to put in. Owner is very involved with his company awesome support team you may work in a store alone depending on the Amount of customers you have but your never alone when it comes to support . If your a self started and love to be rewarded for your hard work this is the right place,None it's all based on your will power
20,Complete Cash Title Pawn,Great place to work!,2015-12-22,5.0,Manager,"This job is a great opportunity for someone who is ambitious and hardworking. How much money you make depends on how much effort you put into the job. I would recommend this job to anyone who relishes success. If you want to just sit at a desk all day and play on your phone to collect a pay check, well this job is not for you.",Collections can be stressful at times.
21,Complete Cash Title Pawn,store manager,2015-11-30,1.0,Store Manager,"you work by yourself, no managers over your back","you work by yourself with a lot of cash which is very dangerous , they don't teach you how to protect yourself if you were robbed, management is horrible no one no what hey are doing, they will fire you to cover there own ,the pay very low , you work 10 hour shifts on salary no over time, u will never get a bonus... please beware of the fraud company , trust me you are wasting your time"
22,Complete Cash Title Pawn,Former Manager,2015-11-08,1.0,Store Manager,The pay is decent that's all!!,They only care about the company and don't value their employees.
23,Complete Cash Title Pawn,manager,2015-09-03,3.0,Store Manager,the incentives that they had for the job.,If you did not make your no.s monthly you were wrote up. (disciplined)
24,Complete Cash Title Pawn,Wish I never quit,2015-08-01,4.0,,"This job was a really good job. I am regretting leaving!  The money was ok, but they stand behind the bonuses they tell you you can make. I just didn't want to wait for it but I know better now and wish I could go back. I loved my coworkers and my DM taught me so much about managing and owning my position.",6 days a week. My store was too small to have 2 people and only work 5 days.
25,Complete Cash Title Pawn,Stote manager,2015-07-30,4.0,Store Manager,You have total freedom at your store. I like working alone. The management team is great. I love the hours.,Working in the store a lone can be boring. I was new to collections so that can be overwhelming.
26,Complete Cash Title Pawn,Horrible company,2015-07-12,1.0,Manager,"None, zero, nada worst job you can have. Stay away at all cost","I was employed there for almost 9 months and I was wrongful terminated , I have a lawyer and I plan on taking a lawsuit against them."
27,Complete Cash Title Pawn,Manager,2015-07-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,That I no longer work there.  It's sad but that is the only positive thing that I can say about this company.,"Everything.  The owner of the company is a racist and calls African Americans names, has no regard for females, is constantly hitting on females of the company or making sexist remarks or sexual comments to them.  Your hours are explained as 9:30-6 except on Wednesday and Saturday's where your hours are 9:30-2.  You are expected to go out ""marketing"" on your own time, you do not get a lunch break and you are expected to drive to the bank, the tag office and out ""marketing"" using your own gas.  You don't get reimbursed for any of that.  You will work a minimum of 50 hours per week.  Fear management is the motto around the corporate office.  The district managers, operations manager and human resoureces are constantly watching camera's and listening to your conversations.  If you drive a company car, you pay for the gas with your money and it typically has a GPS installed.  The owner is always trying to find ways to cheat the government and the IRS.  If a pawn is written off, then the owners come in and make payments, the money finds it's way to the owner's pocket.  This happens continually.  The upper management will throw things, like water bottles and staplers at their employees and continually bad mouth you to other employees.  I could go on and on, but anyone reading this should get the idea.  Think of the worst place you could work and Complete Cash in the same sentence."
28,Complete Cash Title Pawn,Biggest mistake I've ever made,2015-06-11,1.0,Manager,None I can't say one good thing about this company and out of all my former coworker they all agree,They tell you the hours are 9:20-6:00 but they make you stay till 8 or 9 and you don't get paid no days off When you are off they want you out marketing on your time. They don't care if you have family or children just wang you there growing and collecting.
29,Complete Cash Title Pawn,worst company to work for,2015-06-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,benefits and pay was ok,"-Most managers are messy
-work everyday but Sunday
-no life
-salary job, overtime with out pay, but if you were to miss a day you're docked
-they put people in DM or RM posistions that have the slightest clue on what is going on. 
-no breaks
-using miles on your car for ""required"" marketing
-and again management is messy 
company could care less about the employee, they just wanna make sure they get their money"
