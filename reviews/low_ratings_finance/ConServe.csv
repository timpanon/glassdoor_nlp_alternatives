0,ConServe,Fostering Financial Freedom,2022-02-19,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The company had decent benefits.,"Didn't feel like management listed to concerns. 
Pay could have been better.
Wasn't much room for advancement."
1,ConServe,Its a job,2021-12-23,4.0,Collections Specialist,"Good benefits, flexible working schedule,","Micromanaged, if you take 5 minutes without making a phone call or documenting an account your manager may be emailing you. Very flat organization, not many growth opportunities"
2,ConServe,Great pay in sales role,2021-10-23,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great pay and benefits, bonuses and opportunities for growth if you can match the aggressive sales culture of the company.",Too much fear of high turnover make employment job security seem unstable for new employees.
3,ConServe,Not worth 15 an hour for the stress you WILL face,2021-08-12,1.0,Debt Collector,Health benifits are paid for by the company. That is hard to find.,"Micromanagement. Unfair treatment. Favoritism. Unmaintainable goals and metrics. Low hourly rate and very difficult to get bonus. Write ups for everything, you need to be a favorite to be successful. Everyone is treated differently based on their popularity with managers. Not as flexible as they claim to be. Everyone is miserable and stressed out. Toxic work environment. Poor communication. Have to work 2 night shifts a week until 9 pm."
4,ConServe,Ok ok environment,2021-06-28,3.0,Debt Counselor,good commission and benefits for employees,no room for growth and too much of competitiveness among coworkers
5,ConServe,"Good benefits, thats about it..",2021-04-14,2.0,Analyst,Benefits are good. Free health insurance is a huge plus.,"Vacation time is not very competitive and is reset at the end of the year. 

Raises are minimal, if any. Bonuses are small and getting smaller for the most and staying big for the higher ups. For a company that emphasizes the idea that employees are their most valuable asset, you will only be treated as such if you are ""popular"" or close with the higher ups. It seems the same few people keep getting promoted and rewarded. The benefits are good but you will absolutely not be rewarded monetarily for your hard/good work. You will get a nice email while any extra money the company has is divvied up among the unnecessary amounts of managers and directors.

The company outlook is not good, as there have been constant layoffs and downsizing for a few years now as the business loses contracts to competitors. I feel there is no room for upward mobility, as every year the company is getting smaller."
6,ConServe,It's a job,2021-03-29,3.0,Credit Collection Specialist,They pay full medical benefits.,They didn't pay the bonuses out when they were suppose to and when they did it wasn't always the right amount

Good base hourly pay and potential yearly annual bonus for administrative roles.
Great atmosphere and co-workers.
Local company that has a proven track record and won multiple awards in ethics and great places to work.","May be difficult to move up through the ranks as most employees are debt collectors by necessity.
For debt collectors, too many months missing bonus can cause disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment if too many consecutive months are missed. This is to be expected in such a performance-based industry, however."
16,ConServe,Company in Trouble,2019-10-30,2.0,Debt Collector,"Free Health care, dental care, 401K.  Bonus and profit sharing.","After the company lost the ED contract, it is going down hill. Mark Davitt is no longer taking care of the daily business. It is up to Richard Klein (former CFO), So he counts every penny.  There was a layoff in January and again in October.  Moral is low."
17,ConServe,It’s time for new leadership,2019-10-10,1.0,Manager,"Health benefits, that’s about it.",Since the loss of the ED contract the company has been in a downward spiral. Many incompetent people who lack leadership skills are in upper management positions.

For example you have married couple within the firm, friend of a friend and his/her potential in-law within one company.  Given that it is a small company, it can be normal, but what is not normal is work inclusion or socialization become tribal"

38,ConServe,Dept of Education Collector,2017-04-11,4.0,Debt Collector,"On-the-job training, no previous collections experience necessary.
Conserve pays for single-coverage for healthcare, and you only paid the difference between single and family.
Bonus potential. You can make very good money with the bonus income here.
Corporate culture and rewarding all of its employees regularly (catering, free sports tickets, annual picnic, winter gala, etc.).
Good 401k investment & profit sharing. My 401k was in stocks with no loss during my employment, only gain. Profit sharing was annual and based on prior performance.","Greed is rampant and encouraged.
Bonus requirements seemed to increase every year and became more and more impossible.

40,ConServe,not for everyone,2016-11-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"decent medical plans, and 401k. the workplace environment is comfortable, like a normal call center with cubicles. The workplace is in a good part of town.","As mentioned in the other review some of the employees are questionable, and very pro smoking. the starting wage is low,  which makes me wonder why they prefer a bachelors degree for a debt counselor. You have to really not care what you are doing, since you are calling people at their jobs, and calling their family members, which is why it isnt for everyone. The job can be stressful because there are so many compliance rules you must follow and they watch your every move."
41,ConServe,OUTSTANDING EMPLOYER,2016-11-04,5.0,Debt Counselor,"-Paid health benefits for single person, paid dental and vision even for family plan ($180 per check)

-unlimited bonus potential (not pooled)
-flex scheduling for people who qualify
-employee appreciation days
-dress down for charity
-401k matching
-profit sharing
-paid sick days, personal days, very fair attendance policy","Look, I've read all the negative feedback here. But honestly, you only get out of something what you put into it. If you come in to work with a negative mindset and a bad attitude, you're always going to find something to gripe about. I'm pretty sure that's anywhere you work. The work can get boring. It can get tedious. It can be stressful, but it's production based and that's the nature of the business. The work isn't for everyone, just like flipping burgers, surgery, or designing clothes isn't for everyone either. If you have a good work ethic, focus, competitiveness, a little bit of greed and a great sense of humor, you will not only thrive here, you'll love it. This is NOT a bad company to work for. They DO have room for improvement, but in minor areas that I'm confident will be made better with time and a little employee patience."
42,ConServe,Administrative assistant,2016-11-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Close to home and in a nice neighborhood.,No raises for administrative positions! The employees are questionable and they are very pro smoking.
43,ConServe,Mentor,2016-09-19,4.0,Mentor,"The organization has a great culture.  The available technology is above par for the industry.

44,ConServe,Amazing,2016-09-14,5.0,,"Team Oriented place to work, really cares about the employees.

47,ConServe,Debt Counselor,2016-02-05,5.0,Debt Counselor,"Conserve is a great company that values their employees. From what I experienced and witnessed they made sure all of their staff were properly trained. If someone was unable to get up to speed on the collection for, the company tried to make individuals fit elsewhere in the department. Scheduling is reasonably flexible, and flex-scheduling can be earned with above-average performance.","With it being a family environment, some of it can seem clique-ish. But for the most part I felt welcomed by my co-workers upon joining Conserve."
48,ConServe,Ostracizing and Abusive,2015-12-10,1.0,Debt Collector,"Basic 9-5 schedule
Opportunities for bonus
Decent medical coverage for singles
Paid holidays
Morning meetings
Lots of accounts to check
Friendly coworkers","Poor training process
Bully for a trainer- way too militant and unfriendly
Unrealistic expectations for new hires
Deceitful intention to camouflage a collector's job as a ""counselor""
Extremely aggressive financial goals
Cuthhroat industry
Favoritism among management"
49,ConServe,Great,2015-11-09,5.0,Debt Collector,"Great opportunity, excellent training, great potential to move up. Company is on the right track and helps you stay focused in your career",I can think of no cons to to list at this time. Company is great so far in my experience. Lots of incentives to work here
50,ConServe,Skiptracer,2015-11-07,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Conserve has a great employee morale in a tough and mostly negative industry. There are many opportunities to move up into another position. They start with training, usually a two week period.",As mentioned above the work and be demoralizing and you are expected to look past it most of the time so if you are not a strong person you may not enjoy it. You may also become desensitized to what you are doing which could lead to not caring.
51,ConServe,ConServe,2015-10-29,4.0,Mentor,"Company pays individual health plans, 401k match, profit-sharing, individual bonus + partial manager bonuses","Mentors are expected to assist managers as well as hit a slightly lower collection goal which can be a bit overwhelming, low hourly, inconsistent bonuses depending on inventory"
52,ConServe,Confusing and stay away,2015-10-14,1.0,,None that I can think of unless you want to be completely monitored the entire day including breaks and lunch,Very confusing place to work as you get different directions from different management. Training is very rushed based on contract needs. They say open door policy but be very careful who you speak with as will come back to bite you hard. They monitor everything including what entrances you utilize and are very afraid of losing any contract so watch your every step
53,ConServe,Account manager,2015-10-03,3.0,,"Good work environment, good benefits, organize, good people, excellent training, top performers make own schedule","Must hit numbers or certain termination,"
54,ConServe,Best in Class,2015-08-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This is a company that tries very hard to be the best in class for their Clients and their employees. The industry is in great transition right now, and co mgmt is trying to walk the line between a great work place and moving the expectations for communicating to borrowers up to the stds being imposed by govt regulators. For most it is working, but still need to try harder for best effect.  All in all, no place better in our industry, and I know, I've worked at quite a few!","Regardless of what you read, company mgmt is responsive to the needs of the employees, while trying to make sure that they keep Clients - something that others in this space have not been able to do.  Hundreds of people in competing companies have lost their jobs due to their inability to perform their work in an honest, quality way."
55,ConServe,Debt Counselor,2015-07-01,3.0,Debt Counselor,"Decent money
Decent PTO
Great benefits and health insurance 
Good 401K","Turning very corporate
Hard on people who don't meet goal
Very political 
Bosses can easily play favorites
Strict about breaks and regulated bathroom breaks"
56,ConServe,Cut throat from top to bottom,2015-04-25,1.0,Debt Counselor,Company paid health insurance for single coverage. Family is $220 paycheck for full 26 pay periods annually as opposed to twice per month. Which puts it on par with other large agencies. The company is self insured and doesn't use any of the large insurance carriers. This is a little worrisome. But with the average aga of their employees in the twenty something age range they should have no problems,"I truly believe that at one time the company was a great place to work. However with their rapid expansion and the changes that have occurred throughout the industry. They are scrambling to keep up. They have gone to a punish first ask questions later business model. Management just isn't skilled enough to keep up. Very cutthroat environment. One day your teammate is smiling at you the next you'll find a knife in your back. The company knows this so they mask it with silly writings in th wall ""together we can achieve anything"". Or ""Forestering financial freedom"" (for the owner).  The company is driven by greed. The base pay is horrible. The bonuses are good but by comparison to what is brought in it's subpar. For example hit the base goal of a fully ramped collector who has been there greater than six months of $18000 fee you can expect a bonus of about $900 or less depending on how many ""buckets"" you've hit. Combine that with the low $13/hr base pay you can expect to gross $3150. So the company gets $14850 you get $3150. Now it's not as simple as I illustrated because of fallout rates etc. But you will get penalized every time a customer falls out of the program. So the percentage of what you receive compared to what you bring in is far below what other collection agencies pay. They are growing so fast they promote supervisors who would otherwise never have a chance in the real word to ever be in a management position.  The other positive posters on this site are either so brain washed or upper management posting. It's certainly not what's being said amongst the employees in the break room. More frustration being heard than positive statements"
57,ConServe,GOOD FOR A TRANSITIONAL POSITION ONLY.,2015-03-25,3.0,Debt Counselor,"Positive environment, single person insurance covered by company, variety of different departments.","Base pay is low, bonuses depend on many variables that are out of your control.
Company hierarchy for disciplinary actions does NOT EVER come off your record. That's right, they don't fall off after a period of time.  I'm not talking about extreme infractions.  I mean Infractions such as doing something/saying something incorrectly as far as information to the consumer.  Instead of training, they can write you up and those infractions build in unrelated areas but are still escalated into Final Disciplinary action and/or termination. 
Raises are very minimal.  I've been there several years and have met my goals 83% of the time, yet I've only been given a .49 increase, once.  
The owner cares more about the company's status as ""Best Place to Work in Collections"" and ""Forbes Magazine top 5000 growing biz list"" than he does about employees.  He masks it by providing cake once a month to the employees."
58,ConServe,"Great place to work , it is the best in the Debt Counseling industry!",2015-02-25,5.0,Treasury Department Counselor,"Great people, ethical and high standards........",So far there are no cons to this job
59,ConServe,"Not a bad employer, but could use some improvements",2015-02-23,3.0,Debt Counselor,"Pretty good bonus potential, 100% health coverage, floating holidays, decent training.  I also appreciate that they promote business ethics and workplace diversity.  If they like you, but can't cut it in frontline collections, they will help find you another position in the company.","The base pay is rather low.  Some departments only promote their friends.  Rigid scheduling, stuck in a cubicle all day."
