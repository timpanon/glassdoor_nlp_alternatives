1,Concordia Advisors,Lack of growth opportunities and learning curve is limited.,2011-03-23,2.0,,It's a good place to work if you are either 1) starting out in your career or 2) established professional who is content with his/her role and responsibilities.,"One big issue is Poor Communication skills throughout the firm.  And it feels like you are a cast member of ""The Office"" and working with senior management like Michael Scott.  Management (mainly the portfolio managers) has a tendency to hire the incompetents from outside the firm for senior positions instead of promoting within the firm."
