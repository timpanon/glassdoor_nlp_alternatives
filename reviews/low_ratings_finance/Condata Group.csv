0,Condata Group,International Freight Bill Auditor,2020-08-06,2.0,Auditor,You have the ability to make a commission over and above your salary.,"Limited training and no cross-training, and their management team is not as professional as I'm accustomed to."
1,Condata Group,overall review,2017-09-28,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"You get beginner level experience, but I think it's still good for someone who is a freshman or sophomore at college to build your resume. There are about 5 to 10 people that work there. And the boss is really organized in what she does so that one thing you'll learn organization.","Sometimes the boss can be loud and will sound rude. Which for me, didn't create a good working environment."
2,Condata Group,Accounting Assistant,2016-10-10,2.0,,Good entry level experience. Flexible scheduling.,Not too much respect from management. Treated unfairly.
3,Condata Group,Internship/Part-time work Scam,2013-11-08,2.0,Accounting Intern,"-GREAT experience. The supervisor is willing to teach and train you well. 
-Learn clients of different industries
-Mostly general bookkeeping duties, but at least you're exposed to QuickBooks
-Very flexible schedule","-It's a bait and switch tactic. The posting is placed into schools asking to hire and pay per hour, but it's really an unpaid ""training"" program. You'll get paid whenever they see fit, usually 2-3 months later, depending on when they feel you're doing work ""worthy"" of being paid; in other words, if you're not up-to-par on what you've been taught so far
-Majority of my co-workers are unpaid interns in this ""program"". The clients are becoming upset that there are new faces all the time, which is usually because the new-hires are unhappy with the treatment and the bait&switch, when it was really supposed to have been a job, and not a ""program""
-Some travel required, especially if you know your stuff. But don't worry, you'll still be paid your hourly wage that you originally signed up for in the JOB, not the unpaid-training program. 
-Employees are paid monthly, at low wages. The company charges their clients at decent rates, but yet, employees are paid pennies."
