Overall it was a great place to work for. If full time the benefit are really good very competitive.","Instead of outright firing me or letting me go they just slowly cut back my hours. I was pregnant at the time and choose to leave when I went on maternity leave, I was let go as the part-time receptionist and was working closer to full time as a file clerk."

Firm invested money in technology as opposed to trying to cut costs in that area.,"Despite investment in technology, day to day work was very manual.  Company culture changed for the worse.

I would definitely recommend Conifer as a great place to start a career in finance, not to mention the benefits and bonuses are superb.","The base pay is competitive but be prepared to take on a consistent amount of additional tasks with the same pay.  There are rarely opportunities to advance within the company, although you will have job security."
