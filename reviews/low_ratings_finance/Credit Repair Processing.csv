-  hold back a week to give to you after you quit or get fired (can't find anywhere where this is legal)
- there's a quota of 2 sales per day, but the company keeps 100% of the first 22 monthly sales. you make commission on the 23rd sale EVERY month. 
- the leads are bought from other company and tell you that it's from people with bad credit when that's not the case. 
- at the interview they tell you that there is NO cold-calling and all leads come from their site from customers interested in credit repair. 
- No holiday benefits (at least for ""sales"" people). 

- The worse part is that there's no communication between managers. The sales manager is a great guy and supportive, but he had different information than, the other sales manager (not mentioning names), and both of their information does not match the information from the owner himself. 
- they might not give you a time card to clock in or out which could be illegal. 
- I started working on the 22nd, and they owned me 2 days from the last pay period. I didn't get it, and the owner said no. He said his paperwork says I started on the 27th, not on the 22nd. On top of that, there's a week that would still need to be held back. 

There are tons of red-flags when dealing with this company. In the condition of this economy, I wasn't going to be picky about having a job, the problem was when they didn't pay me; so I walked out when the owner said ""no"", he doesn't owe me money. The department of labor is currently handling this issue. 
We didn't know that they held back a week until the beginning of the 3rd week of work when we were supposed to have already gotten paid"
