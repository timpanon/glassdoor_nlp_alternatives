0,Dash Financial Technologies,Accountant,2022-02-18,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Great learning experience
-Great lower-level team comradery/collaboration","-High pressure (need to produce deliverables quickly in unreasonable timelines)
-Lack of transparency (since buyout, decisions are made at the top with no input/consideration of employees)"
1,Dash Financial Technologies,Pay is horrible. But small company so opportunities are available for hard workers.,2021-08-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great market share in options. Client facing web interface is top notch. Small company so easy to gain a lot of responsibility, even if slightly outside of your experience.","Pay is sub-par (to put it nicely). Equities are an after thought (again, to put it nicely). Very lean staff is by design but that means that some things just wont get done, even if they are good ideas. Other recent ""great"" reviews here are Glassdoor are from insiders and 100% fake!!"
2,Dash Financial Technologies,Great Place to Work,2020-02-19,5.0,Project Manager,"Smart, hard-working people, good energy, they value the right people.  Tremendous personal understanding of a balance between work ethic and personal life, feel respected by management and always welcomed.  Ideas are always welcomed and often challenged, creating even better ideas as a team.",Trade Desk should be in NYC
3,Dash Financial Technologies,Great Place for Self-Motivated Individuals,2020-02-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Autonomy
-Work at your own pace (But expected to make results)
-No toxic work late culture (although there may be emails outside business hours)

Overall a great place, it's mostly ""make your own future"" here at DASH. If you can't create your own work, handle your own schedule, and get things done then it's probably not for you. People are also very honest, if they have a problem they tell you, so while this may be a little too forward for some, the advantage is you know where you stand with people.","-Expected to create your own work
-Senior Leaders are very busy, hard to get feedback"
4,Dash Financial Technologies,"""Great Company, Still Figuring Some Things Out""",2019-12-24,4.0,Devops Engineer,"Primarily AMAZING people, but also lots of other good things. I'm genuinely thankful that I had the opportunity to work here. - Incredibly talented, hard-working people -- to some extent throughout the company but especially so on the Operations team. Until the day I left, I felt like I constantly learned so much from my coworkers","I wish employees could have remote work flexibility. Besides of it, everything was great."
5,Dash Financial Technologies,"Great Learning Experience and friendly team,",2019-08-16,4.0,Analyst,Dash New York's office is full of friendly and smart peers who are happy to help you out.,The Chicago office seems worse than the new york office.
6,Dash Financial Technologies,Some unprofessional staff,2019-06-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Nice location in New York, NY.",Bad attitude and negativity from some.
7,Dash Financial Technologies,More than Toxic,2019-04-22,1.0,Staff Member,You get free lunch on Fridays,Watch your back because nobody in this company is your friend. Its about what you can do for the upper management or only those that sit on the board have job protection. The said part is some of these people are learning very bad management styles sociopath behavior is bad for a companies culture and grow.  Also punishing people for doing the right thing is some new type of management style that I have never seen before.  There is no grow only the people you see on the website have power.
8,Dash Financial Technologies,Toxic,2019-03-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I can't think of one good thing about Dash,"The most toxic work environment that I have ever been in.  Upper management does not value their employees.  They don't put any value on their employee's career growth and constantly change your title to fit what they need you to do at that moment and don't give you a clear path for development or allow an open conversation for your feedback or concerns.  They love to use transparency as their tagline, but there was never any transparency and you constantly feel like you need to watch your back."
9,Dash Financial Technologies,Toxic Management,2018-08-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Free lunch on Fridays, some good coworkers, decent choice of health insurance","A huge weight has been lifted since seeking new employment outside of Dash. I knew the environment was toxic while there but now that I'm gone I see just how bad it was. I should have known when I first started that if 3 people warn you to watch your back, you should probably slowly back away and start running. Most execs are in NY and have no idea about the day to day in Chicago nor do they seem to want to hear it. Their turn over rates were shockingly bad. You never knew who or when the next ""lay off"" would be. Most of the time it was simply because management didn't understand why that person was important or because that person said the wrong thing to the wrong person and was stabbed in the back. They superficially care about their employees until they decide that employee is no longer of use to them.  The execs play favorites and it's usually to those that have the brownest noses.
An ongoing joke within the organization is that ""transparency"" is in their tagline but nothing about the way they operate is transparent. My coworkers and I begged for more communication, for an organization chart, anything that gave us more insight and they downright refused.  
They are also extremely excessively litigious, as other posters have mentioned. I'm so glad I didn't have to sign a separation agreement, I can't even imagine how much those probably hold you by the balls. They do work, though, I think Dash would have more poor reviews if people weren't so afraid of the company finding out who they are and going after them."
