5,Democracy Federal Credit Union,Love my Job,2017-06-23,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I’m very tired of seeing previous employees post here with negative comments. This is a wonderful place to work as long as you do your job. This isn’t somewhere you can be a just a body and do nothing and be rewarded. A little hard work, effort and a teamwork mentality are greatly appreciated here. 

Management is super easy to get along with and ready to help you learn. 

The vast majority of employees have been with Credit Unions for years and are passionate about helping our members. 

Benefits are great and they encourage you to take your vacation and relax!  

A new benefit this year – getting a paid lunch! Instead of working 8.5 hour days with a 30 minute unpaid lunch, we now work 8 hour days and get paid to take lunch! 

Headquarters is located in downtown Alexandria and an awesome location and building. Parking is included for a small fee or you can park on the street. When I worked at my previous job in DC I had to pay hundreds each month to get a parking spot. This is much better! 

If you want to progress here it’s not hard! Work with management on a plan, work hard and see yourself grow. 
Overall employees get along and have a great comradery. DFCU is like my second family!","Some people who are hired do not want to put in the work and end up quitting when they realize this is a real job, not a sit-on-your-phone-all-day kind of job. Or they get fired because they get caught not doing their job. Then they come up here and bash DFCU because it makes them feel better. It’s a shame! Grow up!"
6,Democracy Federal Credit Union,A Truly Terrible Place to Work,2017-06-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Democracy FCU offers great location if you work out of their headquarters in Old Town Alexandria.,"There are too many cons to list. The company is struggling financially and is looking to cut costs wherever they can including employee benefits, salaries, and working hours. Benefits are lackluster and are on the chopping block due to financial woes. Employees are charged for parking on-site each day. Management seems uninterested in the well-being of employees and often uses them for justification for company failures. The board is old and out of touch with the changes that are needed to salvage the credit union's future. There are no telecommuting options and the suggestion of such is often laughed at by the executive team. 

The truth is Democracy is failing credit union that is in desperate need of new leadership and direction. Unless that happens, the company will continue to circle the drain."
7,Democracy Federal Credit Union,Loan Processor,2017-02-22,1.0,Loan Processor,Decent pay and decent benefits .,"Horrible , rude and very impatient management . DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,APPLY SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
8,Democracy Federal Credit Union,HORRIBLE PLACE TO WORK,2016-08-02,1.0,,"None.  Best day of employment here was my last day, when I walked out.","Everything.  If you have ever worked at a good credit union, you will know this place is trouble right away."
9,Democracy Federal Credit Union,Great Place To Work,2016-07-25,4.0,,"Close-Knit work environment
Very knowledgeable management staff
Very effective and supportive executive staff
Great Benefits
Compensation is comparable to experience
Metro accessible
Monthly Team Meetings to Rally the Crew


My experience here has been very positive contrary to other comments from former employees. If you perform your job to the best of your ability and you show that you are a team player, you will do just fine here.  And more than likely, enhancing your abilities and advancing to other roles within. The individuals that become complacent in their roles, do not contribute or act as a team player, or just can not perform the way they boosted about then maybe its not the place for them.  I have worked here for many years and have enjoyed the vast majority of it.  Partly, because I am a team player who will go the extra mile and I really dig the people that work here which makes it that much easier for me to perform at my best.","days can be long sometimes

10,Democracy Federal Credit Union,Employee,2016-03-09,1.0,,There are no pros for this organization.,"The senior management team is not qualified to lead a credit union.  They have allowed ""managers"" of various department terrorize new employees due to their tenure."
11,Democracy Federal Credit Union,"No, no, no!",2015-08-21,1.0,,Not applicable. Does not apply.,"Hours, lack of staff, unprofessional ignorant senior management, unethical practices, no security"
12,Democracy Federal Credit Union,"Tough place to work, learn and progress in life",2015-05-08,1.0,Manager,Was a job and gave me good experience of how to ask better question in interview process of company to determine pit fall organizations.,No follow-thru. Lack of perspective from management. Not open to ideas and opinions without loosing your job or being branded a poor communicator. Senior management lacks professionalism. Organization is a walking lawsuit waiting to happen. No career development. Poor accountability. Very poor job security. Provides bad service and value to members for a credit union. Organizational goals seem to be stay afloat vs help members and invest in future of service and saving people money while building career for your team. Small credit union who will always be mom and pop.
13,Democracy Federal Credit Union,Poor Leadership. No Job Security.,2015-03-26,1.0,Float-teller,"Co-workers. The only people you can trust most of the time. Without them this place would be a mess. Decent pay for someone beginning in a banking position. Overall, good place to start and get experience.","Managers and above are a horror to work with. One day they might completely ignore you, the next you're being told to pack up and leave. No job security what-so-ever because they are a ""At Will"" company. Basically when they can't afford to keep you on they drop you."
14,Democracy Federal Credit Union,Could be a better Management environment,2015-02-10,2.0,Communications Associate,"Co-workers, location, parking, office environment (physical)","Management/growth potential, fractured strategy, lack of computer/professional tools to get the job done"
15,Democracy Federal Credit Union,I had  great time working there,2014-04-10,5.0,Head Teller,the hours where great and nice are to work at,parking was always hard to find
16,Democracy Federal Credit Union,the worst place ever,2014-02-25,1.0,Branch Manager,it was a paycheck an that is it,"I was a manager at this company and its not just the Sr. Management. It also is the other department managers. These are 40 and 50 year olds who act childish. I served in various positions within this Credit Union and once I reached management the B.S. started. I was advised by the EVP how the other managers felt, so I knew their objections going in. I did not have nor feel the support of my peers. 
This place has major issues and I no longer cared about the credit union after my peers tried to tell me that I was wrong when I mentioned that we had a very large turnover and that we needed to work to retain our employees instead of firing them for every little thing. I advised them that staff needed to build a rapport with members and was told by the other managers that that word was over used and it did not matter.  Building a rapport is how you better identify the members needs especially when members can have 2 or 3 credit unions that they deal with. The members are going to go where they have a better relationship and know the staff. I sat in a staff meeeting while we did role play and the senario was that a MSR was helping someone who was a beneficiary on an account. I stated that the employee could have suggested to the beneficiary that they were eligibal for an account and everyone yelled ""no its too soon""
including the managers and then they wonder why they don't grow as a credit union. They always say think outside of the box but I guess in never dawned on them that the person infront of them may be unbanked and not have an account, need an additional account for tax purposes or to divided any funds. I felt like not asking the person was a disservice to the person and to the credit union. Furthermore if you can't say ""Mrs. Jones ""I am going to include this membership application with your paperwork and again I am very sorry for your loss then you don't need to be in this business."
17,Democracy Federal Credit Union,Head Teller,2013-10-18,2.0,Head Teller,The Falls church branch hours was good.,"I felt that I'm nothing to them, even I came with years of banking experience before I worked for them, the CU culture isn't focused on employees, members or customer service in general.
I felt the senior management like a gang if you voice your opinion you are the enemy and you kiss your job good bye.  They need to pay for employee parking at Falls Church."
18,Democracy Federal Credit Union,The worst executive level staff ever encountered in almost 30years in the industry,2013-06-27,1.0,Management,"Have already spent too much time trying to think of one, moving on to the next question","Senior staff tries to pit staff against each other, does not want staff talking to each other if they can not at least see you if not hear you. This is also true at the Christmas party. Senior staff will assign a task to you then ask you why are you doing what you are doing. If you attempt to do what is best for the company and it's members and it may expose the ineffeincies of the executive staff they will start making things up to attempt to put you in your place and if it doesn't stick the CEO may start accusing you of not liking her or another member of the management staff. Executive staff has been known to hide behind office barriers and eavesdrop. the CEO spends a mojority of her day watching tv and listening to employees phone calls etc, etc, etc"
19,Democracy Federal Credit Union,A long struggle to help members and staff due to poor methods of management.,2013-06-15,1.0,Management,Promoted several times over many years with good salary increases.,"Management was always slow to make even small, obvious changes. Management would listen to some staff ideas but rarely supported thru the application phase. It took management over 15 years for us to begin to update core software, thus members have suffered and potentially talented staff have not been hired or have left, or worse terminated usually without a reason other than its just not working out. Management provided no path for staff advancement, learning or salary structure so you could see what you could earn in current position or the next level, these levels did not exist. Many years it seemed we were just going thru the motions with operational projects that management never made a reality for our staff and members. Senior managements salary structure seemed very high compared to regular staff in terms of annual salary and retirement benefits. Benefits such as sick pay and vacation accrue at poor rates. Absent of a formally trained HR focused manager for most of my time here, anything HR, primarily overall work culture and advocacy for staff suffered due to lack of ideas and change and helps explain in some part the very high turnover rate of staff, especially branch and department managers and HR normal staff."
