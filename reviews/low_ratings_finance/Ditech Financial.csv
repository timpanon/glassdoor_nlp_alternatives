Turnaround has always been an issue with the company, but it has gotten much worse as time goes by. Employees have been quitting at a much faster rate lately, and morale has dropped. Certain added practices have been seemingly slowing down productivity lately and making the job more difficult and less productive. Pay is still lacking, especially for ""lower-level"" jobs - it's not at all competitive. I'm becoming more and more dissatisfied with the struggling paycheck to paycheck I've had to do while having the same qualifications as people who make so much more than I do, despite the only differences between us being job title and/or a few years seniority. I would like to try to stay here, but there seems to be no opportunity for advancement or growth and I could make better money going elsewhere. Plus I've been forced to do the job of more than one employee lately without the financial compensation for my efforts. CEO position has changed hands multiple times in a short period, which is alarming enough; some office closings have happened, and most alarmingly, a voluntary separation program has gone into effect that has allowed many higher-ups to leave the company with a cushy separation package. From my experience, these are all signs of impending disaster, and proof Ditech may be failing and only cares about protecting their ""important"" employees in the end."

Holiday ""fun"" was taken away, such as Santa coming in on Christmas Eve and having employees able to bring their kids in. Departments were laid off and jobs moved to India. Bonus structure was constantly changed for the worse, making it harder to hit goals, and then ending up in write ups and people being fired. Before the end of the year, policies changed causing health care to double, earned PTO days that you were able to roll to the next year lowered, and bonus was only paid out if the employee worked there at the time of pay out. I assume this happened because people started jumping ship. I was made aware about the new bonus pay out the day I was leaving when I was told I would not receive it even though I worked the full year. I was also told they were ""unsure"" of when it would be paid out. Throughout the year, we would look at charts hanging up showing how much money we were doing and how well the company was doing. But when it came to yearly bonuses, they were lowered because the company was not making enough (two years in a row). They had no problem letting good employees leave and hiring ones without knowledge and then providing spotty training. Some managers micromanaged too much. I ran into an issue with this, received a warning but was not made aware it was a warning until I received a ""second warning"" and was threatened to have a privilege taken away. Since I was a good employee, always hitting goal and my numbers, I went to upper management for help because I felt like I was being treated unfairly. I thoroughly explained the situation and my reasoning, but was told they would not side with me. When my aunt passed away, I was not aloud to use a bereavement day because she was not a close enough relative apparently. I worked there for 5+ years, and only once received a small bonus. The company doesn't care if employees leave, because they are hiring college kids at a lower pay rate anyway (in certain departments). They promise positive things but don't commit. They have no interest in their employees happiness. OT was constantly made mandatory and then quickly taken away, making it hard for employees to have a life outside of work. It's almost like they want the company to fail."

305,Ditech Financial,Clueless management for onboarding IT contractors,2016-03-03,1.0,SQL Server Developer,"None, as I was only there four days so I could not form an opinion.","Clueless middle management that has no plan for onboarding contractors.  I started as a contractor at Ditect in St. Paul in Fall 2015, and they were completely unprepared:  No projects, no pc, no access, no workspace other than a vacant executive room a couple of buildings away.  Slowly over the next couple of days those started to happen, but mostly on my own initiative.   

After four days I was laid off with no advanced notice and no reason other than 'We didn't link how you were acting.'   Ditech middle management was not even decent enough to give this response, let alone a good one, and I heard it from my recruiting agency as I was leaving work that day.   

I have been told from former co-contractors who remained there that improvement in this area was extremely slow. 

DO NOT WORK FOR DITECH"
306,Ditech Financial,"Horrible, Horrible company!",2016-02-24,1.0,Loan Officer,they have relaxed the dress code.,"myopic, inept managers (including more senior management). Absolutely no regard whatsoever for employees. Constant layoffs or threats of being laid-off. real pressure-cooker environment. Senior management is extraordinarily inept at business forecasting."

308,Ditech Financial,Not a nice place to work.,2016-02-22,1.0,Developer,Not a nice place to work.,Back stabbing and the consultants are treated better than the full time workers.
309,Ditech Financial,Loss Mitigation - Short Sale Negotiator,2016-02-10,3.0,Short Sale Negotiator,Initially very laid back and paid very well with 50% salary and 50% of your income in bonus. Nice office and accessible by train.,"Co was bankrupt. The wrong people were promoted that were clueless about managing.

310,Ditech Financial,No Loyalty,2016-02-09,1.0,Mortgage Loan Processor,nothing positive to say at all,"no training,  no teamwork, cussing and fighting,   They closed the Retail Lending Division with no notice.

313,Ditech Financial,Loss Mitigation Specialist,2016-01-10,1.0,Loss Mitigation Specialist,Nice co-workers for the most part. Decent pay.,New upper management turning entire department into a collection/customer service call center too much work and not enough time in the day and very limited OT allowed. They expect Loss Mit Dept to take inbound phone calls all throughout the day also which makes hitting goal and getting your work load done extremely hard.
314,Ditech Financial,Currently looking for new employment,2016-01-09,1.0,Disappointed Employee,"There's not many positives to comment on.  The workflow is steady, so there is not much down time, keeping you busy and making the time pass.","Since the merge with Ditech this company has become an overall miserable place to work. Healthcare has  doubled. PTO, including sick time and floating holidays is now accrued. So, the PTO that you were promised when you were hired, you now have to earn. Overall, becoming a Walter Investment Company has been a nightmare. Green Tree needs revival. On a side note, the turnover rate is insane. Mass firings and mass hirings. Also noteworthy, there is an extensive amount of racial tension."
