Hmmm... trying to think of anything positive, but there really isn't a single redeeming quality about DAS whatsoever.","The President of the company will bully, threaten, and accuse you of things you never even thought of doing (happened to me and others). On a whim, the owner will decide not to pay you for time already put in (happened to me and others). Never EVER get in a position where you are owed money-- you will never get it back unless you are prepared to hire an attorney (they cost money). Your phone will be bugged; the owner will be secretly listening to your calls (happened to me and others). Since he thinks everyone is out to screw him, he will screw you first (happened to me and others). Not a single positive thing about working for a man like John Black, unless you have a history of psychological abuse in your family and enjoy the trip down Memory Lane."
