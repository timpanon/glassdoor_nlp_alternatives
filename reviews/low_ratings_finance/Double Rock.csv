0,Double Rock,Double Rock Review,2015-10-28,1.0,,"Able to learn different types of financial banking products. Had to wear many different hats, so was able to gain exposure to various departments within the company.","Extremely underpaid for work effort.  Corporate culture was not friendly, everyone for themselves, and senior management/sales setting unrealistic expectations."
1,Double Rock,Wishing I hadn't taken the job.,2010-04-27,1.0,,"Close to mass transportation in arguably the least likeable area of the city.  Otherwise, no real ""pros"" to being employed here.","No room for advancement and no formal review process.  There is an employee manual, but is adhered to in the loosest of terms, and at management's convenience."
2,Double Rock,RUN ... In th opposite direction,2010-04-27,1.0,,"The only positive about working here is the company is soooo horrible that you have absolutely no qualms whatsoever about arriving precisely at 9 and leaving promptly at 5 - in this day and age, given the current economic climate - virtually unheard of!","Nepotism, incompetence, antiquated systems, uncrupulous or non-existent business ethics ... I could go on, but you get the idea."
