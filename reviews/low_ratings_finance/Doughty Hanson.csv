0,Doughty Hanson,Worst place I ever worked at,2019-03-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Nothing at all. They give you free lunch but work you to death and are rude,Hostile unfriendly environment. Openly racist majority white middle class team. Most have been there for years and set in their ways. Wouldn’t recommend working here. Had several people leave due to how unfriendly this place is & by far the worst place I’ve ever stepped inside. They employ the same kind of horrid people who all fit in. Having worked in several private equities this is by far the worst so avoid it
