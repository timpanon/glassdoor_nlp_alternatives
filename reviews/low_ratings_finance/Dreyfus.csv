10,Dreyfus,Senior client specialist,2016-08-07,2.0,Senior Client Specialist,Great benefits with a generous 401k match that vests immediately. Also a small additional 401k contribution that Dreyfus provides but you must wait 3 years for it to vest. Great place to learn how to service clients and they also provide you with your series 6 and 63 that they pay for and sponsor,Micromanagement is a constant issue with this place. More emphasis on avoiding all risk no matter how reasonable over growing the client base

15,Dreyfus,PLEASE DO NOT WORK HERE !,2015-05-17,2.0,Senior Account Analyst,Not much in this section.  Most of the time got work done within hours specified so didn't have to stay late.  Coworkers were dedicated and hard working.  Willing to go that extra step.,Where do I begin.  Salary was very low for new york city.  It was nearly impossible to move up beyond senior level unless you were friends with upper management.  Benefits were average at best .  Technology was sub par in operations area.  Company moved jobs from manhattan to brooklyn.  Don't expect to make big money here.
16,Dreyfus,External Wholesalers,2015-04-09,2.0,External Mutual Fund Wholesaler,"Global company with tons of jobs, oce youare in, after 2 year youcan aply for anything...anywhere..huge global reach

Great Benefits","High turnover in CEO's..promises never kept and stability is questionable

Regionl Manager are puppets..they give no sales ideas...they manage up, the ONLY way to shine is to pat yourself on the back and make sure all the important people know

Key Accounts for the IBD channel has been slow to get funds in models/rec lists

Shortage of interna lwholesalers-not one to one

Too many conferenece calls during the week"

19,Dreyfus,Solid training and quality of life for LI based job,2014-11-18,4.0,Client Service Associate,"Good training program for people just entering the financial services field. Sponsor for securities licenses and examinations. Shift type work for most entry and mid level equates to high quality of life and little ""take home stress"". Atmosphere was supportive, not competitive.",LI based operation leads to less compensation and fewer opportunities to move up. Always felt there was a chance they could move this operation to a different part of the country due to high cost of doing business on Long Island.
