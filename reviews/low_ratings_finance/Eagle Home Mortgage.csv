7,Eagle Home Mortgage,No Place Is Perfect,2020-09-25,4.0,Senior Underwriter,"Direct management is very clear and open and honest. 
Overall direct management seems to understand work/life valance and are genuinely appreciative for their employees.
Consistent meetings for the whole UW team that can result in good conversation and opportunities to give effective suggestions or voice concerns. 
Overalll this place has (like ALL others) it’s good and bad. No place is perfect and if you can be effective and efficient with your day & work you will find great success","There is some upper level pressure to work as many hours as not humanly possible
Some of the choices made to restructure appear to be made without long term thought to impact and effects
Wish there was an incentive plan for UW department which is fairly common at other companies"
8,Eagle Home Mortgage,Sweatshop,2020-08-18,1.0,Mortgage Underwriter,Work from home as remote employee,It’s a sweatshop. They don’t want you to take vacations and if you take a sick day they call you during the day and give you a hard time. You can’t go to the doctor’s office without going through management and they won’t let you use your sick time to take appointments. Only 2 weeks vacation that you can almost never request off and forced overtime every weekend. It’s awful.

Too many meetings"
10,Eagle Home Mortgage,Most stressful company I have ever worked for. Poor compensation.,2020-07-07,1.0,Mortgage Loan Processor,The office is centrally located between Clearwater and St Pete.,"80 plus loan pipeline, some loans are build outs meaning they will not close for possibly a year, commission ranges from $0 to $30 for a loan you have spent a year working on updating docs for. You are forced to wear multiple hats, micro managed to the max, treated as if you literally have a tag on with a number on it- you are nothing more. There is zero work/life balance. Management does not take accountability for anything and are not at all helpful, they merely pass the buck down and everything falls on the processor. You spend your whole day providing updates on loans that you have already answered to several times over. Customers are treated terribly because you do not have time to respond to them, as you are replying to 20 or so emails per day to your boss and their assistant. They do not bother to look in a file to see what is outstanding, they hide behind the computer and fire out requests all day, when you are already clearly overworked. Overtime is not required, but they will bully you into working late at night, on the weekend and even holidays. They will ask you for the hours you will be working on a weekend or a holiday up to a week in advance. They will tell you over and over again how ""everybody has plenty of work to do""- this is due to them not being able to keep their best people. Most people quit within a year of being hired. Training is non existent- you are given a booklet to read and a 3 day computer class on 1 of their many software programs."

15,Eagle Home Mortgage,Processor,2020-01-30,1.0,Processor,"Stability, nice teammates and location.","Where do I begin!!!  Over worked, under paid!  Company under investigation by the Federal Government.  There is favoritism from management with a handful of employees; “COMPANY PETS”!  You can’t voice your opinions to management because you will become a target and the mistreatment worsens!

- Leadership needs to communicate to the company, as a whole, more often. The three large centers and headquarters get special treatment (picnics & holiday parties, town hall meetings with executives) and the other locations across the country don't get the opportunity to watch via webinar or listen to a recording. Therefore the same message is not consistently being delivered across the country."

Lennar was a great company to team with and focused on working together.,"I enjoyed working there for the most part.   The manager was extremely smart and could get things done but her insecurities and lack of self esteem interfered with being a good manager.  It came out in immature, caddy behavior.   Too much gossip and it created a bad culture.   The builder was amazing and fun to work with and the metrics and processes were pretty straight forward.   I think I only missed a couple close of escrow dates and those were not the Ops team fault.    On Call weekends were rotated between all the LOs so if you were up on your work you could take some time off."
38,Eagle Home Mortgage,"I'm sure the company is fine, my managers were so bad I had to quit after only 3 months",2019-02-05,1.0,Mortgage Loan Officer,Not slaves to a schedule. Spoonfed clients from the awesome sales team at Lennar.,"Lousy comp plan. They don't offer Kaiser.

Our office was a mausoleum! If you were on a phone call the boss would storm out of her office and shush you. I was asked to take down pictures of my family from my cubicle. I was told by my managers in 5 separate meetings that my NHCs didn't like me (my NHCs were my next door neighbors and invited me to their homes for parties, and were PISSED when they heard I was told that). I was so miserable there, and felt so mistreated that I quit after only 3 months with 1.3 million in my pipeline (many of whom were only there because I SAVED THE SALE!)."

Was told in the past that I was making the most my position could make without ""moving up,"" found this to be completely untrue when talking to another former coworker in my same position. 
Corporate shakeup has left many including me feeling vulnerable and with almost a complete loss in confidence for the future. Attrition has emptied out the offices. 
Recent layoffs handled very poorly, with staff crying in the hallways while higher ups were in the conference room laughing and chumming it up. Poor taste considering you just let people go - time and place...

Demeaning and dehumanizing layoff process. A recent one was done over speaker on a cell phone and clocked in at 3 minutes.

Smart - I work with just really intelligent people that get it.

Rewards Results - People on these sites often complain that they weren't recognized or rewarded for working hard.  Well, in the real world you may get an A for effort, but if you're not producing results, or your results are poor quality, then don't  expect to be applauded, because you failed.

83,Eagle Home Mortgage,Management,2017-04-05,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great sales staff that actually cares about their operations staff and works well with them. 
All managers work well together to get the loans done for the customers, everyone jumps in to help when it's necessary
All staff is motivated and takes coaching well","We were a smaller business purchased by EHM. The longer we go, the less voice we have on bigger ticket items, like the OS we are using and the changes they are making."
84,Eagle Home Mortgage,Would not recommend,2017-04-02,1.0,Senior Loan Processor,"Im scrapping at words for pros here, but location of office was nice shopping and food and coffee is close.","Managers need serious help with operations their mood swings are enough to give ypu whip lash. They talk at you. 
No bonuses due to no equal loan distribution.
Not allowed to ask underwriting questions on conditions without being criticized 
Overlays they state when hired are small, howecer they have the most out of any lender or bank ive worked with.
They do not follow fannie freddie guidelines 
Loan officers will toss you under the bus if you do not hide documents or pretend not to see documents that will change a loan
Not allowed to discuss files with anyonr regarding other guidelines or question any underwriting conditions
If you haave experience you meed not apply it here you will be told continually it doesnt matter. 
You will be lied too by management and mis misrepresented as well.
If you have issues do not use hr it makes problems worse and you will be terminated without cause."
85,Eagle Home Mortgage,Loan Officer,2017-03-27,5.0,Mortgage Loan Officer,Great support.  Company offers excellent tools to help LOs be successful.,Their presence in Arizona could be greater but they are working on it.
86,Eagle Home Mortgage,Mortgage Loan Officer,2017-03-21,5.0,Mortag Loan Ofcr,"Amazing tools for LO's (paid for by company), in house underwriting, Appraiser Roster (no AMC fees to stick customers with), incredible benefits (low cost insurance, 401k match and many things at Lennar's cost)","I agree with the LO  from AZ,  I just wish Eagle would have been here sooner"
87,Eagle Home Mortgage,Great Compay to work for,2017-03-17,4.0,Loan Processor,"Great management, great pay structure, great benefits, work life balance.",The company is somewhat corporate
88,Eagle Home Mortgage,"Great People, Great Place to Work!",2017-03-17,4.0,Processing,"Benefits are great. Pay is competitive. The Management team and staff are very friendly and do no micromanage so long as everyone is doing their job. The team chemistry and dynamic is wonderful. It is a fun environment and there is also room for growth. People tend to get promoted pretty quickly and are able to move up the ranks. Also, the system for our borrowers is wonderful. Everything is moved efficiently and quickly through the assembly line of LO to audit to processing assistant to processor to underwriter then to closer. Everyone works pretty well together.","The system is not very good. It is highly customized and lacks efficiency. It is extremely compliant thus resulting in not being very user friendly.  Bring your own supplies as it is difficult to get approved for anything(wrist rest, new note pads, etc.)."
89,Eagle Home Mortgage,Best Company I've Ever Worked For,2017-03-16,5.0,Mortgage Loan Officer,"Support, support, support!
This company is the only company that I have worked for that provides in house:  a loan officer assistant, two processors, plus our underwriting and closing teams all under one roof!  This is gives us an edge on 99% of the competition and allows me to deliver unparalleled service to my clients and business partners.   The branch manager at my location is in my view is a world-class loan originator with decades of experience.  The company provides more tools than I can even use....a huge difference from where I came from.  I couldn't be happier at Eagle Home Mortgage.",I wish I would have found this company 10 years ago
90,Eagle Home Mortgage,Staff,2017-02-11,1.0,Support Staff,Insurance is strong and inexpensive.,Senior Leadership is horrible
91,Eagle Home Mortgage,Area Branch Manager,2017-02-08,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Great senior leadership and positive atmosphere,None to really speak of
92,Eagle Home Mortgage,Boise Office,2016-06-02,5.0,Loan Processor,"Great Management, Rapport among employees is high, Office is structured as a supportive team directed entirely by management. I have worked here for almost 4 years, and best company to work for. Benefits, bonuses, base pay is great. Can't speak for other offices-Greatness starts at the top and management here is top notch","This is mortgage, so you will be working overtime. Don't think it's necessarily a bad thing-they pay overtime."
93,Eagle Home Mortgage,MLO,2016-06-01,2.0,,"Fast closing, no micro management.","Uncompetitive pricing, much more needed to improve on leads quality."
94,Eagle Home Mortgage,Run away,2016-04-14,1.0,TSR,There are no pro's that I had working at eagle.,This company has no morals or character. The company is racist and sexist. I was fired for speaking up about the relationship that my boss had with his assistant. Our department was ran into the ground and we lost our jobs because of poor management. 2 accounts were lost due to the bosses assistants incompetence. if you want to work at a place where the way you get ahead is to sleep with the boss feel free to apply.
95,Eagle Home Mortgage,Lacking Good Management,2016-04-08,2.0,Loan Processor,"They offered a pretty decent bonus structure based on your production numbers for processors. 
They have a good intranet with details about all the loan programs they offer. Really useful when prepping a new loan file to figure out what is best for the customer.
They have quick responses when you send a question in to the loan desk, but often it would only be a copy & paste from some guides. Still useful when you don't have the time to search the guides yourself. 
Their closing team is pretty great and are focused on what's best for the customer.","Career advancement is very unclear. Seems really wishy-washy about how you can grow with the company. 
Upper management (Tempe/Reno) is not good at communication. They do not notify all branches when big changes happen within a company, let alone any of the small stuff. 
Underwriting is a mess. There are underwriters there who seem to drag their feet and take forever on loans. They will also delay approval and/or not approve a loan at all based on ""underwriter discretion"" way too often. It seemed like it was more of a personal attack on the loan officer than a true review of the file. If they didn't like an LO, then good luck getting your file through. 
The underwriting department out of Tempe needs a new management badly. There is not good communication and the customer is not put first"

99,Eagle Home Mortgage,Top 5 Mortgage Lending Company,2016-01-22,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Has all the trappings of a large company like $$$, Benefits, Programs & staff but the feel of a smaller company where you can go for the correct answer rather than 5 layers of management.",Letting the public know how good we really are!
