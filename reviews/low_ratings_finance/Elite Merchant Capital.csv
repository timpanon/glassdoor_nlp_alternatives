0,Elite Merchant Capital,Junior Funding Analyst (aka: Telemarketer),2015-10-12,1.0,Junior Funding Analyst,"SOME of the people above you try to keep up your moral and help you, but overall you all know if they start you as this position, you're not going anywhere.","They pay the SMALLEST base possible ($200/wk when I was there) and promise great commission. In this position, you probably make $0-$200 commission a month AT MOST. 

Calling people on the phone for 8 hours and maybe getting 3 leads a day if you're lucky. You don't get paid for how many you pull in though.

Promises made for commission were NEVER kept, and you were kept in the dark a lot of the time on whether your leads were actually funded..meaning the closer and the company kept your share.

Overall...they dont have you sign a contract which is ALWAYS bad. Basically means they pay you whatever they want. No benefits. No anything. 

Worst job I have ever had."
1,Elite Merchant Capital,great if you can get paid,2015-10-08,2.0,Telemarketer,Chanced to learn how to sell bank loans over the phone,No salary no commission you work for free until you quit.  The employees are sharks and acrobats jumping over their terminals to land square right in front of you to steal your leads.
