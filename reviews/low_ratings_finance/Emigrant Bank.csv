I saw it happen to someone in my department and then it happened to me. I had to leave for personal reasons, was able to return after three months--they hadn't found anyone to fill my position--and was punished for disloyalty: demoted, lost my private office, and was required to learn skills that I wasn't suited for. The reason for learning those skills was that they hadn't found a qualified candidate after years of looking. (Translation: The salary was too low. Duh.)"

17,Emigrant Bank,Old School Company Lacking in every way,2019-08-12,1.0,N/A,"Recognizable name in the industry, compensation is moderately competitive for some positions. If you work in NY there is a cafe in the basement specifically for EB only at a discounted rate.","Old Boys Club mentality where everyone caters to particular personalities and nothing is up-to-date or competitive as far as benefits, perks or cultures goes.  Being in the elevator with the CEO is prohibited.  Formal attire required, starting vacation is 10 days, WFH is prohibited.  Team might require you to attend off-site training that they will not pay for completely, culture is anti-millennial /technology, management dislikes those who utilize their time off, work-life balance is non-existent (deceiving interview process where its conveyed that the culture is relaxed, you can come and go, but in reality there are long hours regularly and weekends you are required to work from the office), performance management process could be so much better but is paper-driven and focused on how you stack against your team members rather than being evaluated on your own performance or potential.  HR couldn't help in a stressful situation, team discouraged socializing with others because ""our work is too important to wait on social graces""."
18,Emigrant Bank,"Small company, big personalities",2019-05-31,3.0,Anonymous Employee,There are 10-ish company holidays a year and (depending on what you do) a fair amount of half days before said holiday.,Many roles are currently filled by personnel who have not adopted with the times.  A lot of technology is outdated.  There is an effort to update/upgrade however there is no solid time table and could take years.  This bank is very behind most banks you'd find today.

21,Emigrant Bank,You are better off somewhere else!,2018-04-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Nothing else other than the miserable paycheck,"A lot of things , lack of good morals,  pompous senior management who care about none but themselves  Associates and assistants are treated like worthless talent, and used as scapegoat for when things are off, and the executives can't even figure out certain things themselves because they refuse to keep up with the advancement of technology.

I hope you have more than a minute to read this part, especially should you be considering working at this bank ( which you shouldn't, really):

Only the heads of certain departments such as capital markets, private bank, and finance and operations are rewarded favorably. Yes, very true.

 The pay is insulting to one's work experience and skills, and you wouldn't have sufficient funds to actually enjoy life assuming you're not one of the aforementioned department heads.
 
Blatant favoritism, nepotism, and  they are a few officers and 1 associate, whom i shall not name that  will address you differently due to the color of your skin; They will freely throw fake smiles your way, but when it comes to the real work, you will be underestimated, belittled, and held with no respect. Brief, you will be treated and spoken to differently if your skin is far from fair, and you are not a brunette nor blonde. 
Minimal compensation despite working hard and producing results; management does not care about employee satisfaction, and often secures a scapegoat in the event that something goes wrong. ( Too accurate)

They will sugarcoat you  on how great the bank is and opportunities for future advancement, but i hope you'll be smart enough to not believe them.

The initial job responsibilities will be nothing of what you'll expect to do a few months in the role, you will end up doing more work, with no adequate guidance from the top heads who delegate it, or the necessary tools to perform the work demanded.

No open door policy, you cannot express concerns or even ask for things needed to productively perform your work, you have no right and the decision is final, no discussion about it, you shouldn't even ask, just don't.

The associates are unhappy, and If you are in an assistant position, it's even worse, worse, i tell you. 

 No advocacy for the employees, because the only person who has the power to influence improvement refuses to do so for fear of losing her job, because she has ""a mortgage to pay"",  so you just have to be silent and do as  you are told, no collaboration, no open ground.

This bank will continue to have a revolving door effect  until the re-evaluate their morals, procedures, and HR. 
So many employees i've spoken with in my  department and other departments have expressed unhappiness at their jobs, but they stay because they have bills to pay, and that is no way to live and work."

Quite frankly, I come to work to collect a paycheck until I can find my next opportunity.","Where do I begin?!
-Executive management including bank founder are not forward thinking and not open to innovative ideas. They look for ""yes"" men, nothing more. 
-HR is at the beck and call of management, does not look out for employees at all. In fact there's probably more turnover in HR than anywhere else! 
-Laughable salary and bonuses for anyone who is not part of management
-Not many opportunities for growth
-Terrible benefits
