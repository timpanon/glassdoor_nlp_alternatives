3,EnTrust Capital,Shady business tactics; lots of perks but treat employees badly,2016-09-06,1.0,,"Free lunches every day
Casual dress code","Came off as a great place to work during my interview, but didn't turn out that way. Lots of perks on the surface (free lunch every day, company-sponsored retreat), but the real benefits like health insurance and retirement benefits are worse than average in my experience. Pay isn't great compared to other jobs I have had both before and after working here. In addition to all of that, I was treated like garbage while working here. I found the culture to be incredibly unprofessional and witnessed harassment of my coworkers. Also, like another reviewer said, financial performance is weak, sales tactics are shady (without getting into too much detail), and they were just bought and merged into another underperforming financial services firm. Not somewhere I would go if you have any other options."
4,EnTrust Capital,Employee,2016-04-07,1.0,,"-Average benefits package

-Not many competing for jobs here so the competition isn't steep, most of the talent has already left",More of a sales company than anything related to financial services. Focus was always on shady tactics like using only the phone instead of email (fraud) so the SEC can't track their criminal business activities or finding ever more clever ways to hide true performance numbers from clients. The firm is operationally a wreck and just merged with a hedge fund that hasn't been profitable in years. I wouldn't work here unless you're desperate.

High level of integrity among several of the partners/employees.","Business and investment strategy more focused around copying what other successful firms are doing or what has worked in the past for them, rather than being anticipatory."
