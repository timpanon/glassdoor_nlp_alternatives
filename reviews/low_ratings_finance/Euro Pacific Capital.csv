12,Euro Pacific Capital,They've got problems...,2015-07-11,1.0,Stock Broker,You learn how not to run a brokerage firm.,"""Just because the doctor diagnoses the disease, doesn't mean they know the cure."" Working there forced me to learn the int'l markets/economies and their interconnection with US markets. But what I learned caused me to realize that Peter is wrong. 

Platform is very low-grade and brokers are severely restricted from straying outside the Peter philosophy, even if it's in the best interest of the client.

Watch your payout percentages! The numbers they initially gave me and what I was actually paid was much lower. 

Periodically, they do ""client dumps"". A client dump is when the big producing brokers dump clients on newer brokers. These clients have already been milked for their commissions, but now must be serviced. The big producers can't be bothered with providing service, so they dump these clients on newer brokers to service. It's genius, when you think about it!"
