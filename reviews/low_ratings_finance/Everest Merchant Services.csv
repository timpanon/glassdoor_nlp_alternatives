0,Everest Merchant Services,Jr. Account Executive,2017-06-21,2.0,Junior Account Executive,You're able to make a lot  of money when bonus's are put on the board,"They always change the amount of time you have to be on the phone, in order to make the quota"
1,Everest Merchant Services,Won't Recommend,2017-05-14,2.0,Data Entry Analyst,Payment is Swift & moderate career opportunity.,"Expects to work for free, nepotism & low hourly rate."
2,Everest Merchant Services,High Turn over,2015-10-29,3.0,Senior Account Manager,fun environment.  every one in the company is high energy and enthusiastic about getting hings done.,terrible pay structure.  they had no way of keeping track of business that was closed.  often had to go to the payroll section and tell them what deals i had closed and how much they were for. management was shaky at best.  they hire a bunch of people at once because they assume most will leave within the first 3 months and theyre right
3,Everest Merchant Services,run away,2015-08-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,only pro is that it closed down i believe,Dont pay bounce checks and owner is insane
4,Everest Merchant Services,RUN RUN RUN!!!,2015-07-22,1.0,Account Manager,PROS? Ha Yeah right! ABSOLUTELY NONE,"If u want to slave for potato chips then u r cool....otherwise run fast!....commission only no matter what they tell u(and I recall a Manager saying ""tell them what they wanna hear"" so they will tell u $9-$14/hr but it's a complete lie!!!!!ripoff"
5,Everest Merchant Services,Sucks,2015-05-04,1.0,Account Executive,hated the environment and employees,no benefits too much favortism
6,Everest Merchant Services,I work for Everest Merchant Services.I think it should be closed down or re-structured.,2014-11-22,1.0,"Telemarketer, APPT SETTER","The only pros are imo:
1.)Fast same-day interview,and i was at the time offer,to begin next day or same week.I was very happy,being in nursing school to help with my household bills etc.the kids,our family etc.
2.)First 30 to 90 day paycheck,i have to be honest was ON TIME-EACH WEEK,even if some here i see and on FB twitter who have met me,prove to me,showing me issues they had with their check,each week.I would have file complaint if that happen to me fast.No company is allowed by law i have learn to hold back a check repeatedly like this,when your working hard,and on the books W2.
3.Also i like how at""first""every 1, i met seem like me,professional,MATURE over 18 y.o. and not kid,fun atmosphere but boy was i wrong after first 2 to 3 months.","Cons involving EMS,Everest Merchant i've witness first hand are several so i shall try not to take up the entire page here.

1.)Lie to me about benefits.
2.)Lied on a nice quiet,professional atmosphere,no ""loud street hood atmosphere.""
3.)Lied to me when i began about how this is NOT your typical telemarketing,call-center BOILER room like the movie exhibit.
4.Everest Mgr. had inform me 1st interview,"" boss mrg.etc.always will LISTEN/HEAR ME OUT/HELP if i need it etc. and it was all a lie.
.
I was sad premise on i was mislead.
i really needed this job too.only ten minutes by car from my home in Bayonne,Weehawken,Jersey City area,in NJ.
But yet,i just recently had to leave.I am going to file complaint on them soon with others,on the pay deceit,and on the fact,it is a un-professional atmosphere. EVEREST,CANADIAN etc. might advertise on Career weekly to monster etc. and make the job sound legit,and ""so professional""but trust me,they are not,at the bottom of the barrel.I hope by complaints,since I VOLUNTARILY quit when i found something much better,i hope the office is mature/much nicer,professional as they FALSELY advertise. Until then, be sure to expect if hired,the above issues,everyone.i am glad i left.Meeting more to file class action suit,and or complaints galore,from others who went through what i did.Not right to be mislead at all. Shame on Canadian and Everest Merchant Services.I am sure karma to them will come.

Very Unprofessional.I don't miss working here at all. shame on ARNOLD ."
7,Everest Merchant Services,"Not what it seems, really a ""boiler room""",2014-11-07,1.0,,"Informal environment, able to Dress down. Not much more than that.","Boiler room style setting, unprofessional management, typos like crazy on the Training script. (My 10 year old can spell better). Trainer was using lots of profanity."
8,Everest Merchant Services,Boiler room,2014-09-22,1.0,,Abdolutrly Nothing positive to say,"Look at current employees. Less than 5% of sales associates have been there less than 3 months. Support staff, pricing desk, IT used to be in sales but there is no future. Management has criminal records (check w SEC). 
Bait and switch company. Notes in sales360 even indicate on certain leads that rate quote was bait n switch. Try calling the 800#. Does not go to receptionist, just bounces from phone to phone."
9,Everest Merchant Services,Favoritism and A Scam,2014-09-04,1.0,Appointment Setter,They will hire you on spot ANYONE OFF THE BOOKS,I actually liked the job until my co workers were bad mouthing me because I was setting 13-18 appointments a week. I complained nothing was done . They will make you think a appointment was not valid and still go out to the appointment and not tell you . You never see the owners or head managers as if your their slave . They say you aren't selling only setting appointments but in all reality you are they'll fire you for standing up for yourself as far as pay . They put you down  and make incentives with you so you would want to book more appointments and not keep their promise. Favoritism I say that because they'll have people miss 3 days every week and still be able to be employed with them but fire one of their best employes for being late to work . Mind you it's commission why are you going so hard ! They lie to bussiness owners . Checks bounce and you never get paid on time . Being they hire crack heads and want to make them team leaders shows a lot about their character . I met a lot if good people there as I said I made good money every week but it's because I have a sales hustler mentality and I was let go because I defended myself on money I was promised unlike a lot of ppl that work there that let them steal and lie I said something . Yes I was late but I can come to work late and book 5-7 appointments a day ! While they have ppl who miss work 3 days a week book 3 appointments for the week and still are employed ! I didn't want to go so hard but y'all know what's up ! I MADE YALL WHO YALL ARE SO YALL MOVED TO WALL STREET NOW YALL WANT TO ACT SADITTY YOU WILL NEVER FIND ANOTHER EMPLOYEE LIKE ME !
