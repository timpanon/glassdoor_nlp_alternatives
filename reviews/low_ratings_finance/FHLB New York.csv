No growth in the company"
1,FHLB New York,Incompetent and Overly Political Senior Management,2022-01-19,2.0,Risk Manager,"It is very easy to get by without any focused attention to anything you do, if you choose to do so. There are a few very competent individuals who seem to carry the entire firm on their shoulders, and get persecuted by senior management if they ever try to get out of the hamster wheel that's been set up for them. If you are bad at your job but suck up, there is a very high chance that you will get away with adding negative value until your pension is fully vested.","Management demonstrates a profound lack of insight into both technical and personnel matters on a regular basis. Most of your coworkers will be relatively helpless and spend their time implementing menial tasks for mangers in systems the managers barely understand. It seems that there can never be any meaningful change, despite yearly protestations to the contrary, because of the self-serving structure of the senior management and lack of probing and professional standards from the Board."

7,FHLB New York,Company Review,2021-04-27,4.0,Analyst,FHLBNY is a great place to work because it is small enough of an organization where you can have a lot of exposure in the company.,A bit political in nature and extremely regulated environment that sometimes hinders innovation and change.
8,FHLB New York,Credit Analyst,2021-03-08,5.0,Credit Analyst,Great place to work at with nice people,Some technology and practices are dated and the place is highly bureaucratic

14,FHLB New York,Operations,2020-02-06,2.0,,"Salary, Pension & Work life balance.","Everything else....AVPs, VPs, & above are promoted based on years of service at the company instead of knowledge. They tend to lean on those with sharper minds. Meanwhile, you carry all the weight without the recognition and DON’T YOU DARE COMPLAIN!!! 
Can’t wait until I become fully vested....then I’m gone with the wind!!!"

Strong corporate mission","No clear path for advancement
Poor communication from managers
Corporate culture

Long standing employees with reluctance to change and poor view of younger generation in the workforce"
16,FHLB New York,Making Good Progress Toward Industry Standards,2019-11-27,4.0,Analyst,"-True 9-5, never a need to work more unless you want to but it is never frowned upon to leave at regular business hours. Home/life balance is well respected here.
-Beautiful offices one conveniently in midtown and the other in Jersey City off the PATH train with amazing views. Everything is clean, spacious and beautiful as far as office spaces.
-I've made good friends here and happy I have them.","-HR, HR, HR; They control a lot and some of us as employees do not even know who they are or what they do. There is no system, rhyme or reason for why they control so much, i.e. salaries, raises, promotions. You guys do not even know what our jobs are so why do you get to dictate any of my raises/promotions etc. There needs to be a overhaul in the HR department and get rid of some of those useless souls and make HR about the employees."
17,FHLB New York,Horrible Management,2019-10-16,1.0,Analyst,Amazing office and good coworkers.,Management will treat you like a factory worker & micromanage. The company looks to promote females over males when possible even if less qualified for diversity reason. Most managers have no idea how to manage. Senior management is resistant to change.
18,FHLB New York,Not the best,2019-07-17,1.0,Analyst,"Great benefits, wonderful location. Nice new office",Unless you've been there for 10+ years you're treated like a child. Managers can only micromanage and offer no positive feedback. Upper management delays projects but expects deadline to be met.
19,FHLB New York,"""Stay Away if You Want to Build a Career""",2019-06-13,1.0,"Vice President,\Director Technology","Nice office space on Park Avenue and in Jersey City, NJ.","No professional nor business conduct among staff. Hiring is done through committee of more than 6 people. The youngest and lest qualified staff members always nix highly educated and qualified VP/Director level candidates. It is shocking to interview a candidate for 6 hours and have someone slighty above secretary say ""no"".  Therefore, FHLB NY has an over abundance of low skilled and low IQ staff. Just review the LinkedIn profiles of staff and you will understand that these employees would never get an interview with a Wall Street firm.  But what is really frightening working at this bank is the high level of diversity employees who do no work or very little work. The IT department is very behind in terms of IT standards and processes. No women staff members in IT department."

25,FHLB New York,Professional Specialist,2018-01-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Most r Excellent benefits life ins. , vision,  generous PTO, vacation, personal up to 23 and 12 sick days per yr.  However the medical health and dental insurance is extremely expensive premium is costly and super high deductibles horrible.  Pension and matching 401k is great.","Advancement is extremely difficult with management and corporate politics.  Unless you have a professional knowledgeable and emotionally intelligent normal manager willing to help there qualified staff excel and grow. Bonuses are unfair compared to management's and 1 st level officers.  Extremely one sided.
If you're lucky enough to have a normal just manager this GSE organization may work for you. Otherwise corporate will not be fair in there investigations for non officer professionals. BEWARE"
26,FHLB New York,Specialist,2017-11-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- good pay
- good management
- 401 k match",None that I can think of.
27,FHLB New York,In my opinion,2017-08-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Small company in terms of number of employees but the Bank does a lot of great work. Depending on the area you work there is room for growth and even if it isn't, you have the ability to apply for a position in another group.",Medical and vision benefits are not ideal. Two options of a high deductible plan costing a family of 3+ at least $400 per month. That's not including the out of pocket cost you are responsible for until you meet your deductible.
28,FHLB New York,Awful!,2017-06-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- NYC and JC Office Locations are prime
- Fairly laid back environment
- Tons of opportunities to give back to the community","- Some of the Management - there are way too many political games played by the seasoned employees to keep their favorites progressing (no matter how bad) and keeping other talents back from moving up in the company. 
- Even when bad managers are apparent, they are not removed - they are simply moved around"
29,FHLB New York,Good experience,2016-12-09,4.0,Intern,"Friendly, great interdepartmental communication, work closely with fellow interns",Get ready to work if you're in the sales and marketing Dept. might seem dull after awhile

33,FHLB New York,"Decent bank, but not a very hard working or dynamic culture",2015-11-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Cushy job: benefits are disproportional to amount of work that people put in. Almost everyone leaves at 5.,Not a very fast-paced or dynamic culture. Understandable due to GSE status of bank. Very very behind on technology - can be hard to work with outdated stuff.
34,FHLB New York,Excellent opportunity for growth if you are motivated.,2015-08-13,4.0,Collateral,"Small company doing big business, growth opportunities, good work life balance.","Health benefits used to be great.
Some office politics. 
The coffee."

36,FHLB New York,Not the A-list,2015-06-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Nice location, hours not too bad.","Old technology.  People are nice at first but soon you find out that there is an unfriendly reality that will feel like highschool.  As is typically the case in financial institutions, there is no real training; you will be dumped on.  Pay is not great and promotions take a long time.  The scope of the business is very limited which limits opportunity to do something interesting."
37,FHLB New York,Look elsewhere.,2015-06-11,2.0,,"Most departments have a good work life balance
Nice location in the city. Overall there were a lot of nice people there but the few bad ones were truly bad and created a lot of problems and made it a miserable place after a while.","No room to move up, very little opportunity for career advancement 
Some really terrible Directors there who get away with treating employees very badly
Way behind in technology 
Low pay"
38,FHLB New York,Good benefits,2015-03-06,2.0,Anonymous,Great manager makes this place bearable. Working from home option is great as well.,The politics are ridiculous as mentioned by other reviewer. There are more people checking your work than people actually working. More concern is placed on having multitude of procedures. Advancement is hard to come by.
39,FHLB New York,The benefits are not worth the headache!,2015-03-02,1.0,Analyst,"Great benefits
Small firm leads to good exposure (which I liked)
Plenty of projects to keep you busy","Management!  - Most use their role to create a great working environment. Others do not! As a previous reviewer commented before, its all a facade until you start working there."

42,FHLB New York,Manager,2014-03-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Thought it would be a great mission oriented place to work at.,Turned out to be the most toxic environment to work at. Sr. Management would walk around trying to motivate people by threatening to fire them.  A hostile work environment was encouraged there.
43,FHLB New York,Good,2014-03-10,4.0,Analyst,Work/life balance is great. Great benefits,simple business model leads to limited mobility

Good benefits, including a defined benefit retirement plan in addition to a 401K.  Location is convenient to public transportation.  Training is available when needed.","Advancement tends to come slowly, and the process is too political.  The board of directors doesn't seem to value the employees, viewing them as an expense to be minimized."
46,FHLB New York,Everything moves in slow motion,2013-03-07,2.0,,"Great benefits including a pension plan
Low stress environment
Flexibility to work from home","This is a great place to work if you have no ambition to advance your career and you just want to ride it out and wait to retire.  There are many people in management that are waiting to retire and have given up completely on getting anything done.  This is understandable since they have been at the Bank for 20+ years and are worn out.  However, it presents a real challenge if you happen to work for one of these “checked-out” managers.  If you don’t want to become outdated you can’t stay at this organization for more that 2 – 3 years.  Also, for an organization that has less than 300 employees, the politics are ridiculous.  The politics at the Bank prevent anything from getting done."
47,FHLB New York,IT Intern,2012-11-06,4.0,,"- Worked directly with the VP of the department.
- My boss was readily accessible for a VP.
- Worked on a project as a rising college sophomore that was potentially going to be used internally within the company","- I did not have people I worked with outside of my boss, so if I was stuck with something and my boss was not around, I basically did nothing until he returned."
48,FHLB New York,Management made the job a nightmare!,2011-12-29,1.0,,The FHLB has good benefits and as an institution provides various morale boosting activities auch as the annual holiday party and the annual boat cruise or picnic.,"Unfortunately, local management's actions undermine everyone's morale. In a period of about five years at least ten officers and directors came and went. They either left due to the working environment, were forced out or were fired.  Non-officer exempt employees turned over at least once during the same period.  Management did not provide any leadership and was not particularly savvy in what was required to conform to the Bank's regulator guidelines.  Management used the annual review process to ""document"" performance deficiencies in order to preclude annual raises and bonuses.  Management did not responde in a timely fashion (sometimes weeks)  to reports submitted for review  them blamed the analyst for submitting a final report, which was ""documented"" by management.  This was by far the worst management that I have seen in many years of working in the financial industry."
49,FHLB New York,Satisfactory,2011-06-15,3.0,Mortgage Analyst III,Strong and successful GSA and great organization to work for.,The bonus compensation for professional non-officer staff is not as generous as for the officer staff.  Also opportunities for growth is sometimes difficult.
