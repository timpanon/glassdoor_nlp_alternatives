1,FX Alliance,Not bad,2015-12-08,3.0,QA Analyst,"For QA folks:
Steady stream of work
Reasonable balance between work life- since work is not overly challenging
A great place to work if you are NOT looking for challenges in your career or any sort of career growth
Middle management employees tend to stick around forever and rarely provide an opportunity for promotion by attrition.","One mans poison is another mans elixir.
The Pros mentioned above could be Huge Cons for some.
1For Functional Folks- You hit a plateau very soon and its a struggle to keep the motivation up since there is nothing much to learn .
2 Growth potential is very rare- and if you dont enjoy testing the same set of features or executing the same tests again and again - This is NOT the place for you.
