0,FX Concepts,CEO drove company into bankruptcy,2013-10-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Strong camaraderie amongst non-senior employees, good office space, convenient location, shower and gym in the office, large open dining area for employees","Management all in CEO's pocket, CEO living in his own reality, downwards momentum in morale and faith in CEO's ability, company heading towards bankruptcy, lack of direction from senior management"
1,FX Concepts,Great Company when at it's peak performance,2013-10-03,4.0,,"Great benefits, good corporate culture, great bonuses",Senior management became disconnected to the rest of the company
2,FX Concepts,MISMANAGEMENT AND POOR MONEY MANAGEMENT HAVE LED TO THE FIRM'S DEMISE,2013-09-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"When the company was at peak assets (> 14 bln) there were some pros but at $400 mln assets, there are no pros left.","At one time some employees thought the CEO was a charismatic, brilliant and generous man but now that the firm has gone nearly bust all of his faults have been exposed: he is a self serving and selfish man (bought himself a $22mln apartment with firm assets), zero leadership skills (after promising to sell said apartment as the firm continued its decline, he moved into his luxurious 5th Ave pad on the exact day that he laid off 20% of his staff), a poor money manager (firm has severely underperformed for the last several years and lost a majority of client assets), and has let his most promising employees leave the firm while holding onto his coterie of sycophants who support him even as the firm is crumbling day by day."
3,FX Concepts,A Once Thriving Company Now Teetering on Bankruptcy,2013-05-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Absent management which made for a lax working environment (a management consultant might consider this a con), wonderful hours, and some cool people (if you're not counting most of the management team,  that is). Pay was decent when the firm wasn't suffering from prolonged, abysmal performance of its funds.","Top-heavy with inept management that is clueless about the sentiment amongst the masses, the needs of its clients, and which is unable to effectively manage the company if their lives depended on it.  If the firm's dirty laundry (i.e, massively mis-managed finances) were aired, it is unlikely its few remaining clients would keep their money invested in the company's funds. The founder of the firm is aided and abetted in his mis-management of the firm by his brutish and clueless advisors who are kept on board for their loyalty, rather than their competence."
4,FX Concepts,This firm has hit rock bottom,2013-03-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"There is usually something good to say about an employer. However, this is one of those rare cases where there is nothing, the nice office maybe?","Five years ago this firm was one of the biggest hedge funds in the world. Turns out the firm was just lucky, now it is teetering on the brink of collapse. Anyone who can leave has left and the firm can't afford to replace them, instead ""promoting"" from within. The result, people are in jobs they are wholly unqualified to do. The research/trading team are all ex-IT support, and they're meant to turn the firm around? If investors knew who was managing their money....."
5,FX Concepts,Zero Stars for a Company with No Future,2013-03-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"In it's heyday, had some talented professionals, most of whom were not appreciated by management.  Also the company has a beautiful office, which it is now not in an economic position to afford.","Impotent, feckless, and borderline unethical management who are severely out of touch with the employees. The company is bleeding any remaining talent and any remaining investors. Rotten culture."
6,FX Concepts,Do not work for this company,2013-03-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Everyone leaves by 5pm as no one is motivated anymore.,"This firm has been losing clients, staff, and money. The only employees left are those who can't find employment elsewhere. Salaries are being cut, benefits are going, and there hasn't been a bonus in years.
