0,Federal Standard Abstract,Micromanagment Company,2022-03-10,1.0,Title Administrator,"1. If your really into the real estate industry, this place might be for you. 

2. If you need a starting job, this place is decent. Expect a lot of independency with bare minimum training.

3. If you want to stay for short-term, sure. But, long-term, think again.","1. Horrible benefit and salary

2. There are eyes and ears on the wall, be careful of your surroundings.

3. Expect High turnovers, especially since people come and go all the time, since they found something better.

4. Don't expect a good starting salary.

5. They don't increase your salary if you have a lot of workload, they only increase if you ask and have the knowledge and experience.

6. They dump the workload on you expecting you to understand with minimum training.

7. Top of the Management is tolerable, but people in HR aren't. 

8. Don't expect IT to fix things faster, they don't even have a query ticket system. Its old-fashioned phone calls, they will forget about you, till you call back to remind them again."

5,Federal Standard Abstract,Must speak Chinese,2020-11-19,1.0,Front Desk Receptionist,people can be nice and caring,can be overworked and repetitive
6,Federal Standard Abstract,Do NOT work here unless you are absolutely desperate.,2019-09-08,1.0,,Literally none; the promises you got from the interview will not be honored at all.,"The firm is run by a group of narrow minded Cantonese Chinese with a mindset that employees are slaves of the company. Your supervisor will time how many times you use bath room and how long you are in it. Clearly, 7 mins is too long. The only way to fit in is that you speak Cantonese; otherwise please find other places to work. 

For attorneys; 

This is a title abstract company that does not need an attorney in theory. They hire because the senior staff in the firm doesn’t understand U.S. legal system and how to work with attorneys. They need someone to fight with other real estate attorneys who questioned their work products. Unfortunately most of the claims are true b/c the staff prepare the products has limited knowledgeable about real estate transaction and legal system. The experience you can get as an attorney here is very limited, and they definitely do not respect you as a legal professional. The only reason this firm exists is because Chinese immigrants love buying real estate properties; otherwise this place will close within 6 months. 

And never ever believe the crap they say that they will train you if you don’t have relative experience. The training lasts about 3 hours; then they expect you function as if you have 3 years experience. 

For non-attorneys; 

If you speak Cantonese, you have a chance to stay if you don’t mind being treated as a slave for 3 months. 

If you don’t speak Cantonese, this place is a hell. 

If you only speak English, as long as you can bear the horrible benefit package and being isolated by the rest of the team, you will be fine. 
That’s all."
7,Federal Standard Abstract,Micromanagement and gossipy,2019-08-21,1.0,Administrative Assistant,Nice building and occasional refreshments. FSA & Associates are all very friendly and nice.,The office is way too gossipy. Everyone on the 8th floor has passive aggressive behavior and will make unnecessary degrading comments at you. Everyone on the 8th floor is straight up disrespectful and will always yell at you or give you a hard time.
8,Federal Standard Abstract,extremely micromanaged but still fallen apart,2019-07-18,1.0,Front Desk Receptionist,"Very nice environment, FSA & Associates coworkers are all nice and friendly.","Hard to fit in because there are drama groups with their own clicks. Everyone kicks football with job responsibilities. Front desk gets blamed whether doing job correctly or not just because higher-ups are having a stressful day... Some are very rude to coworkers thinking the new ones can be abused (Cantonese Chinese mentality). And you wonder why people come and go every month... If you're hired and started working, watch the 8th floor, and good luck."
