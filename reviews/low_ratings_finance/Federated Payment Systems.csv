0,Federated Payment Systems,Not a great place to work for,2022-01-20,2.0,Sales,"Ok pay
Always had hours
Lots of spiff type bonuses",Bad management and setup of company. Operates under multiple names to operate ina. Shady way towards its customers
1,Federated Payment Systems,Stay away,2018-03-13,1.0,Sales Associate,Very few pros I can think of--parking spot?,"Horrible and rude managers.  High turnover, no respect or a care for employees.  All the positive reviews are written by current employees-AND YOU CAN GUARANTEE THEY DID NOT WRITE THEM OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF THEIR HEART-they even scam Glassdoor"
2,Federated Payment Systems,Less than ideal pay but an enjoyable job and atmosphere,2018-01-23,4.0,Merchant Support Representative,"Good work environment, management works with you to help solve issues. You are given the tools you need to succeed and I never was afraid to talk to the managers about most of the obstacles I dealt with if necessary. Helping merchants that need assistance and are sometimes grateful can be a rewarding experience.","Dealing with angry and sometimes disrespectful merchants on the phone. Some of the online systems used to look up crucial processing information do not function ideally and can make searching for info more difficult than it has to be. Anytime one system is replaced by another one that is supposed to be better, it ends up being worse than the previous one. Also the pay is lower than at other companies doing the same work."
3,Federated Payment Systems,Opportunity filled with rejections.,2017-07-05,2.0,Telemarketer,Managers close your leads. You have sick days.,Loads of rejection. High layover rate.
4,Federated Payment Systems,Don't Work Here - You've Been Warned.,2017-06-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,People you work WITH are nice (as opposed to the people you work FOR who are not).,"So many: Dishonest with employees. Selling a bill of goods that will never materialize. Horrible boss. Turn, churn and burn operation. Anyone, anytime for anything (real or imagined) can be fired on a dime. Sales reps get no salary then are nickel and dimed on commission. Customers treated as horribly as staff."
5,Federated Payment Systems,Call center,2017-05-24,1.0,,There really are none at all,The pay. The culture. The team leads. The CEO
6,Federated Payment Systems,This place is a joke,2017-05-22,2.0,Telemarketer,"You get paid $15 a hr that's about it. The cafe down stairs ""Deluxe Cafe"" has good food and the people that work there are always nice and pleasant.","The data is horrible. When you dispose the calls it doesn't work properly. You dispose a company ""not interested"" or ""do not dail"" and it still comes back up the next day. You call the same people everyday no new data."
7,Federated Payment Systems,An objective review of Federated Payment Systems,2016-02-24,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Listens to employee concerns.  Encourages workers to strive for excellence.  Asks how they can improve processes.  Develops employees through directed coaching and feedback.  Empowers agents to do the right thing.  Recognized strong performance.,Evaluates changes fully before implementing revisions to policy and procedure.
8,Federated Payment Systems,Every Man for Himself!,2016-01-19,1.0,Customer Service Tech Support (Canada),"Good starting salary - paid 3 week training. Co-workers try to be friendly and helpful to newcomers.
Manager for the Canada section is very nice when not in ""work mode"".","Too fast paced(for me) !Should have a longer training period. three is WAY too much material to learn in just 3 weeks! I worked for Federated for 4 months and needed more help and support than they were willing to give. you have to be a human sponge to retain the information and apply it. the same day the training was finished I shadowed a co-worker on Live calls; very intimidating, no practice!  Also, you BETTER TAKE NOTES ON ANY AND EVERYTHING! YOU WILL ONLY BE GIVEN ASSISTANCE ON A LIMITED BASIS. Your co-workers will be too busy to help you; thrown to the wolves! plus if you are helped and something goes wrong, it will be denied and you will be blamed! The ""new guy"" did it! I felt like I just another body just .to make them money. Nothing done to improve yourself. In essence you MUST be a self starter or pretend to be. not a good experience..."
9,Federated Payment Systems,Call center rep,2015-12-17,3.0,Call Center,"Easy money, help with closing appointments. A lot of games to try to keep it a fun atmosphere.","Unpaid days off. Works on a point system... You always need to be covering your back. If you're sick for more than a day, you risk suspension no matter how good you are."
10,Federated Payment Systems,FYI,2015-10-28,2.0,,I do not have one,Corporate office is very difficult to deal with
11,Federated Payment Systems,Stressful,2015-04-14,1.0,Regional Manager,Worked with nice people. NOT UPPER MANAGEMENT,This company is a scam. The owner should be in prison along with the Vice President. They totally keep Managers for 3 months and get rid if them so they do not have to pay benefits. They rip off the sales reps so they do not have to pay commission.  I can't believe this company is still in business
12,Federated Payment Systems,Terrible work experience.,2015-02-08,1.0,Account Executive,"No Pros, just losers that should be exposed by the truth.",The management are all cons. Preset appointments sent me on fruitless sales calls to people that didn't exist. Management were worse than used car salesman.
13,Federated Payment Systems,Stay away!,2015-02-06,1.0,Sales,Nice and helpful coworkers. They were always willing to answer questions and assist you in any way possible.,"I worked in a sales role. Management has unrealistic expectations of all sales roles regarding quotas, number of daily phone calls, etc. Not much guidance and many demands. Very high turnover rate at all levels from telemarketers to regional sales managers. Several people would last a day or two and quit."
14,Federated Payment Systems,hell every day but i was a good talker,2015-02-01,2.0,Telemarketer,"good pay, good co workers that were willing to help new people.",you get cursed out basically all day everyday. and if you dont make your quota the company just tosses you away.they expect you to learn a 20 page script in two to three days word for word. if you stray from the script they discipline you even if your way works and gets the client to agree.
15,Federated Payment Systems,Short lived,2015-01-22,3.0,,Great people. Good supervisor.  Vibrant environment,Turn over rate. Not enough coaching
16,Federated Payment Systems,Hot and cold company,2014-12-08,2.0,Collections Manager,If you need a job quickly they will hire you.,"Favoritism is this company's standard operating procedure. This is a company that will pay you a holiday bonus in your first year and deny it the next year, due to an intent to resign, regardless of contributions made to the company. This is a company that will terminate you after many years of service and add insult to injury by attempting to block unemployment benefits. Use a job working here only as a stepping stone to something better, NOT a career."
17,Federated Payment Systems,Sales,2014-12-03,2.0,Sales,It has potential to do better if under new management and sales leadership.,Company leaders disrespects employees on a regular basis. Moral ethics are compromised often. Management needs more training on how to manage a team. And advance sales weekly meeting are at a novice level to say the least. Try working on a planned sales meeting and stick to the particular subject to cover. Your all over the place. No true structure to the discussion.
18,Federated Payment Systems,I liked it there. They always paid me and I was treated well.,2014-10-16,4.0,Manager,I never had to fear that I wasn't going to get paid. People got fired a lot but it was for their own stupidity or lack of work ethic. If you're loyal to them then you'll go far.,The appointments weren't the best but that's the same at any company. NO time off AT ALL. The pay was very low.
19,Federated Payment Systems,I hated working hear because everything was so crazy in the office. No since of peace in work place.,2014-10-11,1.0,Customer Service Agent,"Great Incentive Plan

Mon-Fri(40 hrs)

OK beneifits","Long Hours

Aggy Customers

Low Pay

Noisy workplace"
20,Federated Payment Systems,Embarrassed to have this company on my resume now.,2014-07-19,1.0,Executive Level,None anymore. Greed has changed this company.,"They always say it's you. But what's always the common denominator? They are. Ask them who the two managers that accounted for almost all of their growth between 2007-2013 were. The same two, and only two, managers to stem from this organization with an impeccable reputation in the industry. The same two that set almost every company record. Even these two have been deleted from the records and forgotten about. All because they wanted to advance their careers as young business men. 

When an employee almost dies after being found the next morning, blood soaked in an elevator, after using drugs and alcohol in the  office  after hours, you must believe something is wrong.

As a former employee of this organization for MANY YEARS at an executive level, believe me when I say, ""do your research."" Not only have I had a professional relationship with this organization, I have also had an extensive personal relationship with the individuals that run this company. In the end, I was treated just like everyone else was; disposable.

No matter how good you are, how much revenue you earn them, how hard you work for them, It will come to an end and they will fabricate anything to put the blame on the other party. This is a company who fired 20+ employees, just hours before a company Christmas party. This is a company who intentionally cuts off residual payments. This is a company who will [and has] take away the livelihood of the most loyal of employees.  All because they are greedy. One owner says it best with his famous line, ""My kids eat first.""

This company even went as far as to fire the #1 sales manager for the past 5 years, via a phone call from home, while the employee was at his desk working to earn this company more. This is a manager who has accounted for over 10,000 of their existing clients. All over a rumor that this individual was looking to advance his career else ware after he was told he would never be promoted further. Furthermore, they attempted to slander his name across the company after his dismissal rather than resolving the matter privately. This is an employee who would work 65+ hour weeks with no overtime; fueled by his dedication to the company. 

They will attempt to discredit you: They will hypocritically denounce you. Calling you irresponsible, dishonest, or disloyal. 

Then they use lines like:  Just another case of a rep who cant close Just a guy mad that he cant sell -  You violated your agreement ( usually based on fabricated info)  to rebuttal any reviews like these.

If you're a sale rep, they will tell you: We can't set appointments in your area anymore, its a bad area. (this is how they get you to perform below your contract requirements so they don't have to pay you anymore)

The bottom line at this company is the bottom dollar. I understand free enterprise, I appreciate capitalism, and yes I was part of this organization for a very long time. 

Just remember EVERYONE IS DISPOSABLE at this company.

21,Federated Payment Systems,The most unprofessional and backwards company I have ever worked for....EVER,2014-03-12,1.0,Sales Manager,"you need a quick check....they hire anything with a pulse.  Their motto is ""throw Sh*t against the wall and see what sticks""","the service you are attempting to sell is built off of lies and deceit.  The sign merchants up with promises and never meet them, then charge their merchants to cancel.  UNFAIR"
22,Federated Payment Systems,SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM.. STAY AWAY... Dont fall for it.,2014-02-24,1.0,Sales,Nothing to think of maybe nice ppl to work with,"They are also knows as US bankcard, National Debit card Network, Volt Payments all a scam!!!

They treat all the employees very bad. No room for growth. The company is falling apart fast. The upper management will send you home with no pay for no reason. The list goes on and on. Whatever you do DO NOT WORK HERE YOUR LIFE WILL BE MISERABLE."
23,Federated Payment Systems,takes advantage of hardworking employees,2013-06-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"there were very few pros being employed by this company, the business was ran very unprofessionally and those in a position of power were uninterested in the well being of the employees and customers alike. The only pro of working for this company was being able to learn the ins and outs of the business and credit card processing terminals.","upper management is completely uninterested in the well being of the employees, this is most definitely a dead end job with little or no room for growth regardless of how hard working or dedicated you may be as an employee. when advanced positions are available in the company, in most cases upper management will choose to hire outside for the position rather than promoting employees who have been working toward advancement."
24,Federated Payment Systems,NOT Worth it,2013-01-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,None to be discussed here,"Stay away from this place.  I believe the positive reviews on this site has been written or better forced by the management team.   You will never see you commissions, they do no to disclose how they can rig the sale so that you will not see the commission. As promised.  The company does pays the merchant 48 hs or more after the transaction has processed; but you must make sure your customer passes Federal Credit Check...  Do not fell for the preset appointments... those are customers  not around anymore..."
25,Federated Payment Systems,Worst Work Experience of My Life - Beware and Read the Reviews- Not the ones they wrote,2013-01-01,1.0,Sales Manager,Nice out front recruiting person,"Not an honest opportunity. They provide preset appointments that had me calling on people that were dead for years, had not been contacted and approved, businesses that were closed or in locations that were not safe and dangerous to be. It cost me about $1300 in 2 months. Complete waste of time and money. Management were deceptive and evasive."
26,Federated Payment Systems,Probably the best overall company I have ever worked for,2012-05-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Co-workers are friendly.  Salary is great to start out.  Career advancement is available for those willing to stay focused and work hard.  It feels great to not be a “number” like other companies.,You work hard but the rewards are there so I guess this is not really a con.  I am pleased overall and honestly do not have anything bad to say about it.
27,Federated Payment Systems,"Federated is devoted to educating business owners on low cost,secure debit/credit card processing & business development",2012-05-22,5.0,,"Federated taught me more about merchant services and business to business sales in 5 months, than I learned in 4 years in the industry. Full training provided (webinar and in house) by a management team that worked their way up and actually understood the industry and market",Extremely fast paced environment. Several leads coming in from various sources so if you don't manager your time your sure to fall behind
28,Federated Payment Systems,GREAT COMPANY!   I discovered internal skills i never knew i had that makes me successful.,2012-05-18,5.0,NY Telemarketing,Federated Payments showed me how important good leadership really is. They provided me with all of the tools i need to be successful both in my work life. The management team here at Federated always helps no matter what the problem is. A great thing about Federated is that management team never puts me down for not understanding certain things and they patiently work with me to handle all tasks at hand. What I love most about Federated is that each call is a fresh start and a new opportunity to perform.,The only real con to working for Federated Payments is really the pressure I put on myself. All day long they connect me to business owners and that mean money in my pocket and when i cant close one i get very hard on myself.
29,Federated Payment Systems,It's a great place to work!,2012-05-18,5.0,,"Good pay, great benefits.  It's a fun place to work.  Lots of interesting people work at Federated.  Conveniently located.  I have seen people around me get promoted in a few months","Late start, 9:00 or 9:30.  Office temperature is a little hot sometimes, especially in the summer.  Cafeteria downstairs is a little pricey."
