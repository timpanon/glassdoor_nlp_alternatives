0,Festina Lente,Santiago Calatrava Architectural Firm,2010-02-19,1.0,Intermediate Architect,"Amazing Architect, interesting, challenging work.  Co-workers are very intelligent.  These are all the good reasons to work at Calatrava, but there is little else.","No respect by management for worker health and longevity.  Never a thank you.  No sense of appreciation whatsoever.  90 + hour work weeks.  Very few days off - this includes weekends!  Continuous false deadlines.  Really sad, because, the work in itself is exciting."
