0,Financial Network Investment,Disappointed,2017-04-16,2.0,Recruiter,People were very nice and helpful. Office environment was professional.  Always clean. There was no clock watching. They didn't micro manage. They allowed me to have a team work for me with the On-boarding process.,Management wasn't good.  Didn't really want to hire. Made my job very difficult.  The only reason management was trying to bring Advisors in was because Cetera the mother company wanted them to expand.  They fought against it.
