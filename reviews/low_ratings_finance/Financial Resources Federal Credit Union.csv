6,Financial Resources Federal Credit Union,"Executive Management cares about employees, what’s working, and what’s not",2019-03-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I’ve been with the company for a few months but am surprised by all the negative reviews. No company is the perfect place to work but I have to say that I’ve never worked for an Executive Team that cares so much about their employees, whats working well at the Credit Union and what’s not working/the challenges. 
No, the CEO may not be in the office all the time but she shouldn’t need to be, what CEO is? The CEO has other responsibilities to take care of outside of the office and has hired people to run the organization when she’s not there. 
The Credit Union offers flexible working arrangements for just about all back office staff, 401k with match, good PTO, paid holidays, volunteer opportunities, etc.",A lot of work to do....but that is what we are there to do.
7,Financial Resources Federal Credit Union,"Poor leadership, setting everyone up to fail",2019-01-30,1.0,Consumer Loan Processor,"Federal Paid Holidays
Community Volunteer Opportunites

You can be an absentee CEO and still have your personal vehicle financed by the company","The previous reviews say it all: sky high turnover rate, absent Senior Leadership, unattainable expectations, antiquated technology, zero training, no room for growth, BURN OUT

Unprofessional CEO, inadvertently copying staff members on gossip emails. The average employee does not last more than 3 months. There are simultaneous vacancies of three department heads, the inability to retain quality staff due to burn out is self explanatory. Training is non existent, you are thrown to the wolves expected to teach yourself. Technology is comparable to a 90s dialup setup, forget about supporting an entire institution, a financial institution at that...comforting. 9-5 is more like 9 to 7, 7:30 or 8pm.

All around terrible culture."
8,Financial Resources Federal Credit Union,Relationship specialist,2019-01-01,2.0,Anonymous Employee,My branch manger and assistant manager are probably the best this company has.,"Loan servicing is a key way we make revenue and it’s so disorganized it unbearable
The technology is trash, like think of the stone ages that’s FRFCU. 
They expect us to do 110% but the technology can’t even support 50% of what we need to accomplish. 
“Daura”
*Sell more credit cards*
The payments system is so antiquated it’s sad, they point/rewards are out right depressing. 
We can not compete with anyone other intuition with these junk credit cards. 
Stop trying to push something you wouldn’t even put In you wallet....."
9,Financial Resources Federal Credit Union,Wrong Place To Work,2018-12-29,1.0,Member Service Representative,PTO and meet nice people. You get holidays off. Nice break room.,The challenge is losing a lot of hard workers due poor management and leadership skills. The whole place needs to revamped starting with the CEO and then loan servicing department. CEO and CFO has no people skills. No Training department and the systems are old. CEO is barely in.
10,Financial Resources Federal Credit Union,loyalty and good work are meaningless,2018-12-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"401-k, paid time off, location","Loyal employees with years of good work ethics and essential knowledge of how the business works get replaced by people with a lesser “title” that are expected to perform at the same level as the person they are replacing.  There tends to be a two-faced, double-standard when it comes to recognizing and rewarding hard-working employees and this type of management style creates a toxic, mistrusting environment."

Moral is low"

13,Financial Resources Federal Credit Union,Revolving door,2018-11-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,PTO..sometimes work from home. Met some cool team members.,Low pay and minimal increases. Many people very unhappy and left or looking to leav. Better opportunities with career advancement out there. Morale is low and leadership oblivious to all of it. Turnover at all time and we get stuck doing all the work while replacements can’t be found.
14,Financial Resources Federal Credit Union,A nice place to work,2018-11-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good PTO, all federal holidays are given, good work/life balance with work from home option for much of the staff, medical benefits are affordable and provide good coverage, excellent 401K program, everyone is very nice and welcoming, does a lot of good work for the community and local charities.","Growing pains, But nothing that can't be worked through! Not a lot of room for advancement in a small company but, they are working on that with developing career paths. I would still prefer to work for a smaller company than a much larger bank."

The turnover rate is extremely high, and for obvious reasons. Terrible work environment. High stress"
17,Financial Resources Federal Credit Union,Dysfunctional at best,2017-09-06,1.0,Msr,"PTO is generous and the staff is good.  There aren't to many other pros for this company, certainly not job security","Senior management, especially CEO and CFO.  Irrational, unprofessional.  Absentee CEO (maybe there 20% of the time) and CFO is the definition of wrong management.  All of the good leaders have left and the wrong leaders are what's left"
18,Financial Resources Federal Credit Union,Only the Strong Survive!,2017-03-07,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great people. The environment is very fast-paced. You must be really good at what you do and able to multi-task & communicate effectively. If you thrive in that type of culture, you will do well.",None that I can think of at the moment.
19,Financial Resources Federal Credit Union,"Horrible Morale, Bad Leadership",2015-09-06,1.0,Branch Supervisor,"Convenient Location, Long-Established Credit Union, Flexible work hours available for the summer, good match on the 401k plan if you take advantage of it.","Horrible morale goes from the CEO and CFO down. There people are given preferential treatment. Medical benefits are very costly for coverage. Low (if any) pay raises. Almost never close for bad weather putting employees lives in danger. CEO is never there and when she is, all hell breaks loose. Very unprofessional."
