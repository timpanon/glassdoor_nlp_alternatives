0,Financial Technologies Forum,A Horror Show,2018-04-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I made good industry connections at the events who I am still I touch with and have gained professional opportunities from to this day.,"Verbally abusive. It is a tiny office of 5 people and management curses at and screams at people both on the phone and in person. The women in charge particularly have a toxic, antiquated idea of how younger women should look, and they berate female employees (never the men) for how their clothing fits their bodies, how their shoes match their outfits, for yawning, for saying ""cool"" or ""totally"" to a client on the phone, or ""yeah"" instead of ""yes, etc. A very unhealthy work environment with a terrible pay for being expected to be onsite for (and sometimes travel out of the country for) each event, 6am-11pm. 

Also, there is no “HR” to speak of...you are instructed to IM  one of the owner's family relatives on Skype who lives in a different state. For real."
