1,First Atlantic,Agency,2022-01-05,4.0,Hha/Caregiver,Great pay and great clientel,Long shifts and far travel
2,First Atlantic,Incompetent,2021-10-05,1.0,Senior Manager,Not too far from the beach,"Horrible CEO who has no vision but cutting costs, as well as having no care or empathy for any employee. 

Example - Actually having an employee go out and pull weeds because the CEO wouldn't pay the landscaper...that really happened. One example of many."
3,First Atlantic,Good job for young people,2021-04-28,2.0,Member Care Associate,Chill environment and decent hours,"Hardly any training, not too serious about COVID. Everyone talks bad about each other"
4,First Atlantic,Terrible,2020-02-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Non- management employees are great, that's all.","Promotions are based on who you work for, not on knowledge of the job or anything else a promotion should be based upon. Some managers are down right disrespectful bc of their  relationship with the CEO. CEO is cheap and does not pay people according to position or title. If you are not senior management,  you will be under paid, with supplies and a chair that is broken.."
5,First Atlantic,Absolutely the Worst Place To Work-Don't Work Here If You Want To Be Happy-Look Elsewhere,2019-10-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The only 'pro' to this company is it's non-management employees. They are great.,"Dirty workplace, old and broken furniture, OSHA would have a field day with this place, lack of supplies, lack of computer tools to get the job done, Incompetent Senior Management, Bullying tactics, Long Hours, Intimidation tactics, Hostile Work Environment, No Training, Culture of being mean to employees, Management is incompetent, Unusually high amount of money given to Board Members, Sr Management has an ""Us and Them"" mentality. The President is a grumpy old man who needs to retire. Sr Management tries to give lunches and food to employees but no tools to get their work done....a twisted sense of logic, and a disorganized management approach to anything and everything."

7,First Atlantic,Love it!,2018-10-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Everyone works well together. CEO is very approachable. Hard work gets recognized.,I think one meeting a month would be sufficient.
8,First Atlantic,Undervalued,2018-10-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The only pros I’d say were the coworkers in my store.,"Underpaid and overworked. In my store my manager has to work well over 50 hours per week, open to close without assistance. This goes for the teller staff as well. In other locations the managers only work 20/25 hours and make their employees cover all the shifts while at the gym and 2 hour lunch breaks. What they call training is a joke. What they call teamwork is a joke. The HR department is a joke. Confidentiality doesn’t exist. You’re hired and told to follow a career plan to be later told you need a degree to be a teller."
9,First Atlantic,Mca,2018-10-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Can’t think of anything other than the few people I worked with,The place should be shut down. They don’t follow any banking regulations. The CEO is a joke. Upper management is a joke. The entire company is a big joke.
