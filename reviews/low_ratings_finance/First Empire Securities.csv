6,First Empire Securities,yikes,2018-08-03,1.0,Various,nice office with new desks and windows.  People seem nice at first but you are either in or out.,violation of many employment laws.  Boss would stand at door at 5pm and tell people that if they leave they may not have a desk tomorrow.  Boiler Room Tactics.  How is this place still in business I have no idea.  Cheat clients and employees.  Maybe watched Wall Street and Billions too many times.
7,First Empire Securities,SEEK ELSEWHERE,2018-02-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's a pro if you are a former baseball player, family or family member of management,  like to be micro-managed or remain stagnant in your career.","Sales training is sub-par at best.  Absolutely no job growth. Every department manager is home grown.  Resistant to change but will claim different.  Don't expect praise, a raise or any kind of additional compensation. Horrible morale!"
8,First Empire Securities,Great Company,2018-02-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work-life balance, wall street feel on Long Island, great connections, open to internal growth on sales floor.",Expensive benefits plans although there are several options

11,First Empire Securities,Terrible Organization,2018-01-31,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Beautiful building, great cafeteria, good parking",Awful management & some backstabbing coworkers
12,First Empire Securities,Wow - just wow. Do not consider this firm.,2018-01-26,1.0,Manager,"They have bathrooms, lighting and heat.  Good deli downstairs.",YOU ARE DISPOSABLE - point blank. It doesn't matter if you produce extraordinary amounts of revenue. You could show up on time every day and show the utmost loyalty. If the wind blows North you are gone without a real explanation.  Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse...new management with the same lousy management style.
13,First Empire Securities,Anonymous,2017-02-22,2.0,Anonymous,"Nice building, cool coworkers, management is generous during sick days.",Dead end facility. Very little opportunity for anyone who is new. Training didn't start until new guys were 10 months in.

17,First Empire Securities,Ops,2015-11-04,4.0,Operations,Great work environment. Nice workers.,Need more room to grow.
18,First Empire Securities,All for one! One for all!,2015-10-03,5.0,Sales Strategist,"Everyone there will do anything they can to help you succeed! Because it all comes back to help them in the end. It's an ESOP, if one does well, we all do well. $$.  I don't know what happened in the past to former employees but it has been great working here and the business is growing! Everyone gets to leave at 5 every day so there is great work/life balance.",There are no cons about working here. Can honesty say it's the best of all the places I interviewed/considered.
19,First Empire Securities,I'm happy here,2015-07-17,5.0,Administrative,"Is the firm going through changes. Yes. Did we have some struggles over the past few years. Yes. Does Management care enough to try to change that. Yes. Some people cannot be pleased no matter what you do. I make a good salary, get to leave at 5:00 everyday and am never expected to work overtime. The location is close to my home, my coworkers are great to work with and my Manager is patient and fair with me. In the end the employees benefit most since it is an employee owned firm.",I have none. Some people are Debbie Downers. This place is really not as bad as others portray it to be.
20,First Empire Securities,Horrible Company,2015-05-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are none!!!! I have no STAR rating to give them at all. But stay away from this Ma & Pop company. There are better financial companies on Long Island and in New York to work for.,"Micro managed, extremely petty, very jealous if you have class and skills, no room for growth.

21,First Empire Securities,I feel like I made the right move,2015-04-23,4.0,Sales,I was on the fence to join this company due to some of these reviews but I'm now glad that I made the switch to First Empire. I've developed some great working relationships and growth opportunities are everywhere. If you have a strong sales background I recommend this firm for an exciting career. Big money to be made. Work-life balance is great. 16 either early close or fully closed holidays.,Benefits aren't terrible but could be better. Reporting structure has changed since the company has become an employee owned firm. Less autonomy for managers. A little micromanaging at times. Vacation time not great.

23,First Empire Securities,"Good Pay, good team of strategist and direct access to the trading desk.",2015-01-07,3.0,Bond Broker,When I was there they paid you a salary for the first 2 years as you ramped up and built  your client base.  You can go to commission before that if you are bringing in more money. Get all the holidays the bond markets get.  Have a team that you can go to for the analytics and help you present it as a team.,"No real autonomy here, feel like you are being watched a lot of the time. Treat you like you are in high school part of the time.  No room to grow.  Wanted a little bit more of a work/life balance."
24,First Empire Securities,An offensive environment to work.,2014-11-30,4.0,Financial Consultant,There were no pros about this company,Offensive to women.  Abusive. Lack of respect. They only treat people well if they keep their secrets. They can't handle competition. They go out of their way to hurt anyone that takes business away from them. They act professional but they are everything but professional.
25,First Empire Securities,"The interview process conveys a very professional institution, this couldn't be further from the truth.  This is nothing but a boiler room dressed up",2014-10-30,1.0,,I have nothing good to say about,To many to list - the client's best interest comes way behind the best interest of the company

28,First Empire Securities,Avoid at this company at all cost,2014-05-04,1.0,Analyst,"Great healthcare benefits 
Retirement plan matching 
Work/Life Balance","Terrible compensation  and low salary.  Office politics and soul crushing bureaucracy.  Poor communication from management regarding assignments.  Company is paranoid and secretive, and doesn't trust its employees even those that have been there for years.   Every decision no matter how trivial requires the approval of several senior managers.  Good luck on getting approval for anything."
29,First Empire Securities,Solid Firm with good sales training.,2014-02-05,3.0,Vice President,Very conveniently located on Long Island.  Excellent Financial Analyst teams to help you sell to institutional clients.,"Very long hours, with inconsistent management.  If sales are up, everyone is happy and treated well.  Once sales dip a little bit, management hastily starts to crack down on everyone."
