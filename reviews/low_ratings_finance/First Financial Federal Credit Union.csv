4,First Financial Federal Credit Union,Don’t do it,2018-11-06,1.0,Teller,-great co workers... that’s about it,"Everything
Poor management from the top
Impulse decisions made no sense
Constantly worked alone
High turnover (rare to find someone who lasts more than 6 months)


We were working with low staff and management didn’t care to ask us how we were actually doing...... just complained about long lines even though you were working alone.
No perks at all for part time
No opportunity to grow in company
Treat employees like crap
Immediately blame employees without consulting them on their side of the story"
5,First Financial Federal Credit Union,"Stressful, no work/life balance, difficult core system,",2018-03-21,1.0,Financial Services Consultant,The benefits Offered i.e Health & dental insurance were competitive. Most of the co workers in the back office were friendly and knowledgeable.,Many cons. Employees are made to feel appreciated. The pay is a joke for what’s expected from employees in both retail branch and back office. Not enough detailed training on the Extremely dated & difficult core system. Staff Turnover is ridiculous so there’s never enough coverage to handle the teller line and desk. There are many different accounts/products that are confusing for members and staff.

8,First Financial Federal Credit Union,"Great benefits, knowledgeable back office staff and management",2017-08-16,4.0,Financial Service Consultant,Upper management is always available to answer any questions.

There seems to be a lot of Staff turnover.
9,First Financial Federal Credit Union,Good place if you are positive,2015-12-27,3.0,,"Small company so executive management is readily available.
HR Department strict but open to listening, and very proactive.
The people who work there are wonderful.","There can be cliques/clashes between corporate and branches.
It's a not-for-profit so don't expect to get paid well.
Sometimes morale gets low."
