0,First Financial Northwest,Thank You  -  IT Department !,2022-02-15,5.0,Market Manager,"Gratitude and appreciation to the entire IT Department at FFNWB, who has been a lifeline for me as we navigate through personnel changes, technology updates, inventory and taking the time and pride to make sure everything is working to the standard of our company culture.","No, not at this time."
1,First Financial Northwest,Adapting and Growing,2022-02-10,4.0,Assistant Vice President,"I began working here during the pandemic, when employee moral at every company was at an all-time low. This bank is adapting to the changing working needs of staff and is culturally thriving. I work with a diverse and kind group of people who are the true definition of a team.",Renton road construction may never end.
2,First Financial Northwest,I am very happy here,2022-02-04,5.0,Manager,Most managers here really care about the employees and are always looking for ways to improve. Pay and benefits are very good as well as higher than average PTO accrual. I feel like I have good work/life balance and have a lot of freedom to do my job without being micro-managed. I also like that we support charities and are able to give back and the bank encourages it. I have always been proud to work here.,"I don't really have anything bad to say. The bank has been a really good place to work. COVID has been a challenge, but the bank has made every effort to help us through it and adapt to it."
3,First Financial Northwest,Opportunity for Growth,2022-01-28,5.0,Assistant Vice President Relationship Manager,"Decent benefits,& compensation. Amazing co-workers and a fast environment.","Understaffed, Long hours, high goals, unexplainable incentive plan."
4,First Financial Northwest,Legacy Institution Struggling to Adapt to Purposefully Rapid Growth,2021-12-10,2.0,Retail Relationship Manager,"Base pay is decent for most positions. Retail branches are only open Monday through Friday, so minimal work requirements on weekends for retail staff. Autonomy to create strategies to grow the business in your own market. Work-life balance is decent.","Corporate Culture lacks any focus other than growth. Employees are not recognized as assets. There is no training program. Autonomy verges on dropping teams into the deep end to figure things out on their own. Executive Management doesn't demonstrate any positive Leadership qualities. Incentive Plans are inconsistent and appear as an undesirable expense to management. The focus on running an efficient business is important, but there is a difference between running a business efficiently and running a business with too few people to create a positive environment for employees."
5,First Financial Northwest,Culture all time low,2021-08-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Bank Holidays and PTO are pretty nice.,Culture in the company has turned for the worse. To focus on cutting corners that there is no more enjoyment in going to work. From traditions as department decors during holidays to the occasional company parties. All but gone. Even before covid it was already leaning on going away. Absolutely shameful how the company really took a turn for the worse.
6,First Financial Northwest,No stability and constant restructuring,2021-07-08,1.0,Loan Document Specialist,"Other staff members, good pay, benefits","There has been a massive amount of turnover in loan ops, a mix of people resigning and being fired. This has led to multiple attempts to restructure the department, which have failed. They have, in succession, hired 5 different managers within the last few years. 4 were bullies, 1 who was not, and was well liked by the staff, was let go due to refusal to bully the team."
7,First Financial Northwest,Toxic Mid Level/Senior Management,2021-07-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Just about the only thing I enjoyed about this place were my direct teammates and the work itself.,"SUPER toxic management, severe lack of employee appreciation (company wide), severe nepotism both internally and with external vendors."
8,First Financial Northwest,Ok,2021-05-28,3.0,Loan Servicing Specialist,Time off accumulation is good,Rather not say anything about it
9,First Financial Northwest,No accountability,2021-04-26,3.0,Loan Servicing Specialist,Great benefits and managers of other departments,"No accountability to the customers, no one takes responsibility"
10,First Financial Northwest,Managers' Behavior Repulsive,2021-04-14,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Employee Stock Ownership Plan and casual Fridays.,This place is great only if you have a good manager.
11,First Financial Northwest,Good people; upper management has room for improvement,2021-04-07,2.0,Lending,Lots of knowledgeable people with great ideas and motivation to improve practices and procedures. Close knit group with many long term employees.,"Available technology didn’t promote efficiency. Upper management didn’t embrace or prioritize opportunities to improve technology, practices, processes or procedures. Work environment toxic at times."
12,First Financial Northwest,Greedy growth goals,2021-03-07,2.0,Vice President,Opportunity for promotion if you’re committed,"Management sets unrealistic goals for growth. Compensation is fair, not great"
13,First Financial Northwest,The most toxic and unfriendly environment ever worked at.,2021-03-05,1.0,Manager,Salary & benefits were good.,Employee sabotage and undermining; especially of new employees.
14,First Financial Northwest,First Financial Northwest Bank,2020-11-11,2.0,FFNWB Employee,Develop meaningful relationships with bank customers,Difficult to grow within the company. High turnover rate. Unprofessional work environment.
15,First Financial Northwest,Awful culture and management,2019-10-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Generous PTO and benefits, hard working coworkers","Toxic culture, questionable practices, lower than average pay."
16,First Financial Northwest,Toxic Environment,2019-07-10,1.0,,Pay and benefits are competitive,Odd culture; no core values
17,First Financial Northwest,Horrible Local Management,2019-03-05,1.0,Personal Banking Consultant,The commitment to the community is impressive. Salary and benefits are good. Great hours. No Saturdays.,"Branches are in a management crisis. I have never seem anything like it. Intimidation is not a management style that ever works. Write ups for the most petty things. No encouragement, no true regard to customer service and delight."
18,First Financial Northwest,Community Banking,2019-02-26,5.0,Personal Banking Consultant,"Good overall benefits package. No Saturday business hours unless working at a community event. Annual merit increases with bonus potential. A smaller staff allows for growth and development (I'm not just a PB, I get to do more). A friendly community bank feel. Not a pushy sales environment.  Seems to higher experienced bankers.",Bank grew quickly and is catching up on offering competitive products and services. Lending seems to be conservative which can be a challenge. Goal structure has changed each year. Most non-retail positions remain at the corporate office in Renton.
19,First Financial Northwest,Horrible Company - Would never recommend,2019-01-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good benefit package, cannot think of anything else","Unfriendly people, structure of 1-2 people in a branch doesn't work, cannot trust coworkers"
20,First Financial Northwest,Branch Manager,2018-03-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great environment, competitive pay, and amazing benefit package!","Middle of an acquisition, so a bit chaotic."
21,First Financial Northwest,Growing company with lots of opportunity.,2018-03-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great benefits including company events, healthcare, free parking, bonuses and more! There is a lot of opportunity to grow here and share your ideas to help with the banks growth. If you come with ideas and solutions to support their mission they support you. There is also a good work-life balance here, they do well working with your schedules/needs when they can, as long as you show up and get your work done.","Communication could be better, though, it has improved over the years. I would like to learn more about the direction they want to head and how I can help."
22,First Financial Northwest,I really enjoy working here!,2018-03-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"First Financial Northwest Bank is a growing community bank that wins awards for things such as branch experience, and innovation in education. 

The people here are great and the benefits are excellent including, medical, dental, disability, etc.  One of the things that really makes the bank stand out is the ESOP plan and paid volunteer opportunities.  The bank employees are also very active in the communities they serve.  I am happy that I joined the bank when I did because a lot is changing for the better and it is fun to be a part of it.",Nothing that comes to mind.
23,First Financial Northwest,Terrible!,2018-02-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good Benefits, can't think of anything else to say",Lack of communication from management and too many employees undermining new people.  No clear outline of expectations and misleading contradictory information. New employees not given the opportunity or information needed to succeed.  Terrible experience with fellow employees lying about being disrespectful and management allowing it.
24,First Financial Northwest,Love it here,2017-09-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"People are awesome, good benefits, 401K match, Jeans and blue Friday's, Lots of giving back to the community.",Communication could be a little better.
25,First Financial Northwest,FFNWB,2017-08-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Good working environment. Lots of opportunity for wearing business casuals or jeans to work.   Good retirement plan.,Incentives/Annual Bonus are below market and not clear cut.  Too many turnover.  Short of staff.  Too many new employees and they were not introduced/announced. Parking space is an issue to many employees.
26,First Financial Northwest,Room for growth in many ways.,2017-06-15,4.0,Anonymous Employee,First Financial Northwest Bank is really starting to grow in its branches and development.,They are having growing pains. Learning to balance growth with retention of current employees. Too many employees feel they are not valued.
27,First Financial Northwest,Changed,2016-04-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Depending on the manager it can be very hands-off. An employee can jump in and take one whatever they enjoy.,The place is going in a new direction with not even all of management on board or even aware of the changes to occur. With the new direction employees are pushed to their limits consistently.
28,First Financial Northwest,old school organization,2015-12-04,2.0,Personal Banker,"no weekend hours, free parking, bank holidays, higher than average pay for entry level positions.",Old school management and organization structure.  Minimal employee inclusion and almost no top down communication.  This is not the place for Millennials looking to collaborate and grow a career.
29,First Financial Northwest,Poor employer,2014-12-25,1.0,,Free parking and friendly work force,Does not stand behind employee and lets employees go who are newly dealing with disabilities.
