5,First National Community Bancorp,Horrendous,2014-07-05,1.0,Part-time Teller,There aren't any pros to working here. Look elsewhere. Worst bank to work for in the local area,Management has no clue what they're doing. Employees are treated like they don't matter. They will transfer employees to other branches for months at a time. I was hired as a part time teller at one branch and only spent 7 of the 9 months I worked there at that branch. Scheduling was a nightmare. Wayy too much gossip throughout the entire organization.
6,First National Community Bancorp,Lack of communication from the top down,2012-04-09,3.0,,It is a good local employer where everyone knows each other and seems to get along well. Good group of workers that go overlooked.,"There is a lack of communication from the upper levels of management, leaving employees in the dark. Sometimes the bank can't seem to get out of its own way."
7,First National Community Bancorp,"Good learning experience, not permanet career",2009-07-19,3.0,Teller Supervisor,"The hours are great. Paid vacations, paid holidays, and flexibility are a plus. The pay is decent, but could be better.","Definitely not enough vacation time. Management is horrible. It does not go by experience, but how long you've known somebody in the company or just how many years you've worked there, even if your work isn't good."
