7,Firstrade Securities,"Horrible management, low pay, worst company to work for.",2013-01-20,1.0,Customer Service Representative,they buy you a piece of cake on your last day at work!,"very very low pay
management are clueless as to who are doing the work, who are just passing time, no organization whatsoever
very stingy on office supplies, they want to pat you down for A ""post it"" and A paper clip
for a $10/hr job, they will have at least 5-10 department head interview you for 20 minutes each
lots and lots of customers calls in and complain everyday
no resolutions to solve these complaints
unhappy customers
one person does the job of 5 people
a manager makes a mistake, will blame it on someone else under him/her, upper management does not investigate at all, management will then type up a letter asking this ""fall person"" to sign and admit their wrongdoings, if not willing to sign, you are fired.
too many cons to list"
