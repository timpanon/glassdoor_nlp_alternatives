Nice people focused on producing a unique financial solution to a variety of entrepreneurial businesses.",Management was good at pitching its concept of a democratized investment product providing non accredited investors with access to private secured lending opportunities previously available only to institutions and high net worth individuals. Sadly leadership failed in nearly every element of execution and ran the company into the ground.
