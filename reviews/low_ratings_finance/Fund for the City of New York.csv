1,Fund for the City of New York,Amazing place to work! Positive organization Culture!,2022-03-10,5.0,Facilities and Office Manager,"I have worked at Fund for the City of New York for almost two years and I am more than happy to be part of this organization. FCNY has an excellent leadership team that is supportive and clear in direction they want to take the organization. Flexible and supportive in the professional development of its employees. Leadership team has an open door policy, which makes me feel valued and appreciated. Transparent and communicates with team. Fun and thriving place to work. So much room for growth. Excellent benefits, which is very important!",I have not had a negative experience in the two years working here. I feel valued and appreciated. I will update if necessary.

3,Fund for the City of New York,Heed the reviews,2021-03-30,2.0,Administrative Professional,"Okay benefits, basic set-up - nothing special","Location is a bit dirty. Think: abandoned suburban public middle school building vibes. Middle to upper management seem very unhappy. Low to middle management is totally untrained and unready. Deeply unprofessional incidents are just the norm, because no one mentions or calls out these irregular lapses. 

Most people nice but downtrodden. Realistic sense of norms not there. A mountain of micromanagement, mostly because people have no power or feel like they have to hoard scraps of power, also because even senior roles overlap with semi-degrading work. Please, just hire some building and IT staff. 

Always talking about all the $$$ they have but still the same failures to train and 360 evaluate that tiny nonprofits suffer from. 

The kitchen is windowless, FYI."
4,Fund for the City of New York,"Huge advocate, when they are on your side; toxic saboteur otherwise",2019-11-20,1.0,Executive Director,"For many years, our organization enjoyed the basic elements of service and support. They let us run our operation, with minimal involvement or micro-managing. 

The benefits offered through FCNY are reasonably good for the non-profit sector.","Ms. McCormick was tacitly supportive of our organization, offering occasional one-time grants to help us fill holes - however that seemed to come at the whims of her barometric interest.
She encouraged unethical accounting practices, fudging PTO allotments, insisting on antiquated operational procedures (i.e. no Google Docs).
For many years, we benefitted from FCNY's support and stop-gap/bridge funding. But, when Ms. McCormick soured on you (for no clearly justified reason), she demolished the relationship with no regards to the impact on the sector or the partners/service recipients. 
Memorandum of Understanding that you are required to sign is heavily weighted in favor of FCNY."
5,Fund for the City of New York,Its the worst.,2019-11-15,1.0,Program Assistant,there are no pros.,"The very first day, my direct supervisor told me that Mary, the CEO have yelled at her and then she warned me that such verbal abuse in office that may happen in the future. The entire management is coward and constantly works under fear. There is zero communication and the work culture is pure toxic. They do not communicate well and basically hire ""assistants"" to make them do typical intern-level work. You basically will learn nothing in this company and the management do not care to teach. They just constantly enforce fear into people working there. The office itself is a big mess -- water leaking from room, dirty environment all around. Overall, this company is a nightmare and I would not recommend it to my worst enemy."

Not sure that this is really a con, though."
8,Fund for the City of New York,Terrible place and an awful environment,2018-11-14,1.0,Program & Development Manager,Good benefits and a good location,"The President is a tyrant and a low life. She verbally abuses staff, even the ones that dont report to her. She hosts weird staff functions where she says she's 'celebrating' people but she seizes every opportunity to embarrass and berate them. 
Staff is generally unhappy
The office is a mess - vermin, broken facilities, no IT staff (and sometimes no wifi)"

Overtime is low-key expected, although never directly asked for and not compensated."

15,Fund for the City of New York,Program officer,2016-06-24,2.0,,"Interesting, relevant and challenging work.","(I was there before 2012, and don't know Mary McCormick, but that is as far back as this program will let me go. So my experience may be irrelevant. When I was there, this was not a financial institution. It was a foundation funded primarily by the Ford Foundation and supposed to make grants ""to make NYC a better place"". It was very cultish, elitist, arbitrary although the program staff and the Board really were intelligent and well meaning."

Good vacation benefits if you can take the days (usually locked into taking long weekends rather than a block of time).,"The most hostile work environment imaginable. Middle management paralyzed by senior management.  No encouragement to support staff to share ideas, team work discouraged.  Forget about work/life balance."
