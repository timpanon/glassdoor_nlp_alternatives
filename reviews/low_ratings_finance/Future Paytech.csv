0,Future Paytech,Working at future paytech,2019-06-01,1.0,Sales Representative,None I can think of.,Shady visa master company.  Very unprofessional support staff. Advertised leads provided but to desolate businesses. Company keeps changing names to keep away from bad reviews and lawsuits.
1,Future Paytech,Not at all the best,2017-06-17,2.0,,The only pros if there could be one is you're not out long hours of the day. Other than that not many.,Businesses they send you to aren't really businesses.  more of a home office environment. So when I tell you you're going to businesses you're really not. Also it's just commission with no mileage reimbursement or salary.
2,Future Paytech,something easy...,2017-04-11,3.0,Anonymous Employee,you get a good size cubical and the hours are average. You can make unlimited amount of appointments which means you can make unlimited amount of money. The one in grand prairie Texas let you eat in your cubical. (think its shut down now),you repeat the same line over and over again trying to call different bus. owners all day long and its hard to get a hold of one. Then when you do get a hold of one 8 times out of 10 they tell you no.
3,Future Paytech,"My experience in one sentence... hmm, one word will do... misleading!",2017-02-14,1.0,Independent Sales Representative,I do not have any.... that's all I have to say but I got an error when trying to submit to have at least 20 words so I had to expand my comment! :),"Promise to give you atleast 2-4 leads per day... I was lucky to get one lead in one WEEK! The leads I was given was outside the ""20 mile radius"" of my zip code so I averaged about 900 working miles per month, no reimbursements. Mislead once again for their ""fast start bonus"".. which I delivered on my end but was never paid the bonus nor was I paid any residuals after 90 days! Their entire ad on different job boards is just a total lie. For anyone considering FPT, I would think twice. There are so many other companies out there in the same industry that actually offer you, base + commission + car allowance and actually care about you as a person... FPT wants you to believe you are so valuable to them because your the face out in front of clients, well they need to start treating their ""independent sales agents"" with more respect and committ to what they say they will compensate you for. You're the one out there making the deals and they put you in uncomfortable situations and then micromanage you and tell you, you did something wrong! Speaking of micromanaging.. my so called ""advisor"" was so rude, talked so much as if u know what your doing and never stopped to let me ask questions to learn! Their training is horrible and then they give you ONE person in the entire company that you can communicate with, it's a total mess. I was skeptical when I first started by reading people's comments and their rating with the BBB but I decided to give it a shot and decide for myself and continued... I should have listened to all the reviews I read instead. Financially, you can't make it solely working for a company that doesn't reimburse you for anything and doesn't give you leads like they guarantee you. The few leads, I did have I closed. Easy. However, cold-calling and going to business to business in person is extremely hard these days, everyone knows that so if they don't give u leads, u can't make any money! Just my two cents though! Good luck to any one actually brave enough to take on the challenge and be treated unfairly. Too many negative posts, feedbacks, etc about this company... it's not the company that is right over everyone else... trust me!"
4,Future Paytech,Run don't walk away from this job!,2017-01-17,1.0,Sales Representative,They provide the shipping cost to send back their tablet....,"Wastes your gas
Wastes your time
The appointments are to people the company pestered forever to give them 5 minutes to give them a pitch. The service they are providing is a necessary one they should not need to beat people over the head to get an appointment with a willing business owner.
When you run out of business owners who begrudgingly let you pitch the product to them you need to approach business owners who don't have an appointment with you.
When you seperate from the company the tablet they provide will need to be mailed back to them. I sent the tablet back the same day I left the company. The next day they called and emailed me asking me to send it back. I let them know I had sent it and it will get there when fedex gets it to them. I got threats via email and phone telling me they would take legal action if they did not recieve the tablet back. I messaged them back letting them know I sent it with the prepaid label and that if they take legal action for not receiving the package it should be fedex they fight not myself. I also let them know if they took legal action against me I would talk to a lawyer about a counter suit that would likely love to take on a big company and get a large settlement. The company didn't contact me after that. Best guess they got their package or made it an issue with fedex. 
If you accept employment by this company take pictures when anything happens with the tablet with a timestamp. When it is sent to you and when it is sent back take pictures of the fedex guy putting it into the truck. Take pictures at every point of your employment. This employment is not really an employment you are not an employee you are a subcontracter of sorts. So take care but best advice is keep looking this company preys on the desperate!"
5,Future Paytech,Not bad for what it is.,2017-01-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The local management team is largely populated by charming, good-hearted people who really are part of the team vs. just supervisors.","The job is strictly cold-calling small business owners, and often the contact information is wildly outdated and not pre-screened (for instance, FPT does not work with corporations- yet many times potential clients are plainly listed as such). The work is unpleasant most of the time, and at times unreasonable pressure is applied from upper management- the VP once pulled a young lady into her office in order to grill her about her low production numbers/appointments set, and after acknowledging that she'd listened to the employee's calls and that she was doing a great job, still wanted to know why she wasn't able to book more appointments and pushed the young woman with questions about ""problems at home"" that might be causing potential clients not to book appointments (despite the employee's having been doing a wonderful job per the VP of pitching appointments) until the employee cried."
6,Future Paytech,Sales,2016-11-28,5.0,Sales Representative,Love it . Great company to work  for and they take good care of my customers.,Its sales and it has upsome and downs but love it
7,Future Paytech,FPT,2016-11-26,1.0,Outside Sales Representative,"Absolutely nothing. If you're not able to make a sale, which based on my experience, you're pretty much driving around to different businesses wasting gas.","Pure commission, cold calls, and terrible training methods and customer service advice"
8,Future Paytech,Unfortunately named,2016-11-19,1.0,,Can not think of one,Very dishonest.  I actually had a business owner call me because of his funds not being deposited within the promised amount of time caused his account to be over drawn!  Great customer service there were also extra fees added to several clients accounts as well.
9,Future Paytech,Stay The Heck Away,2016-09-19,1.0,Sales Representative,Nice technology and options available for the card processing customers. They seem to really provide great options to the customers at least.,"In order to start working for them (as a California resident), I had to get a notary done and it ran me $30 because it was 3 forms. I got it done at the UPS Store. I asked about reimbursement and was contacted by phone asking why I didn't take it to a bank to get it done for free instead of being told I actually would get reimbursed.

Also, there seems to be no offer to reimburse for mileage or gas, either.

I asked if there were any actual customers who could tell me if they were glad they switched to Future PayTech and was told no."
10,Future Paytech,The question is why,2016-08-29,1.0,Field Sales Agent,The biggest pro is that I found no discrimination in this company. Being blind gives a certain advantage when dealing with that problem. I give them a 5+ on that however it quickly goes down from there.,With a lot of promise they can't possibly keep they bring you in with a tablet. Once you have it they provide a useless two day training before they send you out. As an experienced rep for many companies in the past this is not enough training. They lose two points there the other three come when you discover that the person on the other end had no clue as to what they're talking about. You know that because he's asking a coworker about it and they don't have the answer. That's a three strikes and you're out situation
11,Future Paytech,I am a Marketing Rep and although it may have its good and bad days I love it! I love my FPT family!!!,2016-08-01,5.0,Marketing Representative,The atmosphere of the center is amazing and the supervisor team well Lets Just Say they are the Best Around!!!! Always supportive and always there to help when needed!,I cant much think of a Con or anything negative just trying to keep everyone motivated and positive can be a little tricky!!
12,Future Paytech,company review,2016-05-29,1.0,,able to make bonus on the job with no cap,"unprofessional , not enough training"
13,Future Paytech,Director of Business Development,2016-05-21,5.0,Corporate Sales Manager,Great growth company and client and employee focus.,Regional focus. Local advancement and expanded employment focus.
14,Future Paytech,Call Center Agent,2016-04-25,4.0,,Work environment and goal orientated,Repetition with marketing script and hard to meet daily quotes when customers hang up and don't see the value.
15,Future Paytech,Commission only - dishonest company,2016-03-07,1.0,,Sales managers are helpful - try to close most deals for you when you're new,"Closing practices are dishonest - contractual lengths, ETFs, one-time startup fees, and other fees are glossed over or not mentioned at all. You are basically sent to build a relationship and  gain the customers trust so your manager can close them over the phone. See neutral reviews on cardpaymentoptionsDOTcom"
16,Future Paytech,"""You can tell if they are lying if there lips move""",2016-02-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,If you can think of any let me know.,"Company lied about everything. Quality leads, sales support... No benefits at all."
17,Future Paytech,If you have real bills BEWARE!,2016-01-21,1.0,Call Center Representative,"cheap health insurance ....occasional get n go's meaning if you get a certain amount of appts then you can leave early and still get paid for the whole day but trust me, don't hold your breath ....pay can increase if more appts but it'll only increase for that pay check and then you have to start over so I guess that's a pro and a con.","cold calling and trying to sell ppl (they say we're not but we are), if you don't set enough appts they give you two weeks to bring your average up and if you don't you get fired at the end of the two weeks so the turnover rate is like through the roof because the one week ""training"" course is vague and doesn't really prepare you well for what your about to do so some people can just jump in and go with it and others can't. I've seen them fire a person that's been here for over a year because their average dropped for two weeks. it's sad."
18,Future Paytech,"The good, the bad and the ugly",2016-01-13,2.0,Independent Sales Agent,You get a lot of support from the management team at corporate. The pay is in your bank account when it is supposed to be every time.,High pressure and unethical practices
19,Future Paytech,Marketing Rep,2015-12-06,3.0,Marketing Representative,Starting pay is good even when you have little to no experience. People are nice and coworkers are encouraging. Benefits kick in quicker than most employers (after 60 days). They give advice for improvement not just tear you down in reviews.,There's been a lot of negative talk. Focus is more on production than quality. You can't keep customers that way. The more customers to more revenue for the company so not sure why the focus on the negative lately.
20,Future Paytech,$800 RIPOFF!,2015-11-15,1.0,Independent Sales Agent,Pro is luckily I have a credit card to rely on because these crooks cleaned out my bank account.  I gave them back their tablet but they ripped $800 from my bank.,The leads were fake.  Every owner I visited had no clue I was coming.  Then I decided to move on because I couldn't just drive around all day for nothing!!  The manager got real mad and said I wasn't trying.  Anyway he told me mail back the tablet.  I did and even had proof via FedEx but they said they didn't get it and stole $800 from me.  So they have the tablet and my $800.  I should have done like other reviews said and kept the tablet and close my bank acct!  Don't be stupid and trust these people like it did.
21,Future Paytech,Amazing leadership.,2015-11-14,5.0,Marketing Representative,"Fantastic work life/home life balance, with the amazing work schedule. FPT even offers daily incentives if you meet your goal you can go home for the rest of the day AND they pay you for it!","Entitled tended reps, however management does a wonderful job at defusing them. Just because you have tenure doesn't mean you DESERVE a promotion, they just want it handed to them."
22,Future Paytech,FPT Review,2015-10-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Simple easy to understand product. Able to save most customers money.,Some customer services problems every now and then.
23,Future Paytech,Sales,2015-09-29,1.0,Sales Representative,"Lots of free time, mangers are closers","Pays very little, not what promised, terrible appointments some are not safe in clients homes"
24,Future Paytech,"High Stress, High Reward",2015-09-02,2.0,Inside Sales Manager,Excellent pay structure.  Team atmosphere.,"High pressure sales, only as good as your last month with a lot of outside factors that directly affect your success path"
25,Future Paytech,RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN,2015-08-06,1.0,Outside Sales Representative,None. I should have known it would be a bad experience since during the initial phone call the recruiter bad mouthed every other company and made it seem like they were the best in the world...,Worst company ever. Got a call from a manager who cursed me out in a voicemail. Then when i called back he continued to verbally abuse me. These clowns dont even pay a base salary. SCAM SCAM SCAM DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT HITTING THE APPLYING HERE JUST KEEP STEPPING!!!
26,Future Paytech,don't like to much,2015-08-05,1.0,Marketing,Great place to work I guess,Stressfull  on if you will get fired from not making enough appointments
27,Future Paytech,Quickest Way To Lose $800,2015-08-04,1.0,Sales Agent,They lend you an outdated tablet from 2011 to help with the sales process.  It plays a presentation video to disarm clients and build trust in you (supposedly).,"When they fire you, they give you 5 days to return the tablet or they charge you $800.  Yes, $800.  This almost happened to me but my bank didn't let it go through."
28,Future Paytech,Pathetic,2015-05-23,1.0,,Fleeing was the only positive,"Remember the old days of car dealerships that the sales manager had to talk to every customer? This is worse. You build a rapport with a client and turn it over for them to screw it all up with their high pressure phone tactics. In addition, the leads were over an hour away, Miserable experience."
29,Future Paytech,Stay away from this company.,2015-05-19,2.0,Regional Sales,Even a novice salesman can probably close a deal. They give you a tablet with a 5 minute power point that explains what we offer.,"Very misleading company. Future is a dba for a company named crescent processing, a company that has a terrible reputation for screwing merchants. I was told i will get paid $415 per deal. That is virtually impossible to do. Average pay is $225 to $140, due to subtractions from not upselling 4 different items (-$35 per) & $25 is taken away for the ""free"" tablet. The call center is absolutely terrible. My contract states I will only have to travel 20 miles from my home. My footprint had me going  as far as75 miles...Their pitch is basically telling merchants you are there to show them a video. The majority of the merchants I am put in front of told the caller they were not interested."
30,Future Paytech,outside sales,2015-05-14,2.0,Outside Sales Representative,"not a 9-5 job, freedom to leave early to golf","poor commissions, saturated market, gas is expensive, sink or swim mentality"
31,Future Paytech,Terrible. The Company is a complete scam,2015-04-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The tablet to do the interviews,"They claimed I would have all these appointments and sent me driving around town constantly saying appointments were made. I got to two different places, and they weren't even open when I showed up and the owners weren't there. You are constantly on the phone; it doesn't matter the time or place. The contract is misleading and the company only teaches you enough to reel the potential business in. The terms on returning the tablet are ridiculous; it snowed when I was supposed to return it and they still expected it back in 5 days. Most customers end up very dissatisfied"
32,Future Paytech,"some challenges, but good overall experience",2015-04-15,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"friendly people, laid back office, open door policy.  I was able to come into contact with a lot of interesting people and I got to learn more about the day-to-day operations of many different areas of the business, such as underwriting.I ended up moving out of state but I did enjoy working there",small company with a limited budget. like another reviewer said we do need to invest more in updated technology. The tablets we've been using we've had for several years now.
33,Future Paytech,"Good place, can always improve but nice environment",2015-04-14,3.0,Corporate Manager,"As a smaller company, the environment here is less rigorous than some larger environments I've been part of.  No place is perfect, including here.  But at least in my role here, I can enjoy being able to communicate with the reps on how they can continue to grow and improve. No one micro-manages me, which I've also encountered in the past.  Here, it is open communication, and as managers we're encouraged to think for ourselves (within reason, company policies always apply), but with a little common sense and judgement, I've found I have the freedom to grow here.",We need to evaluate some new products/techniques so we can become more successful.
34,Future Paytech,complete crap,2015-04-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I can't think  of one good thing to say about it!!,They give you bogus leads and the so called sales directors are no help at all. I have called mines plently of times for him to say please hold and then I'm on hold for 15 to 30 mins for the line to get disconnected. Future tech is the worst company I've ever worked for
35,Future Paytech,Future Payment Technologies A Misnomer,2015-03-27,1.0,Outside Sales Representative/Business Account,"Provide a tablet for agents use. 
Leads are provided, alleged to be double confirmed.
Personal sales managers who provide excellent assistance to agents.","Although they claim no affiliation with Crescent Processing, both companies have or had the same address and both appear to use the same business model
Both Crescent Processing back in 2008 and Future Payment Technologies in 2015 use very similar (virtually identical), 27-page Terms & Conditions. I mention T&C because the sales rep is mandated to leave a copy with each new account. Most every merchant I wrote moved on to a different processing company within 18 months. Not a satisfied customer among them. The T&C's are loaded with ""Gotchas"" that go into effect when the merchant commits infractions that change his rates, What was presented by the sales rep is soon reflecting costs that are heavily loaded in favor of the processing company. These are somewhere in the 27-page tome.
As a 10-year veteran of merchant processing sales and service I have never encountered another company as ethically lacking as Crescent Processing or the reborn Future Payment Technologies"
36,Future Paytech,"Great company, great leadership.",2015-03-23,5.0,Business Analyst,"Senior management is the most knowledgeable IT experts I've had the pleasure to work with in recent years. Great people skills, well treated and contributions are valued.",None. As a contractor I wish I could go permanent and stay with the company.
37,Future Paytech,"It has been a pleasant opportunity, I was hoping it would be more lucrative.",2015-03-01,3.0,Sales Representative,"You work independently, which gives you the freedom to create new business opportunity, and to ultimately increase your earning potential.","I wish the earning were greater. Also would like to maintain a residual commission on all sales presently, in into the future. That would make sales reps feel better about future growth."
38,Future Paytech,DON'T FALL FOR THE LIES!! DON'T BELIEVE THE FAKE POSITIVE POSTS!!!!!!,2015-01-10,1.0,Territory Manager,Absolutely Nothing at All! this is a complete waste of your time. Don't fall for the lies. Never got paid. Wasted Time on pre-set calls that were not legit. There are no positive things to say about this position.,Pre-set appointments are a Lie! Worked with them for 3 weeks and spent my gas money and never received a cent. Difficult to get help from inside contacts in a timely matter.
39,Future Paytech,Scam Artists,2014-12-18,1.0,Account Executive,"Absolutely no pros to working at this company at all, the only benefit of this company is learning a life lesson about not being  naive. Never work for an employer you have never met in person especially as a sales job, let my mistake be your lesson this company will never pay you despite the first impression as a major corporate company. Dont let the tablet they send you fool you I fought for 3 months to receive my first paycheck and when i finally contacted management over the head of my manager they chose to release me from the company. Despite my attempts to file a complaint with labor bureau standards government agencies the company covers their tracks well to avoid legal repercussions",The leads are never confirmed despite their claims to double confirm them. The company uses bait and switch tactics on any merchant that you will close as a lead so if your goal is to ruin small business owners for the false promise of a sales commission that you will never receive this is the job for you. It is unfortunate that such a corporation would take advantage not only of the small businesses they claim to help but hopeful young salespeople trying to make a better life for themselves.
40,Future Paytech,Very poor training process.,2014-12-09,1.0,Outside Sales Representative,I like that the tablet mak s a lot of the work dummy proof,"Hard time getting a hold of management during the day. Also, if support manger is closing a deal while you are calling in a deal you wait instead of having another manager pitch in and help close."
41,Future Paytech,Sales,2014-12-06,1.0,,"You get a nice tablet to use which has a slick presentation included and the application process is simple, and if you are new to sales you have a very involvedSales Management team.","They are very controling oif both the Sales Staff and the clients, refuse to provide written proposals or rate quotes which turn into argyments also the leads provided are very weak many times the merchant does not know why we are there or what we do. Job requires a belief in the magical abilities of sales presentations. It also seems management gets all future money streams and sales person gets none."
42,Future Paytech,Red flags everywhere!,2014-10-23,1.0,,Maybe the tablet. Even though it's worthless outside of using it for FPT.,"The appointments seem completely bogus. Every appointment I went to, they were completely confused and had no clue what I was talking about or why I was there. Even the introduction training that's sent to you consists of red flags abut the appointments. It has you introduce yourself, the company, and why you're there. Then it says be prepared to hear ""not interested"". Why wouldn't they be interested if they set the appointment?!
Then the training is horrible. You receive the tablet which provides tons of information about all the features and perks of the products, but neither the tablet or your sales manager tells you each feature costs extra. On top of that, when you fill out the practice applications, neither the tablet or your sales manager lets you know if you did it correctly. I did my practice applications in about 20 mins each. It took me almost 3 hours to complete my first real application and it still does because I keep finding out I'm doing it wrong. Plus I haven't got paid yet and the commissions are all over the place. And there's a one time processing fee that you inform merchants of at the last minute of the application that deters them real quick, but the processing fee is how you get paid! Also, they have an extremely aggressive sales strategy that irritates merchants while on the job when you do the door to door option. And when you do your research, there's way more negative feedback than positive. Honestly, there are way too many red flags and I'm not quite sure about FPT."
43,Future Paytech,Tin Men,2014-09-19,1.0,Sales Agent,Nothing positive to say about this company.,They just want you to run around and tell the customer as little as possible while pushing them to sign up no matter what.  The corporate managers think zinging the customer is going to result in sales.
44,Future Paytech,An interesting ride so far,2014-09-02,4.0,Sales Agent,"I was hired on as one of their remote Sales Agents. They do give you a tablet when you start that is loaded with a presentation and you use that tablet when you meet with prospective clients. I like the tablet because most people are familiar with tablets now and I've found that most people are visual. Otherwise, merchants get really bored or distracted. You don't have long to make impression - we're talking 30 - 60 seconds here in come cases. Like someone else said, they do have sales conference calls and they usually last no more than 20 - 30 minutes – I actually wish they'd last a little longer because I think we can share more selling tips, but I am sure they're trying to get us off the phone so we can get to our next appointment.",I think the sales presentation could look a little more sophisticated.  We’re competing with the bigger players out there.
45,Future Paytech,Enjoy working here but save your gas money,2014-08-28,3.0,Sales Agent,"I’ve never been one to enjoy working in an office setting, so I appreciate the flexibility of working from home and on the road.  Since we’re all remote and all over the US, we have weekly sales meetings where we call in to discuss our progress with management, along with anything new that’s going on with the company (products, etc).  From my past experience, communication is a joke at many companies. These calls are good because they highlight peoples individual successes and provide public recognition on the call.  Sometimes in our line of work, I’ve felt like we’re an afterthought. 

They do give you a tablet that you can use when you present your materials to prospective merchants – that’s a more up-to-date approach than lugging around a tone of printed sell sheets.",You will have to drive to your appointments to meet merchants and sometimes they’re not as geographically as close as you’d like them to be.

Other than that, no pros I can think of.","Commission structure is weak and you get ZERO RESIDUALS ON YOUR SALES!!!

""Pre-set appointments"" were worthless.  To FPT, a pre-set appointment means a business owner said it would be ok for someone to ""drop off some information""; not watch a 4-minute brainwash commercial.

1/2 the time these appts are scheduled for when the business is closed and/or the business owner is not there, wasting your time and gas money.

No real development of sales skills; Managers are busy with all their other agents so they don't take the time to help you develop your skills.  They just want you to get into you're ""pre-set appointments"", play your video (if possible), and then get them on the phone to do the actual selling."

Then you have to keep calling in from every bogus appointment and your manager will swear that the leads are good. And when you quit or they let you go, they'll expect you to have the tablet back in five days and if FedEx doesn't get it there in time, they'll try to charge your account that you set up for direct deposit $800 for the tablet.  If that's not sketchy enough, they've changed their name about 7 times to avoid all the complaints and bad publicity they continue to get. If you're considering working here, RUN as fast as you can!

Attainable monthly bonuses.","Many of the leads are not actual appointments. I would have preferred cold calling. Very little training. The company does not give you enough tools to properly do your job. They keep essential information from you. When you ask for help, they don't have time. The presentation tablet did not do all of the functions it was supposed to."

58,Future Paytech,Top Rated Company,2014-02-14,5.0,Isa,Future Pay Tech is one of the top 100 Financial Services in the nation. We have cutting edge  equipment as well as highly trained sales and support staff.,We are working out way up to become number one.
59,Future Paytech,So far so good!,2014-02-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I joined Future Payment Technologies just about a year ago and I'm still happy that I made the decision.  Since joining, I've been excited about the direction of the company and the vision of our leadership team.  I see great things in our future - we're really embracing new technologies and other aspects of the industry to provide the best services at the best prices to our clients.

On the employee side - I'm privileged to have been involved in the process of reinvesting into our employees in the corporate office, plus, reinvesting into our field sales agents.  Everything I've seen has shown me that, as a company, we're committed to success at all levels of the organization and willing to invest the time and money needed to reach our goals.  It's an exciting time to be here and I look forward to what the future holds.","No employer is perfect, but I definitely see FPT working hard to provide a great experience to everyone involved in the organization.  In my role, I interact with new sales agents every day and it's very unfortunate that not everyone achieves the same level of success and tenure.  I take it personally when someone isn't successful in their position and hate to lose the, no doubt, talented people that don't find success in our sales agent program.

It's also difficult to fully communicate the vision and direction of the company, when such a large part of our representation is scattered across the country, rather than being here in our corporate offices.  When you don't interact face-to-face every day, it can be a real challenge and I know it makes some individuals feel like they have to do it all on their own."
60,Future Paytech,Future Paytech is dishonest to its sales agents and to its customers,2014-02-13,1.0,,"Your on a 1099, self paced training, they give you a tablet for presentation and they give you 1 to 3 leads.","They put in their sales pitich next day funding and ommit at time of sale that it cost and extra monthly fee so cutomers are mislead into thinking next dat funding. Compettitive companies charge as much as $30 a month for equiptment and they put in their sales pitch free equiptment, just a monthly processing fee of $9,50 per month and whatever the discount rate is. What they ommit is $9.50 monthly fee for reciept capture, $9,50 monthly to put your address on the receipt, $9.50 a month for a check swipe, $9.50 month for a gift card. So during business with this scam company has a hidden monthly fee of around $50 a month for all the sservices plus lots of other hidden fees in the terms and conditions they custom can't read the print is so small. So So if this isnt bad enough they deduct $35.00 from the sales agents commission for each additional monthly servoce fee not added on to the contract.So for example you sell a Visa and Mastercard processing only your commission is only $141 less $25.00 for the tablet and $39 for what they call services. What services, their leads are the worst I've ever seen. You drive 50 miles just to discover that the telemarketer wouldnt take no for an answer and so since the $9 an hour telephone worker needs to keep their job being meaured by the number of appointments they set, they'll just set anything. When they say double confirmed appointment, the same group of people who set the bad appointment also confirmes it. This is one of the slimiest group of people I ever met. They are hustlers, tricksters and just a group of crimminals with bad intentions."
61,Future Paytech,So far so good,2014-02-13,5.0,Independent Contractor,I truly believe in the product and the company.,"Would like more qualified leads,"
62,Future Paytech,"Great company, good employment opportunity",2014-02-13,4.0,Independent Sales Agent,"They set up the appointments for sales reps to meet with business owners. It is up to each sales rep to sign up the merchant with their service. if you encounter problems or objections at the business location, the company will do all in their power to help you close the deal, its a great support team","can be a little frustrating at times when business owners do not show up for their scheduled appointment. In my area, I do not always get to go through the entire presentation. Merchants just want the bottom line."
63,Future Paytech,Great company for a motivated sales professional!,2014-02-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It is a mostly autonomous work environment. The great thing is that you are sent leads that have been contacted and twice confirmed. There are some days where you do not get leads, but a B2B salesperson, should already be familiar with generating business on their own. I was reading a few of the reviews, and they said that the leads were not up to par. I don't find that to be true. I have had a few instances where, the business owner was just trying to get off the phone so they said they would be able to meet, but the majority are interested in your service. The other huge plus is that they are able to put businesses on a program that saves them anywhere from 25-50% over what they are currently doing. So with that, you are able to offer a deal that is very cost effective. I also read that you have trouble getting an account activated and thus...paid. That is false as well. It is a quick process to get an account activated. The equipment is sent out quickly and the business will receive it in 3-5 days. A quick call and they will be set up. Those people saying otherwise, probably didn't help their customers with an install. I have, and the process takes about 5 minutes. Sales managers are easy to work with and try their best to help you make money. The system of selling is very helpful in getting a sale made. The basic equipment is free. The upgraded equipment is very inexpensive and it sets you up well for regulations that will be on the horizon.","It is a 100% commission job, but with the leads you are given it helps to make up for that."
64,Future Paytech,Working at Future Payment Technologies has allowed me to accomplish so much from a personal and professional standpoint!,2014-02-12,5.0,Account Management Specialist,Future PayTech stands by its open door policy so it makes it easy to share with management solutions and/or concerns that makes the workplace better for all.,The separation of our sales team and client services department being on different floors. It would be easier to keep both teams close so that we can achieve together the overall goal of making sales and keeping our merchants happy.
65,Future Paytech,Great Company to work for,2014-02-12,5.0,Isa,"Daily coaching from direct supervisor. My manager shows true concern for my personal well being and always takes care of issues that may arise. The preset appointments are great, but you are also given the freedom to go out and generate your own sales which gives you the opportunity to have unlimited income potential.",Nothing. I have had no issues that have not been given full attention and handled immediately.
66,Future Paytech,Independent Sales Agent or ISA,2014-02-05,1.0,Indenpendant Sales Agent,They say you're independent but every morning you need to call in at 8:30am to your corporate manager. He then gives you pre-set appointments one at a time so you must drive at your own expense to the appointment within a 50 mile radius of where you live.The freedom and flexiblity is a definate plus.,"The pre set appointments they give you are really bad. They have very poor telemarketers that would say anything to get you in the door. Most of them are bad addresses, some of them they the girl would take no for an answer. In general these pre-sets are a waste of time. Then once you're lucky enough to make a sale, commission time (they say everyday but I've waited 2 weeks becasue it has to be approved then activated, they take fees off your commission check. They punish you for not selling some services by taking off $35.00 for each item you don't sell so a $341 commission nets out to less than $141. It's a scam. You have to sell 8 deals a month to get $400 gas money but what they don't tell you upfront is that they charge the ISA $39 a month in support fees. They lie to the merchant and they lie to the hands that feed them too. My advice to anyone looking to work for this company...run fast as you can away from them. They are preying on the unemployed and desperate people out there."
67,Future Paytech,They lie to get you on board...Same Company as Crescent Payment and changed name to DBA Future due to very poor reviews.,2014-02-04,2.0,Isa,"You remain independent and get paid on a 1099, have some flexibility in your work day.","The leads they provide are not double confirmed, it takes them weeks just to activate an account and you don't get paid until its activated. What's more, even after they activate an account you still have to wait for your commission check. Very nasty management styles."

69,Future Paytech,Nothing new in the world of 1099 employment,2013-12-10,2.0,Independent Sales Agent,"Well, if you have plenty of business contacts in your network this could be a great way to monetize those relationships. Every business needs the ability to accept payments by credit and debit. The compensation is pretty straight forward, and they provide a company tablet to present with that eliminates the need for submitting paperwork and speeds up the process.","The leads they promise as qualified appointments are no such thing. The business owner has never heard or at least doesn't remember the name Future Paytech, and they are surprised to see you when you show up for your ""appointment"" if they are even there to begin with. Many times the merchant who was ""qualified"" is hostile towards you, or just plain too busy to give you a few minutes of your time. Your corporate manager insists that these are good leads, but in the end you are the one there to experience the opposite. I have worked independently for other processing companies and decided to try out future paytech because  it seemed easier and straight forward (tablet) but the main reason was for leads so I'd have something to get started. The leads are terrible IMO, and I am actually a very good salesperson with experience d2d, retail, and event from 20-20,000 $ items. 

My advice is if you are a good salesperson, contract with a different company to provide these services. Compensations are much higher then with future paytech and while it will be completely cold calling business (at least at first) its better then driving around on bogus appointments."
