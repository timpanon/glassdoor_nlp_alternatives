- Smart casual dress code.","- Just a job, not for those looking to build their career.
- Zero investment into employee development - training in the form of ""get it done"", ""look on this free website"" and ""Google it"". This approach can work for some tasks but does not apply to all forms of knowledge.
- Cliques exist, do not expect interesting work if you are not part of it.
- Multiple re-orgs in the space of a few years, different structure and faces - same chaos.
- Every project ends up as a last minute rush with management cracking the whip for employees to do the impossible. Excuses are made for the rush each time."

There really are no pros. Unless you are strapped for cash or have no previous job experience, look for an actual job that will build your career.","The management. Their only interest is saving face, and protecting themselves from their superiors. The departments are run like a popularity contest. Promotions are not given on a merit basis. They make you take some stupid tests to get a promotion. First promotion you receive is larger than the second promotion. How does that even make sense? Shouldn't promotions increase as you stay with a company? That's just part of the backwards logic this company has. Don't trust your managers, they will burn you.
Monotonous work. Mounting pressures. High turn around rate, and responsibilities are often redistributed to everyone when someone leaves. Company thinks everyone is replaceable and when they can't replace someone their solution is to just redistribute the work to someone else, while not increasing the salary to match added responsibilities. Oh, and if you think this redistribution of responsibilities is temporary you are sorely mistaken.
Skills don't transfer over in the professional Finance/Investment world. Most of the policies Gain Capital uses are archaic. They don't provide enough in-house training, and education. The longer you work here the more behind you are in building your career. Do yourself a favor and earn your chops, work a year, and run for the hills. You’ll learn a lot more in a month working for a bigger company than you will learn here in a whole year.
Poor incentives and bonus structure. At first you think that oh jeans, awesome! Oh free bagels on Friday awesome! Oh free coffee! Even better. However, none of these things help repair a toxic corporate culture. Gain Capital can only change if the management is completely uprooted and there is extreme focus and emphasis on their corporate culture.

One particular (Without mentioning names) has free reign to Bully, intimidate, use threats of firing (Scare tactics), Abuse absolutely everyone behind their back and has direct access to all staff members. Due to this they force workload onto people without any regards for triage and some of the work they force upon them has unreasonable deadlines, is poorly managed and only half of the information is passed on. Already set up for a fall before you begin and then when it goes wrong the entirety of the blame fulls on the unfortunate person who was given the task rather than with the person who poorly handed it down. You are then rewarded by more abuse, shouting and swearing usually with an audience to better their effect !
Whilst this goes on, all other senior management will just turn a blind eye to it (Even those senior to them) and for this reason I think they are just as bad.

Due to this person, I (As well as anyone else I have spoken to about this) truly believes that they are the main reason why GC has not progressed and why it will continue to fail in the future.
