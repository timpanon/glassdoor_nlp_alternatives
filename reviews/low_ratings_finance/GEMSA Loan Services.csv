5,GEMSA Loan Services,Not worth your time,2015-08-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I honestly can't think of any Pro's other than a steady pay check. I guess depending on how you look at it management really doesn't care a thing about you, not that they should however, this does come in handy as you can easily work under the radar.  Part of this is being able to work from home some days.","Pay is not compatible with local markets.  You will be asked to do extra work and essentially get a promotion, but never reap the benefits of a promotion meaning no title change, no increase in pay.  The employee is expected to know all of the HR laws of your state; more specifically FMLA and will be written up for missing work due to a family or personal medical emergency regardless of how many PTO days are left.  On the flip side, management will not counsel problem employees when requested by direct supervisor."
