Good first job but then run.","Limited growth, CEO, compensation 

You have to take everything on this site for what it is, not going to be many positives and its usually from an unhappy employee. However; from the other side, look at the positive posts. These are obvious plants to make the company look better. 
I’m not going to go into a rant on how bad the company is but just do your research if you are a potential employee or a potential client. Look at turnover, why have so many upper level management employees either left the company or were let go? Many of the core Gemini people that helped grow the company to what it is today are gone. Many by their own choice, even to competitors. I wonder why that is?  
If you are reading this and you are either interested in working for this company or giving business to them just think; what made a great growing family oriented company into an undesirable place to work.

This place is a cesspool with some of the most incompetent management in the history of employers. The new CEO is focused on cutting good employees and keeping the trash. One manager in particular has built their career on talking a lot and saying little, while simultaneously never accomplishing anything.  The reviews on here from past employees are all spot on.

22,Gemini Fund Services,GHFS - Great place to work,2017-10-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"GHFS has been a great place to work at over the years.  I have truly enjoyed working at Gemini Hedge and have gained extensive knowledge in the hedge fund industry.  Having weekly/monthly company team meetings keeps the line of communication between all departments open to discuss any issues or concerns and are kept in the loop with potential client onboarding’s.  When a new employee starts, it is nice to see the team leads go out to lunch to get to know the team members they will be working with on a daily basis.  It is also nice to see that the Gemini Hedge team likes to get together after work hours.  This shows that the team enjoys the people they work with.  The company tries to make our working environment as pleasurable as possible.  There is a casual dress code, monthly companywide events, and monthly team lunches.  It is nice that the each Team has implemented quarterly one-on-ones.  This provides each team member the opportunity to openly discuss issues/concerns/training that may be on an individual’s mind that they do not feel comfortable bringing up in a group setting.
Being able to interact directly with upper management to discuss any issues or concerns an employee may have is extremely beneficial to how the company operates.  Having this open line of communication helped direct a career path for me.  Seeing that upper management cares enough to plan a career path and implement that career path shows that they encourage internal company growth.  It is nice to see that people are not just promoted for the sack of promoting, but for the work they produce, the work ethic they show, and the motivation to continue to learn about the industry that we service.","As seen in many companies in the financial industry, you see a certain amount of turnover due to a variety of reasons which is expected in this field.  One of the main reasons that I see is that a current employee is choosing to take a different career path whether it is a different office location, to be more involved on the fund side, or getting out of the financial industry all together.  Because of the turnover, there is time that is needed to keep current and new hires up to speed with the work that needs to be completed."
23,Gemini Fund Services,Great place to work,2017-10-18,5.0,Risk Manager,"I worked at Gemini for 3 years starting in late 2014. My experiences do not line up at all with a lot of the recent chatter on here. I came on board as an entry-level analyst and from the outset received great deal of responsibility, as well as good mentoring and a lot of autonomy. There was a lot of room to build out and refine daily processes, and my experience with management is that they are hard working and eager for good feedback on changes that can be made. Over my three years I received multiple promotions and raises and turned down more competitive offers to stay at Gemini. The position servicing hedge funds means you get to interact with high-level people and make great connections.","A lot of the technology has room for improvement, some processes are still too manual. Some of the upper management positions were staffed with what seemed like patronage positions, but that situation has improved considerably with the new CEO. Mixture of some great people but also a number of employees who are not especially engaged and who turn over pretty quickly.  But chatter on this site does not accurately reflect the company."

The company and the management are terrible. They introduced overtime after the conversion was over so they didn't have to pay more to people who were working 10-11 hours straight without eating or having any break to go to the bathroom but as soon as they introduced overtime they made sure to emphasize how you must take a break according to NYS law.  They reduced benefits when they introduced overtime, removed the bonus from employees eligible for overtime, cut emergency time off, increased workload, decreased hiring. 

The base pay is 40k for a fund accountant and you'll get like 15 vacation days total but you also must take 5 consecutive business days off within a year on your own time, no exceptions. The work is not fast paced, it's not difficult and a lot of people get comfortable and some stay for very long periods of time but that's because they aren't successful. There is a lot of turnover and there is always someone who leaves every month, every month, out of the maybe 30 fund accountants on the floor. Many seniors are incompetent, the managers above the seniors are incompetent and don't care about anybody in the firm unless they are best pals. Promotions are based relationships with the managers, not merit. If you aren't best pals with the manager expect to have more funds than the rest of the group but get paid less than them. Managers are unapproachable, rude, flat out lie, and definitely pick favorites. Seniors and managers struggle with basic excel functions and aren't genuinely appreciative of anything you do for them. Some super senior management person came from Omaha, the HQ, split up groups and changed entire structures even though she has barely a spoken to anybody here or has any insight in how groups operate. Guess what the group managers did about groups being split up? Not a single thing. But guess what? If you are best pals with the manager then you'll likely stay in the same group as before. 

Corporate actions team is just filled with loud mouths who talk obnoxiously loud all day and have zero respect for the people working around them and several of them struggle with setting up securities and processing early morning corporate actions. 

The departments have extremely poor communication between each other. Treasury still sends old codes for the old accounting system, fund administrators send current codes but the incorrect ones. 

There are constant NAV errors and I hope less clients come to this company for support of their products. The conversion cost the company over a million dollars in NAV errors because the company couldn't be bothered to hire 2 specialists to prevent such errors. That's okay though because management said that if a group doesn't get any NAV errors in a quarter then they'll get free lunch. 

I really hope I save potential future employees and clients from ever having a relationship with this company. If you stay here for over a year then you are just wasting your potential."
36,Gemini Fund Services,Fund services,2017-03-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Not many pros for this company. Bagel Fridays. Some co workers are nice. Some managers are nice. Good experience.,"The upper management which consists of VP and AVP have absolute no managerial skills. They do not know how to manage their employees. They absolutely have no feelings and do not care about their employees. They make mistakes themselves and blame their employees. Is that how a company works? These useless meetings they have are an absolute time waste. They act like they care, but they do not. The workload they throw on you is crazy. When we need help they never come by and help. They just simply ignore and at the end they ask why did you do it wrong? Salary is well below the market value. Benefits are ok. If you do decide to come to this company then do it for a year and leave. Unless the upper management changes there is no point of staying here more than a year. They only promote the people they like. It is definitely not based on performance. I have seen people work really hard and all they got at the end were blames. The turn over rate is really high. Please read other reviews because they are telling the truth. All the good reviews you see here are probably written by upper management."

I suppose you will get some exposure as a first job out of college, but that's really it. And it isn't even worth it.","Where to start.... The first red flag is the ENORMOUS turnover rate. An extremely low percentage of people stay in the group longer than one year. Generally, people stay longer than a year because they have trouble getting a different job since nobody has ever heard of this company. The reason for the high turnover is management. As a low level Admin, you will be worked to the brink of insanity with absolutely zero recognition. You work forced overtime and the ""big payoff"" is a 2-3% raise each year. Considering that you will be WILDLY underpaid, the ""bonus"" is minuscule. Management only cares that deadlines are met, regardless if they are reasonable or not. You could work a 12 hour day and then have a meeting the following day to discuss why your deadlines were not met. Management sees everyone as a number which can be easily replaced. They show this in many ways. First, they have not addressed these issues since the group formed years ago. They make an excuse for each individual's case and shift the blame away from themselves. Second, they force the other employees to train the new employees. Management does not take the time to learn anything about their staff since they see everyone as a number who will leave within the year. Another thing management is notorious for is recording EVERYTHING. When you are new and learning (making mistakes), management will write down everything you do which they deem incorrect and will bring it up at a later date as evidence for whatever their agenda is. My advice to anyone considering joining this group is TURN AWAY. The experience is not worth the anxiety and frustration that comes along with the job. Gemini Hedge takes young people who want to run through walls to learn as much as they can and turns them into people who hate coming to work and will do the absolute minimum. When the clock strikes 5:30PM, everyone gets up to leave their desk and does not look back. That really should tell you everything you need to know about employee moral. *STAY AWAY*"

43,Gemini Fund Services,Great place to work if you want to be a lazy employee because everyone gets the same raises,2016-07-05,1.0,,"Casual dress code, bagels on Friday and friendly coworkers are the only reason this company still has a staff","Severely underpaid compared to salaries at similar companies, unless you're senior management, they line their pockets while the rest of us struggle to make ends meet. Gemini's motto is to take advantage of their good employees and overworking them to the point they absolutely dread coming to work and if you’re horrible at your job you can just float on by with less responsibility. You have to really actively try to get fired so if you want a job that you can do the minimum amount to get by or less then, this is the place for you. They will keep people in management positions knowing they are unable to do the job and force their staff to pick up the slack. If an issue occurs then the staff is blamed for the problem, not management. No compensation/vacation time is given if you have to work extra hours, it’s just expected, even if the reason is because of incompetent workers or understaffing issues. No one is trained on anything, you pretty much have to figure it as you go and ask around to co-workers for help. Everyone gets the same raise each year, regardless if your review was good or bad, so there is absolutely nothing to motivate you to work hard. The ""quarterly bonuses"", if you can call them that, are insulting, maybe $200. People are promoted because of who you know not what you know and the hard working employees have to fight tooth and nail to even been recognized. They started as a small company and grew too large to fast for their own good and the head's of the departments are not qualified to be running them. Everything is a game of catch up or putting out fires, never planning ahead. Always grossly understaffed because it doesn't take long for people to see how this company is ran and they jump ship. Unless your desperate and can't find work anywhere else, I would not recommend this company to anyone."

If you want to work for management that behaves more like a gossipy high school clique instead of competent professionals, than look no further. you have come to the right place. approximately 70% employee turnover this year alone says something: this environment is not sustainable for career trajectory. leadership is not a term management is familiar with. communication is terrible. and finger pointing is what management does best. never take responsibility for their own actions but know how to flip the blame on someone else just so that they can cover their behinds.  management is unwilling to help to the highest degree-want to come in, do their own work, and go home. don't even bother to say good morning when they walk in. management is guilty of making belittling and condescending comments about other staff members to their current staff. who knows what they even say about you behind your back. they don't empower their staff at all. you are taught procedures not concepts. as if making pennies wasn't bad enough, you will spend the majority of your time, dreading coming to work in the mornings. my time at this job was by far the most draining and toxic point of my career and it affected every part of my life. everyone else who has moved on to greener pastures will say the same.....i know, i know, i am such a disgruntled former employee."

55,Gemini Fund Services,Mutual Fund Accountant,2015-06-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Relaxed dress code, solid benefits, co-workers are friendly and helpful for the most part. Gives a good look at the day to day workings of a mutual fund.","Pay is terrible, and there is a very much a take it or leave it policy regarding pay raise negotiation. Long hours are the norm and bonus amounts are insulting. Training is non-exisitant and you are expected to learn on the fly from your co-workers. Tuition reimbursement for continuing education is also pretty laughable, maxing out at $300 per course taken. Company maintains a turnover rate of nearly 40% a year."
56,Gemini Fund Services,Better off elsewhere,2015-06-12,1.0,Paralegal,Learning the ins and outs of mutual funds.,"The company is overall not transparent and certain departments are a nest of snakes i.e. Gemini Fund Services legal. Certain managers have been promoted as a result of being the SVP's golf buddy and dear friend. The pay and bonuses are insulting, the level and amount of work demanded for the size of the department is absurd and training is virtually non-existent. Management is a boys club of a certain class and definitely embodies the US vs. Them mentality i.e. attorneys run the show and crap on the paralegals. The SVP and certain members of his management team are UNAPPRECIATIVE. This would be a case of buyer beware. The job here is not worth it and the department has a high turnover rate. The paralegals are made the patsies of certain managers utter lack of inability to manage, delegate and supervise. This is overall not a respectful department and the since the company (NorthStar Financial Services) is privately owned it embodies the ""it's who you know"" mentality. Outlook is not good since the compay's acquisition."
57,Gemini Fund Services,Not for everyone.,2015-03-30,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Relatively friendly people to work with depending on the department. The company has ok benefits and they do treat new parents well.,The pay is extremely low and HR refuses to negotiate with new hires. Management is elitist excludes the lowly employees from their boys club. Some managers should not be managers but are in the position because they are the boss' pet. Quarterly bonuses are insulting.
