0,Gerstein Fisher,#Shade,2019-01-26,1.0,Client Advisor,Use this firm as a trampoline to another opportunity.,It's a firm where the management speaks out of both sides of their mouth.  They lie to your face and have no shame about it. Constant manipulation and lack of professionalism.  There is no career path and it's a firm filled with nepotism.  Your only chance of survival is if you are related to someone in management or the founder. A 25 year firm that still can't get it together. Don't bother interviewing if you have other opportunities.  They will say anything to get you in the door.  They have high turnover and don't have the skill set to manage seasoned professionals.
1,Gerstein Fisher,Slave drivers,2018-12-13,1.0,Client Advisor,Interesting Proprietary Funds via sudo quant,They listen to all your calls and go through your desk and computer regularly.  Very sneaky group
2,Gerstein Fisher,Stay Away,2017-12-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,None that overcome the negatives,If you like passive aggressive overbearing micromanagement this place is perfect for you.  Dishonesty is pretty prevalent as well. Many of my colleagues complained about overall compensation and that it would change frequently.
3,Gerstein Fisher,not a fan,2017-07-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,no upside at all for being here,most people get canned usually
4,Gerstein Fisher,A place to maximize your potential,2016-12-06,4.0,Client Advisory Team,"I have been working at Gerstein Fisher for 5 years. This is a great place to work where you are given the liberty of managing yourself within a team environment working together to help people reach their financial goals and to  help grow the business. These are the reasons that attracted People's United to invest in Gerstein Fisher. They were impressed with the culture at Gerstein Fisher that's been making the company very successful and will continue to do so in the future. People's United is a very client oriented company with over 175 years of history, and Gersteinfisher Fisher also embraces this belief since it's inception. The two company together will provide even better services and more types of products to our clients. And this is a great place to grow and challenging oneself and helping people reach their financial goals.",Nothing significant to touch upon.
5,Gerstein Fisher,People's Bank - what were you thinking?,2016-11-30,1.0,,None.  Brand which is why People's Bank bought them (hopefully),"Almost 20 years of experience and I have never since so much turnover in such a short time.  Also I have never been lied to and she lies occur to people's faces (clients, advisors, and employees.  TOXIC place.  Bad people"
6,Gerstein Fisher,Great Platform to Develop and Grow,2016-05-30,4.0,Client Advisory,"The culture at Gerstein Fisher is more like a start up, where all employees are encouraged to learn, grow and develop their skill set. A lot depends on your own initiative and willingness to grow, as nobody is here to spoon feed you. The CIO and senior management team are very approachable, and appreciate smart ideas and suggestions from employees. This is a place you can strive to make an actual difference, compared to a larger firm where an employee is a small part of a large machine and nothing more! Colleagues around are generally very helpful and hardworking people. This is not a 9-5 job, and people coming in with that expectation, or a more bureaucratic setting land up exiting the firm in a short span of time.",Nothing significant enough to be termed as a con
7,Gerstein Fisher,Great Place to Work,2016-05-22,5.0,Client Advisory Team,Great team environment with plenty of opportunity to grow. Fun and dynamic culture. This is a successful firm that values the contributions of its employees.,"We go out of our way to do the best for our clients even on the ""off"" hours and you may have to respond to an email or call in the evening or weekend. I see that as representing working for a firm that cares and while I do not see it as a con some people may."
8,Gerstein Fisher,How to Make it in America,2016-05-19,5.0,Private Client Advisor,"I have been with Gerstein Fisher for almost four years.  Coming into the firm, I did not know what to expect as I was transitioning from a large financial firm and all the bureaucracy that goes with it, to an independent RIA.  I was intrigued because the owner of the firm had successfully built this company from scratch to one that manages billions of dollars.  This was accomplished without any outside money or any influence from shareholders or corporate boards which left him unencumbered to be subject anyoneâ€™s interests except for those of his clients and that jelled with my moral compass.  I was also at a point in my career as well as in my life being unsure of future success, I was somewhat at a crossroads.  The founder of Gerstein Fisher, Gregg Fisher, met with me and identified there was a lot of un-tapped potential IF I was able to cultivate my skills and work hard.  And work hard I did, over the past four years, I have been immersed into the wealth management and asset management business consuming every idea and concept aimed to help clients achieve all that is important to them and have successfully been guiding countless families to the realization of their dreams and helping manage the confusion, fear and uncertainty that goes with all things financial.  Additionally, I went back to school and earned my MBA from one of the most prestigious business schools in the country, got married to a wonderful woman and we just welcomed our second child to the world.  In just under four years I went from being unsure of my career and life at large to enjoying a very well balanced and successful life.","This is not a 9-5 business, this business is an all the time business, you need to be or become highly skilled.  This is the way of any business, this is the way to Make it in America.
Not really a Con"
9,Gerstein Fisher,I implore you to stay away.,2016-05-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"My fellow employees were mostly great to work with.  Good people who work hard and have a high tolerance for BS.  Other than that, not much...(maybe the view from the office).","The CEO
The ""management team""
The environment
The pay, benefits and other perks (or lack thereof)

If you take this job, you will be lied to, micro-managed and forced to look over your shoulder every five minutes.  The CEO and ""management team"" breed an environment of condescension and ridicule.  You will be subject to office-wide ""learning moments"" when the CEO will pull 5 to 7 people together to listen to him tell you how stupid you are.  You will also forced to attend useless weekly meetings where you will be told how little you are doing to keep clients happy and help the company grow (i.e., put money in the CEO's pocket).  You will also be blamed for the exodus of client assets from the firm, even though you are a relatively new employee and there is documented proof that such clients have been unhappy with returns for three years running.  Speaking of exodus, you will watch your fellow employees leave the company in droves for all the reasons above.  Lastly, as a woman, prepared to be routinely offended by the CEO's sharp tongue when he tries be ""cool"".  If you want to be cool, pay people more, trust them to do good work and stop spying on them through the company phone and other applications used to monitor your LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.     

Do not be deceived by the positive reviews on this page.  They were written by the CEO's ""henchmen"" in an attempt to deceive prospective employees to thinking ""life at GF isn't all that bad"".  It worked for me..."
10,Gerstein Fisher,Great place to work at. Working here definitely helps broaden your knowledge and skills,2015-12-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great place to work for where you get an opportunity to learn finance, client service, wealth management and tax planning. Emphasis is given for everyone to learn about all aspects of wealth management and investments and ample opportunities provided to grow on the career path you choose. The CIO and senior members of the firm are very approachable, accessible and helpful. Team work is highly encouraged and an environment created for collaborative learning. Challenging and interesting assignments are provided with great guidance and mentoring.",Some months get busier than usual due to the nature of the industry and business eg. tax season.
11,Gerstein Fisher,My Experience,2015-11-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been working for Gerstein Fisher for many years now and have nothing but positive things to say about working here, especially compared to previous companies I have worked for. I enjoy the ""small company environment"" here because it gives me the opportunity to share my ideas with upper management,  and many have actually been acted on. Although we are growing, I believe the people around me are really here to help. When I say help, I am speaking about actually stopping their day to teach me and problem solve as a team. I have learned more from my colleagues in the last few years than ever before in my previous education. It feels good to work with such motivated and intelligent individuals.","You have to work hard, sorry. Gregg Fisher started this company from pretty much nothing 20 years ago. It didn't come easy to him, it still doesn't and so every day we are motivated to service our existing clients with the utmost amount of care and respect so that they benefit from  working with us. I often hear Gregg say, ""They should feel better having spoken to us, than not"". And so in order to do that we spend a lot of time and attention to detail with every client we meet with to make sure their experience is always a positive one, some clients and situations are easier than other. It can sometimes be overwhelming as you are trying to make sure they are having a positive experience while they are probably already uncomfortable having someone else manage their personal finances. But hey, that's the career you signed up for."
12,Gerstein Fisher,Anyone would be lucky to work at Gerstein Fisher.,2015-11-21,5.0,Private Client,I have been working at Gerstein Fisher for 7 months now and the experience has been everything I wanted and more. The work is challenging and very rewarding as it became clear from my first few days that we put our clients first and we help people. I love working at Gerstein Fisher and I love all the people that I work with.,"I'm finding it difficult to fill in this section because it is really awesome working at Gerstein Fisher. When you feel good about where you work and what you do, other things fall into place. Anyone would be lucky to work at Gerstein Fisher."
13,Gerstein Fisher,Responce,2015-10-26,5.0,Anonymous,"In reading some of the negative comments that individuals have posted here about Gerstein Fisher, I am both upset and personally offended. I have worked at Gerstein Fisher for many years now and its been an overwhelmingly positive experience for me. This is a place that allows you to be as involved with and do as much as you want if you take the initiative. It's a place with an open platform that allows individuals to work directly with different departments. When you raise your hand for help, or to ask a question, your colleagues will drop everything and extend a helping hand to you. I have learned an incredible amount from the bright individuals around me at Gerstein Fisher.

The negative commentators on this site might not fully understand the industry we are in - THIS IS NOT A 9-TO-5 JOB. Time, effort, and dedication are the name of the game here; some of us get it and can take what that entails, but many cannot. Not being able to doesn't make you any less, but this may not be the business for you. 

These posts personally upset me because I would not spend years working at a place where I didn't feel like the firm and its people were doing the right thing. We take our business seriously and work hard, together, to make sure we provide our clients with the best possible service. 

When reading the negative comments here, please keep in mind that there are two sides to every story.",The Pros section should cover my full review
14,Gerstein Fisher,Stay away,2015-08-09,1.0,,There really aren't any that I can think of,Terrible work environment and no opportunity for personal success.  The system is set up so only one person benefits.
15,Gerstein Fisher,Find ANY Other Place to Work,2015-07-31,1.0,,"Great, smart, hard-working people overall. Well except founder and his ""management team"".","Narcissistic founder, below industry pay, no upward opportunities, paranoid and micro-manage management team (they don't have the aptitude to be management and are SOLELY in that role due to the fact they just comply to whatever outlandish request founder has that day. Don't have client's best interest, SOLE focus is to bring in more money which will go to founder and not shared with employees. Employee turnover below management and so many small clients makes and untenable expectations of founder, make for an AWFUL work environment."
16,Gerstein Fisher,Good Experience,2015-07-19,4.0,Client Advisory Team,"The Gerstein Fisher approach is focused on client experience and putting its clients first. It's nice to work with a group of people with such a strong work ethic.
There is a strong belief in educating its clients and employees.
I work with a great team of people, especially Gregg who have been and continue to be very supportive through different life circumstances.
We are a very fast growing organization.","There are times you have to work on the weekends, because we work with our clients financial situation, if they send an e-mail with a question at night or on the weekend, we want to get back to them right away."
17,Gerstein Fisher,Horrible place to work,2015-07-16,1.0,Quantitative Research Analyst,The workers are generally nice. We get to order food off of Seamless every day for lunch,"The management think they can control your lives outside of work. We were given company phones, but were told we had to get rid of our own phones and only use the company number. A few months later they asked for some of the our phones for ""maintenance"". Mine was one of them. When I got my phone back the parental controls were on and I couldn't use some of the functionality. I didn't trust it so I cracked it using a computer program to see what they had done. It turned out that they had put on the tracking feature so my movement could always be tracked, even at home ... this was my only phone remember. They also joined the managements iCloud account and downloaded all of my contacts to his account. Don't trust the them at all."
18,Gerstein Fisher,"High turnover, incompetent management",2015-06-25,1.0,,My coworkers were great people.,"The people in positions of power routinely abuse and belittle the staff through insane, controlling rules, recording when you come in in the morning regardless of how late you stay, watching you like a hawk, and not allowing coworkers to talk to each other. Creativity is impossible when your manager doesn't know what they are doing. They have also lied about compensation to potential employees and let people go because of political games. I cheer every time a friend of mine leaves."
19,Gerstein Fisher,Read the previous emails,2015-06-09,1.0,Quantitative Research Analyst,There are no pros that I can think of.,"The bad reviews are all genuine, the good reviews are written by HR."
