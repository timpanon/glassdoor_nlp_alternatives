0,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,Bottom feeder compensation,2022-04-02,1.0,Director,"Above average deal flow, colleagues generally willing to help, if you don’t care about making more than your salary then you’ll love it and never be fired.",Worst compensation of any reputable restructuring firms.
1,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,Worst employment experience hands down!,2022-03-08,2.0,Associate,The salary was pretty decent,"Good ole boys network, speckling of people of color (particularly African American). The boys at the top are extremely condescending and berating. High turnover of associates. Misogyny & borderline underhanded racism. Worst employment experience thus far!"
2,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,Decent place to work,2022-03-02,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Great office location
- Engaging work",- Lack of transparency when providing feedback
3,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,Focused on cost rather than excellence,2020-07-30,1.0,Vice President,"For entry level people, it's a place to practice.",Ian Ratner is an accountant rather than a manager with vision or strategy. He sees one thing: cost.
4,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,GlassRatner (GR) is not a reputable advisory firm,2020-01-02,1.0,Senior Managing Director,It is amusing to watch GR employees try to sell any kind of advisory service to anyone who would like a free lunch or who will listen. The potential client never returns GR follow-up calls.,"Every year Ian decides to change the company's expertise to reflect the latest and greatest in advisory services with absolutely no experience in the industry /service.  Jason runs behind Ian like a man servant. Paul and Sam are old, sad drinkers who should be in the pasture.  The rest of the employees cannot find a new job due to incompetence/laziness."

6,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,property manager,2017-11-08,4.0,Property Manager,"I had great experience there using my skills and accomplishing duties too there high standards of paperwork, community relations,and a feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day",They do restructure and sell properties so yours may be sold
7,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,great company,2017-08-22,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"great work opportunities, interesting work products, sharp management team","insurance premiums are higher than past jobs, but that could be true elsewhere"
8,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,Evil Overlords,2016-03-07,1.0,Property Manager,You get a chance to learn what NOT to do in property management.,Everything! The District & Regional managers are a joke and have no idea what they are doing. It is like highschool and run by a clique of people and if you don't socialize with them and kiss their backside then you will not advance. They are always late paying vendors;they tell them 30 days and don't pay until they get threatened with legal action. They treat employees like dirt and there are no benefits.
9,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,If you need someone to draw you pictures like your 2 it's great,2015-08-15,2.0,Property Manager,Decent salary but you earn it,The Indianapolis Reginal had no clue what she was doing. It was great before she came. Ins is a joke. They are clueless how to run a property
10,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,Great learning experience,2015-07-15,3.0,Associate,"Great learning experience, lots of hands on involvement. Great top management.",Smaller company lacks brand name.
11,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,Number 2 on the list of terrible entities I've worked for,2014-10-18,1.0,Leasing Consultant,"The only pros to working at a property under GlassRatner is no minimum wage pay and my manager. She's the only reason why I stayed as long as I did. The woman has more experience than upper management and could do their jobs two times over. Oh wait, she does do that.","There is no room for growth under GlassRatner. Management has no real presence at the property and they expect you to turn apartments on shoe string budgets. We were even asked why we hadn't been replacing appliances for move outs while residents still resided in units. Simple: if we put a shiny new stove in an apartment for the pending applicant and the current resident decides to use the stove or breaks an element where does that leave us? I've been working in Property Management for almost 2 years and even I can tell you that GlassRatner doesn't know what they are doing. There's no rhyme or rhythm to their ""structure"". They don't care about properties they just want to collect money each month. It takes weeks, on several occasions, months, to hear back from anybody regarding transfers, policy changes or dire P.O. approvals. There's no pay increases or training. If they acquire a new property half a state away they want to know if you can work at it. To top it off, if I get sick I can't seek treatment because the healthcare literally won't cover anything until I pay a very high deductible that I wouldn't be able to meet until 2 years from now. The position I have is not for people looking for growth it's for people who still live with there parents and don't have as many expenses."
12,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,It's what you get if you let an accountant be a CEO,2014-09-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Can't think of any.  The office space looks decent, especially in New York and Atlanta, but it's just for giving clients a false sense of respectability.","So many that I do not know where to begin.  No matter how hard Ian tries to paint a nice picture of the firm on Glassdoor, it's a firm that has no respect for its employees.  The firm is in cash squeezes constantly, and Ian Ratner is constantly trying to cut cost.  The result is that good people leave, and only dregs stay.

Even when cash is tight, the firm is still filled with political infights. Instead of banding together to get through difficult periods, partners all have “their people"".  If you are a partner's ""guy"", you get paid a bonus even with sub-par performance. If you aren't, it doesn't matter if you pulled in tons of revenue from your billing.  Again, the result is that people who can pull in revenue leave for other firms."
13,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,Disorganized,2014-08-16,2.0,Leasing Consultant,I was able to enter the real estate industry,No bonuses. No commissions. No real training. No human resources department.
14,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,"HR policy is:  burn through people.  They let disillusioned people leave, and hire some more.",2014-05-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Some work can be put on your resume and look good.,"""Discretionary bonus"" here means ""Rarely any bonus"".  This ""discretionary"" is not the same as the ""discretionary"" in other firms.

When an employee passes the one-year anniversary, that's when he/she gets to know how this place works, and that's when this person leaves, if he/she is good.  Needless to say, those who stick around are those who can't find a new place.

The firm shrugs, and hires one more.

Ask about the turnover rate here before you take a job."
15,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,GlassRatner discriminates against African Americans; has Biased Nepotism; and Lie to Owners in colusion with Trimont Rea,2014-02-28,1.0,Property Manager,"They will allow Nepotism among their white employees. And they like to hire individuals with no real knowledge, experience or credentials.","They do not pay vendors that have actually completed work on their property and they will love to hear rumors amongst their employees. Drama is something they love; it keeps them busy and they do not work for the asset, although they do a good job making the Owner's and Owner's Representatives think they do."
16,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,"Excellent company to work for with great leadership, tremendous vision and excellent future prospects.",2013-12-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The firm is rapidly growing the range and diversity of its service offering and is committed to establishing itself as an elite full-service financial advisory firm.  Exposure to senior management and the interaction from the very top of the organization to the most junior level employees is almost unmatched compared to other firms of its size and stature.  The senior management team has the vision, drive, skill-set, intelligence and commitment necessary to achieve the goals it has set for the firm. Best of all, hard work is both recognized and rewarded.  Although the firm has grown very quickly since its inception a decade ago, it is still a true meritocracy and bureaucratic policies are almost non-existent.  I have worked for both the largest possible financial institution in the world and also for smaller boutique organizations and GlassRatner provides the best of both worlds.  The leadership is as strong as any bulge bracket firm and hard work and ability do not go unnoticed.  I would recommend GlassRatner to professionals at any stage of their career.  It is an excellent place for junior professionals to learn a develop a dynamic skill-set to advance their career while also providing senior team members with the platform and resources necessary to excel.","The only cons will be remedied over time.  The firm has its roots in the niche sectors of forensic accounting, restructuring and real estate services and has only recently committed significant resources to expanding the range and diversity of its service offering to include traditional financial advisory and investment banking services.  As such, it will take time for the firm to establish its credibility and increase deal flow in these sectors.  As a new entrant to the higher profile and more lucrative investment banking field, compensation will continue to lag behind peers in this sector for the time being.  However, with that said, the senior management of the firm has demonstrated its commitment to building a true full service financial advisory firm and compensation will improve as deal flow increases. Experience and feedback from long-term employees provides evidence of generosity in pay packages as revenue and fee generation grows. Unlike many firms that attempt to grow very fast but then are forced to layoff employees en mass if deal flow does not keep pace with the increase in head count and average compensation, GlassRatner has taken an aggressive yet cautious approach to its growth strategy so that it can maintain what I would consider a ""family atmosphere"" and significantly diminish the possibility that it will be forced to make mass layoffs.  There is nothing more detrimental to employee moral, productivity and firm culture than than a day-to-day fear of losing your job due to bureaucratic reasons that are completely unrelated to performance.  I believe that senior management is acutely aware of this dynamic and places a high value on the culture it has worked so hard to create and has shown significant prudence during this expansion initiative in order to protect against this worst-case scenario. It is a rare occurrence that the most senior level employees show such empathy towards the rank and file and for this I applause them."
17,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,Stay away from this firm!,2013-09-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"No micro-management from superiors, opportunity to work in various case (M&A, debt restructuring, forensic accounting, etc.)","Toxic work environment, extremely low pay, lack of opportunity for advancement in any degree, poor work/life balance, and high turnover."
18,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,Entrepreneurial firm but dealing with growing pains - high turnover and limited upside for junior employees,2013-09-04,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Lean deal teams and plenty of opportunities to work on a range of assignments.,High turnover and limited opportunity for junior employees to move up.
19,GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group,Changes,2013-01-24,5.0,Business Manager,Positive work experience with new senior management team. Thorough communication from the top of the ladder all the way down. Reginal and Vice President are always available to you and actually care. My Regional has been with GlassRatner for several years and I see how different things are handled now at a higher level and it has definately trickled down and made my job easier!,Wish that vision was offered in benefits package.
