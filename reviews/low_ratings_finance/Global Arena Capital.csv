Furthermore they won't tell you that in 2015, hardly any people are dumb enough to buy stock over the phone from a stranger and when the market starts going down, all their accounts bail and they are left on the unemployment line.","Telemarketers posing as ""financial advisors"" in fancy suits. You know when you see a job ad and it says 6 figure potential in your first year and you think it's too good to be true? Well, it is.
