0,Global Infrastructure Management,Good place to work,2022-04-01,5.0,Associate,"Highly successful fund. Solid experience if you're looking for good deal flow with large, complex transactions and thoughtful team members. Great, close-knit group of associates and SAs.",Deal process is pretty rigorous. Could have more sponsored outings/events.
1,Global Infrastructure Management,Great Experience here,2021-11-04,5.0,QC Scientist,"Great Team
Well managed lab
Friendly Atmosphere
Good interdepartmental contact
Good support from management",The commute and traffic can be rough
2,Global Infrastructure Management,Incredibly challenging place to work; expected to work constantly with zero time off.,2021-11-04,1.0,Senior Associate,"- Interesting deal activity
- Good resume builder","- Senior management is quite disconnected from junior employees
- Communication within the firm is atrocious; everyone seems terrified of voicing their opinion as it's an incredibly hierarchal organization
- You should expect to work 24/7, time off is rare"
3,Global Infrastructure Management,Bad culture with fake people,2021-09-09,1.0,Private Equity Intern,"-assigned to this firm by a well-known diversity summer program
-GIP gave us an almost guaranteed full-time offer, which is a backup if we are desperate. but from this, we realized from the start that they are not a top tier firm","-we thought the work (and project) was frivolous and uninteresting, and the people were fake/unprofessional
-we weren't given ""real"" work, but we heard of horrid hours (frequent 4am nights for associates. analysts must get worked harder.)"
4,Global Infrastructure Management,"Great company, lacks career progression in some departments",2021-08-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Decent salary and the people, culture and office are great.",Lacks career progression for anyone outside of the investment team. Unless you're doing the deals you will be overlooked.
5,Global Infrastructure Management,"Go elsewhere, super dull environment",2021-07-02,1.0,Executive Assistant,"Given extra PTO end of year usually, overtime, snacks in pantry. Nothing spectacular","Run away. Terrible work environment and worse if you’re part of the admin team. Expect cattiness and severe unfairness. The person in charge of the admin team is by far the worst person you can work/report to. This person is a liar and lacks empathy. They’ll threaten you that you’re not doing a great job and make you feel as if you’re really doing horrible when in reality the executive you support is absolutely satisfied. This person has a tendency to not credit you for good work and instead wants to always make you feel inferior. Absolutely no growth here as an admin especially, and the senior leadership are typical finance folks that give zero care towards you. They walk past you as if you’re a nobody. You’ll be told something else when joining and once you do join, you’re out to fend for yourself. No structure, no training, nothing. The assistants there look miserable. It’s obvious this person that the assistants are under lacks self love and projects insecurities towards others, and is also obviously making their own little “team” of favorites. Leaving the company was the best decision."
6,Global Infrastructure Management,Good time,2021-04-18,5.0,Consultant,I enjoyed my time here,There wasn't really anything bad!
7,Global Infrastructure Management,"Vibrant, close knit, generous, hard working",2021-01-05,4.0,Owner/Director,"Good working environment, good social side, exciting activity","Could improve delegation, 24/7 at times"
8,Global Infrastructure Management,More of a Global Individualist Program,2020-02-12,1.0,Senior Associate,"Although it may have done great investments and made a name but it isn't truly a good place to work for.  Great senior leadership team but hardly do they give thought for fellow hard working juniors, atleast as a noble charity they could pay some heed to it.","Global in name only, hardly one would know other person across offices or rarely anyone sees any re-location. Mostly all locations work in silos.
Very shocking but yes discrimination does exist- partners too busy making money to pay any heed to maintain the cultural balance. Executive committee not close to ground realities.
Not much company wide coordination, no common excursions, almost zero fun except some drink outings!"
9,Global Infrastructure Management,Terrible culture and environment,2019-04-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The benefits package is good and having GIP on your resume may look attractive to future PE employers because they have had some very successful funds,"- Horrible environment with a very high employee turnover in all groups
-In general people feel overworked and burned out
- Lack of leadership and development. All management cares about is their pockets
- Not very diverse in terms of minorities and women, most notoriously in the management team. Although they have hired a few more women in recent years, most women complain about how hard it is to work at GIP
- It's full of cliques, like a high school, full of people who smile in your face and talk about you behind your back, including your manager
- Promotion and compensation does not seem to be merit based. If the people at the top like you, you may be happy with your compensation
- If someone doesn't like you, they will find an excuse to fire you, even if you get your work done
- When someone quits, after they have already left the firm, some people in these cliques make up lies about them, including that they did not quit but were fired instead.  This makes no sense, what is the purpose of doing this?"
