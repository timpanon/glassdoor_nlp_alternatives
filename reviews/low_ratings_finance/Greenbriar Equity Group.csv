0,Greenbriar Equity Group,Not a good company to work for.,2022-01-05,1.0,Service Writer,They will hire almost anyone.,When they purchased the company I worked for they revised everyone’s pay plan. 80% of the employees lost about 30%. The worst part was their medical self insurance scam. Many of us could not get covered by any medical practices in the area. The HR department told us to pay out of pocket and submit receipts. No one I know was ever reimbursed. Luckily most of us found new jobs within the first 100 days.
