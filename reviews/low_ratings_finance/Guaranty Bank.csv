Flexible hours. Overtime was great.,"Poor communication from upper management. Upper management left my previous branch without a branch manager or a supervisor while previously knowing the lost of a leader. Hopes were given of growth within the branch and company then discontinued the branch manager and assistant position to benefit the branch and companies profitability. Very poor organization and management. Most questions asked to new regional manager could not return answers for 3-5 months. There are times important questions in emails and calls are not received for weeks and months but when someone gets a sale, an email from the regional manager is sent to everyone in seconds. 

The company lacks in hiring new employees to branches that only have a few, as in two, employees covering all the 10 hour shifts per day within the week, including weekends too, for branch profitability, causing help to needed from other employees who lives 1-2 hours away to cover.

Sales incentives are extremely taxed along with any other bonus so sales goals are almost worthless. But again because of the shortage in many of the branches due to high turnover there are lots of hours for overtime.

Where the employees who are parents needs to leave due to family emergencies, they are told,"" if you don't find coverage, then you can't leave. "" You would think a fully staffed branch would be able to sacrafice one of their employees to let the other go."

My whole work experience was absolutely horrible. The company has a super high turn-over rate. Literally every day I received an email of a new job opening. The company barely reverse overdraft fees for customers and employees even when the overdraft was not the customer's or the employees fault. The company only cares about numbers. They are not human at all. They purposely rip people off. Very poor management structure. Because management is poor, employees do not know how to handle customer's financial needs. It is very easy to move up within the company because someone is always leaving. If you make a simple mistake it is a automatic write up. The company relies on employees (mainly Sales Associates, Personal Bankers, and Assistant Branch Managers) to bring in sales. If you do not reach your goal for one month you get put on an improvement plan. Employees only look out for themselves. The company does not know what the word team means. The customer service and back office gives out different information to confuse customers and employees. The company hired me a week after they closed down seven branches in the beginning of the year. I did not know they closed down branches until I got into training. When I first got hired I was suppose to start training in the beginning of the month, however due to them having a high turnover rate I could not start training until a month after I got hired. The customers are always angry because the company is always messing up. The management only care about themselves so tellers and personal bankers barely get breaks or vacations."

150,Guaranty Bank,Business Development Manager,2015-06-23,1.0,Business Development Manager,Their core mission to provide financial solutions to blue collar workers is sound.

When you're fully staffed the managers work with you to get time off, there is a lot of flexibility to the daily routine, and you get to take on many roles. Interacting with customer is fun and learning all about the industry is very telling.","Pleasing the customer, the manager (+their manager), and doing it in budget is not a common occurrence; would be like getting triple 7's on a slot machine. No matter who you please by giving a fee reversal, going the extra mile, or trying to stay within profitability one of those parties is going to be mad at you for not meeting their goals. That will remain true your entire time with this company. 

Just about the only form of marketing this company employs is word-of-mouth. So if you need to get those 25 accounts this month it's certainly not going to come from any other form of marketing. 

The company has next-to NO marketing budget for branches whats-so-ever; so you'll have to draft a plan to the powers-that-be to get any support to make your goals.

The company sold off its mortgage division and recently downsized majorly; if you don't make your monthly goals odds are you'll be cut too. 

You would be this company's perfectly employee if you can 1) sell ice to an eskimo, 2) be a Yes man, 3) and find carrot-and-stick incentives rewarding."

Not going to lie it was nice the short time it was me. But when around 8 people quit in a year you think upper management would wonder why.

166,Guaranty Bank,I do not recommend...,2015-02-01,1.0,Sales Associate,"The Levy family who started and is running the company seems to care and be decent people, and of course you can get a paycheck.  The particular branch manager I was going to work with was open, professional, had great soft skills, and seemed to really care (not my impression of the other area branch managers).","The business model relies on employees for all marketing so there is high pressure to produce using a business model that requires having branch offices in the small rental spaces in grocery stores and employees walking around the store doing cold-sales to get new customers.  Their computer systems are completely disorganized and need to be consolidated, they operate on a low budget, and during the 2.5 week training class they made it public that they were closing many of the area branches within the next two months (Atlanta, GA area) because they were not creating enough revenue to keep them affordable (even without having a marketing budget and paying the cheap rental price of a small space in the front of a grocery store), including branches that people in my training class were designated to work in.  The fact they hired people to work in branches they were about to close demonstrates the kind of unconsolidated thinking that is part of the culture.

Just for the Atlanta, GA area they have one training class after another to try to keep positions filled because there is such a high burnout/turnover rate.  Two people simply stopped showing up during the first three days of the training class (I verified this with the trainer.) and most of the rest of the class was lazy and barely participating, talking when the trainer left the room about how the job would require more work than they thought it took to work in a bank.

The employee HR interface is dysfunctional.  If you want to click the link to email HR, it loads an email window, but the ""to"" field is blank, so you can't send the email to the right person.  You can't load your W-2 because the application is so buggy it can't generate a PDF.  The atmosphere isn't professional, is sloppy, and everything is about opening new accounts with little employee development.  Basically unless you're management or the local trainers or investigators, you have to carry the load of getting enough new accounts to try to keep your local branch solvent.  It's a high-pressure environment with little reward.  They expect everyone who is a Sales Associate to be both a skilled sales person AND a teller that never makes a mistake, even when you're new, because they can't afford to absorb even small errors.

There is no opportunity for culture, peer, or management reviews because as a Sales Associate there is no interest in anything but you producing your sales quota.  There is little provided for employee enrichment, although if you're a  high producer you can advance to other positions, but for each successful person, there is a lot of carnage from people who were burnt out, discouraged, and left behind.

During the 2.5 week training class the class was dialed into a company-wide conference call in which the President announced the coming branch closures, and as a result the people in my class hired to work in those branches could not get a hold of their branch managers, as if the managers checked out on their job, walking out and leaving, or checking out while they were at work just biding their time.  It was so sad but another red flag.

I left at the end of training after getting a clear picture that this is not a company to work for to develop a career there.  I believe in giving a 2-week notice no matter what, but was told since I was still in training I could leave on good terms without notice.  I was told by the trainer that only I and one other person in the class seemed to be motivated to do our best.  That was also very disappointing, but I agreed with her, as I sat in that class, and looked around me at the attitudes most people in the class had."

180,Guaranty Bank,Disappointing and dead end job,2014-07-30,1.0,IT Service Desk Agent,The management does not understand proper managing techniques and you can therefore work virtually unlimited overtime and make twice your salary. Expectations are low so as long as you show up and sort of do work you won't be fired.,"Company culture is extremely poor. The reason for that is the company has not been profitable for 6+ years and is getting cease and desist letters from the government. Because of this there is an attitude of defeat and there is no energy or excitement in the company. 

The management complain constantly of how backwards the company is. One manager in particular would say ""do you see the name on the side of the building?"" every time I tried to suggest better ways of doing business and asked him why we were doing certain things backwards . There was no desire to fix problems or make things better because the company as a whole would not accept it. There were very few forward thinkers and any time there was a good initiative to help lead the department to a better way of doing business it was met with extreme negativity. 

There is a negative feeling of being over-worked, under-payed and under-appreciated. There are a few good workers within the IT department but they never last very long because they realize that this company is failing and there is not much job security. There is also very little if any inter-department collaboration. Every part of the technology team as a whole did things their own way, did not document anything, and refused to share any good information with other IT teams. When you asked to learn more about a process you would get shut down almost every time. When someone from another department tried to bring to light a process that was failing or something that may not be done correctly from a different team they would be met with massive backlash instead of a humble attitude to learn and grow. The reason for this attitude is because the IT department as a whole is failing and nobody wanted to be the person or team that was blamed for something failing. Instead of looking at it as an opportunity to improve themselves or their team they would shut down any and all constructive criticism and make sure the finger is not pointed at themselves at all costs.

If you are looking to build a rewarding career and be challenged then I would not consider Guaranty Bank. If you are looking to do the bare minimum and just skate by in the workplace then you will feel very comfortable with this company. Unless serious changes are made they will lose all of the good talent that they have and eventually the ship will sink."

I could do my shopping after work that was nice. Got the good sales.,"The staff was dishonest.  The bank encouraged employees to do unethical things to make goals.  The regional manager new and encouraged employees to open checking accounts for people that wanted savings to make goals. When customers complained all the bankers involved lost their jobs,  but not the regional manager. When I found out all of this was going on I resigned.  Did not want to be a part of any dishonest behavior."

185,Guaranty Bank,going nowhere and fast,2014-07-10,1.0,Branch Manager,flexible working hours in the branch network,very demanding and stressful environment.  The upper management of the bank has turned itself completely over 3 times in the last year and each new person brings further changes to the corporate structure and culture.  Still no lending has been okayed by the federal government as the cash reserves of the bank are not sufficient enough to support the practice.  Guaranty's mission has become one of a customer at any cost and are willing to approve anyone provided they pay for the account and its monthly services. This is a very non-employee focused company and you quickly become a number.

They're a great group to work with and, in general, senior leadership is friendly and down-to-earth. It makes for an environment that at least seems transparent and gives employees the feel that they understand the challenges facing the organization. They are great about helping employees maintain a work-life balance, and Doug and Jerry really uphold the company values. Employees have the sense that senior leaders have employees' and customers' best interests in mind when making company decisions.","The Bank does not see professional development as a priority, which can stagnate one's career. Managers have so many other responsibilities that they do not have time left to appropriately coach and manage their people, which can lead to a disconnect in terms of expectations for results. The company continues to make decisions with a ""loss aversion"" mentality. They continue down paths where money has already been lost because of the investment, rather than carving out new paths for success."
188,Guaranty Bank,Overworked & Underpaid,2014-05-08,2.0,Assistant Manager,Pretty good benefits and discounts,"Too much emphasis on sales & new customer acquisition, not enough on maintaining current, loyal customer base.

Also, ideas that were suggested to create business growth were shut down and no legitimate reason was given.

Training is very laid back, the trainers were easy to get along with.",Unrealistic goals set for you by corporate. I worked in a slow branch that was expected to open more than 30 accounts in a month. Nearly impossible if Guaranty Bank is for the hard working family and they place a branch in an upscale part of town. You are basically an over glorified teller at this bank as a personal banker. No responsibilities other than calling your branch support to do your work for you.

194,Guaranty Bank,Company Currently In Decline,2014-03-21,3.0,Branch Manager,"If you don't mind sales its a pretty easy job if you can hit your numbers. Bank is only really focused on checking account growth which doesn't seem to be going that well currently but you're not really required to have advanced banking skills that other banks require like lending, investments, and insurance. Its more like a starter company for your banking career. Lots of turnover means lots of promotion opportunities as long as you can avoid leaving yourself.",Company has tunnel vision towards checking and checking fee revenue. Corporate and retail have a huge disconnect and almost seem against one another. Communication is horrible and incentives/reporting are not trusted by branch employees so a manager must always manage employee moral.

No one seems to know the ""formula"" for how commission is paid and you only get paid if you meet/exceed your goal. They don't offer any loans. Everyone in the branch does all jobs, there's no one in an office that specializes in solving customer issues or opening accounts. No matter how small a check is, there is a hold til at least the next day. You have to call on any check over a certain dollar amount to verify it was issued."

You'll be called Slave Labor buy the regional managers and be expected to ignore your friends and family just to make there lives easier as they continuously go on vacations and deny your requests for a day off.
You'll get paid half as much as you would at any other bank.
It's all about the sales who cares about service, and when I say sales I mean Checking Checking Checking, I don't think this bank realizes that there are other products that a bank can sell.
Don't expect to be appreciated here, yes you lead the team in sales today, what will you do for me tomorrow.
The Incentive plan is a joke they will sell you on it as wow you can double your salary and then you blow the sales out of the water and yes Two Hundred dollars before taxes wow what a reward for working 60 plus hours a week when they guaranty you'll never work over 40.

This sort of failure at the top of the company has cascaded down to the branch level where immense pressure is put on everyone from the sales associates to the branch managers to reach unrealistic sales goals. If you don't believe me, just mention sales around a Guaranty Bank branch employee, or check their rating on bankrate.com in regards to capital levels. Consequently, their heavy sales focus has led to a breakdown in customer service company wide, so much so, that in quarterly, which were once monthly assistant manager meetings, we had to take time to discuss our ""service issues and how we might improve upon them."""

If you ever want to move to another instituation, then you would already know the foundations, hot to run a branch. You could even apply to a manager position!","Depending on the person, you may not like in aisle sale. All of the best banks are located all in Kroger grocery stores. So a Personal banker positions at Best Bank is to basic go throughout the Kroger, walk up to customers and sale a account. Note: You may get discourage with the number of ""no's(depending which branch). Remember: Each ""no"" you get, your that much closer to a ""yes""

No Personal banker 2 nor upper sales positions"
216,Guaranty Bank,Worst bank ever,2013-01-23,1.0,Leadership,"Turn over is much higher then industry average, therefore getting promoted is easy, with little training and skill","The executive leadership has no idea what they are doing. Throughout the last several years they have made poor and unprofitable decisions. The entire leadership team vacated. They have changed successful products like clear coverage that consumers already had without grandfathering existing customers in. They have no account management system. They have employee and customer attrition that is astronomical. They sold off thier shelter mortgage division to raise capital and yet they are still in hot water with the occ. Recently they increased wages to be more competitive but they are still significantly lower then everyone else, hence employee turnover. They do not offer any type of lending, consumer finance, or investment products, and therefore are considerd by many to be more of a cash advance place then an actual bank. Furthermore, although you can get your foot in the door, I have spoken to many recruiters from a multitude of banks who purposely pass up on candidates whom have worked at best bank or guaranty bank since there personal bankers and all other positions are not trained as you would expect a banker to be since they don't offer the product range that all other banks offer. 
     In addition the company suffers from an identity crisis and has some of the poorest marketing campaigns ever conceived. In the 5 states they have locations in they are known as either best bank or guaranty bank, this defeats any reputation, respect, or branding you might hope to achieve with a potential customer. In comparison to other instore banks the marketing campaigns do nothing to draw attention and captivate potential customers. The turn around time to receive any offer they present such as 75 dollars when you set up direct deposit is over 3 months long. As comparative banks sign profit sharing deals and long term contracts/leases with thier grocery store partners I anticipate that best bank will fall by the wayside since they have no traditional stand alone branches in 90 percent of their markets."

First note, there are many companies that run under the name Guaranty Bank, and some people have given reviews for some of these other companies (some with not the greatest reputation) under this Guaranty Bank.

The company has a great work/life balance; they really don't want anyone working more than 40 hours a week.  To show it, certain levels of programmers still make an hourly rate, and even earn overtime!

The Vacation system can be a blessing or a curse, depending on what kind of background you come from.  Instead of giving you so many sick and personal days, you only get PTO days.  So, when you are sick you are taking a vacation day.  However, you accrue these days VERY quickly (By the first of the year after your have been hired, you will be getting just shy of four weeks a year.
