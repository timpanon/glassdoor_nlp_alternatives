4,"GunnAllen Financial, Inc.",I dont know..... they made me do this.,2009-08-12,2.0,,This company is good for those who are well seasoned advisors looking for true independence.,"A bit too independent at times. I believe for the sake of fees and how much revenue a certain branch brings in, compliance tendsto get a little to laxed on activities on how business obtained. (dont ask dont tell) which can ultimately put the firm's name and reputation (the little that there is already) at risk."
