1,HFC,Just Business,2022-03-09,2.0,Junior Underwriter,Remote work is available and utilized primarily,"While the preach family/work life balance, they only practice it for certain individuals. 
Training in a new position is minimal and lackluster - they love the phrase “sink or swim” but expect you to swim with just a couple of days of training (where the trainer is incredibly impatient and not really a people person) and then you can watch videos or hope your team lead doesn’t get annoyed with the questions."

19,HFC,It all comes down to your branch manager.,2015-03-19,2.0,Loan Officer,"Not a bad way to start your career in financial sales. Decent training, and a large corporation does allow some chance for continuing employment if you have to move with your family. Best thing is there is a base salary, which is a nice benefit since so many jobs in mortgage industry are straight commission.","I did NOT have a good experience, so please take this with a grain of salt. I got hired into an office that was not at all stable, so there were managers cycling through way too frequently, and each had no experience in management, and just happened to be a decent sales person, so they got promoted. That causes a TON of problems, from solid deals suddenly dying after 2 months of work when a manager makes a 5 minute 'preclose' phone call to the client (costing me hundreds of dollars in commission), to horrible issues with managers who can generally get away with treating employees like dirt, as long as they put up monthly numbers. I had more than three times the experience in the mortgage industry as any of my managers, and was simply looking for a 40hour/week job that I could leave at work at the end of the day. I always felt like I was being managed by people who didn't have a clue about effective motivation. Unfortunately, at the time I was with the company, there was almost no way to  bring issues to HR's attention without negatively impacting your own job and reputation with the company. Thus you had a number of employees constantly huddled up complaining about the (horrible!) managers they cycled through the office, and no way to bring any issues to the parties who might actually improve the situation. Accepting this job was, without a doubt, the worst professional mistake of my career."
