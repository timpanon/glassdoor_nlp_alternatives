14,HFP Capital Markets,great experience,2013-08-18,4.0,Trainee,long pay int he long run,hard to start as a trainee
15,HFP Capital Markets,I was lied to from day one!!!!,2013-07-17,1.0,Registered Representative,"They will sponsor you for your series 7 & 63, they buy good leads. It is a young environment where dont have to be very professional","Its essentially a pyramid scheme where thew top 5 guys make money off the jr. brokers before firing you or bringing in new ones. They tell you the obligation (50 qualified accounts, recently changed to 100) is the tough part and if you can make it through that, the big money starts to come in. However, very few guys are given the chance to actually get through the obligation, and 80% of the brokers that do were fired within 2 months of getting through their obligation losing any chance to make real money because the accounts you get no longer go to your senior broker.

Senior brokers are uneducated for the most part, while the other half is either college dropouts or just high school like the head of retail. There are no CFA's or MBA's and they have an inferiority complex to all the bigger firms. HFP is one of the least paying firms out there.

There is no talk or understanding of the market as you are just told to push the product they need to be sold. Although not a boiler room (because they are selling real products) they are selling very bad investments under the guise of being safe that even the head guys do not understand. I am aware of plently of securities that HFP sold of companies the ended up going bankrupt.

You expected to work 3 saturdays a month and until 9pm during the week (In at 7am)

Most of the senior brokers do not have clean licenses and you can look that up on brokercheck, the head of the firm can not even sell securities in a bunch of states and another state is suing the firm. They are currently spending a lot of money on PR and want only good things to be seen when you search them. Including this site so be aware of what looks like what may be done by a PR pro, it likely is because nobody is happy at this firm except for the top 5 guys. Even the few mid-level guys I have heard are scared for their jobs now that they are making really good money because they do not reach quotas. And because of how the contract is structured they can fire you whenever they want down the road no questions ask. You have to sign it... Best of luck though"
16,HFP Capital Markets,"Bad environment, horrible people, and no sleep",2013-07-03,1.0,Stockbroker Trainee,"Probably a good introduction into finance culture on Wall Street, although not sure. I did not go to any other firms before or after to compare.

If you have any 4 year degree and can speak clearly, you will probably get hired.

Fully sponsored for Series 7 and 63 exams.

If the job is right for you, the money can grow exponentially.","They hire everyone they can because they know that their job is demanding and most will not stay. I advise people who are looking for respect and a positive work environment to not work there. 

Through my experience here, I have found that most of the people there are vocally racist and sexist. They tend to talk about women in a very demeaning way. Some of the brokers there had the maturity of a stereotypical college frat boy, and in a way being a trainee is their version of hazing.

The job is 100% cold calling until you are licensed. They do not want a trainee to do anything else but cold call. They will reprimand you for asking questions about the product that they sell, company policy, and/or the market trends as a whole. Its a closed environment and don't expect to make any friends. They conduct their business very strictly and nothing else.

I was nothing more than a glorified intern as a trainee. I ran to get the brokers coffee multiple times a day and got paid very little, barely covering the costs of commute and taxes.

The hours are very long. As a trainee, you are required to be there at 7:15am every day. If you are late, you should expect a stern reprimand; and there is no concept of a sick day to them. As a broker once one passes the 7 and the 63 exams, you should expect to work from 7:15am until very late at night cold calling as well as Saturdays.

In addition, every new trainee is forced to make one of these upon your first day. Their ratings here were very low, and they made their interns and trainee give great reviews of the place to make recruiting easier. Don't be fooled like I was, I can tell by the language of some of those posts that a supervisor was standing behind them as they wrote it."
