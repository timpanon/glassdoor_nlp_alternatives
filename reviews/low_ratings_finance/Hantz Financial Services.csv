16,Hantz Financial Services,Horrible Cult Culture,2020-05-18,1.0,Equity Specialist,You will learn what a toxic culture looks like.,"Too many to think of. I worked in the back office for a year. My original expectations weren’t high starting with the interview, when the VP of the company told me how I could become a millionaire if I stayed with them for 15 years and how he’s now the boss of the guy who originally hired him and how he doubles his salary. He insulted my 3.4 gpa and then proceeded to give me the job offer for a financial advisor assistant job. A couple weeks later, I got a call from HR saying that he wants me to come back in and interview for a $12 an hour paying equities specialist role which I reluctantly agreed as I needed an internship. When I started, I was surprised that almost everyone who worked there was also new with the exception to maybe 3-5 people who seemed miserable. They start you at 30k a year (which is a joke) and that won’t change for at least a couple of years despite what lies they tell you. I was moved to salary after I graduated and was told that I would be compensated more than my peers because I had so much potential and passed my series 7 and was offered $30k. I guess the manager never expected that I was smart enough to determine that this was the starting pay for any full time post graduate for this position. Not only that, but I was now required to come in on Saturdays and also work an extra hour a day, so in reality I was being paid around minimum wage considering overtime. Things got progressively worse once I passed my series 7 and was given more and more responsibilities without changes to my compensation. I was then forced to participate in pointless classes and expected to study for them outside of the 8-6 working hours. One of the classes was a speech class that required you to memorize a horrible cult-like speech that they give to their clients about how they “guarantee” their investments and was taught by a crazy old lady who had no business teaching anyone. If you made any mistakes, she would belittle you in front of your group. It got so bad that many people in our group would just quit their job. I was so happy to leave this horrible place and join a company that appreciates my work. I would not recommend this place to anyone, in any circumstance."

19,Hantz Financial Services,"Just a job, don't expect anything more.....",2019-10-01,2.0,Equity Specialist,"They were reasonable with accommodating my school schedule and we did get paid time off as an interns. I needed a job and it was better than working a restaurant or doing retail, it was nice to have more 'regular' hours. The people I worked with were awesome and hardworking (please note, this does NOT include the management!) and I know all of them will be really successful in life and at another company when they finally leave there!","I'm not quite sure where to begin, this is going to be a long one. Since leaving Hantz Group, I grown a huge appreciation for my new and current job. It is everything that Hantz Group was not.
My new job pays me fairly for my responsibilities, Hantz Group paid bottom of the barrel wages which are not sustainable by any means. 

My new job has reasonable hours which maintain a healthy work-life balance, Hantz Group asks for it's employees to work insane and unnecessary hours  AND Saturdays. This was absolutely ridiculous as most people just ended up sitting around anyways. 

My new management treats me as an adult and respects me, Hantz Group treated me like a child that needed to be watched over at every moment(i.e our supervisor and manager), like we couldn't handle ourselves. 

My new job offers great benefits like team socials and 401k, Hantz Group does not.

My new job offers interesting and stimulating work, Hantz Group (at least the department that I was in) was monkey work that required little to no critical thinking. 

My new job offers is transparent about salaries and the levels  and scheduling of promotions and new opportunities that are offered. Hantz Group does not, there were many people who had no idea how to advance and how long they would have to wait to do so.

In summary, Hantz Group will be just a job for you. It offers little to any benefits and it is NOT a place that allows for true growth and mentorship.Again, I can only speak for my department, but I senior level people from other departments  that we worked with cheering for me when I told  them I was leaving (that says something!)

Hantz Group is something that's there if you absolutely need a job. I would advise you to look elsewhere, there are so many better opportunities. 

John Hantz is a smart and successful businessman, no doubt, but if he  doesn't change some of his practices to adjust to the new workforce, he'll never be able to maintain a solid ,ground up company to meet the changing world."

24,Hantz Financial Services,"Good company for learning opportunities, but does this outweigh under appreciation and low pay?",2019-03-14,3.0,Investment Analyst,"The company has an older demographic overall, but they are looking to hire students and younger individuals. This means that it is relatively simple for a new graduate to land a job. 

The company is all about learning. They offer a ton of training, one-on-one teaching, regular company meetings, and other networking opportunities. These are all OPPORTUNITIES because they are only beneficial to those who take advantage of this.

If they see potential in you, they will let you grow in your position. Being a top performer and a hard worker means more time with mentors and more involvement in decision making.

The company is growing, and they are integrating a lot of technology into their practice. 

The people at this company are very fun and quirky. Many different personalities make the workplace more manageable, given the long hours. You are likely to work with a team, and management is very good about placing you with people you will work well with.","The people who make money here are senior financial advisors and upper management. If you are not a financial advisor, you better prepare yourself, because they want you to be an advisor. Don't want to be an advisor? Ok, then be an advisor!

Pay is minuscule, and the long work hours are not worth it. If you ask for a raise, expect a 3-month delay in the negotiation.

Work does not end when you go home. 

Management attempts to compensate for low pay by offering treats, recognition, parties, etc. However, management will never provide performance reviews. 

The company will pay for you to get certifications, but they are very pushy on completion. It's GREAT to have someone holding you accountable, but this is difficult when you are still expected to work 50-60 hour weeks and study on your own time. I have even seen them do this to full-time students."
25,Hantz Financial Services,No in between of love it or hate it,2019-01-10,2.0,Equity Specialist,"I worked in the back office in Southfield for over a year, I will do my best to describe what I thought was objective along with some subjective experiences. Without a doubt I believe the company has a very good business model. The company has been around for more than twenty years in a highly competitive field with vastly less resources than other companies. They bring a quality product to low net worth clients as well as above average net worth clients which is very respectable. Very notable, at least for advisors, is that people brand new to the business can be successful with the process in place at the company. I say this because I’ve spoken to advisors from other companies, they say to run from any position that does not involve a team of some kind, this is primarily because high net worth clients are the preference of almost every major firm and most high net worth individuals either already have a person or will not trust a wet behind the ears advisor. If you trudge on your own at the Merrill Lynch, UBS, JP Morgan etc, you normally try to get noticed to find a respectable group and then hopefully you can buy that persons practice after a decade or so , not always but that is apparently the normal path at bigger firms. With a competent person, the model “offered nowhere else” at Hantz is a force to be reckoned with. 
The company has a very tight knit inner circle giving the company much more of an entrepreneur’s touch. You will meet some very hard working and very good people at the company, the CEO is very likeable, personable, and highly intelligent who seemingly does his best to build others up. By far the biggest quality I miss is working the day to day with the friends I made there. There is no garden of Eden and you could be working at places much worse.","I liked the company but much of my experience in the back office was negative. Most companies will rightfully have you eat some humble pie, but here you will eat something more like a partially alive crow. The pay is horrendous for the amount of hours worked (8-6 minimum along with 3-6 hours on weekends) and those hours will not change for years. I would figure out very quickly as to whether or not you are 100 percent committed because you will be treated as 110 percent expendable. In moments of emotional excitement you will see outbursts of pure frustration and employees suddenly not showing up to work the next day, don’t allow yourself to get to a point where you no longer care, everyone loses. Questioning the status quo is preached but promotion is based on attrition, turnover is uncomfortably high and like someone who has had too many divorces they would rather settle than be alone forever.
And much baggage you will deal with, when you start doubting your pay (as is inevitable when paid in vague future opportunities with no clear definitions and broken promises) or question the culture. You will be told about personal growth, playing the long game, and need in the company. Sounds great but become suspicious when your concerns are dodged and loyalties met with hostility. Your competence is subtly belittled and now you have personally made an enemy with someone in management with possibly cataclysmic results. If group morale appears low from being perpetually understaffed and burnout, learn the priorities of someone important.  While concern about your personal growth is parroted, imagine with me for moment that you are on date with someone 40-50 pounds overweight and you talk about nothing except fitness and sculpted abs. I hope you see the dis-connect here when at the mercy of others, really push or pretend to align your growth with theirs for the sake of sanity. Otherwise a wall of pictures or you-tube inspirational videos will be all you have for solace, which are about as inspiring as a couple of dead batteries. The wall of promotion would be more comforting if turnover were not so high and the “promotion parties” had more than the apathy of an inmate with a life sentence watching a fellow anonymous prisoner go on parole. Team above self is lip-serviced but you are truly in competition with your co-workers like most places in the private sector. Maybe one day you will find more than polite clapping, half smiles and disguised indignation but probably not in the back office. Thankfully your friends will genuinely be happy for you….. ideally. For better or worse there is no in between of saving American Capitalism by working here or living with the quiet desperation of working there too long. Best of luck"

27,Hantz Financial Services,Take advantage of hardworkers,2018-11-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Room to learn a lot, however you will be over-worked and EXTREMELY underpaid. 
There is a chance for a larger income potential, but you're looking at three years before a livable wage and another 10+ before you see significant growth.","8am-8pm are the average hours. You will be reprimanded for being 10 minutes late and will be looked down upon for leaving early, even if your work has been completed. 

A LOT of useless meetings preaching the ""company culture"" , which is very lopsided and always changing depending on what benefits the higher ups. Positions that require a college degree will start with a salary between 26K and 28K a year for working a minimum of 60 hours per week. Also beware that Saturday's are required for most positions from 9am-12pm.

There is also EXCESSIVE favoritism and a general lack of respect among coworkers. It's clear that the bottom 90% are miserable in the company but the top (paid) 10% are just more vocal. For instance, there are employees with a take-home that is less than minimum wage, yet the company throws a party each year valued at HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of dollars. This is seen as a good thing by upper management, but the general staff do not enjoy it and see it as a waste of money and time (also, attendance is mandatory). I see this as a lack of understanding of both the modern employee, as well as the general job market and what other companies are offering. (To not have direct deposit as an option for payroll is extremely dated and almost NO other companies still do this.)

The biggest complaint is the lack of work/life balance. The company looks down upon any time-off/vacations/etc and you are only rewarded if you work yourself into the ground. Most people burn out after three years and the majority of the staff does not have much of a life outside of work."

29,Hantz Financial Services,Fulfilling Career,2018-09-11,5.0,FinancialAdvisor,"I have worked at Hantz Financial for over 8 years.  Since Day 1, the job has been rewarding.  You get to work with a specialized team in a Family Office - providing holistic solutions to clients while saving them time and stress.

The team allows us to use ""intellectual leverage"" where you don't have to be the proverbial ""Jack of All Trades,"" you build a team (or are a member of the team) where each member contributes based on their specialty. 

It is a rewarding career both intrinsically and monetarily and I cannot imagine working somewhere else in the industry.  I've spoken to friends/acquaintances who work elsewhere.  They do not get the right training (if any at all).  Hantz more than equips you with training and through the use of the Family Office you have a knowledgeable team to truly create solutions for your clients.","When you first start, things come at you like drinking out of a fire hose.  However, you are learning a model in the financial industry (Family Office) that is not taught in school.  So you have to get a good baseline of knowledge to actually be able to perform your role.

But guess what so does our CEO, he drives a Jeep Grand Cherokee. maybe these senior managers don't need to have flashy cars , maybe they don't need to show that they have money. Maybe they would rather save for retirement or even for the future of there family instead of showing off today.  Just Some advice, don't always take the word of others.

36,Hantz Financial Services,Ignore Fake Positive Reviews Posted By Financial Advisers,2017-12-11,1.0,Equities Specialist,"Met hard-working, ethical and good-hearted colleagues","An awful culture which flows down from Hantz and his cronies down to the management. I experienced this asylum by working as an Equities Specialist in the back office. Essentially what HFS does is hire desperate and perhaps naive people whether fresh out of high school, or fresh out of college with the promises of riches. In reality, you'll be lucky if you can afford a happy meal. The compensation is abysmal, the benefits are horrid, the hours are 8 until 6 and then you need to study until 8 for the Series 7 license. You must also come in on Saturdays, and if you're working on Schwab accounts, chances are you'll have to stay until 1-2pm, maybe even longer if Mr. Self-Important Hantz feels like having his nonsense aka ""philosophy class"". In truth, it's just his way of showing how great he is at life, supposedly. I'm not so sure because I have a sneaking suspicion that he ruined a marriage of two people who still work for the company. Oh, and I have personally heard him shout at his top executive in charge of accounting for letting his subordinates have a Saturday off because they finished all their work on Friday.

There is no support from the direct supervisors, the two ladies which run the back office do the exact opposite of what an effective leader does, they do not motivate, they deprive of a sense of self, they belittle in front of others. Their behavior and treatment is so anti-human that you wonder where their ethics and morals are.

Bottom line is that Hantz tells his managers to strip new-hires of their ego, to deconstruct it and then rebuild it according to his desired specification. It's a militant approach. To create obedient, blind, devoid of self-awareness robots. Then, of course, they do absolutely nothing for the benefit of the clientele base. Their favorite thing to do is continuously churn money from one investment vehicle to another, all the while they're collecting wrap-fees, commission percentages and so forth.

Their compliance department catches the majority of unsuitable transactions, but then somehow they're always told to stand down and their worst offenders (out of Taylor) always get an exception by upper management. Things that make you go, ""hmm...""

I had an interview with the Hantz Group at the last career fair of my senior year of college. They told me the position was an ""Equities Specialist"" and they made many empty promises. I accepted the position -- letting all other employers I was in the interview process at the time --- know that I had accepted the job. When I started my position at the Hantz Group in July, I was optimistic. However, there were many red flags. 

The hours were from 8am - 6pm (and studying from 6 -7 or 6 -8pm) Monday - Friday and from 8am - 12pm every Saturday. My salary was $30,000 annual. 
Another red flag - current employees and some even in leadership positions openly made comments about how no one who worked at the Hantz Group actually wanted to work there. 

The amount of work I was given was extremely low level. On my busiest day, I could complete the entire days work in just 2 hours. But still was required to sit at my desk from 8am - 6pm and from 8am - 12pm on Saturday. I scheduled a 1:1 with my supervisor, letting her know my strengths and that I would be more than willing to take on more work. I was very surprised when she told me that ""i do what she says I do"" and that she ""does not really do the whole team thing."" I put my two weeks in the next day and was able to accept a position with a different company that I love.


I really just wanted to share this because I truly feel I have a sense of responsibility to let anyone know not to accept a position with this company. During the time I was employed there, I thought maybe I was just being dramatic, but looking back at it now it was probably the worst time of my life and the way I was treated was border line bullying. I honestly feel that if I did not choose to leave the Hantz Group that it would have affected my mental health and overall well-being. Please be aware of this......."

The company invests in its people and if you stop to look around, you can see how many resources there really are for you to take advantage of.","Like everything in life, few things worth while are ever easy.

45,Hantz Financial Services,It wasn't for me,2017-10-03,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"I worked at Hantz Group for more than 3 years.  The training and education in the financial services area was second to none.  They require their advisors to do things the right way, no cutting corners.  When I left and interviewed with other companies and I told them that I worked at Hantz Group, it gave me an edge for landing my next job.  If you  asked most former employees and they gave you an honest opinion,  they would all agree that working at Hantz Group prepares you to compete against the rest of the industry.    I was able to secure a new position with a new company, work half as hard and make more money because of my experience.","Hantz Group was very demanding on compliance with regulations.  They expected people to do what was best for the clients regardless of the effort required.  As an advisor and after a few years, I expected to have the freedom to set my own schedule but I was expected to show up at the office.  I wanted to work from home and meet with clients at my convenience but that was not an option."

Lack of options for choosing investments for your clients, they tell you what you have to use, not as independent as one might think. Technology is very dated and they are slow to move on anything to do with technology. When we moved in to a new office at a location owned by Hantz the facilities management was horrible, lots of burned out lights, overflowing toilets, lots of maintenance issues that they simply refused to spend any money on. Last, but most importantly, the clients you bring on belong to Hantz Financial, not the adviser. They make you sign a do not compete which is not typical among other firms."

They basically treat you like an animal and get every once of work they possibly can before they burn you out and kick you to the curb. Hantz particaptes in discrimination when hiring, also during your interviews they will lie to you and make fake promises to get you to come aboard just to get in you in the door because they are so desperate for employees because EVERYONE quit. You walk down the halls and empty cubes and offices are the norm. Asking questions during ""training"" is frowned upon. It's basically the person that's been there the longest teaching you once how to use systems and if you don't take it upon yourself to take adequate notes to get you through and you do ask a question all hell breaks loose. I've been called every name in the book by my supervisors who are close to Hantz. They make fun time in public humiliation in front of other colleagues . Unless your sucking Hantz you get no respect. Also there infrastructure isn't there, everything is done manually or with paper Hantz is not investing in the firm directly because the ultimate goal is to be bought out by a bigger firm and the shareholders your bosses basically are the ones that will be getting paid.

54,Hantz Financial Services,Proceed With Caution.,2017-01-28,4.0,Financial Consultant,"If you decide to work here, demand a sales job. You will likely hate it because you will cold call for several hours a day. However if you stick with at at least a year, you will absolutely learn that elusive and highly prized skill in business. As long as that's your condition to work here you will learn how to sell and this is why I'm giving a rating of four stars. Other pros include working in a high-energy environment, a non-pc culture, additional training which will also be valuable to you elsewhere and an excellent addition to your resume.","You will be mislead and lied to. Count on it. This company is a cult first and a for-profit business second. Hantz is very smart but do not let your guard down if you ever talk to him. Hantz demands personal worship and ego gratification from all who work for him. After a year you will notice that the company executives are all highly-trained managers who are highly skilled at training and the art of bs, but because they are supposed to worship Hantz first they would not be confident at succeeding on their own somewhere else. Hantz is very smart in that he picks the individuals with the least amount of independent thought to run his company. Notice I mentioned thought, as many of the executives really are very smart people, just not confident or independent. You'll notice that these ""executives"" also drive outdated cars and live in shacks, a clear sign they're not making any money either. So what does this mean for you?
You're not going to make any money. It doesn't matter if you sell more than your entire peer group. Your commission went to go pay for Hantz' next painting. 
If you don't worship appropriately, you're going to the back office to collect dust. Leave immediately if this happens. Forget about whether you brought in business or not. Remember, cult first, business second. 
If you are good, expect to drive around Southeast Michigan at your expense. 
Plan of learning a lot about how any other company would fire you. Again beware of this bs. 
Because of Hantz' insatiable ego, better get used to working on Saturdays. You won't actually do anything while you're there but you will have to put the gas and mileage on your car. 
Vacations were for your childhood. Kiss 'em goodbye. 
If you complain relentlessly you will get a marginally insignificant raise, then have that raise used as an excuse to verbally punish you. 
Finally, and most important, working here does have that great benefit in that you will learn how to sell and competitors will pay a significant amount to bring you over. If you choose to work here, work here for at least a year but no more than three. It will look great on your resume and your income will be good once you leave and go somewhere else."
55,Hantz Financial Services,You Deserve Better,2017-01-02,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Hantz Group gives you the opportunity to learn some of the core aspects of financial advising. Most of the staff are knowledgeable about the subjects and products that they sell. This is especially important to note since they are an all-in-one smorgasbord for finances. This allows people to learn and get licensed (for free for the first try) in Life, Accident, and Health insurance, Auto and Property insurance, various securities, and retirement, estate and child education management. Learning all of these facets and receiving all of these certifications and licenses in one place could lead to much better jobs later on.

Most of the staff members are nice and its loose freewheeling environment allows you to keep a low filter depending on who you work for.","It has been around a year since I worked at Hantz Group so I can say for certain that I write this with a clear mind: this company needs a major management overhaul, a change in their corporate culture, and some soul searching on their philosophy.

The philosophy of Hantz Group is the idea that people, no matter where they come from, must start from the bottom and work a grueling path to the top. While this is not the worst philosophy (in fact I like the idea of that as a character builder) the management at Hantz Group use it as an excuse to bully, brag, and demean those that would be considered inferior by their standards. This philosophy is also used as an excuse to provide minimal payment and extensive hours that would exasperate everyone except those that believe they cannot do better (the hours listed below by other reviewers are accurate). This creates a horrific work/life balance.

The management attempt to balance out the abusive behavior by making lavish promises of a future life of luxury. They try to show you that they guarantee it since they are going within Blue Oceans territory. This life of luxury is a false promise since most of their workers fall within the middle class spectrum anyway, something that you can likely achieve without having to undergo 60 hours of work a week. However, even if you were to achieve wealth at Hantz Group, you would be working so much that you would likely not enjoy it. I only write this to bring people looking for a job there for that reason back down to Earth.

The management spout vitriol like no other. I said earlier that a pro was that you can keep a low filter. The downside though is that you will be called every swear word in the book, every variant of the word idiot they can find, and will have your greatest weaknesses discovered and preyed upon. Often times it comes in the form of micro-management that is counterproductive to the work that you are doing. In fact, it often stifles you from reaching your potential goals. This creates a culture of retaliation, loss of promises, and paranoia. 

This trifecta of corporate malaise (micro-management, corporate culture, and philosophy) is what creates the frequent turnover at Hantz Group while also maintaining a cult-like environment to those who stay (and mind you, they will tell you that the rest of the world is trying to rip you off). It is what keeps the company from creating a more inviting interior atmosphere. And it is what gives the company the undeserved arrogance to create a technology company that in itself needs a desperate upgrade in technology (if you need more proof just check out their shoddy WordPress webpage). Having arrogance in a company is needed, but when it has overblown to this extent it pushes those that could make the company greater away.

Just to add specificity: your pay at Hantz Group will likely start at around 24-25k. You will work 12 hours Mon-Thurs 8-8, Fri 8-5, and Sat 9-12. If you like that then I wish you would see a therapist because you are worth more than that."
56,Hantz Financial Services,Tax Accounting Intern,2016-12-22,5.0,Accounts Receivable,"Great working environment, and the staff was very helpful. Hours were great and flexible. Overall a great learning experience",I did not have any negative experiences while interning here.
57,Hantz Financial Services,The reviews you read here are accurate!,2016-12-07,1.0,Recruiting Specialist,"Because of the long hours, you'll spend lots of time with your coworkers. I worked with some great people and that is the ONLY thing I miss about this place. 

They sponsor you to get licensed, however you are required to pass before you start and don't get paid for it. If you leave before a year, you are required to pay them back for the study material and exams (you sign a loan agreement).","All the reviews you read on here are accurate. Initially I thought ""eh, maybe it's just a bunch of recent college kids that are lazy and privilege""..nope. Every job with the exception of some bank employees, requires that you work 8-8 Mon-Thur, 8-5 Fri, and 9-noon Saturday, however I heard most people worked later than this. All of these hours for 24k SALARY. They justify this by saying they are all ""very hardworking"" even though a lot of the time it's wasted labor. Naturally the pay and hours combined cause the most ridiculous turnover. They justify this by saying people are lazy and don't want to work for things. 

They tell you there's lots of opportunity and room for advancement, however most things are lateral moves and expect the same pay. The only way you can actually make money here is to be a financial advisor, which they will try to force you into regardless of where you work. I watched them sway bank employees, recruiting, Hr, and even the main receptionist into trying to get licensed. Most people agree to go along with it because they offer a ""bonus"" to it. Realistically, these people have 0 intentions of ever working as a financial advisor so it's just money the company is throwing away. 

They definitely don't pay people their worth. They say you need to start from the bottom and work your way up. In most cases, okay yes especially when it comes to being an advisor. If you have the education and experience in your background though, you deserve more than 24k for 60+ hours a week. I only recommend this job if you are 1. Recent college grad that didn't do an internship and are having a hard time finding a job or 2. You are desperate and 3. You want to be a financial advisor and can tough out the hours. The model that they offer their clients I really do believe is the best. 

This place is completely unorganized and there is 0 structure. They say they don't do ""annual reviews"" or things of that nature because they give immediate feedback. My experience was different. I always got very vague feedback and when my boss wasn't happy and I tried to figure out why, I never got a real answer. That could have just been my direct boss though. 

My first red flag should have been the interview. It's not a real interview. It's a ""tell me about yourself and now I'm going to sell you on why we are better than everyone else and you should work here"" interview. I've never had an interview before where the employer was trying to sell me. 

And the best for last..

I was unhappy here for quite some time. I really enjoyed my coworkers though, the work was mindless, and I don't like jumping job to job so I wanted to get in at least a year before I left. That all changed when there was a battle over hiring an (overqualified) candidate because she wore a hijab. Yes, you read that right. I worked in recruiting and heard these words directly out of the senior Vp's mouth myself. I was literally speechless. The reasoning was because they believed they couldn't put her in front of clients because clients wouldn't feel comfortable working with a Muslim girl. Also, I couldn't even tell you how many times I heard African American employees referred to as ""thugs"". That day though, was the day I started looking for a new job. 

I was hesitant to review this place, but they think that Glassdoor reviews are garbage and full of  lazy people complaining. In my experience, 98% of the time, Glassdoor accurately reflects the work environment you're about to walk into. Hopefully this saves someone from doing what I did leaving me with ""should have listened to those reviews""."

No flexibility (perhaps if you've been there 10 years as a financial planner), few benefits and what they have are poor. They used to have a benefits division -- clients have better benefits than the employees at Hantz.  If you are out of a job, and the economy is really poor, and there are no other options -- this might work for you. Otherwise, I'd keep looking.  

Morale is very low in many areas.  The young, young people (early to mid 20's) might have enthusiasm, but those types would -- toss them a party twice a year with full on alcohol flowing endlessly and food, and why wouldn't they?

There is plenty of earning potential ""down the road"" if you put in your time.  The employees are friendly along with the majority of your clients.  There are also always people there to help you and answer questions when you need it.  The idea of extensive financial planning along with tax planning and bank integration is also a great idea.","During your interview process it is not made clear that the hour expectation is going to be 6 days a week (including holiday weekends).  Also the hours worked throughout the week are extensive.  12 hour days except Friday and Saturday push you into the 60+ hour work week.  To some this might seem acceptable, but the compensation does not equate out to a respectable level for the position you're in.  I would say on average for someone working in the accounting field after graduation the starting salary with Hantz is about 60% of the median salary elsewhere. I worked as a tax planning specialist along with portfolio analysis.  From my experience the portfolio analysis was an easier way for the financial adviser's to make more money.  As an accountant you will make considerably less than the median starting salary for someone in a similar position.  Completing my BBA/MSA was a goal along with immediately taking the CPA exam.  That was discouraged as we were required to be licensed by FINRA so we could deliver portfolio analysis.  After that the EA was the ""recommended"" route.  This was not up for negotiation.  On top of that there was no assistance when paying for study materials or the cost of testing.  Overall this is a job where you will get essentially minimum wage with no assistance on certifications (unless you are a financial adviser).  If you like being told what to do by someone who makes significantly more than you with no real vision on what your pay will amount to in the future then this will be the place for you."

Good financial planning model.  Anniversary and Employee Appreciation Parties are fun, as much as you can eat and drink.","Hours are a strict 60+hr minimum, 8-8 M-Tr, 8-5 F, and 9-12 Sat.  Offices farther from Southfield are less strict but at Southfield this will  be the minimum.  They will tell you this is only for the first couple of years but many employees that have been around for 10+years still work this. The tax department is always considered second hand to the advisors.  Hantz does have a plan to benefit the accountants in the form of making them learn portfolio analysis to help the advisors make more commission and make him  richer.  It will get better though, just put in the work now and you will receive great benefits, later... years later.  Less work and more pay, or in reality more work  and same pay. 
They do not say in the interviews but you will also travel to other offices to work, without any mileage reimbursement.  Also told I would have time to study and complete my CPA exams, but 60hrs does not exactly promote study time. Only the head of tax department encouraged me to continue my CPA, while others managers and Hantz promote the EA exam.  No other CPA or accountant would ever tell you get an EA over CPA.  They also do not pay for study materials but will  give you a bonus, although after the materials and paying for the exam is it really a bonus?  Also you will take your series 65 to do portfolio analysis, but quit before a year and you will pay $500+ for the study materials.  
Hantz will always tell you it will get better, keep at it, we are changing the game, and keep living the dream... Like working 60hrs with little pay is not a dream, living on a beach with a drink in hand is a dream!  Hantz believes in employees putting in the work for years with no pay and if you make it you will get more money.   Employee turnover is so bad that most do not see the additional income, so Hantz comes out on top by keeping salaries so low.  Be single and live with mom and dad because you will  have  no life or money, but hey, it will get better. 
Last thought is to actually train your financial advisors on the investments you sell.  They know how to sell but have no real response when clients ask about the details or why the investments are doing bad or why we change investments after we recommended an investment a couple of years ago.

87,Hantz Financial Services,The Perfect Example of How NOT to Run an Organization!!! (Must read),2015-02-17,1.0,Personal Banker,"First of all, I consider myself very level headed and understanding. I don't write bad reviews on yelp, I don't yell at waitresses or other service providers, and I always tip well...so hopefully that gives you insight to how bad this experience must have been for me to even write this......

The only real pro wasn't even about the company: it happened to be a great commute for me. The people you work with at the peer level are nice, decent folk for the most part.","Ahem, where to begin? First off, they grossly exaggerate the amount of growth and experience you will get during the on-boarding process. I worked on the bank side, and the initial pay was low, a huge cut from my previous job, and they knew that and still did not budge on the pay. 

Specifically to the banking side: the training is non-existent. My first day of work looked like this: oh the lady who was supposed to train you took a sick day, here is this paper manual last revised almost 10 years ago: read through it. My entire 8 hours was spent reading and taking notes, zero engagement or interaction. That was the brunt of my 'two week training'. The most hands-on was doing basic transactions and creating new accounts.

As soon as you log into the system you see how out-dated the software is as well. It is very inefficient, an eye-sore, unorganized, and has zero guidance tutorials from people or machine. A lot of my learning was trial and error especially when it comes to unique transactions, loans, IRAs, etc. and how to process them properly. How  do you think it looks as a customer when the teller has not been trained how to work with YOUR money? The go-to fix if you had an issue is call another office and hope to speak to a more tenured teller. You would think something as technical as a bank would have extensive hands on training so that you can look and feel professional.

Another thing is lack of positive reinforcement. If you do something wrong, no matter how new or aware they are that you are new, they immediate belittle you and patronize you as if you're some kind of fool for not instinctively knowing everything about banking and their out-dated systems. Being someone who has a BA degree with honors it was very frustrating. 

If you're wondering why I was in this role to begin with I had personal issues to be closer to home hence this job and they promised excellent career growth and pay (which were false). 

No management or communication. My boss was always out of the office busting their behind working 12 hour shifts so I rarely seen them. Also, communication among other branches was very shotty. If someone quits, no one mentions it, if someone transfers no one mentions it, if they completely change the pay roll system, no one mentions it to the lady in charge of pay roll!!!??! (True story).

When my manager left (yes they quit)
I was familiar with the role and was told about it originally during training. 

I felt honored to be approached so early about their plan to mold me and promote me and it was a cool feeling. Once I realized how much ridiculous travel was expected and hours to be worked compared to the fixed salary (absolutely fixed to salary so you couldn't get overtime and considering they expected you to work 12 hour shifts who wants to pay out all of that right?), I felt totally tricked and annoyed. I don't like committing to something and backing out; it makes me feel bad, but when they totally leave out important details and intentionally deceive it's hard not to. Let's just say the pay was less than 30k, hours horrible, still no training. 

I could honestly I go on but hopefully you get the point."

Employees here have access to experts in finance & financial planning, tax,  legal,  insurance,  markets, and so on.  I never have to worry about making the right decision for a client because I know I have argued through options with a variety of specialists and truly received expert advice.  I feel more comfortable with my decisions for clients at Hantz than I did at the two Banks that I worked for before being recruited by Hantz.  

I have been treated better as a professional, employee, and as a person at Hantz than I ever have. The leaders and managers here are always open to educating and coaching their employees. When they don't know the answer to something they will set you up with someone who does. This same rule applies to clients.  Even John Hantz himself takes the time to listen and coach. Beyond growing professionally and intellectually I have become a better more rounded person during my 2 years at Hantz.

Appreciated employees become loyal employees become very productive employees.  Management has yet to learn that.

Never expect any positive kudos, no matter how hard you work or how much business you bring in.  

Cult like atmosphere.  If you don't drink the Kool-Aid, you are better off going elsewhere.  Trust me, you will be happier.

Colleagues are unprofessional towards each other.  Very condescending and rude.

I witnessed some of the most unprofessional staff meetings I have ever attended.  Management openly ridicules staff constantly regardless if they are in the room or not.

This job was a stepping stone to much better opportunities elsewhere.

The annual party was a lot of fun.","Terrible hours and pay. The company strives to pay as little as possible to new employees and get as much work out of them as humanly possible. 

As I stated previously, I was an accounting intern for Hantz. As soon as I finished school, I received a call from one of the many VPs. I was offered a salary that came out to about $10 per hour. I was also told that I had to make the decision immediately. When I countered with a a small increase to the original offer, I was told that I shouldn't expect anything more coming right out of college and that I was lucky to have this offer. There was no way that I was going to be able to live on that salary, so I turned it down. Two weeks later, I found another job that paid $50,000.

I watched one employee take a sick day. The management did not like this, so they sent another employee to their house to make sure that they were truly sick. The employee was not sick, but probably exhausted from working so much. I am not sure what happened to them, but I know that management was furious."

Just be prepared to pay around $2000 out of pocket when you quit before your one-year commitment. You can also learn everything you need to within a 1 year period. The concept of the company is creative & can be beneficial, but does lack customization to the clients. Future employers will feel sorry for you that you worked here & will more than likely hire you out of pity; many previous employees have been hired in by reputable companies due to this, this fortunately happened to me.","The reviews below stating 5 Stars are not realistic by any means. Notice they had four 5 star reviews within a two week period.

-If you can read body language and pick up on visual clues you will notice that everyone is not as happy as they claim. (Look at the vehicles they drive, yes they depreciate and are a poor investment. But to drive a 2000 Ford Taurus but you claim to make $150,000, I can see one person doing this, not 140 advisors.)

-What they “forget” to mention is that any clients you bring in are not going to be yours. They belong to the shareholders in the company.

-When someone does leave the company, the game moves along to who is going to get their clients. Those who live and breathe the Hantz fumes get the good clients the remainder of the clients is passed along to others. 

-Whatever expenses can be handed over to the groups and individuals they will do that. Hantz needs to cash for this Bank, he is desperately trying to become a billionaire in his lifetime.He could have reached that if he changed his business culture/mind, but will never reach that goal and is starting to plateau out. 

-Everyone has to work 6 days a week because “we work harder than our competitors”. You could have brought Bill Gates in as a client; you are still going to be working Saturday.

-Presentations are very good quality, I recommend sitting through them if you’re looking for creative ways. You can then use these if you go off on your own, many already have.

-Some of the advisors don’t have a college degree, this to me is a slap in my face for the hard work I did for four years. This shows the respect they have for your accomplishments. They hire anyone they can; this provides those leads, not experience or leadership.

-Everyone is a vice-president of something. From VP of Commercial Insurance (East Side, Brick Buildings Only), VP of Property & Casualty Insurance Main Office (Luxury Automobile Division), VP of Marketing (Phone Based) to VP of Marketing (Web Based). You get the idea. You can sniff out the “leadership” who are pure losers.
 
-Health Insurance is a joke. I bet Obamacare will be better than what they offer. You will also try to sell health insurance it if you stay long enough.

-I am an independent but the entire company hates democrats in general because John Hantz does. This to me is very funny to here the regurgitated comments from the dedicated employees. If John says it must be true, this reminds me of the State Farm Can’t lie on the internet commercial...”

-Everything they sell or offer they need you to have as well. You must open bank accounts; debit cards use their auto/home insurance plans.

-ZERO, support for advertising; ever see a commercial/radio ad? They claim they don’t work, I claim they don’t know how to market effectively.

-They are not respected by other companies & advisors. Go to a NAIFA meeting or other related conferences. Most advisors have positive comments to say about other firms and individuals, not this company. I had a previous finance professor who I spoke to a year after I graduate, Once I told him where I was working, he laughed under his breath. I told him I wasn’t offended by it.

-Some of the local offices have a bad reputation with the community and the stakeholders. Eating at local restaurants near these offices, I was fortunate to talk with some of the owners and workers.  One community called the local office The Boiler Room, just like the movie.

-Clients are all recommended the same products. Your job is to sell what they tell you, not ask questions or recommend your own submissions.
 
-Bonus/Raises are provided by the yearly Hantz annual party, at his house of course. All the food and alcohol you can consumer in one evening.

-LinkedIn is forbidden, they see your profile, and they want you to delete it immediately. Those who are established and stuck can leave it up for false hope.

-You are not an employee or worker, just a cheap source of sales leads. Good quality sales leads can be expensive. You become an employee after you return a profit to the group above your cost to them.

-Sales leads are a complete joke, their leads are outdated, have been called upon other advisors thousands of times, pulled from the yellow pages. Anyone remember Farmer Jack? 
-Mileage reimbursement=$0. Good luck with that.
 
-If you have to put food on the table and you can’t wait for another interview/offer then go here, if not wait it out."

105,Hantz Financial Services,100% committed to your career success.,2013-05-12,5.0,Financial Advisor,"I started here as a college grad 9 years ago, this month. They took my lack of experience and turned it into the best career experience anyone could ask for. Training comes from all angles...management, experienced associates, coworkers in other lines of business, product companies. I've seen countless examples of people who've taken their income above $150,000 per year, once they get their client base established.

 When I interviewed, they did tell me it would take a lot of work to get my client base built. The hours referenced are to insure you have time to learn the many facets of the business to be successful. Veteran advisor and associates here work with great flexibility because the career allows for it, once your client base is built. No other company I interviewed with showed as much commitment to training and comprehensive integrated knowledge around what needs to happen to take care of the client's financial needs and concerns. I could not imagine working anywhere else, and if I had to build my career on this industry, again, I wouldn't take the risk with another company. 

Even though my full time job is working with clients as a planner, I've had the opportunity to build and integrate new technology into our client service model. Very few places allow the field advisor to influence the work that is presented to clients.","If you are looking for a job and not a career, this is not the place for you.

You make very little with promises of making a lot.  Truth is if you become a miniature Hantz then you will be given clients and will make a lot of money.  Their mission is to select a few underdogs and feed them with opportunity and clients to “prove” that anyone can make it with his philosophy.  They make you believe that you cannot make it outside the Hantz walls and that everyone else in the world is subpar to them.  Which if you do a little digging there are many places that are just as good if not better.  They speak to you like you are not even human, very demeaning.  Be prepared to cold call all the time.

-Rewarding as you want it to be, this is only for the determined and open minded.

-If your are open, you will learn a tremendous deal about financial planning, financial markets, marketing and selling.  You WILL learn how to sell if you are there long enough.

-Some of the nicest people to work with I have ever met, they work hard but play harder.

Firstly, your experience will greatly depend on which office you are working in.  I was never misled  in anyway during the interview process.  I knew exactly the hours I would be working, what the job entailed as far as marketing goes, and the pay scale. Unfortunately this does not seem to be universal.  Now the hours are long, M-Th 8-8, F 8-5 and Sat 9-12.  What I want to point out is that these are the expected hours of a first year advisor and are not really set in stone regardless of what management tells you.  Your job is to get people in the door and create a client base.  After a few years unless I had late meetings I was gone by six at the latest.  I knew many advisors that would just kind of pop in and out as needed as long as their goals were hit.

Second, upper management has made a lot of changes in the past few years but it was really more of a re-shuffling.  Usually you will start out as part of a group practice so in essence it is up to that group to hire you, train you, set your goals and pay you.  If you end up with a good group they will show you the way, if not, or if you or they have unrealistic expectations it probably won't be that enjoyable.  I was not in a group until after a year in the company.  The idea behind a group is 1+1=3.  You share revenue and responsibilities with your group so if one person has a poor week the other people can still help them out financially and vice versa.  I was lucky enough to be in a group with 2 great guys in a great office.  

Third, if you want your overall knowledge to go up then this is the place to do so.  I can honestly say John Hantz is one of the smartest people I have ever met, and I don't mean just in business but in general.  He has a very philosophical mind set which he tries to instill in all of the employees.  I learned more in a just a few years there than most people do in 20, and not just about financial planning but really how to think and perceive the world.  That sounds corny I know, but its true.

If you have the drive and determination and want to have a hugh earning potential then this is a great company.  They will give you the opportunity if you are up for the challenge.  If you are not then you will hate every moment you are there.","Now on to the bad.

-You work on a draw, meaning you are on straight commission unless you are paid a salary by your group (if you are in one).  If you don't bring in revenue you still get a paycheck, but that money will get paid back to the company from future commissions.  A few bad weeks and you can get into a big hole.  Get into a big enough hole and be prepared to have uppermanagement in your ear.  That being said if you are just looking to show up to a 9-5 job and collect a paycheck you will be greatly dissappointed.  Your pay will be based on the quantity and quality of clients you are able to sign up.

-The intial hours are horrible, check the PRO's for details.  Your primary marketing method initially will be your natural market, friends, family old co-workers, etc.  You will end up bugging the crap out of everyone very quickly if you constantly call them.  I know of people who still walk the other way when they see me coming.  This is the reason for the long hours.  You will be training most of the day and then 5-8 is phone time.  In my mind this is a dying method and is becoming less effective.  12 years ago nobody knew or had caller ID and would answer the first time the phone rang.  Now all they have to do is see ""Hantz Financial Services"" calling and let it go to voicemail.  If you want to make it in this business you need to get creative on how to get clients into the door because you will run out of people to call very quickly.

-From a benefits standpoint it is pretty much bare bones.  I personally do not look into this much but for the people who do - they offer a nonmatching 401(k), pay for roughly 1/3 of health, dental. vision and offer discounted DI and term life.  You get very few personal or sick days, so little I don't even remember the amount.  But I should add,  you work on commission, in all reality you could take a month off if you were enough above your goal (well probably not as if you are out of the office you are not bringing in revenue, but hopefully you get the idea).

-They have an extremely high turnover of employees especially in the back office.  The reason for this, in my mind, is the poor pay with little room for them to advance.  If you are unhappy working long hours for low pay then they will just find the next person in line who will be glad to do your job.

-Traveling is required and there is no reimbursement.  Not bad if your going to a nearby office but Sault Ste. Marie is alot farther from Southfield than Saginaw is to Midland.

-Advancement is limited.  As an advisor you may have the opportunity to become a branch manager but most likely not happening.  In my opinion most of the advisors were comfortable with their current responsibilities and saw no reason to seek ""job title"" advancement.  You want to get a pay raise you need to start selling more.  If you are looking for a ""management track"" position call Enterprise Rent a Car."
114,Hantz Financial Services,"If you value your family, friends and reputation, look elsewhere.",2011-12-16,1.0,Tax Specialist,"Employees learn tax and financial planning strategies.  Will also gain experience working with lower middle income clients who need financial help more than more prosperous and better educated clients.
Also, odds are you’ll be the smartest guy in the room.","Many of the cons have been listed by previous reviewers.  Those include no expense reimbursements, small employer contribution to health insurance coverage, no employer paid dental or disability insurance and no employer 401(k) contribution of any kind.  No compensation or bonus for overtime work.  There is no mention of hours to be worked or miles to be driven without reimbursement until after you start working.  New inexperienced financial advisors make approximately minimum wage when starting salary is divided by working hours with time and one-half for overtime.  Advisors are pressured to call family and friends to obtain their investment, banking, insurance and tax business.  If you want to have your family and friends avoid you like the plague, join the Hantz Group.

I have often thought that you can judge an organization by its parking lot.  Newer vehicles indicate successful fairly compensated employees.  By contrast, Hantz office parking lots are filled with jalopies.  Hantz Group wages and lack of mileage reimbursement don’t allow its employees to pay off their student loans and buy cars made sometime after they were born.

The fundamental problem is the Hantz variable compensation system.  After a year or so, tax team employees receive a percentage of the client billing as compensation.  35% is a typical employee percentage with the house keeping the other 65%.  On the surface, that doesn’t seem out of line with what others pay.  However, that is only figured on the billing to your clients.  You are not compensated for working on others’ clients, continuing education, attending sales presentations or administrative tasks.  Also, it is not unusual for you to drive between offices one or two hours from yours for which you get no pay or mileage reimbursement.  Such practices contribute to the atmosphere of employee competition instead of cooperation and the lack of esprit de corps.

The Hantz Group touts its weekly office meetings where financial advisors and tax specialists gather to brainstorm solutions to clients' financial situations.   The idea of these meetings has considerable merit.  However, what they don't mention is that only ideas that help the Hantz Group financial situation are considered.  For those of us who believe the client comes first, it's anathema and a far worse problem than employee compensation.

Hantz offices vary widely in management and furnishings.  The office managers are given little in the way of guidance or training and are selected based on their sales achievements.  No consideration is given to their ability to actually run an office.  It’s the Peter Principle put into practice.  The Hantz office in one town may be reasonably well run but that doesn’t mean the office in your town will be.  The computer equipment is old and outdated and the enterprise software is slow and cumbersome.  It seems that no one in the upper echelon of the organization understands the benefits and efficiency that modern computers provide.  

The Hantz Group holds firm-wide meetings at a meeting center in Sterling Heights.  All employees are required to attend these meetings.  They get no pay or expense reimbursement for their travel or attendance at these sessions even when they may have to travel several hundred miles.  These meetings have the ostensible purpose of keeping the employees current on strategies and products.  The real purpose is to give John Hantz, the founder, an audience.  He relishes telling a captive audience how rich he is and how smart he is.  He's correct about being rich.

The Glass Door rating system is well thought out and executed.  However, when 1.0 is the minimum score, a rating of 1.2 is really 0.2.  If that score and the reviews by current and former employees don't convince you to avoid working for the Hantz Group, you deserve what you get."
115,Hantz Financial Services,"Accountants, be sure that you properly account for every attribute of this job",2011-11-05,1.0,Tax Planning Specialist,"You will have access to very good software that they will let you use to prepare your own tax return.  You will also get a good general overview of the financial planning field.  There are many hardworking, intelligent, mangers and co-workers.","They generally advertise the position with a range of starting salary, depending on experience. Their offer will usually come in at the bottom of the range, or in my case below it.  The benefits are very minimal also.  You accrue 10 vacation days per year, you can’t carry them over, and the # of days never goes up.  There is mediocre health insurance that you pay 1/3 of.   There is no profit sharing or match on the 401k, and no reimbursement for mileage.  The mileage could turn out to be very significant as many associates there drive between 10,000 and 35,000 miles per year.  There is no pay at all for overtime, which is just considered part of the job. They will tell you not to worry much about the lower starting salary, and promise that you will move to a variable compensation structure that will “blow the salary and lack of benefits out of the water”.   

The variable compensation structure that they try to move you toward is similar to that of a financial advisor.  The only problem with this is that the only thing that they will measure toward this is 35% of planning fees of clients that are in your name.  This doesn’t include the clients that are not in your name that you will work on many hours since you are new.  This also doesn’t include clients in other offices that you will drive to without any mileage reimbursement.  You will also get the clients that have very little revenue and very much time involved.  Around a year or two into the job, they will analyze your job performance.  Your value to the company will include clients in your name times 35%.  You will hear how you are overpaid and need a drastic increase in plan sales; probably many times what you have sold in the first year of the job, in the next year, to earn your keep.  This will be an impossible goal as you may also be competing with another specialist who is more established and probably a manager who is trying to get paid what they have been promised.  The organizational structure will hinder sale of plans because of how the compensation structure on plans is for advisors also.  They come up with many marketing strategies for you that seldom work.  This may include a lot of free work for clients that aren’t paying tax planning fees.  If you look at the turnover of accountants, you will see that most accountants quit or get fired before this plan comes to fruition."
