6,Heritage Federal Credit Union,Unethical,2021-07-02,1.0,Sales,"401k, paid for 8 hours on Saturday","The only word that comes to mind when I reflect on my time spent at HFCU is unethical. They have a high turnover rate, the training is poor & there are a lot of small town banking politics. You are promoted there not for your worth- but for who you know or who likes you. They worship the leadership that is awful, and do not care about the mental well being of their employees. They overload you with work that should be delegated more. They stress you to your limits and then when you have had enough they place an X on your back. When you are disciplined you are not talked to or written up until months after the occurrence happened. They rarely promote within. They always look to the outside for people they know and like. They have managers over departments that have no training or knowledge to do so. Very rarely when someone leaves for maternity leave they come back. They leave a lot of promises broken and it's not worth the toll it takes on you. No job should ever drain you to the point of no return. They recently had a job fair to try to bring in some new employees because all the good employees left or were fired for no reason. They are a just cause employer. They will fire you just cause they don't want to pay your high wages and incentives. From the top down they are crooked. I would or recommend this employer to anyone. They will tell you almost anything to get you in the door and leave you empty handed. You will find yourself working for lazy entitled people who care more about their title and status versus their job."
