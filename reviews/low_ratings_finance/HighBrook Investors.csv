1,HighBrook Investors,Turnover City,2020-01-03,1.0,Office Manager,Good bonus and a few people who are awesome,"If it gives you any idea, I'm still waiting for my 401K employer gift deposit from 2017...yep, 2017. The management is chaos, the accounting team is lost, nothing gets done and the culture is mediocre. They lie and make promises they never keep. I put in 3 years, but I tell you, nothing will change. When it's chaos from the top down it will always be chaos. Considering they won't get rid of the founder or the top partners this place will always be a mess. Stay away."
2,HighBrook Investors,Sales Agent,2017-02-03,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Lots of room for career growth. You are able to be your own boss and make your own money.,Not a ton of training. They need to outsource training to benefit their employees and their company as a whole.
