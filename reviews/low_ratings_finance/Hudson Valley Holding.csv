0,Hudson Valley Holding,"Good hours, No money, Horrible Management",2013-07-18,1.0,Lead Teller,Closed on weekends and Federal Holidays. There really wasn't many other pros. Almost everyone who worked at the bank either called it in or were miserable.,"There are way to many cons to list all of them but i will go into some details. EVERYONE who was the head of a department or a manager of some kind had no idea what they were doing. Every time you call someone for help, they have no idea what to do. The company takes forever with annual reviews and doesn't care about the unlivable wage that they pay their employees. They had a huge set of layoffs early in 2013 because they people running the bank were incompetent and made bad business decisions. They decide to live in the stone age when it comes to technology and most of the customers eventually close their accounts because of the lack of convenience and high fees. The employees are over worked because they don't hire any new people. They load on more and more responsibilities to the lower end people without any compensation. Everyone who works there besides the heads are underpaid, overworked, undertrained and unappreciated. Stay as far away from this bank as you can. They offer some new people a lot of money to join the company if you want to be an upper level manager, but most of those people eventually are laid off in an effort to save money"
