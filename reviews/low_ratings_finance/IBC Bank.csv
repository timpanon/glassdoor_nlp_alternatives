0,IBC Bank,Stepping stone,2022-04-01,3.0,Senior Business Analyst,"-Laid back
-Room to learn
-Manager opendoor policy","-Salary very low
-Not sure of expectations"
1,IBC Bank,Bad corporate culture and low pay - know what you're getting into,2022-03-29,2.0,Graphic Designer,"- Good department-level working environment. My management was never overbearing or had unreasonable expectations. They made clear what was expected of me and my coworkers and they were very understanding of shortcomings or mistakes.

- Excellent coworkers. The marketing department at the time I worked there was mostly staffed with fun, relaxed people that made me feel like part of the team almost immediately.

- Fulfilling and diverse work. There was always something to do vis-a-vis graphic design but the work extended to other areas I was skilled in, such as video editing and social media. The work never felt like too much and was a perfect workload for someone looking into breaking in to private-sector graphic design, video, and social media.","- Low pay. This is a massive con. While I was never expected to work more than 40 hours a week, the workload I had while being paid just $16/hour came close to being insulting. Graphic designers are typically underpaid but not to this extent. 

- Conservative corporate culture. While the working culture at my department was acceptable, the overarching corporate values that come from the top are not. They are overwhelmingly steeped in old-fashioned corporate adages that absolutely no longer belong in a billion-dollar company. 

Even if the management I reported to did not particularly espouse these values, knowing that the President of the bank subscribes to ideology that says ""Accelerate or die"" and ""Manage your own morale"" is distressing enough. The talking points seem to be lifted right out of the GOP. While people are entitled to believe whatever they want, there's a reason top-flight Fortune 500 companies have long abandoned this way of thinking.

- Occasional friction between departments. There were times where it truly felt the right hand didn't know what the left was doing and that led to issues working between departments. It could be a case of too many layers of people needing to know everything that goes on in departments not under their jurisdiction.

So long as you are aware of these issues, there could be a lot of fun to be had working for the bank. Just know that with this level of pay, unless you advance quite quickly, you should be keeping your other options open."

Easier to move to other positions internally.
Good for those with little experience","Some management is toxic depending on where and who you work for.
The pay is notoriously lower than other positions in the field would make.
Raises are hard to earn due to strict HR, and can only happen every 3 months at the earliest.
Negotiate high when interviewing, as managers will keep you at a low salary compared to your other team members and gas light you if you speak to them about it.
You will be volunteered to help other positions that do not have enough manpower."

He’s extremely political, and on his annual Christmas speech doesn’t hesitate to tell you who you should vote for. He is very anti work from home, all raises go through him directly, and from company policy, it’s clear they think every employee is fresh out of college, zero work experience or ethics.

IBC excessively lays extra burdens on employees without increasing pay and it is difficult to move up. 

Tellers are generally unappreciated. Dealing with the most customers for the least pay. As for as performance goals are concerned we are generally at the mercy of our sales reps and if a sale we claim is already an existing customer than we don't get credit. 99% of the people we talk to are existing customers."

38,IBC Bank,Not even a good place to start a career,2021-11-10,1.0,Manager,It is a job that pays the bills.,"Leadership is disconnected and does not care about staff. They pride themselves in ""Doing more with less"". That means less staff. Even one of the CEOs put it on his monthly report as a success.

There is opportunity for success if you are in the right group. Leadership is composed of many women that have been there for decades and want to keep it that way.

President pushes his republican agenda to the point where he calls democrats stupid in his big bonus presentation. He will not give overall salary increases based on the ""stupid democrats"" not allowing the company to meet their profit goals.

They will rather see a good person leave due to low salary only to hire at the salary the departing employee was asking.

At times will hire people at a much hire salary than those tenured."

I was promised a raise I never received and higher ups will complain about managers they can’t fire. There’s probably 1-2 people in each department that actually care about their jobs, everyone else is a chicken without a head. No communication and management refuses to modernize or have standardized references for employees to use. The CEO urged us to vote for trump and said it was ‘to save our taxes’ when he’s a millionaire. No Covid pay, no personal time, multiple Covid deaths while I worked there. One of their mottos is ‘work more for less’ and they mean it."

But not much,"They are not flexible, the pay is poor for the amount of hours, training, and work you do. The training staff was rude and one guy who trained me thought I hated him because I didn't kiss up to him and he would punish me and pull me aside to say I needed to smile more. The lady trainer was extremely rude and if I had not been a favorite I would have quit during training. They will not excuse any absence no matter how important, and it is clear that most of the people working there have no idea what they are doing nor do they care.

Can be pressure to meet quotas of opening accounts,2021-08-05,4.0,Bank Teller,"Full time employees need to meet a quota of opening 4 accounts per month while part time employees need to open 2 accounts. They do offer cash incentives for getting customers to get into IBC's other services such as credit cards, loans, etc. The teller job is easy in itself, but the quotas can be pressure-some. The bonuses are great at End of Year at the December Christmas party. Depending how long you've been there, you can earn anything from a paycheck to Actual Gold coins/ Ruby and other cool things at the party.","The pressure of having to open accounts. You have to be a good salesperson. If someone comes in and asks to open an account with you, it doesn't count. You have to offer the account. They give you a few strikes and a 2 ""pips"". I forgot how the system works, but if you hit the pips and then fail a month, they will fire you(something like that). I was given the chance of trying to reach my quota or give a 2 weeks notice. I went with the 2 weeks notice lol.

75,IBC Bank,"Poor Benefits, Poor Senior Management, Poor Company",2021-06-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The only “pro” would be for employees to get their experience and find another position at a different company that has industry standard benefits / compensation.,"Health benefits are terrible. The company self funds their health plan and has been running at a deficit for years. This makes monthly premiums outrageous. The company has a mandatory benefits presentation employees must attend. The HR sanctioned advice is to not use the health insurance if you can help it and to call ahead to providers when you have an emergency to see who has the best price. 

Next, the company does not pay industry standard wages for the positions they offer. My experience was the company agreed to increase my salary each month to bring me to industry standard. Even though I had this in writing from Human Resources, they always seemed to conveniently forget I was even on a salary plan. 

Bank senior management will not listen or give credence to the input of staff on matters that impact the entire bank. In fact, senior management will “welcome” ideas but do the exact opposite. This way of operating has caused IBC Bank to frivolously spend thousands of dollars on failed projects and initiatives.

Bank leadership is under the impression that employees do not leave a company based on pay and benefits. This is completely off base and shows how out of touch senior leadership is with the modern workforce."

84,IBC Bank,Horrible experience,2021-06-08,1.0,Sales Associate,You get banking experience at IBC.,"Horrible, unorganized, unaware, UNETHICAL management. Management dedicates time only to the employees they choose to, yet they complain about the rest of the employees not meeting certain goals or knowing certain things. The pay is also ridiculously low even though they constantly pressure their employees to meet challenging sales goals. No other bank pays as low as IBC. Also, IBC management makes it clear that under no circumstance is an absence justified. If you have to go to the doctor or if you have an emergency, you will still get treated in a belittling way if you request a day off for these types of situations, and in the most cases, your request will be denied without hesitation. Upper management is constantly trying to intimidate employees and expecting employees to catch up with their unorganized methods. Because a lot of the employees at IBC are around 18-21 years old, management takes advantage of how easy it is to intimidate these young individuals who are just beginning to develop themselves  and treat them how they want, so their main method of achieving sales goals is through intimidation of their employees. The worst part is the fact that management is aware of the unethical ways in which they treat employees because they constantly pressure employees not to complain to HR ."

The system they have set up is that when you are ready to begin working on a new task that they would go over it briefly with you first, while also expecting you to have certain knowledge before hand, and then want you to begin working on your own projects. This is okay when it comes down to smaller functions of the business but it lacks the necessary training when it comes to larger projects such as loan documentation reviews."

All of IBC at the moment is criminaly understaffed, so you will be doing at times the work of two to three people. The reasons for their being understaffed were made abundantly clear to me based not just off of the abysmal pay (starting 9.25 an hour, could make more at Dairy Queen for goodness sakes) but by the utterly lacking management or at the very clearly stated in the company's ""10 comandments"" that they owe you nothing for your hard work or commitment if you arnt lining their pocketbooks basically. I work with people who have been with the company for 10+ years who are miserable and overworked with nothing to show for it. My bank manager doesn't even have the actual title of bank manager despite running 3 locations for IBC, I'm assuming because they didn't want to be legally required to give a raise along with the official promotion. This is a typical soulless corporation who could care less about the people they have working for them as long as they can still make money and it shows. Needless to say after working here only a month I am already seeking work elsewhere despite going into the job delighted to enter the banking field only to be bombarded with unprofessional and downright ridiculous workplace issues that should be left to fast food and retail, not banking where you are handling people's life savings and livelihoods.

The pay is super low compared to the rest of the market and they try to make up for this by saying that you have an opportunity to make incentives on certain products. What they don't tell you is that it's almost impossible to sell these products. Their response to covid19 was terrible. We were told not to wear gloves because it ""scares the customer"". We're scared too! They never once closed their doors to customers like every other bank in the area did. On top of that they let go of some really amazing employees that had been there over 5 years when business slowed down due to covid. Employees are overworked, underpaid, and constantly hounded with sales goals. They are always reminded that their jobs are expendable and they can be replaced easily. My advice would be to stay for the training and then get out of there as soon as possible."
168,IBC Bank,CEO is a nightmare,2020-07-07,3.0,Mortgage Underwriter,"I liked the people I work with on a day to day basis.
Middle management is supportive as they can be
I worked on the mortgage side and if you I was able a lot of autonomy provided I could get my work done.
They paid into retirement for you.
Mid level managers value input
If you work managers will help and move you along a career path.","Pay is below industry standard for most positions. This is especially true on the retail bank side.
You pay for your benefits. 
While they set aside money for your retirement. You have no say on how it is invested. It is put into a plan that is very low risk and low return. While this is great for some....not everyone benefits as younger people need to build stronger return while they are young. Most people need returns of more than 2% in order to retire.
CEO is very old fashioned. You will have a required Christmas party every year for your yearly bonus. At which time you will be berated like a high school teenager. He will go on and on about your shortcomings letting you know you should be grateful for your job and here is a bonus what we might not do again. 
I never heard the one positive thing come out of the CEOs mouth. Instead we would be told we are ungrateful for what is provided and premadonnas. Never mind the fact that starting pay will not pay for an apartment in any major metro area.
Since they underpaying throughout the corporation, high turnover exist. People in all areas get there experience and move on so your manager will constantly be hiring to try to backfill positions. You will constantly be behind the curve as the CEO most approve all job openings and all raises so it would sometimes take 6 months after a promotion before a raise was realized. 
The motto is ""we do more"" they will chant this at meetings. Somewhat cult like as they expect you here and buy into the culture and sacrifice family time to do it. 
No PTO. You get two weeks vacation and then sick time. Sick time can roll over but vacation does not. You either use or lose.
During Covid I saw a girl cry because she was having a problem finding child care. They advice of HR and upper management was they would allow her to use her sick days. One girl had to quit because of this arrangement.
No work from home. You must come into work even during Covid. No accommodations were made until there was a large group of people calling the health department and raising so much of a fuss they had to take notice.
Our first email during Covid from CEO was to not call in sick as your just pushing your work onto someone else."

The pay is going to be $9.25 an hour and the most you can ever hope to make here is around $10.50, I believe. If you have to, get your banking experience and then go to a better bank. Incentives do not pay out as much as is claimed and they're extremely hard to come by.  

It should also be noted that in the COVID-19 pandemic, I know for a fact that they took lackluster efforts to protect employees and customers. The most branches got were tape on the floor and suspiciously packaged hand sanitizer.

Don't work there unless you speak Spanish fluently. Actually felt alienated due to being white. Pay is twice a month, and very low. Promised benefits that were never delivered.

197,IBC Bank,Good start in banking,2019-09-30,1.0,Sales Associate,Working at IBC strengthens your resume and prepares you to work at another financial institution,"I worked at IBC full-time for roughly seven months. I was excited when I first got the job because I knew banks are great about promoting from within so I saw a lot of opportunity and therefore was alright with only making 10/hr. After training I unfortunately was placed at the slowest branch in the San Antonio market. This  can make it difficult to meet sales goals when the goals for my branch were the same as the branch with the most traffic in the market. In order to meet goals management encourages sales associates to visit local businesses to offer employees accounts. However, IBC does not compensate for gas instead, they say that the incentives that you will earn from making those sales will cover for gas. This is not the case; blitzing in the San Antonio market at best is responsible for an additional seven percent of account generation. Sales associates earn six dollars per sales point and typically one account generates two or three sales points. This means at my branch, during a good month when we get twenty new accounts and sales calls are responsible for seven percent of sales 1.4 of those 20 accounts will be from sales calls and you can make anywhere from 12-24$ in incentives off of that account and that is supposed to cover your gas money for the month. To sum things up IBC is cheap and doesn't treat their employees well. However, I will acknowledge that not everyone has that experience. Other branches with higher traffic I have heard are much better to work at however busy branches still have a problem with turnover. I also would like to address some other signs that IBC is a bad company; not only do they not pay their employees they don't pay their bills. For instance, my branch received a notice in the mail that they were sixty days past due on their security bill. That is a red flag, good companies don't do that to people. Another red flag is that they have several branches without a manager and it has been like that for years. They consistently tell their employees that they are going to move them up so they will want to stick around but they don't often promote. For instance, there is a sales associate that has been working at one of the slower branches for quite some time and she has been able to get the whole branch to perform they keep telling this individual that they get a promotion but this person has yet to be promoted. Also, the majority of the managers in the San Antonio market don't actually have the title of branch manager because that would come with a bigger salary. Instead they are senior sales supervisors who barely make more than sales associates."

199,IBC Bank,"LOW PAY, HIGH EXPECTATIONS, RUDE COWORKERS",2019-09-20,1.0,Bank Teller,They do not drug test.,"Where do I begin? First, the pay is very low and uncompetitive. I started at $8.74/hr and after one year was making $9.74/hr. The expectations are high: You must open 2-4 new accounts per month; provide very fast and polite customer service, offer credit cards, offer other services, get to know the customer, and tell them about a possible survey, as well as asking them to donate to the current charity. However, there are referral incentives available to pay you money, but they don't tell you how hard they are to come by and get approved. You are constantly encouraged to work outside of work, because everyday that you are not at your sales quota, management IS DOWN YOUR THROAT. Another thing, management across branches and markets is very inconsistent. Every branch manager has their own specific way of doing things, and it often blurs the lines of policy and what should actually be happening. VERY BEHIND ON TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION; most of the time, the ATMs are malfunctioning (and most do not accept deposits); The mobile app has limited functions and is very unsophisticated. Employees are encouraged to move up, but with little incentive. A $0.30 raise is offered to lead tellers, with a huge heap of responsibilities. 
 
Lastly, there is major favoritism in management and several very rude employees. I used to have problems with multiple employees ignoring me or berating me when I would ask questions."

For the record, this place pays their poor tellers $9 an hour. You could make more working at McDonald's or as a custodian. 

Sean Stewart is the worst. All he cares about is numbers and accounts. Not you, nor the customer or his branch managers, Just his mean self and his Excel spreadsheet of how many people he took advantage of today."

There are strong stipulations to prevent employees from advancement opportunities.  A great example is moving from Universal Teller I to Universal Teller II; it takes over 6months to get the paperwork even approved to change job title and increase pay.  Also, cross training from Teller to Sales is also a nightmare, especially when a new hire sales can earn more than an existing employee who has experience and participating in the same training class."

218,IBC Bank,Has Potential and improving in some ways,2019-03-28,3.0,Systems Administrator,"My direct managers were some of the best I've had in terms of getting stuff done and looking out for good employees/allowing them to grow and move on. My coworkers and boss were the reason I got my new job. They also just had company wide pay raises, we have a pretty relaxed work environment, and are actively trying to improve technology/services. I leveraged my time/experience at IBC in such a way that really advanced my career (Help desk -> Senior Systems Engineer at upcoming job) because of the unique opportunities I had at IBC.","Oh man, IBC has some cultural and operational faults that really counteract all the good. 

Starting with the CEO, everyone calls him Mr. Nixon like he's better than the rest of us/on another level - this mindset manifests itself in various ways throughout the company. He treats most people not on executive management level as if they're dumb kids he has to watch out for and he knows what's best. He uses every opportunity to push his political opinions on you, whether it's a personal meeting or the bonus presentation. He talks for AN HOUR straight about ""new administration"" and takes a jab at any non-conservative politician, which ruins credibility. After laying off several of my coworkers and many other from various business units, he had the audacity to say that we should thank him for what he did and talked about how well business was doing - that obviously left a bad taste in everyone's mouth. 

There is not a lick of good corporate culture from the top - not a lot of ""fun"" events, the bonus presentation is pretty drab, no team happy hours or anything like that. If it wasn't for our direct management team actually caring about and wanting to get to know people, culture would have been totally absent. This feels like a direct result of how Nixon operates with execs at the top; no laughing, no joy, no happiness, ONLY hard work and numbers. This rubs off on some of the staff in the most insufferable way possible - breaks being timed to the minute, people always tattling and running to managers for stupid things that can be solved independently, not even allowing us to go to lunch together because of ""business needs"" in totally arbitrary settings. One of my managers even went so far as to not allow people to carpool because someone had complained about something and they thought that would solve the issue. 

Even though I mentioned pay raises, that still makes it mediocre at best especially in places like Austin/DFW/Houston. Human capital isn't built into IBC's business model. They will hire someone less experienced for less money, and deal with them leaving once they gain the skills - this means anyone worth keeping around tends to leave when they get the experience they need. This obviously has negative ramifications on the business. If they could ""do more"" for their employees like their motto for taking care of customers, people would stick around for a lot longer. Again, this feels like a direct result of Nixon thinking that none of his employees are competent/worth his while. 

All in all, these are indicative of bigger issues culturally at IBC. As long as these areas of opportunity exist, they will never grow/adapt to market changes and compete at the next level of banking."

242,IBC Bank,It's a stepping stone..,2018-08-01,2.0,Market Trainer,"There aren't really a lot of pros that come with working at IBC Bank. One of the few pros is that if someone is looking to get their foot in the door to the banking world, it's a good place to start. IBC Bank hires a lot of people with little to no banking experience as a teller or sales associate so it's a great place to get some experience. Other than that, if you're a college student they usually work with your schedule because many branches are open until 7 or 8 pm which allows someone to attend school and still work. Lastly, you get one full month of training as a teller or sales which makes you more knowledagble in your position, but also makes you more hirable at other banking institutions.","Oh where to begin...the biggest con is that IBC Bank does not pay very well at most levels of the bank. I couldn't tell you how many managers I know of that work a second job to make ends meet and as a manager of a bank, that's a disgrace to need to work two jobs. Due to this low pay, most lower employees who are not managers leave within six months to different institutions and to be honest, senior management doesn't care because there will always be people willing to work for the low wages they provide, and IBC knows this.  Depending on which region you work, most tellers start out around 9 dollars an hour while sales around 8.75 and their reason for this is because of the ""incentives"" you can earn. While you can make a decent amount of money with incentives, it's extremely competitive and the incentives are not that much so you'd need to sell a lot to make ends meet. 

Another downside to IBC Bank is there is no real room for growth in most markets. Most people who are at a management position have been at IBC for a long time and will never leave their position which leaves no real room for anyone below them to move up.  The only real way to move up, in most markets, is to know someone at a high level and for them to ""help you out."" 

When it comes to management though, again in most markets, there is no real leadership as most take the position for granted and don't really know a thing about how to effectively manage. In essence, employees are almost left to their own devices considering management isn't in the picture and serves no real purpose. You would that these ineffective managers would be reprimanded but you'd be wrong, nothing is ever done to those in a management position, especially if they have been working for the bank for a long time and when complaints are made, they are virtually ignored."

Tellers start at $8.70 per hour and sales at $10.56 and it is non-negotiable no matter what your management experience, sales experience, degree, or whatever is. They do not care. They tell you that you can have a career and move up there and give you “examples”of that happening. What they fail to mention is that they changed all the rules starting in 2018. The new rules state that nobody can go full time until after their 90 day probation is over AND they have been in performance for one month. Then you can ask to get full time hours. Then, if you perform for at least 6 consecutive months and if there is an open position at your branch, and if the higher ups care for you, you might get promoted. This never happens, though, because there are an astounding number of branches that don’t even have managers and tons of hard workers dying to promote. They could not care less. Tellers can get quarterly raises of 30 cents if they get a certain number of accounts opened per month but there is a cap on how high they can go. Sales associates get no raises whatsoever. Their goal/point system is absolutely horrendous and unattainable. There are 9+ branch/personal goals that are required to perform. You have to drive from business to business soliciting and begging for accounts and it’s pathetic. People do not want to open up accounts with us because we are a terrible bank and it’s pretty obvious. Everything that they teach you in training is a lie, and the higher ups have a horrifying problem with gossip and bad mouthing their employees. When people try to quit, they tell them that it’s about to get better, and it never does. This is not the only bank that will hire you without experience, and i highly recommend going somewhere else. I have never seen a bank pay so low especially for what they require of their employees. You will also have to travel about 1/3 of the time you work for the bank, going to branches that are not yours and that are ridiculously far at times because they do not know how to staff properly. This means that you cannot get your own branch goals worked on because you are away. The schedules for all employees in the entire state of Oklahoma and the Dallas area are made by one person which causes a lot of issues and we get our schedules the Friday before the next week begins, usually, so you really can’t plan anything in your life either. There is nothing about this company that is worth it. Technology and policies are very old and they have no desire to change."

261,IBC Bank,Awful Experience,2018-02-27,1.0,Anti-Money Laundering Analyst,Not much besides my manager who tried unsuccessfully to make things better.,"I was constantly ignored by coworkers when trying to socialize or ask for help and even had a door slammed in my face twice by coworkers. My coworkers would purposely leave me out of group events when they could get away with it and I could hear them saying nasty things about me when they thought I was listening to music in my headphones. I cried once when I didn't get some of the extra food left over from a management meeting because I was having trouble affording food regularly and the next day when there was food left over a coworker brought some over telling me she didn't want me to cry in front of everyone again very loudly. At one point I was leading a trivia activity to bring everyone closer together but my coworkers started to refuse to go because I was leading it. So I started missing a lot of work because of the bullying. It was difficult to get out of bed in the morning and sometimes I didn't make it to work at all. After a while I found out form a coworker that I was fired so I didn't go back. Didn't even get to find out from my boss...
Also the CEO asked everyone to call their state reps and ask them to vote in favor of the Tax Bill. I'm fairly sure this is illegal for a publicly traded company. He also called Millennials lazy inattentive pot heads in front of everyone after we had a successful year. 
The copay to see a Dr is $50 and if you miss a Friday or Monday without a Dr note they consider it as you quitting."

No one ever gets a raise here, unless you get some major promotion or unless you beg for it. 

I also feel that certain employees are definitely favored over others. Certain employees will get promotions and raises left and right, while others are stuck doing the same thing for 13 years.

They ask you to go out every day and walk into businesses and pass out flyers and cards to get people to come into the bank. I've never had someone open an account from prospecting. You have to go to at least 5 places a day in your area so a lot of the visits we make are repeat. So businesses get annoyed. Your sales also depend a lot on what the customer does so it's out of your control. If the customers account falls below 10 bucks you don't get to count that sale. If they use their debit card less than 3 times you don't get to count that sale.

Speaking of pay: IBC is one of the lowest pay banks in any metro city area.  It claims to by a high performance company and prides itself on its consistent quarters of profitability, but none of this translates to truly competitive pay for any of its employees.  
Your average high level VP makes around $60k a year, which is embarrassing when compared to the same position with substantial responsibility in any industry.
In SA: Area Sales Managers/bank officers, the AVP of Marketing and AVP of HR, head of training, head of security, among other high level positions make well under $47,000 a year.

Worst thing I see is people giving excuses to fail without finding solution succeed; and then blame the company. This company brought many people lots of opportunities just by hard working and creating competitive environment.
334,IBC Bank,Pay is horrible,2016-10-09,2.0,,None really. It is a bit disappointing,Tellers make a mere 8.60 an hour and are required to open 4 accounts a month with no bonuses on it. Think 7 products can be sold for additional income but cross selling isn't great when you have a line. You have to also work a year to transfer in the bank despite being perfectly qualified for the job.

The company is based out of Laredo, where labor is very cheap. They carry this mindset to the rest of the company and pay below the par salary wise. The company will do anything to save a penny even if it is to the employee or customer's expense. The staff will try and bully you into donating money to charities they are associated with. Not only that, but if you are promoted within then you are promoted only in responsibilities and roles but not in salary. There are little policies outlined to protect you, the employee.

I was hired with a promise of ""fast track to management"" because of my education and experience. Turns out it's not possible to become a manager until you've worked for the company for a minimum of years; I think it was 4 years? Maybe?

- They have a job fair every week for a variety of positions.  
- Sufficient (more or less) training.
- Decent to somewhat good benefits.
- Possibility of increasing your income with commissions.","- Very high turnover, main reason why they have a job fair every week, with the positions of tellers and sales associates being the main objective as the majority of tellers and sales associates do not last more than 10 months. All the branches are usually understaffed, especially on customer heavy days, which causes customers to leave the branches in a bad mood.
- Very oriented on sales and account generation, you need to meet a goal at the end of the month even if you have to sell accounts to friends and family to reach that goal.
- Very low pay, especially for the tellers.
- Don't expect higher management to back you up, one mistake and you are gone.

GREAT training program and AMAZING instructors","Very Manipulative upper management

They tend to hire young people who have never worked before and don't realize how horrible the management is

There is so much drama its ridiculous. And the majority of it is caused by the upper management of whom most of them are in the 40s-50s

In the beginning they start you out in this great training program that I'm pretty for sure is meant to brainwash you into thinking that you're actually working for a good company before you go into your actually branch and see what a shit-storm it really is.

They give you a starting sales goal of 11 points which seams pretty easy but then when you start getting accounts they make up ridiculous reasons as to why certain accounts don't count towards your points and by the end of the month it's almost impossible to reach your sales goal, especially if you work in a branch with several employees who are also on trying to make their goals.

I had a customer that was being wrongfully charged and when I called the back office to see what had happened they couldn't figure it out until finally they put me on the phone with the manage and she said  ""I don't know"" and acted like that was a sufficient enough answer. I spoke with my area sales manager telling him that this was horrible customer service and wasn't acceptable in my book and he said he was so sorry and would be contacting his boss to get this resolved. I emailed him once a week until the day I quit  to make sure things were being handled and he always said he was working on it...my last day at IBC (3 months after I had initially contacted him about this problem) the issue had still not been resolved!!

It is a paid training that usually takes up to 2 months and some of the topics include federal guidelines and regulations surrounding the banking institutions, learning about different types of transactions, dealing with difficult customers, and handling oneself in situational circumstances.","The management pays its tellers less than $8/hour, but has massive expectations from them. Some of the managers remind tellers on a daily basis to pester existing customers into opening more accounts.

There is the potential to make a decent salary, but you better know a lot of people and businesses that would be willing to open new accounts and products with you.  Another con is that they have a sales quota that you have to hit in order to keep working there, and that is also how you make your extra dollars on top of the almost minimum wage job.  The job itself is not that difficult, in fact if you work at a branch where new people are coming in all the time it might seem easier to hit your sales goals.  But the standard that is at the busy location is the same goal standard at the slowest location as well.  The company is based out of Laredo, Texas.  All the major decisions come out of that area.  However, some of the policies that they implement make since in that region, but won't where you work."

Staff has goals that continue to increase every 4 months without end, and employment is contingent upon continued performance.

Pay is easily half of what other banks pay for equal positions. No holidays (IBC is open sundays and almost every holiday, Including July 4th!), and any hour after 40 in a week is paid 1/2 normal pay.

Management is constantly over-stressed to meet monthly new account goals but are woefully under-equipped to meet this challenge. Staff is always too new to assist since turnover to so high.

The bank itself is growing into new markets, building more branches, acquiring new financial services (retail banking + mortgages + all kinds of insurance, etc.). 

The bank prides itself on its customer service, and trains employees extensively to deliver a strong ""IBC experience"". It also regularly monitors the quality of customer service employees are giving to its customers by using frequent management reviews, coaching, and mystery shopping.

IBC, as they put it, has never had a ""down year"", and follows federal regulation and policy well. It ranks high on bank transparency lists, and has been scandal-free since its inception. Lay offs are not a concern here.","IBC is very behind on the times. The computer software has not been updated in quite some time (Windows XP, Microsoft Office 2007) and the account management systems also need major updating. The internal website is not as intuitive as it should or could be. Internal information systems are very fragmented and thus inefficient. 

High employee turnover is the company's major issue. IBC requires no tertiary education for new hires who work in their branches. It appears that it is so desperate to staff its branches that it hires low quality people who lower morale and spread negativity in the workplace. Often, new hires lack maturity, social skills, and professional experience. Another problem is the salary, which is so low that the few people with professional experience and college education frequently leave for better pay and to work among peers. Additionally, the sales goals can sometimes be too high for even experienced people to achieve, and thus they quit before they are fired, leaving branches for new trainees who have no experience or expertise.

As I stated in the pros section before, there is opportunity to move up. This is largely due to the high turnover rate. If you manage to make it there for more than one year, consider yourself promoted. The question is, promoted to what? There are plenty of lower management positions, but the pickings are slim if you want to move above lower management, and even slimmer if you want to move into a department outside of retail operations. 

IBC offers extensive training to its new hires (great), but the classes are way too long and drawn out, and often focus on topics that any mature professional would already know (a four hour lecture on telephone etiquette and a thirty minute exercise on proper hand shaking were completely tedious and unnecessary). The trainers tend to treat the trainees like children (as many of them unfortunately act that way). 

The communication system is extremely fragmented. People are often misinformed or uninformed about events and procedures that pertain directly to you, causing annoyances and resulting in wasting people's time.

Lastly, as the company is a bank based out of Texas, it is unsurprisingly conservative. This would be fine, except that the CEO has recently attempted to push his political agenda onto employees, which has made some very uncomfortable."
501,IBC Bank,Great starter company & good for advancement; but lots of turnover!,2012-06-25,3.0,Teller,"IBC is a great starter company. Due to high turnover, it makes for good advancement. IBC has some good perks such as the gotcha doing something good program, the referral program, vacation after probationary period,etc.  IBC does seem to care what the employees think.  They do an internal anonymous survey for better changes within company and they have lunches with one of the higher ups who listens to the employees feedback.  The lunch is also usually at a nice restaurant and company paid.","The bad part about working for IBC is that they have 7 day branches and it makes you feel as if you live there.  We also work on the holidays, but don't get holiday pay."
502,IBC Bank,If one person said it they might be wrong but it many say it then it's more than likely true IBC is not a job you want,2012-06-13,1.0,Bank Teller,"IBC trianing is great and make sure that there empolyees know what they are doing

IBC doesn't pay overtime there have found a way to legally pay empolyees half of there hourly pay
IBC wants empolyees to be too happy with customers and if customer states that the empolyee was not nice IBC would give the empolyee a change to explain for what happen
accounts have to be opened all the time they want at least 17 accounts a month per teller per bank
IBC branch empolyees don't get paid hoildays HELL we don't get hoildays They only give 4 hoildays a year x-mas, new years day, easter, and thanksgiving  no other hoildays
600 bi weekly is enough for how they treat you"
503,IBC Bank,Great place to gain experience but horrible pay.,2012-06-01,2.0,Sales Associate,"Great benefits, great training, nice sense of community within the market you work in, bonuses, occasional company events that are lots of fun. There is a set guideline to move to the next position, hence if you start at ""x"" date and are an employee for ""x"" amount of time you automatically qualify for the next position... as long as your meeting your performance goals.","Horrible pay, office politics plays more of a role the higher you move up. Preposterous performance requirements after about 9 months."
504,IBC Bank,REDICULOUS!!,2012-04-03,1.0,"Okay, If You Were A Monkey!!!","Co-workers were very friendly, almost family. Not easy to find that.
Good place to start in a business world to find out what to do and what NOT to do","IBC is a sad excuse for a bank. The way upper management treats lower class, its soooo horrible. People getting fired because they didn't perform!!! Really!! This is a furniture store or a car dealership! We don't make money off the commission!! IBC needs to focus more on the customers and their needs. Not trying to shove a new account down their throat! We need to build a relationship with the customers and establish good friendships. People don't want to bank somewhere they dont know anybody or they dont trust! Turn-over is horrible! Quit firing people and focus on thr customers and their needs and not about performance! IBC's turn-over is worse than McDonalds!!"

508,IBC Bank,Low Pay and Bad Hours,2011-10-05,1.0,Sales Associate,Good as a strarter position for experience to move onto another institution.,The worst pay in the industry with very little room for growth. The training is focused way too heavily on policies and not enough on the customer experience and growing the business.
509,IBC Bank,Little to no experience needed,2011-10-04,3.0,,"No experience needed to start as a banker, fast promotion, good benifits","Pay is no where near what other banks pay, goals are extremely high and if you reach past 31points 3 times you are terminated.  The number of accounts are more important that the quality of accounts."
