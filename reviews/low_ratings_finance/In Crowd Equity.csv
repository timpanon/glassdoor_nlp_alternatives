0,In Crowd Equity,Employee,2016-05-12,1.0,,"Absolutely nothing. Place is very disorganized, fights almost everyday, and a very unprofessional environment.","I don't even know where to start. Manager visits inappropriate websites using the company's computer during work hours while everybody is working their butts off. Looks like everything is a scam for sure. Some of the brokers are alcoholics and/or on drugs. There are fights almost everyday at the office. No business structure, no HR department, no rules. Let me not even talk about the pay......Horrible!"
1,In Crowd Equity,Associate broker,2016-01-28,1.0,,There are no pros. This place is scum. The place should be condemned. Almost positive what they do is illegal.,Where do I start? People getting in fights in the office. Several alcoholic brokers who are just mad because their old principals either fired them or they were let go for security fraud. There is never Internet connection and the phones are constantly down. I don't know anybody who would ever invest with them you are automatically losing money. The sketchiest place in Manhattan and that's saying a lot!!
2,In Crowd Equity,Excellent Company!,2016-01-05,5.0,Broker,"Great base pay, Great investments, Great training, Great leads, Great people, etc. What more could you want?",There are no cons I can think of really.
3,In Crowd Equity,Great Company. Strong Management. Fair wage.,2015-12-09,5.0,Broker,"Very good experience selling investments over the phone. Fair wage, good training, overall great business experience. The investments that are offered are quality deals and the company pays for and provides more leads than any sales company that I have worked for, I definitely recommend working for this company.",There is not really enough time to go to the gym on my lunch hour because my gym is too far from my office so I go after work.
4,In Crowd Equity,Administrative Assistant,2015-10-01,1.0,,The owner does not bother you as long you are closing deals.,"Fly by night startup equity firm from the UK. The pay is horrible, big turn over. There is no structure at this company. They need a Human Resource Dept. The building is old, elevator only holds 5 people, The internet service sucks still on DSL. Open desk layout, no privacy, no coffee machine, no microwave!"
