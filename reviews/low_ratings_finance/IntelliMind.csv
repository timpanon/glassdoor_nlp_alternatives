vague requirements"
1,IntelliMind,Company is not providing experince letter.,2021-04-07,1.0,NLP Engineer,It's tough to speak about pros when the company behaves like this with ex-employees,"I had worked for the company as an NLP Engineer Intern from June 2020 to July 2020, and as an NLP Engineer (Full Time) from August 2020 to February 2021. 

I had followed all company norms regarding resignation and notice period. The HR and CEO had accepted the resignation and had said that they would provide me with the necessary relieving/experince letter (I have emails for this). 

The company had denied my request for a salary certificate saying that their ""law team"" has told them not to provide it in India. But, they had agreed to provide the Experince Letter. 

It has been more than a month since my last day. I had not received my salary for almost a month, but after 2 weeks of daily requests I atleast received that (again, I have all correspondence in the form of emails). Since then, the company has ghosted me. It's been almost another month now. The HR, CEO, none of them are replying to my requests for an experience letter. I am being ignored on all channels. I have neither been provided any updates, nor any reason why they are not providing me the letter.

Avoid this company at all costs if you care about your career. This is a trap, and under the name of being a stealth startup, they are not following standard business practices. The time you will spend with this company will be wiped from your career, and it'll do more harm than good."

4,IntelliMind,Bad,2020-10-15,1.0,Internship,Nothing to mention about pros,"Fake
Promises equity which has no value anyway
Promises good pay, but plays with dirty tricks
Expects to get world class software developed for least pay and in impossibly short span of time
Expects you to work till night
Cruel people playing with future of students"
5,IntelliMind,"Great Environment, Fast-Paced Work",2020-06-03,5.0,Senior Backend Engineer,"-As a newcomer onto the field, working at a startup is helping me to acquire essential skills at a fast pace while working on an intriguing project.
-Promise of rapid growth as a company and a larger salary","-Intial pay is not the highest
-Challenging to get started"
6,IntelliMind,WORST company to work for,2020-05-12,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- No pros, the positive reviews are FAKE. Trust me.","- The company is a SCAM in itself. They will interview you, give you some real time problem statement which will take at least a full dedicated 2 week's time. After that they DISAPPEAR. This way the company is getting its work done for FREE , wasting candidate's time. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE."
7,IntelliMind,Sr. Software Engineer,2019-12-09,5.0,Software Development Engineer,"Before starting as a Software Engineer, I was fresher. I acquired significant skills in Python, Flask, Kafka, and Spark. In addition, I got a chance to work on NLP, NLU, NLI and Cognitive computing. 

I really got a chance to acquire significant knowledge related to Stock Market, Market Microstructure and how people make money.","Some times I feel Test-Driven Developing software is worth every bit, but the learning curve is steep."
8,IntelliMind,Don't care about employee,2019-08-28,1.0,Internship,"Startup, good for fast learning and growth",Want professional level coding ability but does not want to pay even a decent stipend. They dont have products to show and no ethics
