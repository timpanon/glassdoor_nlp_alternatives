base pay decent
3 weeks of PTO was actually the best thing about the company.","-management was useless
-no accountability
-benefits were a joke
-no chance for promotion unless you were friends with the big shots at old companies. If you were friends they would hire you with a manager or vp title with no experience.
-closing loans took months. for 2021 it was an average of 98 days to close a loan.
- so many meetings that were just the managers circle jerking each other saying how great they are but nothing got done.
-claims there were no overlays but constantly made them up and lied and said they were agency guidelines b/c they had no idea what was going on."

9,Intercontinental Capital Group,"No training, expect to be laid off at any time",2022-02-23,1.0,Loan Processor,"Fully remote. Apparently the per loan bonuses are better than other places but this is the only lender I've worked for.

The individuals I've worked with have been wonderful. Even my direct leads and managers have been great people.","- No raises, no reviews -- I've been at the company for a year and a half and I have not had one performance review or even talk of a raise. We've been told for months that ""it's in the works"" but no progress has been made. Not even a cost of living increase. If you were promoted at some point and then demoted, you make more than people at your same level. 
- Loan volume is low and it's difficult to close loans -- the per loan bonus MIGHT be better than other companies but with the terrible quality of loans, the weird underwriting guidelines, and just lack of solid processes you won't make anywhere NEAR what they say is possible. I am making about about half the monthly bonus that was indicated.
- Could be laid off at any time : over the past 3 months they laid off probably 70% of the company. The best one was that they did a round of hiring then 1 month later did a huge cut. Then another month later they laid off those people they had just hired. Senior management is unable to provide any assurances about job security. 
- No training -- I was brought on during a hiring boom. The training was 3 days with a trainer who had no example material, and had been with the company only a week. The company brought in a group from another lender and they were fantastic, trying to institute reasonable changes, get the loan officers to actually follow procedures. Then they were let go and all of our loans suck again. So the processors don't have good training, the loan officers don't know what they're doing, and each underwriter has their own ideas about what's needed. It creates an extremely uncomfortable work environment where everyone thinks everyone else sucks at their jobs. 
- Leadership across the board is bad or overwhelmed -- the company is run like it's a high-school group project. No discernable direction, always starting or stopping projects or trainings. They want to start focusing on purchase loans but nobody in the company (sales, underwriting, processors, closers) has any idea what they're doing with them. Results in every purchase coming down to the last minute. It's nice not to be micromanaged but it's not so great when you can't get any help on questions that are vital to a customer's loan. 
- In summary: it's nice to be remote but there is ZERO career growth, no feedback, no training, and the benefits suck too. It is an amateur operation across the board and I would absolutely not recommend working here or being a customer. 

It's a joke of a company and the CEO is an absolute clown."

All denied, ignored and received hostile responses. 

My lay off is not my fault. The mission statement about doing it right the first time was priceless. Unfortunately, the leadership that was in place was very mom and pop. Titles but no real leadership skills or other positive affirmations. People in places that do not uphold the vision or mission of ICG 2005.

- Training was rushed, inefficient and unorganized.

- Management was absolute garbage. My lead and manager were often hard to reach, inattentive, unhappy, incompetent, dishonest and it's clear that they hated being supervisors. There is no accountability on management whatsoever. My manager had the nerve to tell me that I was relying on my lead too much. How is that possible when she was extremely unresponsive and when she did respond it was days later. She rarely talked to her team and relied on another entry level processor to answer the teams questions.

All management does is stay in meetings all day then log off. They accused me of not being able to efficiently do my job when they should have acknowledged that there are several large potholes in the process that need to be fixed immediately and I'm not the only processor that feels that way. I was doing this job for over a year now and they are STILL struggling with title, scared to talk to underwriting about their erroneous conditions and can barely perform a successful closing. Instead of getting to the root cause of the issue, they rather create another checklist. No process improvement has occurred just a lot passing the buck, lack of accountability and stalling, it's hilarious.

- They set unreachable goals even though they have NO LOANS.
I believe you all had been fudging my numbers and setting goals that could not be obtained for a while now and when I questioned it, they passed the buck to the VP, saying the numbers come from her. Their math wasn't adding up correctly. How does my goal steadily increase but my pipeline doesn't? I went from consistently getting loans to getting little to none for weeks and when I brought this to their attention, they disregarded what I said. When I advised that I had concerns about my pipeline, they disregarded what I said. Yet still continued to call me a ""top performer"" knowing full and well you were being dishonest. When I brought up issues with title, uw and closing, again they disregarded. When I asked about performance reviews, they disregarded knowing that you all were plotting against me and apparently others. Luckily, I'm not oblivious to the shady tactics of your kind and peeped this a while ago.

-They also pick and choose who they give their loans too. It's no surprise, that your top performers are Caucasian while all the minorities are clinging for loans. Do better and try not to make it so obvious next time. Everyone is well aware of you all cherry picking through loans and giving them to your favorites.

- Majorly over hired and have been laying people off consistently for the last few weeks. GOOD PEOPLE GETTING LAID OFF BECAUSE YOU ALL COULDN'T GET YOUR OPERATION TOGETHER.

DO BETTER."

48,Intercontinental Capital Group,Worst company I have ever worked for.,2021-11-12,1.0,Mortgage Loan Processor,Work Hours are flexible sometimes.,The training is very poor. They ask for employees feedback but completely ignore it. They hired people with no experience as an experiment just to hire people with experience a year later and laid off over 100 people they hired before the new people they just hired with no notice and no severance. No 401k match. The health insurance and dental is very expensive than normal and coverage is even worse. Turn times for mortgage loans are sooo long but they expect the processors to make a miracle. Underwrites do what ever they want but the company blames the processors for every single issue. You get Pto but they don’t let u use it and when u quit ( because u will) they won’t pay your your price. I could go on and on. This company is not ethical at all. Don’t trust them run away! Save yourself and your family and look else where. Trust me please! God bless.
49,Intercontinental Capital Group,Great Mtg Shop,2021-11-12,5.0,Sales,Great Leads and Pay. Remote is an option as well,Direct mail shop so from time to time you may have a day with light calls. Plenty of outbound ops though
50,Intercontinental Capital Group,You can find way better!!!!!!,2021-11-11,1.0,Loan Processor,My fellow Processors were the best part of this job!,"If I can give a -0- I would. Working for this company showed me how much a company will truly chew you up, work you death for their own gain, take advantage of you to the fullest, and throw you away regardless of how good you treated them.

No real training. They threw you into it, and expect you to know it, and then reprimanded you with updated policies that were created along the way. ICG way!!! It was horrible coming to work everyday with no guidance or direction. Employees depended on each other to figure out how to process loans everyday. And you are left not feeling confident, when it should be the other way around.

Underwriting unnecessarily kicks loans back, and you are constantly communicating with leads who are over turning the Underwriters decisions. There is a new Underwriter it seems like everyday. And no one knows what the other is doing, nor do they follow the same process. They make up their own rules. One will let something pass, and the other will suspended your file for the same issue. They over condition or under condition. Or when you complete the file, all of the sudden you have 10 other things to get, that were not originally asked for. It's frustrating, especially when you have a borrower demanding something be done, and the Underwriter is unwilling to budge. But when you get a Supervisor involved or the head of the company, all of the sudden they CTC your file. Your lucky if you can close a loan in under 30 days. The average is 45 days or longer, which is crazy.

Cleaning up after the officers and managers is hard task especially when there is lack of communication. The Loan Officers are constantly pushed to put loans in ITP, but they fail to look at the whole picture of the borrowers; or they fail to get the documents that should be with the file before they ITP it. They don't ask the borrowers the necessary questions that will help close their loans; they don't communicate with their borrowers; They fail to write notes in the system so you know what is going on with the file. So by the time it gets to the processor, its impossible to move the file quickly. This is constant here. And you will get talked to if the loan is still sitting, regardless of how many times you have told them why. You will get yelled at by the borrowers, because we are asking for documents that should have already been asked for. The Loan Officers are not held accountable here, but the Processors are. The Loan Officers walk more around the building, then they do talking to their borrowers on their current status. Its the Processors job to do that. And don't ask the LO's to get the documents that should have been in the file, because you will get an email saying don't ask them to paper chase, they need to be on the phone.

The health care plans are far from affordable, and you can only cover yourself, and even then it still expensive. Over $500 for me and my significant other. They do not contribute to it either. You can find way cheaper outside of the company and get better coverage without choosing and HSA. The only affordable plans were the vision and dental. The dental coverage is amazing. The vision is terrible.

And guaranteed they will comment on how they are changing for the better good and trying to implement new things. My advice run! You can find way better. That goes to Processors, Loan Officers, anyone!"

They give you visions of grandeur about how many great leads they have and that the top 20% is closing 20 plus loans a month. It took at least 90 days to close standard refinances even with an appraisal waiver. Self employed borrower? Good luck getting an UW who knows how to figure income correct. Classic excuse after excuse as to why leads slow down. Blame the mailing house, COVID, winter storms, summer storms and on and on. Then postpone new and exciting developments which are standard at other companies. You cannot self disclose an application, get a pre-approval for purchase and have to lock purchase loans for a minimum of 60 days. Appraisers in their AMC take at least 2 weeks to contact a borrower and months to finish. Often notaries leave your customer absolutely no (0) documents at closing. How can they review a refi for 3 days without docs? 

If they tell you these problems are all in the past and you believe that or they give you an LO to talk to chances are its the carrot one that they feed leads and repeat customers to. Literally almost 0 diversity in the management group."

-turn times on loans submitted is longer than it should be, but they’re working on reducing it. 
-SAFE training was great, but Mortgage 101 was awful."
87,Intercontinental Capital Group,Avoid ICG Completely,2021-04-29,1.0,Mortgage Loan Officer,There are no pros here.,"The abject failure of Senior Vice President Bill Pace to monitor the daily operations of his direct reports - namely sales team managers - resulted in over 150 lay-offs yesterday - people who in good faith had joined ICG with the intention of working hard to achieve mutual goals for the good of themselves and the company. Many of these people left stable jobs and bought into promises of six-figure salaries, multiple state licenses and market-leading training. The reality was quite different. The 'Sales 101' training program was basic, outdated and contradictory to team managers preferred practices. Additionally, there is absolutely no relationship between team managers and the marketing department who are responsible for allocating states to MLO's based on company need. With some MLO's passing their SAFE exam on the first attempt then waiting 3 months and still having not even one state allocated, and other MLO's having states allocated within days of retaking their SAFE exam following an initial failed result, it seems that there is internal favoritism and that some of the team managers are unwilling to chase up on behalf of their team, thus paving the way for lay-offs based on non-performance. 
Despite the 5-minute call to advise of lay-offs (in which Bill Pace did not even have the courtesy to switch his camera on) which focused on a 'market dip,' lay-offs are the complete failure of senior managers inability to collaborate with other departments within the company and to adequately plan for variable staffing needs. The 153 people you laid off yesterday - which abhorrently included only 2-days of pay - have been let down by ICG and the ones remaining have had their commission structure halved. This is not the sign of a healthy or sustainable company."
88,Intercontinental Capital Group,Management is a joke,2021-04-29,1.0,MOrtgage Loan Originator,Good training program that will get you licensed,"Management is extremely disorganized and could literally care less about new staff.

But they gave ALL of us no explanation,, just that they were letting all 10 of us go. But I did get months of paid training, however lacking it was, out of all of it. Overall the company is a complete joke."

112,Intercontinental Capital Group,Disaster,2020-05-13,1.0,Loan Officer,"Worked remote
Manager was a good guy","Too many to list, but I will try: 
- leads come in through a gift card they mail to prospective clients. These people have recently closed on a home loan and the gift is sent to them for $100 and it says call to activate. Needless to say most people are calling in to inquire about the money so right off the bat you are playing defense because these people think it is some kind of scam. It is now your job to make an app out of this lead. Dont get me wrong, these are still leads, but people are already hesitant with this information and the process in general and now to throw in the added component of trying to convince these people we are not scamming them makes things a little harder.
- At a regular mortgage shop, closing rates will vary but generally you are safe if you are closing between 10-15% of leads given. ICG expects the same numbers. There is one huge difference though between ICG and most other places, ICG does not have a junior team that is dialing out all days and warm transferring. So at most other shops, if you get 10 leads, you can at the very least say you spoke to 10 human beings that have least heard the word refinance one time before agreeing to be transferred to you. So in this scenario you assume it makes sense that you should close one, if not two, of these leads. Now take ICG, if you get 10 ""leads"" that is 10 phone calls coming in for the gift card. On average 3-4 of those will be dead airs. Lets say there are 7/10 remaining, out of that 7 lets say 3 just want the gift card (which is being optimistic) that leaves 4 people who may be willing to speak with you. Out of these 4 you are still going to ask your qualifying questions, so if they have a low rate and no equity there really is nothing you can do. You can pull credit if you want just for numbers sake, but its really just a head fake. Lets say you pull credit on 2 of those 4, you better be closing one of them. Long story short, if you can pull an app, at ICG more than any place else you REALLY need to close those apps to have a chance at making money, because getting 10 leads does not mean 10 potential customers. Realistically/optimistically it means around 2-3 potential customers. 
- Pricing and rates are not that competitive. Dont get me wrong they are not insane but if you are competing with another shop, odds are not in your favor. My team was doing mainly streamlines and IRRRLs and so especially on IRRRLs you need to meet the recoup. I have never been at a shop where they will not lower the costs the necessary amount to make a loan pass and fund. I had a handful where we needed around $1000 off the closing costs and secondary just came back and said they could not do it. Especially if you are going to focus on government streamlines and IRRRls, you need to be ready to lower costs to make loans work, otherwise why even advertise if you can not close loans. On a VA IRRRL, you can expect closing costs to run between 2-5k. I have not done a lot of IRRRLs and streamlines before ICG but that seems high.
-processing is ATROCIOUS. This is something that was really hard for me to understand because when I originally got hired we had morning phone conferences with the team and a few times, one particular SVP jumped on the call and said how they are making ""tremendous"" improvements in processing. This sounded good to all of us. Fast forward three months. Each loan that gets submitted sits in a bucket before being assigned to a processor. At this point, technically, the loan is out of the LOs hands since we have sold the deal, esigned, and sent in the stips. But for some reason a loan might sit in this queue for a week or so. I thought maybe there was a shortage of processors and so they didnt want to give processors too many loans to handle at once, which is totally fair. I never did figure that part out. Moving away from that, fast forward to approved with conditions. This is what really starts to get ridiculous, I had three loans in March sitting in approved with conditions (all of them were approved prior to 3/15), two of them the processor was nice enough to send a welcome email with no further follow up, and the other one (according to the borrower) there was no communication whatsoever from processing. Once Covid-19 hit around mid April fico requirements go up and those 3 loans still have not closed. Because they have not been touched in 3 WEEKS!! All 3 end up dying because they are now below the new fico requirement and that is that. You can make all the ""tremendous"" improvements you want, but if you cant have processors work on files that are approved, you might want to start there before implementing different strategies. These are steamlines and IRRRLs, they should only take 3 weeks to close, not 3 weeks sitting in an approved queue with no one touching it. 
- When I mentioned this to my manager he said that he knew processing was having difficulties but there really much we could do about it. My manager's a good guy so I dont blame any of this one him but its pretty challenging when these very basic issues are happening day in and day out and it doesnt seem like there is anything you can do about it. 
- Last thing. This isn't even a big deal in the grand scheme but I think it sums up the processing behind the scenes pretty well. I was going over my pipeline one day and I noticed a few loans that were sitting in CTC and they had been sitting there for a a few days (around 5 days) I saw who the processor was (and it was the same on both files) so I emailed and asked if we need anything else before we can push this to docs. She replied and said I need to call them to figure out when the notary can come to their house?! First off, I've been an LO for about 5 years, I've never had to schedule the notary. Second, if I had not have emailed asking about this file, how long would the processor let it sit there? At that point, the loan is basically at the one yard line and we still cant get it in the end zone. I called and had the it scheduled in about ten minutes for both files. But the bigger issue for me is just, can they really not call the borrower and figure that one last part out? Is that really so difficult? I dont know, maybe."
