Decent place to start your career and get your foot in the door if you’re looking to gain some product exposure. I got good enough work experience to now work at a hedge fund. 

Coworkers were mostly good people to work with and supported each other (this is excusing upper management)","Little to 0 room for growth after your first year or 2. Yearly bonuses and raises are minimal and they had a freeze on promotions for 2.5 years out of my 3 years working there.
They make it clear that they aren’t hiring replacements in New York. If people leave and are looking to Indian resources to replace the production. 

I don’t know who I’m writing this review for because they made it very clear they are not hiring in New York.

Plenty of WFH and flex time.,"Training is abysmal.  Reviews are overly harsh.  This is not a place to come before gaining more meaningful experience in public accounting.  They will expect you to know how to do things with the smallest amount of informal training, then grill you for not knowing how to do it, and suggest maybe you should sit for your CPA to learn (yet the company provides little to no support for CPA candidate classes/exams sponsorship).  There is a core group that has been with the company for years, and advancement from the lower level is damn near impossible.  There are accountants there with little knowledge themselves, but merely got in when things were better."

Work-life balance is achievable, I guess.","Well, let's see - pay on low levels is pretty much average, bonuses are poor. The biggest issue is related to too agressive hiring targets thus turnover, immature if not ridiculous (and illiterate) managers and directors, lack of proper structure and development plans are the typical issues which one will face. You can get promoted just for hanging on there and keeping your mouth shut as people leave all the time and replacements - even if the only candidate is an underperformer - are forced . They do not invest in any technology really either so one needs to work on something that makes ""Matrix"" interface look really modern again."

There are literally no other pros - I am having to go back and add this sentence because my pros section had to be at least 20 words.","Everything other than the two pros mentioned above. Management hires new college graduates (as I was) with no experience because we're cheap to pay. When you start the job though, you're expected to be a financial expert. It's an absolute joke. Asking questions is discouraged. If you don't know something, expect to be chastised by supervisors. Management is unwilling to invest in training employees. Employees are overworked and underpaid. In my case, there was roughly twice as much work and people who were physically capable of completing it. I left in October, and 4 out of 7 employees in Kansas City have left since then, 3 of whom worked there for less than 6 months. This comes as no shock at all. The turnover is through the roof. I went from being a confident, happy individual, to someone with no self esteem who suffered from work-related depression. IFS revolves around hiring unqualified college graduates, overloading them with work and refusing to train, having those same employees quit, and finding new, unexpecting graduates to take their places, and dehumanize them just as they did the last group. I especially liked the comparison one reviewer on here uses to describe IFS; it's like a high school clique, where management are the snobs, and if one snob has a problem with you, they all will, even if for no reason at all. I was absolutely amazed at the lack of maturity from grown adults who serve in leadership roles for this company. I truly feel sorry for anyone who gets themselves into this company because I know of the pain that they will inevitably go through. I am thrilled that the majority of my coworkers have found new jobs (and in doing so, found happiness) because this company is an absolute hell hole, to put it lightly."

The managers are all 'buddy-buddy' with each other, and if one VP doesn't like you for some silly personal reason, they makes sure that no other VP will like you, and there there is no chance of you moving up in the company. 
Training is minimal, and pathetic when you do get it. During the interview they assume you know nothing about the line of work, but after the first day on the job you are expected to be an expert. You work long hours, sometimes you are not allowed to take a lunch. During the time I was working here, coffee breaks were done away with as well. The systems are constantly down and management blames you for it. 
Since I left my position 6 months ago, 9 employees have quit (that I know of). An entire has allegedly quit on the same day.  Management is absolutely pathetic, how they ever got the positions they have is beyond me.
