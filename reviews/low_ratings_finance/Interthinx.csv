0,Interthinx,Okay,2021-09-22,3.0,Database Engineer,"At the time, there was a good community among peers.","- Management and senior staff do have cliques and while trying to maintain company policies of civility, there is a hidden shark tank of high school passive-aggressive bullying.
- On some, pride and ego are more apparent than skill and community.
- Development environment does not reward helping. ""If you touch the ticket you're responsible"" only encourages teams and peers to be hands-off."
1,Interthinx,Great team,2018-10-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Super talented and motivated team.  Excellent relationships with customers.   Easy to stay motivated while having a great time at the office.   Leadership team is aligned and very in tune with employees.,Recent acquisition by First American may have had some impacts but otherwise the PROs still remained.
2,Interthinx,Mixed feelings...,2016-04-14,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flexibility of hours worked, production bonuses, competitive pay, good pto policy, ok benefits. Coworkers were great and about the only thing that made the environment fun.","No opportunity for advancement in our division, no job security and as a result low morale. It felt like we only heard negative feedback from management. Some dysfunctional management-attitude against improving processes or creating efficiencies suggested by employees."

4,Interthinx,Interthinx Review,2016-02-26,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great place to work. Wonderful staff, lots of helpful coworkers, great atmosphere. The location was great. Very conveniently located.","No cons, was wonderful. Communication was sometimes an issue, but it was nothing you wont find at any other company."
5,Interthinx,software engineer,2015-09-01,1.0,Software Engineer,"fast paced challenging job, easy going environment.","low paying, cheap company, too many changes in management."
6,Interthinx,Manager,2015-06-11,1.0,Manager,"Used to be a great place to work. Talented co-workers, casual work environment, great products and the technology to accomplish great things.","Purchased for its enormous data, the company began having large layoffs about 15 months ago and what was a 500 - 1000 employee company is now likely less than 200.  Promotions and raises are based on who you are ""friends"" with in upper management, not on skills or accomplishments.  
Former co-workers of upper management are especially bullet proof.  Employee morale is low."
7,Interthinx,Manager,2015-06-08,1.0,Manager,It still has some dedicated employees who are interested in leveraging the company's technological expertise to benefit the mortgage industry and prevent another meltdown.,"Management favors friends from previous jobs over talent or expertise.  In other words, if you are not part of the clique, you will not be promoted or rewarded in the same way as ""friends and family"".  You will be allowed to work long hours without recognition and contribute your skills so that others can take credit for your work."
8,Interthinx,Good Place to work,2015-05-30,4.0,,Good company to work for,"Fast paced, challenging and need to get acquainted to changes"
9,Interthinx,Hope being acquired helps,2015-05-24,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great co-workers, flexible hours, casual dress code and good benefits package (at least until FA took over),",The organization as a whole was pretty chaotic due to a lack of communication between upper management and anybody else; the IT and Product groups were very reactive instead of proactive; no room for advancement apart from management's clique of co-workers from other companies.
10,Interthinx,Client Services Analyst,2015-04-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Interthinx was a great place to work for many years.  The office and staff were always top notch.  Because it is a technology company, all the computers and office equipment were always in great shape.","Lack of growth opportunity was the biggest issue I experienced.  The culture also changed a lot over the years.  The executive staff used to make sure that the employees always felt valued and offered social and training events.   By the time left, the only employee events were down to potlucks."
11,Interthinx,Production Services Analyst,2015-04-19,4.0,Analyst,Treated as an adult most of the time.  Allowed to listen to music on headset and complete quotas.,Communication between upper management and middle management could be a little better.
12,Interthinx,No room for growth or upward mobility,2014-10-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"the office is beautiful and if you are looking to be a corporate drone, this would be the place!","Procedure is more important than insight or resolution, there is no opportunity to grow or lead in an environment that has no value for it. Overall there is a significant lack of leadership."
13,Interthinx,It was a learning experience,2014-09-27,3.0,,Free coffee and doughnuts on Friday.,Anual Bonuses are only given to some departments
14,Interthinx,Not good tech managers/management team,2014-09-24,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,Generally people are nice. Salary is good.,"Managers have no management skills. Promotion is based on if your buddies with the VP, if not forget about it. 
Salary increase is getting smaller and smaller each year. So you can stay there with no growth both career and salary.
A lot of people mostly good people left and they are not replacing them so the workload keeps on getting bigger and bigger. But instead of management thank you for taking the extra load, they gave you a bad review for taking too long to finish the job."
15,Interthinx,I would only work there is I had no other option.,2014-07-31,2.0,Underwriter/Auditor,"Pay was good and location easy to get to.  Company acquired by First American Financial, so unknown about benefits.",People were good but work environment not good.  Upper management is faceless and has not concern for subordinates.
16,Interthinx,"A great place to  work without supervision,  flexible hours,nice salary and bonus plan. company  has a great sftware",2014-07-19,4.0,Auditor,No supervision required to do your job. company allowed you and expected you to your job with minimum to no supervision.,"Lack in training A great place to  work without supervision,  flexible hours,nice salary and bonus plan. company  has a great sftware"
17,Interthinx,Good job but lacked leadership.,2014-06-04,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Interthinx trusted me to do the job I was hired to do.  I did not have someone constantly looking over my shoulder.  There were opportunities for growth and the pay was fair.,"The training provided was lacking.  For a new hire, it would appear to haphazard and unorganized.  Also, too many people were allowed to just go through the motions without being held accountable for their mistakes."
18,Interthinx,Review Appraiser,2014-04-28,1.0,,Donuts on Friday. Expert peers.,HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT! No progressive evolution of the business. Dependance on one client. Multiple layers of redundant management.
19,Interthinx,What a Mess....,2014-03-19,1.0,IT,"Beginning years were good, when we had a good team.",All the great employees left and the company didn't even bother to replace them. So business as usual without any team....good luck
