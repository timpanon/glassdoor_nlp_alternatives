3,John Thomas Financial,My experience at JTF,2016-03-30,3.0,Anonymous Employee,This is a great atmosphere if you are first starting out in the financial business and want to pursue a career as a stock broker. Office has great positive energy and hard working people.,If you need constant attention and guidance then this is not the best place for you. Hours can vary and often extended.
4,John Thomas Financial,Management doesn't listen.,2016-01-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Very competitive work environment.  High performing sales team.,Management doesn't listen to employees.
5,John Thomas Financial,Terrible,2016-01-15,1.0,,You can potentially make lots of money if you stick out months of BS,You call numbers from a script 8 hours per day. They literally don't let you sit down.
6,John Thomas Financial,Experience,2015-05-26,2.0,,Great Energy. There were a ton of really good sale executives that you could learn from. Top producers where raking in some serous cash.,Bad Management. The firm eventually had to close due to some SEC regulatory issues.
7,John Thomas Financial,investment advisor,2014-07-23,1.0,Investment Adviser,you can say you work on wall st.,"terrible place for growth, no security"

12,John Thomas Financial,"Great learning experience while there; was able to have a hand in various depts, happy to not longer be there though.",2014-01-09,3.0,Anonymous Employee,CEO good motvational speaker. He is fair and generous with bonus. High energy place. Good benefits. Brand-new office.,"Unsophisticated group of people lack refinement, boiler room type atmosphere, long hours, demanding work load."
13,John Thomas Financial,I'm sure they are out of business under this name but operating under several others,2013-10-01,1.0,Stockbroker,"Very energetic work environment, but really that's about it. You can learn a lot about the business and the hard work it takes, but then again you can learn that at much better places that won't screw you over in the end.","Too many to  list.  Bottom line this is definitely not a place you should ever work at or with either of the Belisis brothers.  George has a decent heart, or at least he used to.  But Tommy will stab you in the back the moment he feels like it for the littlest thing possible."
14,John Thomas Financial,not for everyone,2013-09-18,3.0,,learn a strong work ethic,only the wealthy accumulate the wealth
15,John Thomas Financial,Great Place!,2013-06-01,5.0,Stockbroker,"great environment, great people, a lot of energy, and if you are looking to be successful this would be the right place for you!",you will have to work 15+ and you are not allowed to sit down while your working hours
16,John Thomas Financial,Right out of the movies,2013-05-17,1.0,,"Will teach you how to be aggressive and strong in sales, which can very easily be used in multiple  careers. Great environment for someone that is looking for a ""wall street experience""","It's not the 80's and 90's anymore, times are changing and you need to change with them. Cold callers were paid 300 a week in the mid 90's, doing that now is just wrong."
17,John Thomas Financial,A good experience that's getting better,2013-02-25,4.0,,I've been with the firm for approximately 9 months and I'm making steady progress. Its a long road to success but my interviewer could not have been any more honest about what I should expect during the first year or 2 in the business. It's not easy I've had good days and bad like any other job. It's simple if you want to pursue this as a career and you are prepared to work hard and make thousands of cold calls then you will give yourself a chance of being successful. Also they got me licensed very quickly,Long hours and a lot of no's over the phone
18,John Thomas Financial,pump and dump,2013-02-15,1.0,Broker,You can create an illusion of wealth and superiority.,"Where do I begin? Well, for one, the will hire anyone who walks through the door with a suit and a pulse. Right away, you are suspicious. Does this company hold any kind of standard at all? No they don't because they cannot provide essential support that it takes to make someone into a successful broker. They just hire everyone and hope at least a few can raise some assets before the burn out.
     
     Firms like this are all too common and before you even think about becoming a broker you must realize that your chances of success are very slim. Even your chances at a real trade shop like Merrill Lynch are slim. At John Thomas Financial? HA! Slim to none. It's not the 90's anymore. Cold-calling is dead. John Thomas Financial revolves completely around cold calling retail investors and pitching stock that the firm probably holds long in some offshore account. 

     The firm tells its brokers what to push and the only ones benefiting from it are the insiders. You may able to show your clients gains at first. But in the end, you will show loses. Where are the ethics? This firm is only concerned about short term profits. You want to become the next Bear Sterns? How many investors are you willing to screw over to get there? There's too much social media these days and that press alone can ruin your reputation before you ever dream about becoming the next Bear Sterns."
19,John Thomas Financial,Definitely the best option if you are serious about making it in the business.,2013-01-21,5.0,Stockbroker Trainee,An extremely fair deal as there is no massive obligation of opening 10 to 50 accounts for a senior broker like the other interviews I went on. Instead you qualify 100 leads and then go straight into a joint book of business.with a 50/50 commission split. As a result I made commission on my very 1st account. You're required to put 20 accounts into to the joint book which is great because it meant my senior broker could guide me along the way and show me how to raise money. After this you can build your own book. They have a massive high energy trade floor with excellent research at their disposal.,Non stop cold calling although this can be expected on any trainee program at any firm. Extremely long hours which is why I had to leave as I had other obligations.
20,John Thomas Financial,Only the strong survive,2012-12-07,4.0,Account Executive,"Very nice office , everyone dressed to impress, performance is rewarded, very energetic atmosphere, u walk in to eye of the tiger booming in the morning, u are motivated to be successful, great opportunity for driven individual. Iv'e had months where I didn't take home a check and months where I took home 30K... its all about talent and work ethic.",they sometime force u into a partnership with a senior Broker  and if u don't u get no help. monthly expenses- $1200.  very Long Hours 8am-8pm.   overall if ur good at sales n willing to work long hours... u can make a lot of money.
21,John Thomas Financial,A phenomenal opportunity for the right person,2012-12-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Trained by Wall Street Experts
Work on a really nice trade floor
Fantastic research access
An opportunity to build and grow your own business","Very long hours
Not much money at first
A lot of cold calling
You have to pass the Series 7 and 63 Licenses to get on the floor"
22,John Thomas Financial,Not the best place to work,2012-11-27,1.0,Stockbroker,"You learn how sell
You get your series 7 and 63 license
You meet a lot of people that you will continue to stay in touch with over years in the financial industry","Very oppressing environment
Are not knowledgly trained enough on securities
All they care about is to sell, but don't care if it goes up or down
It's a revolving door, within one year they must keep only 1% of the people hired,"
23,John Thomas Financial,Amateur hour,2012-10-02,2.0,,"Getting hired is an easy process, involves memorizing a pitch full of typos and reciting it to an a-hole.","It's a facade of a company the projects wealth but relies on free and nearly free labor, they can't' afford pens yet cover the place in Samsung flat screens."
24,John Thomas Financial,Get your 7 & 63 then RUN,2012-07-26,2.0,,"Classroom for training for the 7 & 63...despite the $600 for books, online program very useful.","Was the only person out of 22 people to finish the class, pass the 7 & 63 (some passed and left immediately - they were smart guys looking back..) AND make it to the floor to become a broker and get the ball rolling CHASING THE DREAM. Bottom line, lasted 6 months which felt like 6 years, your $300 weekly pay gets completely cut eventually which is the straw that broke this slaving camels back. Zero pay, cold calling non non stop on your FEET in a suit from 7:30AM to 8-8:30PM and working Saturdays 10-2. Zero benefits and you need a day or time off you should expect to get axed. Not to mention the constant high chance of you getting fired for God knows what. There's greener pastures elsewhere don't even BOTHER!"
25,John Thomas Financial,Great for starters,2012-02-15,4.0,Stockbroker Trainee,Great for starters. aggressive environment,not for everyone. fast paced
26,John Thomas Financial,A boiler room.,2011-10-20,2.0,,there is opportunity to make it there if you dedicate all your time and have thick skin and alot of savings.,"Standing all day with a bunch of ego centric greedy gordon gecho's. dialng the phone to make 500+ dials. The high pressure sales tactics didnt feel ethical, nor did the practice of the firm. ""sell the stock when its high or low"""
27,John Thomas Financial,Pure sales,2011-10-13,3.0,,"Very knowledgeable analyst. Fancy office, boardroom and kitchen. Marble floor tiles and also has a bathroom attendant in the men's bathroom.",Stick to the script type of sales pitch. 100% commission based compensation for brokers. Office purposely kept at a freezing temperature.
28,John Thomas Financial,High energy environment in early stages of growth with room for advancement.,2011-05-24,4.0,,"Structured training program offers the discipline necessary to keep entry level employees on the right track to succeed in building a client-base in a relatively short period of time.  Daily access to technical analyst and economist, both of which are regulars on CNBC and/or Fox Business News provides brokers a competitive advantage when competing for new clients.  The firms committment to long-term growth will provide opportunities for existing employees to advance within the organization.","Because the firm is relatively young, it lacks name recognition.  The full-service platform is still in the process of being built out."
29,John Thomas Financial,"Superb, I want to go back and work full-time",2011-05-12,5.0,Shoe Shine Guy,"It's an aggressive environment, you really feel like you are working for super-macho Wall St Players.","The occassional insult or rude remark, but maybe thats anywhere"
