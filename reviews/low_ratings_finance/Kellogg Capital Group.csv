0,Kellogg Capital Group,Stupid,2017-10-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work Life Balance was extremely good.
Very Easy
Great benefits",Good at hiring smart people and under-utilizing them.  Stuffy British culture and very backwards technology that seems to be run on steam power.  Absolutely notorious for putting the stupidest people in the company in management.  Brits are promoted faster since they are paid less in the same band.
