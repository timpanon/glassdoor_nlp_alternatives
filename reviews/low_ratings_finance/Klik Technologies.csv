0,Klik Technologies,Extremely disorganized company with zero structure,2019-12-11,2.0,Senior Customer Service Representative,A good amount of the staff from the early days of Klik Technologies are knowledgeable in their field and helpful,The new management has no experience in lockbox and they continue to hire uneducated and inexperienced individuals who undoubtedly get lost and are unable to preform daily duties because of lack of knowledge and the old team is too overwhelmed to assist in training
1,Klik Technologies,Regret Leaving :(,2018-02-23,5.0,Lockbox Clerk,"I worked at Klik for several years and enjoyed my time there.  Management was good to the employees, the hours were great, and really close to home.  My co-workers were amazing and the teamwork was unmatched from any other company I had worked previously.  They had to close the local office in Miami Lakes as the new company, CheckAlt,  took over and moved it to south Miami.  I left due to the commute and after experiencing other jobs out there I should’ve made the drive.  I didn’t realize how good I had it.",Location- as mentioned above the commute was too far for me with young children.  I know Klik has locations across the country but not close enough for me.
2,Klik Technologies,Horrible place to work STAY AWAY,2017-07-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,None that I can think of!,"Since CheckAlt took over job moral is way down and upper management does nothing to help moral.  Low pay, benefits sucked once taken over from bank."
