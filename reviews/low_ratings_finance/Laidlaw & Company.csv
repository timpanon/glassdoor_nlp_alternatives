Frat-like office environment. They all want you to succeed but in the end everyone looks out for themselves. You're able to learn about the market and phone sales skills. Your experience really depends on the broker(s) you work with. The rest is really up to you.  A lot of junior employees didn't have the drive, left and wrote bad reviews on here. In the end this is a 110% sales job and you are a salesman. If you're not really into sales you shouldn't work here.",ALL cold calling. Very very low pay for entry level employees paired with long hours. It is very hard to get up at the crack of dawn to cold call all day every day. It didn't sit right with me. The cold callers are only fresh out of college. The office environment can get very very negative. MDs belittle and insult other employees. Sometimes act very unprofessional.
19,Laidlaw & Company,Broker,2017-04-21,3.0,Sales Associate,Company went through a large transition in 2012/2013 and is slowly moving towards being a 21st century wealth management firm by weeding out the gun slingers and driving it's small IB team. Makes sense. One pro is that if you have a good MD they'll let you grow your book in the fashion you want and won't micromanage. There are pros to this environment in the sense that you get thrown into the pit and get a good feel for sales. They also have international clients which allows one to cast out a larger net.,"Poor communication in every direction. Very fratty. Grind grind grind on the phone. No leadership, no direction."
20,Laidlaw & Company,Good people,2017-04-13,5.0,Financial Consultant,You can learn a lot from this job if you really want to. Great people working there to mentor you. Private deals seem to be improving over time. Overall I had a great time working here and gained a good amount of experience.,Somewhat laid back environment with some managers having a hands off management style. How successful & happy you are here will depend upon who you work for(mostly everyone in the 5th Ave office is good)
21,Laidlaw & Company,The positive reviews are fake,2017-03-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Remember working there and management complaining about the poor reviews and instead of trying to improve, the atmosphere, work life balance or anything, they just asked people to post fake reviews so they wouldnt look bad.
-","- Youre taken advantage of from the second you walk through the door, seen as nothing more than someone to call for the senior broker, they hope that you will leave after 1-2 years so they dont have to worry about trying to give you your own book.
- Preferential treatment is given to employees who are friends and family of management. 
- Poor culture, broker come to work in the afternoon high and or drunk.

I worked at Laidlaw & Co full time for over 3 years and was very happy there, I left to go work for a larger firm as an institutional trader. New employees almost always start out working on a trading desk for a managing director, and your sole purpose is to bring in new business. If you can prove through your work that you are competent and hard-working, you will be moved up. There seems to be a lot of former employees who have a sour taste in their mouths from working at Laidlaw, probably because they were not recognized as hard workers and made no progress. I can assure you that Laidlaw can be a great place to cultivate and maintain a career as long as you are smart & work hard.",Not a household name; although with all of the big bank scandals its not exactly a bad thing.

38,Laidlaw & Company,Willing to Contribute,2016-02-13,5.0,Financial Consultant,"Great people, great investment vehicles, environment that promotes growth & development, but must be able to do so on our own. The team that you work with can really affect your entire experience. There are really good managers & there are bad. Overall it's a solid place to begin a career, but you must be able to remain self-motivated and willing to make a contribution. It's a multi-national company with a small company vibe with less bureaucracy as the larger firms out there.","Do not take this job for the sole purpose of having a job otherwise you will be miserable. Management isn't there to hold your hand and spoon-feed you. They tell you what you need to do to move up, and the rest is on you. You move up as quickly or as slowly as you want. If your lucky you'll work on a team where the senior's will pull you to the side every so often to make sure your aware & up to date, but your production/progress is a reflection upon your work ethic."

Entry point into the industry
If you have a good relationship with your broker it will be more bearable.","Just over minimum wage pay 60+ hour work week. 
No real training guide lines. 
Do it your self mentality 
The brokers do not teach you the market you need to very motivated to thrive and not get burnt out. 
This can be considered a chop shop they want an average of 60 accounts opened for their book before you will get the chance to open accounts for your self. 
3-5 year minimum if you are ""good"" to get your own book and making 30K only with commissions only as an account opener. 
Cold calling does work but integrate more tech into the process it's 2015 and let's leave the 1960 call the phone book mentality and actually target individuals using data bases."
40,Laidlaw & Company,RUN!,2015-10-19,1.0,Associate,There are no pro's when discussing the 600-800 phone call minimums required at these revolving door shops? Regardless of whatever they call themselves. If you are that desperate ... who am I to say anything. But seriously reconsider!,"1.) $300.00 a week to get to the city!?!
2.) 7am - 8pm no lunch breaks, look at you funny to get water or go to the bathroom
3.) No leads really provided
4.) Yelling at kids isn't the way to motivate
5.) I sat next to 3 people who worked there for 5 years, and they were staying 12 hours a day and only cleared $43,000 !!! 5 years at any other ""RESPECTABLE"" firm would equate to six figures.

I have worked at several wealth management firms and can say with absolute conviction Laidlaw has the most dynamic investment vehicles and products available on Wall St. This is a team atmosphere starting from senior management down to junior brokers taking their first step in the industry. You will be given every tool available to not only establish yourself but to maintain lifelong relationships with your clients. It means alot, especially in this industry, to have the structure and support to create meaningful relationships with your clients. I would highly recommend Laidlaw not only to Financial Consultants seeking employment, but to retail investors looking for a firm on Wall st. that is first and foremost relationship driven.","The only con in my opinion is the work-life balance, which is pretty much a standard across the industry. You will have to put in the hours and be truly dedicated to your clients in order to succeed at Laidlaw."
45,Laidlaw & Company,Investment advisor,2014-10-15,5.0,,Excellent training program. Learned technical and fundamental analysis. Throughout my experience I learned risk management and how to diversify assets through different product mixes.,Difficult to say. I would have liked the opportunity to learn more about the banking side of the business. The investment banking division is a program I would have enjoyed alongside advising clients how to manage there assets.
46,Laidlaw & Company,Working at Laidlaw has been a fantastic learning experience for a young financial professional on Wall Street,2014-10-10,5.0,Financial Consultant,"Laidlaw employs an entrepreneurial attitude.  This allows for the ""go getters"" to achieve a very rewarding career.  Laidlaw has some of the best product on the street, including REITS, late stage venture capital, and private transactions which stands apart from the crowd of other investment banks.",To achieve success one must understand what type of career they are entering.  As in any sales position you must desire to have success.  You must have a very strong work ethic to achieve above average results which does mean working long hours throughout the week early in your career.
47,Laidlaw & Company,Taking this Job Changed My Life,2014-10-10,5.0,Financial Consultant,"Great environment to build a wealth management business. Had an excellent structure in place to grow and thrive in this market. As long as you are a patient and driven person, this can be a very rewarding career choice.
Clients of Laidlaw have access to an array of products not offered my many broker dealers.This really gives the firm a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Don't believe all the negativity you read about the brokerage business. If you are hungry and go the extra mile, then you can definitely succeed with this career path.","TVs could be bigger, more coffee choices. It's a great Company and I wanted to finish my career here but I had to relocate to the Midwest for personal reasons."
48,Laidlaw & Company,Internship Experience,2014-09-15,2.0,,I honestly cannot think of one aspect of the internship program I valued. I did not learn anything that helped me in my later career.,The leadership at the company was poor. Very little guidance and motivation- I simply cold called random executives I found on various social media websites.

It's a typical Wolf of Wall Street, Boiler Room kind of place that churns and burns its clients. Absolutely no thought is given towards the welfare of the clientele. You're cold-calling on the phone all day long hoping people don't slam the phone down in your ear."
50,Laidlaw & Company,It is what it is,2014-08-07,2.0,Anonymous Employee,They offer you about the same as any other b/d if your a retail broker. Payout is slightly lower.,"Laidlaw is just like any other b/d on the street but they try and act like they are different.  If your a trainee, you'll be cold calling and getting your little check every two weeks. If you have a decent book you might be alright if you can keep everyone's hands out of it."
51,Laidlaw & Company,Racist work environment,2014-08-06,1.0,,Nothing at all. They use you until your worthless to them.,Backstabbers and worst of all Racist. Will make racial comments about you behind your back.
52,Laidlaw & Company,"Company is OK, depending on which Group you work in",2014-06-03,3.0,Stockbroker Trainee,"- The group i worked in was pretty good overall: everyone got along and supported each other, senior brokers tried to help the trainees grow and develop, and my boss was great
- You get to learn about different investment products, and even private equity
-job is petty basic and straight forward, very little interference from upper management","- the hours are very long: you'll work 60 hours a week as a trainee, and then even more once you get licensed ( probably 80+)
-the job itself is very frustrating. you will spend all day trying to get people  on the phone, who will then promptly curse at and hang up on you. 
-they were kind of deceptive about this when I first interviewed with them, but this is a straight sales job. It is not wealth management. You will not be managing client accounts or portfolios, you will be making hundreds of cold calls a day, every single day."
53,Laidlaw & Company,NO room for advancement!,2014-04-28,1.0,Financial Consultant,The only positive thing I can say about Laidlaw is the work ethic I learned while working there. 12 hour days making 500+ phone calls a day PLUS coming in on Saturdays makes any other job feel like you're not doing enough. Extremely tiring and repetitive.,"There is absolutely NO room for advancement at Laidlaw. In the time I worked there (abut 6 months) not one single person was promoted. This includes an account opener who had been working for 3 years when I started there and opened over 50 accounts. His boss would string him along telling him every month that next month he would have his own book of clients. The day after I quit I found out that his boss told him he had at least another 6 months until he would be his own boss. Considering the average amount of time / amount of accounts needed to open in order to ""make it"" in the industry is significantly lower I can not recommend ANYONE to apply to Laidlaw."

56,Laidlaw & Company,Not a smart move AT ALL.,2013-11-18,1.0,Junior Broker,You learn about the financial services business (fee based vs transactional meaning commission). Build confidence speaking over the phone on a trading desk. Zero privacy. The louder you are the more management encourages it.,"Very low pay, long hours. Do not graduate college and take a job to cold call. Its is a very VERY bad decision, financially and career wise.  The Jr Broker (Global Private Client Group) job is 100% cold calling and looking for investors that buy stock over the phone. The deals brought to clients are awful. Think boiler room.. that's what you are getting into here, literally. This is not where you want to be. I left on good terms and performed well while there. I have no axe to grind. I do not want to see others make the same mistake I did. Some of the reviews are legit and this is one of them. Focus on other job opportunities, forget Laidlaw its a dead end. No joke."
57,Laidlaw & Company,Not Very Good,2013-06-10,1.0,Analyst,"Easy to get hired.
