So depressing and useless that I decided to quit the unpaid internship ASAP.",2017-06-25,1.0,Anonymous Intern,"This was in 2015, but when I was there is nothing good. All you do is google companies info and put it on excel.","Office is depressing. The upper management thinks they are top dogs (nope). workers there are just not impressive. The ""traders"" aren't really traders. When I was there everyone was just sitting down surfing the PC"
2,Lampert Capital Markets,Okay for a small shop on the street,2015-03-03,2.0,Stockbroker,Ability to have your own desk immediately. Allow you to quickly get a license including giving time off in order to study for the test.,No real training or direction on how to build a book of business. Unrealistic expectations for starting brokers and not much support for them.
