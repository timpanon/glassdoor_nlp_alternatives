1,Landmark Dividend,"Fine place to work, bad company culture",2021-11-09,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Exciting industry and growing market,They do not value the employees like they should or treat people fairly. Think boiler room
2,Landmark Dividend,A Shady CEO and a spineless CFO,2021-10-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Tough to think of any. Direct coworkers were good people.,Management kept everyone in the dark. They only rewarded their senior VPs and “yes” men. Don’t expect to be acknowledged for doing the leg work. Gave out worthless LTIPs to try to retain people. At the end of they day they were worth zero so BEWARE.
3,Landmark Dividend,STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!,2021-10-08,1.0,Regional Vice President,"NONE, NONE, NONE, NONE, NONE!","Everything they say is a lie. The executive's are not leaders, and they will steal a dollar from their own mother. This company should be gutted, since they were just taken over recently."
4,Landmark Dividend,Women stay away.,2021-07-28,1.0,Administrative Assistant,"Flexible hours and remote work is available if you are one of the favorites, but especially if you are a guy","I want to warn all women that if you ever come to work for this place, you will be overworked and under paid in comparison to your male counterparts the CEO, Tim breezy, as an absolute cheapskate when it comes to women. You will be making half of your market value here, as a salary."
5,Landmark Dividend,Buying Ground Leases,2021-07-15,2.0,Acquisitions,great benefits. many good young people to work with,commission is based on getting the best price for Landmark and not the landlord. Tough to close transactions since much is not up to you yet you are still held accountable. Competitors pay more $ than Landmark so it's very tough to get deals done.
6,Landmark Dividend,Good overall,2021-07-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Nice people and good location and space.,Lots of busy work in my position.
7,Landmark Dividend,Interesting,2021-06-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Cool company with some great employees. Great work-life balance and if you are making deals happen, management will stay off your back. Higher ups are patient and will look out for you if you put in the work","Unrealistic expectations that you should bring in a deal every other month. Over saturated market and old heads keep cards close to there chest. Don't like divulging to much information on how they have been successful. ""Old boys club"" feel. Not many POC or any women in higher up sales roles. Culture can be toxic"
8,Landmark Dividend,Good Team,2021-03-22,4.0,Vice President of Acquisitions,There is a mixed culture where you work on a team but also feel independent.,Saturated Market for sale of Cellular Assets.
9,Landmark Dividend,OK but.....,2021-03-18,3.0,V P,Free to run your job without overly managed,Never know when they will cut you loose for no reason. No annual review.
10,Landmark Dividend,Landmark rewards employees based on favoritism not deals closed,2021-03-08,1.0,Vice President,Salespeople at the bottom are all in it together,"If you aren't a ""favorite"" you won't be at the company long. Regardless of how well you perform."
11,Landmark Dividend,Clicky & Erratic Sales Environment,2020-06-15,1.0,Vice President of Acquisitions,Corporate environment is pleasant and benefits plan is decent,Sales management controls your pipeline and bonus opportunities to the point that one can loose a deal by it being assigned to another sales rep that management wants to bolster as a top performer and use as an example to everyone. Only a selected handful of sales reps have ever hit the bonus here. Sales teams are constantly being modified and broken up without support to guide the team for success.
12,Landmark Dividend,High Profit Potential REIT Job,2020-05-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Naturally Smart And Strategic people do well. Tremendous opportunity to be highly valued and create large revenue streams for the company.,You can’t sit back and expect to do well!

15,Landmark Dividend,"Who you know, not what",2020-01-14,3.0,"Vice President, Acquisitions","Working through details of contract negotiation with customers. Flexibility during the day. Knowledgeable team. Great medical, dental, etc benefits.","Everyone is out for themselves. People will steal deals right from under you and because of internal relationships, you will be forced to split a commission or lose the deal entirely. It's sales - so it will always be a ""what have you done for me lately"" environment."
16,Landmark Dividend,Innovative and Dynamic Company,2019-07-24,4.0,Sales,"I have been at Landmark for five years, and I am impressed by its entreprenurial ability to seize new opportunities, not only overseas but also by using its real estate leasing expertise in new markets. They are not afraid to take chances, and in recent years have experienced remarkable success with new ventures. I believe individual employees are empowered to try new things also.  We have fun here, from daily standup meetings to bagels on Fridays, company-paid lunches before three day holiday weekends, bowling parties, Halloween costume contests, ice cream socials and a great Holiday party at the end of the year.  Health benefits and 401K plan are very good.","Communication from senior leadership in the past was lacking, but that is changing decisively. In 2019 we have seen a big uptick in communication and a brand new company newsletter. That shows me that senior leaders are listening to employees...they want to improve our culture and make it stronger. It's working. People are noticing the positive changes."
17,Landmark Dividend,"Best, dedicated colleagues around.",2019-05-31,4.0,,"Diverse, qualified and dedicated staff.  Entrepreneurial environment; given the freedom to take on and complete projects; given the time and opportunity to learn as much as you want in the fund of funds or private equity spaces.",Things move at a breakneck pace.  It’s a deal shop so often times it’s tough to keep up with other matters while closing deals.

19,Landmark Dividend,Stay away,2019-04-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,None None None None None,Impossible to sell product don't bother
20,Landmark Dividend,Good starting salary but no potential for growth or responsibility expansion,2019-01-17,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Nice salary and benefit package,"Everything else. Management is terrible - their employment strategy is quintessential revolving door. Most hires are fired within 6 months. Daily tracked KPIs that are enforced and only met/exceeded if you chain yourself to your desk. Employment contract you sign says ""50% in office 50% out of office with clients"" which was a main reason for taking this role - that is a lie. You will not leave the office. You will not expand personal knowledge working here."
21,Landmark Dividend,Sketchy Company,2018-12-05,2.0,Vice President Acquisitions,"I was working from home, so schedule was flexible and pay was decent.","The company is run by people who have zero moral compass.  The people in charge of sales training and the sales force are basically con men who will do whatever it takes to make a sale.  Lying to customers is super common and not something I was at all comfortable being told to do.  I'm sure that there are some activities going on that wouldn't bear close scrutiny.  Not a company that offers stability to its employees.  VERY much a boys' club and if you're not part of it, you're screwed."
22,Landmark Dividend,Staff,2018-09-12,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Good work life balance. Good team environment - depends on which team you are in; my group & my director supervisor were great.,"Top level owners/leaders do not really care about anything but themselves, their needs, and their profits. Don't make them mad while you are there, but no need to feel attached once you find elsewhere better."
23,Landmark Dividend,Stay Away - Horrible Place to work esp for Minorities or Women,2018-07-31,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I suppose there was a flexible schedule at times,too many to list. horrible management form top down. the regional vp steals all the deals you work hard on - the CEO is having a constant nervous break down on conference calls - crying for minutes at a time.  i was promised a promotion and told how great i was doing esp when i was beating my boss in sales - then all of a sudden my boss fires me out of the blue after i outperformed him - fired me over the phone when i was on vacation - what a nut.
24,Landmark Dividend,Entrepreneurial Environment,2018-07-13,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Great place to work for those who want to get ahead based on merit rather than politics. Work hard and senior management will notice/reward.,"Management team focused on growth with an unclear business plan. Teams are expected to ""do more/work harder"" to achieve lofty growth goals."

26,Landmark Dividend,Territory specialist,2018-01-23,5.0,,Commission opportunities and cool team to work with.,"Low commission
Not enough training"
27,Landmark Dividend,You must be part of the In-Crowd to succceed!,2018-01-14,2.0,V P of Acquisitions,Employees that aren't part of the Boys Club or okay and seem to genuinely care about others. Lunches occasionally for free where every one gathers and get a chance to mingle.,"High turnover, favoritism. nepotism, women are exploited, etc, etc. Don't waste your time."
28,Landmark Dividend,Great Company,2018-01-02,5.0,Vice President Acquisitions,The company had a great sales team and the executive management was always available. Landmark worked hard to make sure that employees had access to senior management. In a niche business and marketplace in the lease acquisition space; they are the best!,Most sales executives work out of there home office and at times sales moral can get low.
29,Landmark Dividend,Finance and Accounting,2017-10-06,1.0,Accounting,The CEO though is not there often is a nice man who wants to get to know people - he is not closed off.,"The absolute worse place I have ever set foot. The culture is horrendous. No communication skills, everyone just speaking badly about one another behind their back. I can't explain how terrible these people are. They come to the office to express their hatred rather than work. I don't think the CEO or CFO have any idea how terrible these people are. Need an entire change."
30,Landmark Dividend,"Terrible, Terrible Terrible",2017-08-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,None unless you like little snacks,"This is one of the worst companies I have ever had the displeasure to work for.  The culture is really bad, like swimming in a shark tank.  This is led by their nutty CEO who wants to cultivate an immature ""Fratboy"" type of culture, almost as if the CEO is going through some type of mid-life crisis.  All of the negative reviews on here are 100% correct, the kind ones I am assuming are from management to prop up the rating.  

The work is nothing but cold calling an old played out lead database filled with people that absolutely hate Landmark for constantly calling them and having to say no over and over again.  The good leads from warm transfers for an immediate phone meeting, or prospect call-in, in response to an ad or mailer are given to sales reps that have been with the CEO for a long time and came with him from his previous FAILED company.  He calls it a entrepreneurial culture but fails to mention his silver-spoon and daddy money that started his career.   The turnover is extremely high, with most people lasting less than a year, so because of the intense pressure your co-workers are there ready to stab you to keep their job and get your deals.  Run don't walk from this position or you will find yourself back out looking for work"
31,Landmark Dividend,VP,2017-08-24,1.0,Vice President Sales,"Well,  coffee is free.","how many characters can I type?   All the other positive reviews..  NO WAY those were from anyone other than top mgmt.   NO, WAY.    AKA  the only guys  who make the real money.    THIS is a smile and dial operation.  60-80 dials a day.   It is nothing more than a CHURN AND BURN glorified telesales.    The turnover has to be 250%.   Especially working for the leadership they have.   
A bit of  job info:  When you pull up an account .... the list of names of AE's before you, who no longer work there, and had their turn calling  over and over the SAME LEADS..... is  long.   The entire industry is  poisoned from the thousandss of previous reps  from this company and their competitors  who used so many used car selling tactics it ruined the industry.  Potential customers  have to be motivated to sell.  YOU WILL NOT MAKE THEM CHANGE THEIR MIND.  EVER.  You may get lucky, but fact is  the sell is a joke.  Again.  the only positive reviews are from mgmt.  Don't believe me,  and make the mistake I did.  You'll be here posting like this in 3-6 months  GUARANTEED."
32,Landmark Dividend,Never a dull moment with this great team,2016-05-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people at Landmark are amazing. There's a strong entrepreneur spirit despite the tremendous growth and success the company has already experienced. It's very much a fast-paced environment as growth is top priority for this firm. With strong capital sources and a recession-proof business plan, anyone looking to challenge themselves will find this place to be a comfortable second home.","There have been a number of changes to the executive management team in 2015 and 2016. The new team is working towards managerial harmony as it pushes the rest of the company forward. This creates many opportunities, and obstacles, as Landmark seeks to become a $1B enterprise."
33,Landmark Dividend,Territory Development Specialist,2016-02-02,5.0,Territory Development Specialist,"Great hours, staff is so friendly and encouraging. Smaller company so they really care about every employee. Company is also young which allows room for change, growth and a great culture. Very strong leadership and training was amazing.",Smaller office environment. Work can be kind of repetitive.
34,Landmark Dividend,Great company!  Top notch in vision and execution!,2015-09-26,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Top leadership is good!  They know how to run a company.  They do nice things for the employees like a bowling event and nice Christmas party and monthly employee lunches.,Some of the middle management doesn't know what they are doing.  Lazy and dump the work on to their staff and do not appreciate them.
35,Landmark Dividend,VP of Acquistions,2015-08-11,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Unlimited growth and support from your superiors.  If you hustle, you get noticed and get paid.  Takes a lot of patience to learn the job. If you are not good at cold calling and asking someone to buy something they aren't selling then look elsewhere.  Set your own schedule; great work/life balance.","Cold calling was OK at first but it wears on you. If you don't have the drive or ambition to grab the phone and make tons of calls every day then this isn't for your.  However, the payoff can be good with the right call."
36,Landmark Dividend,Sales Position,2015-08-05,3.0,,Great benefits! Good working environment. Free yoga classes once a week. Beautiful offices in HQ. Ok pay.,Long hours. If you are a guy you are in!!! However if you are a girl don't expect to get the same pay rate as a guy doing the exact same thing you are doing. There is a lot of favoritism.
37,Landmark Dividend,Run!,2015-07-17,1.0,Vice President of Acquisitions,"All of the pros only apply if you are in HQ.  They give free snacks, free coffee, have events like dinners and Halloween costume contests.","Degrading management style.  If a deal goes bad, they will tell you everything they think you did wrong and make you feel 2 inches tall rather than listen and understand the facts.  They give their prime leads to those who are the good ol' boys and make those who haven't kissed up work the crap leads.  One of their executives is known to suddenly scream, curse and pound his fists on his desk out of anger.  It doesn't happen occasionally - it's a daily occurrence."
38,Landmark Dividend,Landmark Experience,2015-04-06,3.0,,It is an interesting place to work,"Too much pressure to produce on a monthly basis, transactions have a long life cycle"
39,Landmark Dividend,A Pleasant Place to Work,2015-01-26,4.0,Sales,"I think Landmark Dividend is a fun, relaxed and energetic place to work. Management frequently provides free meals for employees, we get free yoga instruction every week, bowling parties and an MVP program for employee recognition. The technology at this company is outstanding, and most of the programs and software we use were created in-house. Very impressive. Also, the HQ building is beautiful and in a great location just off the 405.","As a young and small company, not every policy and procedure is figured out at this point. A little rough around the edges, but improving."
