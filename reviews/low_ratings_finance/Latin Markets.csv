0,Latin Markets,I’ve been working at a Latin market for 1 year,2020-12-18,4.0,Cashier,"-I work afternoons
- It’s a small store so I got use to everything fast",-sometimes I have to work fill time
1,Latin Markets,What are they doing?,2016-04-25,1.0,,"Lots of young people, nice location. Some of the co-workers are very cool people. Not much is good, actually.","Everyone is miserable. Long hours, not enough breaks. Sometimes it doesn't seem like they know what they're doing. They exploit interns."
2,Latin Markets,Poor management,2016-02-29,2.0,Program Manager,"International group of employees
Possibility of traveling","Inexperienced management 
Unappreciated
Long hours, and low salary"
3,Latin Markets,They have room to grow,2015-08-03,4.0,,"The company used to have more close training and a more ""together"" approach, but with the growth, it has lost some of its personality to consistently hit metrics and have a ""big brother"" attitude. I can see that works for some, but it doesn't work for everyone. The owner of the firm believes in young talent and used to be open to advice from his staff which was a bonus. They later changed their attitude, stopped listening as much and that spoiled things.","There's occasional disrespectful chats on the sidelines, I've seen managers saying some ridiculous chauvinistic things and it's all no big deal because it is a big like a big frat house. I've seen some people work their buts off and get rewarded and others also work their buts off and remain in the same position forever. They went from valuing good quality events to exclusively valuing the money makers, so the quality dropped."
4,Latin Markets,growth at expense,2015-06-30,3.0,Anonymous Employee,rapidly growing company; great CEO and management team; access to top professionals in the AM industry,quantity over quality; creativity not valued
5,Latin Markets,Associate,2015-02-12,1.0,Associate,Diverse and good coworkers with different backgrounds,Lack of management experience and willingness to listen
6,Latin Markets,Rapidly Growing Start up with long hours and young workers,2015-02-11,3.0,Associate,"Young, fun environment.  Nice, cool office.  Growing super fast, so there's growth opportunity if you do well and work hard.","Long base hours, 8am-6pm.  Tough to be very successful, unless you speak Spanish or Portuguese.  Must be involved in the social events to really fit in."
7,Latin Markets,"WARNING, STAY AWAY!!!!!!",2015-02-03,1.0,,"You get a paycheck every 2 weeks.  Unfortunately, not much else worth mentioning.  Sad but true!","First, let me start by exposing these ""positive ratings"" and remarks as PURE LIES.  It is obvious that management is making every effort to cover up the harsh truth by making up false reviews.  Most if not all these positive reviews are all fabricated to save face and company image.   

Orginally, the thought of moving to NY and working for a company that offers to pay your working visa sounded like a great place.  However, eventually it all comes out of your salary.  

Managers are extremely juvenile, unexperienced, and need more training.  This place desperately needs better leaders.  

My day consist of meeting my metrics.  This involves harrassing local businesses via calls and emails in order to meet my required 50 daily calls just to meet my numbers. 

You are treated like children and management constantly monitors your actions.  This creates very low moral, not many happy workers.  Your time is monitored closely, hours are 8:30am to 5:30pm.  No overtime offered but its frowned upon if you do not stay late after your required hours.  

There is no HR department to assist staff with concerns and complaints.  No pension, no 401k, no effort to retain good employes.  This place should be investigated and does not appear to have a bright future."
8,Latin Markets,Avoid working here,2015-01-30,1.0,Associate,Speak with executives of financial industries involved in Latin America,"The executive team is plain rotten.
No perks.
Poor salary.
Poor working hours.
Other people aren't happy working here.
It does not feel like a fun place to be.
Other people (managers) are always watching your every move to make sure you are working."
9,Latin Markets,Great company! great people and work environment.,2014-09-19,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"It was a great experience. Great people to work with. I had the opportunity to work in great events and interact with amazing people from Latin America. I learned a lot in a short amount of time. 
Great networking opportunities and good diversity in work force","it's still a young company with room for improvement , but it has capable management team to keep growing and improving."
10,Latin Markets,A crucial place for my career success,2014-08-21,5.0,Associate,"Diverse place with people from all over the world, young and energetic, and absolutely fair if you work hard. If you learn about the asset class these events represent, the name of the company definitely stands out within the finance industry. 

This was a life changing experience for me, and it was absolutely key for my success in the private equity industry. I admire the founders, and up to date, stay in touch with them. 

Their Inc. 5000 award was well deserved!","Could spend a little more time training their sales associates, that would definitely boost sales, and therefore bonuses for everyone."
11,Latin Markets,Best group of people to work with,2014-07-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Having been with the firm from a very early stage, I have seen it grow from a successful (and very erratic) start-up to an established and well-run firm. I will soon be leaving to pursue opportunities abroad.

- The biggest pro is the people that work here. There is a large office with a very drama-free tight knit group of around 50-60 individuals of all ages and backgrounds. The atmosphere is very open-plan and open discussion and interaction is encouraged. I had made a large number of true friendships there that I look forward to continuing after my departure.
- There is a lot to appreciate about the current stage the firm is at, and I imagine will continue for the next few years: these essentially boil down to the fact that the hardest part is over in terms of establishing itself  as a lead player in the industry as well as building a reliable workforce (biggest problem by far in the company had been a selection of very poor hires that are now no longer with the firm).
- However, the firm strives to continually roll out new service and product lines, which thus far, have been very successful - so the start-up energy is still there.
- The work environment is completely different to any other conference company, in part because the product is completely different, but 'conference company' is the easiest group to classify the firm. The people are  much more educated, the work environment is pretty calm and there isn't a ""boiler room"" mentality (although there was at one point, as reflected by previous reviews, fortunately the firm grew past this).
- I would like to say travelling is a big pro, myself and many people here have traveled a huge amount. However, the firm is growing and getting bigger and I would imagine opportunity for travel will decrease over time - worth bringing up the question in the interview process.","- The biggest con is that the work is not easy (or hard, to be fair) and the work ethic is very much focused on being able to hit certain metrics. Metric-based performance is clearly pretty common fare nowadays, but it's not one that I find particularly effective for my own results - i can see that it clearly works for other people.
- This one may not be seen as too major, but is by far the most commonly heard complaint internally: the work day starts at 8am promptly. Again, you may be used to it, you may never get used to it.
- As with a lot of roles that involve heavy prospecting, you may find certain tasks very (very) repetitive, particularly at the initial stage of assigned projects."
12,Latin Markets,A place to make it happen if you're up for the challenge,2014-06-26,4.0,Producer,"Depending on what you are looking for this company can teach you an incredible amount and open a lot of doors. It’s not going to be a cush job but will give you a far greater level of responsibility, and contact with very, very intelligent and important people. It’s young and growing fast so they will throw a lot at you and expect you to figure it out and run with it. If you can keep up the knowledge you gain and contacts you make can take you a lot of places.

A significant portion of the team are interns who worked their way up. Two of my interns eventually came on full time production and sales jobs and even the head of marketing started off as an intern while she was finishing her undergrad. Within two years of starting as a part time, unpaid intern she was managing a team of 6 and responsible for all of our publications, data management systems, website and the marketing materials for over 40 events. Just an example of what can happen. As well all of management was promoted from within.

They will reward performance. I worked with them for 3.5 years and in that time saw my salary, while quite modest at first, grow by multitudes.","They will make you earn your pay. This is not a large organization where you can get hired and sneak by, pulling a salary without actually producing results. If you don’t perform they are not going to put up with it.

It is also a young, fast growing organization and as such many facets are not well established and are constantly changing, pay & benefit structures, job functions, organizational structure, etc. Some new product, position, or policy is always being developed and as such they are not always perfect when first being introduced, but they’re flexible and seem to always find their way in the end. If a high level of stability is a requirement for you, that is something to consider."
13,Latin Markets,Great place to grow,2014-06-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Opportunity to grow -. Markets Group is a firm that is growing at a tremendous rate and it offers a great opportunity to grow with the firm. I have been with the firm since the beginning and I can assure you if you work hard, it will pay off. 

Diversity - Latin Markets employs people from all over the globe. It is a great place to learn new culture and values. It is a great experience especially if you are interested in international business/economy/etc.

Good environment - The firm has a lot of young professionals which makes the environment very ""fresh"". Compared to the general market they offer a good number of vacation days and it is very flexible. They also offer summer hours (always based upon meeting our goals) and are flexible about letting you out to watch you countries World Cup match.","It is a tough job, not anyone can do it. It requires a lot of commitment and dedication. Everyone works long hours and results are expected by management."
14,Latin Markets,Worst Place to Work in America,2014-05-29,1.0,Sales Manager,No Pros. The place itself is a disgrace. It´s a business abomination in the XXI century.,"These good reviews are probably phony and written by the CEO or some sectarian manager. Isnt it funny? 
New York is the place to be for business, but there are many places around with more career projection and better salary. For many professional purposes Latin Markets is the biggest shithole ever. 
The funniest is when you move on and all your former colleagues ask for a job in your new company."
15,Latin Markets,Depressing Place To Work,2014-05-27,1.0,Sales,"Some of the events are interesting and they hire people who are looking to for a break , ie watchmen, janitors, etc..which is an empathetic move","-From my comment regarding hires getting a lucky break they also pin them down and make them slaves. You will work at a minimum 10 hours a day and will get bullied into staying longer. Alot of these people dont complain but they break inside. 
- Working long hours is not a bad thing however in a toxic environment and treated like a slave those hours can be painfully long. Also when you have little entrepreneurial flexibility in sales that just makes the job that much harder and less rewarding. 
- The business is not well respected. You will get hung up on more times than not mentioning the company's name. Executives in some of the companies they pitch send very mean and ""Take me off your list"" letters back to you. One is forced to sell something at a very low rate here as people will,not pay top dollar for services at this firm 
- There was a comment made here by someone on the juvenile environment. It is bang on. They are kids working here or older staff that got laid off in other jobs
- i do think that alot of the positive thats written here is from the company employees. Maybe they got bullied into that one too!
-The Internet does not work half the time in this office"
16,Latin Markets,Long Term - NO WAY!,2014-05-22,1.0,Ticket Sales,I really can not find one apart from the fact that focusing on Latin America is a good idea from a business perspective.,"-There is no team work here, no passion for the product but a place where people may work for a few months to see what a start-up gone wrong looks like and learn from it. 
- They sell sponsorships for virtually nothing so alot of the sponsors on their website reflects a smoke-filled mirror to the public 
- Employees have been bullied, ridiculed and have been the victims of racism, as it is still a very young teen-environment
- The financial market in general do not take them seriously. They are miles away the more credible firms, ie Institutional Investor, Terrapin, etc"
17,Latin Markets,"Fast Growth, Hard Work, Global Reach - A Diverse Place to Grow and to Learn",2014-05-20,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"A great place for creative entrepreneurial types with a passion for learning - it's a diverse community with the feel of a start up, fantastic opportunities for travel, competitive salaries, merit-based advancement and a great deal of creative discretion over your own projects in a young,  teamwork-driven work environment. 

The opportunities to learn are astounding - day to day work here involves learning about new industries, new companies and maintaining close contact with leaders of the global financial and infrastructure development industries, along with heads of state and policymakers.","Clearly the pace of growth here has led to some odd hiring choices - see peculiar reviews below - and some turnover can be expected for a company growing as quickly as LM.  hardly a con, but in order to be effective and happy here you must be a clear and decisive communicator with a knack for teamwork and an interest in working hard.  otherwise it won't be a fit."
18,Latin Markets,Hard work will pay off here,2014-05-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Latin Markets is a meritocracy and results are rewarded with opportunities. People move up and the pay is above industry standard. 

I have  had the opportunity to learn - strong sales skills, a developed knowledge of the Latam investments industry and traveled the region extensively 

Seeing the company continue to grow into different areas has been a pleasure - our product is the best in the market

At this point the team and culture are stronger than they ever have been and most of the employees who brought negativity and little results have left","It's not for everyone - and it's a tough sales job - if you aren't willing to put in the hours and get on the phone you won't like it

The values at LM are not for everybody"
19,Latin Markets,Latin Markets - What You Should Know Before You Apply/Interview,2014-05-16,4.0,Associate,"This company works hard at organizing conferences and has a proven track record at excelling in a niche field saturated with competitors. Nearly all of the company's management positions are internal hires, meaning that if you work hard (and get results), you get recognized. 

I'm not saying this is the best job in the world -putting on these events is a tough job, no one at the company works long hours because they want to, they do it because they feel compelled to meet a standard of quality. You want to work 40 hours a week in New York City? It's not that Latin Markets is the wrong place for you, you're simply in the wrong city. 

Latin Markets won't be your dream job, but it's a job that will set high standards and push you to meet them. You'll develop a sales, interpersonal, and cross-cultural skill-set that would take years to access in a more hierarchical environment. There's a startup-like discipline to working there -and if you don't believe in the product you're promoting, it will be impossible for the management and your co-workers to believe in you.","It really shouldn't surprise any serious candidate that the negative reviews on this site are riddled with misspellings and come off as mildly elitist (my hotel wasn't nice enough! you're better off working at fast food! what do you mean my BA in Poli-Sci and 2 years of professional experience won't get me a six-figure salary?!). My personal favorite is the individual who misspells the word ""zero."" Listen, if you're complaining that you have to work late hours and aren't being flown around Business Class during your first year on an entry-level job, you should take a long, hard look at how your professional expectations line up to reality. 

I left the company after eight months; organizing events simply isn't for me. The company has changed a lot since I left, but I notice that the people who put the work in while I was there have all stayed and are making significantly more than the (very) modest starting salary we all signed on with. 

It's alarming when any company has a high turnover, but what do you expect from a company that has grown as fast as Latin Markets? A fast expansion is bound to bring hiring mistakes anywhere. Want to take a serious look at this company? Ask whoever you're interviewing with how long they've worked there, and what their title was when they joined. Chances are they worked up to their current position within two years from starting in the same role they're interviewing you for."
