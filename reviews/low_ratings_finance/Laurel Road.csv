7,Laurel Road,Growing Company with Interesting Opportunities,2019-03-02,5.0,Engineer,A focus on using technology to solve financial services challenges makes every day different than the next. Management believes in investing in technology and will spend the right kind of money to solve market challenges.,Too many opportunities to grow means that good ideas can get reprioritized over others.
8,Laurel Road,Bad Management Team and Abysmal CEO/Chairman,2019-02-23,1.0,Senior Management,"Above-average younger talent, particularly in engineering, and many other junior individuals are very hungry, good-natured, and really want to see the platform succeed.  Some good (now former) potential due to partnerships with top medical associations.","Sadly, I have to agree with a lot of the former reviews posted on here - this place had potential, but was quickly run into the ground out of greed and poor execution from senior management.  With 20+ years in financial services I can safely say that this C-Suite is the worst I have come across.  Going down the list:
CEO/Chairman - In 20+ years in financial services he may be not only the worst operator, but the worst person I have encountered - dishonest, greedy, sadistic, inarticulate, and worst of all, a coward. He's a 0 and should be kicked out the door without a dime. 
CFO - Intransigent, overconfident, tethered to the CEO for fear of his own employment, dishonest, and probably the one employee that caused the most value destruction at the firm.  Led the bank to a record loss in 2018 (see public call reports on Laurel Road Bank ) despite the efforts of engineering/product and a few other teams.   Why he isn't fired and barred from ever working finance again is shocking to me.
COO - Untalented, former back-office large company employee with a Stalinist approach to managing staff.  Along with the CFO, he's just as much to blame for the failure of the operating company
CMO - The antithesis of a collaborator, out to sell herself and her personal brand at the expense of others, bad executor, not particularly intelligent."
9,Laurel Road,Work here at your own risk,2019-01-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Health benefits - The company pays all premiums which can be expensive for families.  A very nice benefit with a hefty dollar value attached.

People - The rank and file here are, for the most part, pretty smart and nice people.  Never had an issue with 95% of them.","Management - The company is run on a culture of fear and intimidation.  Don't bother trying to do ""the right thing"" because you will be fired because of it.  The management will NOT support you, will NOT inspire you, will NOT care about you.  You are on your own here.  You will NOT receive direction on what is expected of you.  The senior management is dominated by a single person with rage issues so bad that HR has had to talk with him about it.  People who have succeeded at this company have been the ones who've kissed up to him the best, regardless of their actual ability to do their job objectives.  If you get on his good side he will protect you from all wrong-doing.  If not, goodbye charlie.

Longevity - When I was hired I was told that the company was trying to find a way to capitalize on their product and service and that I shouldn't expect to be employed for more than three years.  They are trying to sell themselves and it's expected that current employees won't be employed when they do.  Management, naturally, will make out just fine.

Turnover - Senior managers have been turning over at an alarming rate.  Hiring a senior manager who stays for 4-6 months has been the norm."
