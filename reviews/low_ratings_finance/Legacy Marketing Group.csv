3,Legacy Marketing Group,good entry level to move into something else,2014-02-03,1.0,Team Leader/Corporate Trainer,"100% commission. you will get some pretty good skills if you do well. if you do well, you will average about $550/week. you will net about $350/week (after taxes). THis money will probably used all towards your gas, that they don't reimburse you for at all.","you work monday - saturday. monday through friday is 11-8pm, saturday is from 10-4pm. If they tell you otherwise, they are LYING. out of every 10 people who come into the door, about 1 person will make it into corporate trainer. When you get to corporate trainer, you need to recruit every single day to build a team to get to management, all the while, getting quota to make money, keep in mind, this is door to door sales from 11-8pm. it's 100% commission - it's a ""you hunt what you eat"". you have to drive everywhere with your own car, they make you pay for your own gas, no miles reimbursement, and they will say anything positive to you to help you believe what they believe. of the people who HAVE gotten to management, a lot of them failed as business owners, so the support isn't there even when people get to the ""management level."" THe owner - Nick - can be very immature and unfair also so watch out. This is a pyramid scheme at its best and you will notice it the minute you walk in. They will convince you it's not a pyramid scheme saying something like .. "" all companies are a pyramid."""

You don't ""set up appointments with mom and pop shops"", you literally go knocking on doors of private households for 8 hours a day.  Oh, and don't be fooled by the suits, they change into their verizon shirts on the streets of New Brunswick before heading out into the field. If you went to college, do not apply.  It's not worth your time."
