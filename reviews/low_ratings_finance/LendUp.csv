3,LendUp,Run,2021-06-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The mission, and some of the team.","-The CEO has a grudge against people who worked at the first version of the company and takes it out on everyone who works at the second version of the company.  Instead of taking responsibility as a company for past mistakes they throw the founders under the bus which makes for bad morale.

-The Customer Service team was expected to be seen and not heard. While the rest of the company was encouraged to ask questions during all hands, the CS team was told to run questions past their direct managers first. This most likely to the CS team asking hard questions the CEO and COO didn’t want to answer.

-CS team was a very close group, CEO and COO didn’t like that and tried to punish CS for it.

-The HR team has the highest turn over in the company

-The CEO doesn’t seem to care at all about the company only their ego. Any meeting or diversity celebration they turn the conversation to be about themselves. Not something you want to see from a leader of your company.

-The company is not transparent at all, they don’t mention when people are hired, re hired or leave. They act like it’s a huge secret which is weird and again is horrible for morale."

- not anyone's fault, but the building has had major issues since I have started everything form heating and cooling, plumbing, elevator. There are days when it is way too cold in the office it's hard to put in the best work
- LU hit on a few nice cultural events like Chinese New  Year and Holi, but totally missed the boat on Black History month. Not even a single mention or email was sent out to recognize this which was a bit strange 
- LU seems to keep priding itself on diversity and inclusion and empowering women, but it just seems a bit pandering on delivery coming from People Operations. Posting our pics on the big screen and on Linkedin daily are a bit over the top 
- A product that may not do so well with a recession, soon to be a depression. Customers will not pay back
- Faulty customer tool that breaks every other day

There are a lot of fun and optional group activities outside of work. The company is very efficient with their use of technology to communicate. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the financial world.,The upper management has a tendency to push the training on long-standing employees who are not paid as a manager when they should be.

29,LendUp,Sad,2018-10-20,2.0,Account Manager,"The people.  in my nearly 2 years at Lendup I met the most amazing, genuine, and smart people I have ever encountered in my life and truly all my best friends are people that I met during my time at Lendup.  
For an early career job, the benefits are good, lunches were cool, more so in idea than practice, and things like offsite's made it feel like a startup.","Have been wanting to write this for a long time and really didn't even want to invest another minute of emotion or time into this company, but after recent events, feel its necessary to share, so i'll keep it as short as possible:

Embarrassing low pay-like fastfood worker low.  This was brought up as an area of concern for employees so many times, and the literal answer one time was ""lower your expectations""

No growth- the classic ""you're good, now do more, with no extra pay, appreciation, or chance of promotion""

Inconsistent- had 3 managers in less than 2 years, and metrics changed constantly, yet everyone was  told they weren't doing enough, only minutes after the manager said ""these metrics are new, we aren't even really sure what we are measuring"" , but somehow, you still aren't meeting expectations.  Really any excuse not to give you the small bonus that comes with a good review.

Favoritism- the loudest yes men in the room got promotions over the hardworking, diligent, smart, and capable one's.  At times you would think you were in an episode of the twilight zone, wondering how management could be so blind.  Ironic thing is, all those people either quit shortly after, or were recently laid off.  And the ones that awarded the promotions quit after 6 months or were laid off too.  And when i say promotion, I mean an extra $1.50 an hour.

Technology here is so broken that it regularly created compliance issues, and droves of angry customers,who honestly had every right to be angry and perceive  lendup as no different than any shady payday lender.  This made the mission null, and not tangible in any way, gave you no sense of accomplishment or joy doing the work.

To top it all off, as I was leaving Lendup, I was accused by upper management of attempting to 'poach' simply because I was ecstatic about a new job opportunity I was pursuing, one with a livable wage.
I'll make it as simple as possible- the extortion of cheap labor from desperate college graduates under the guise of 'opportunity' is what is driving people away, not the loyal and hardworking employees that had the foresight to get off a sinking ship for a better opportunity.  Oh, and yeah the layoffs, that's really whats driving people away.

Sad thing is, now there are going to be about 20 people looking for work, who probably couldn't save much at $15 an hour, but those that mismanaged this whole debacle have the job security, and i'm sure will be getting raises soon.

Overall, job poorly done, and its now showing to people outside of the company.  Sad to see things take such a sharp downward turn, but honestly can't say i'm surprised."
30,LendUp,A radical change is needed,2018-10-19,2.0,Account Coordinator,"Catered lunch 3 times a week. The food is very hit or miss, there is either not enough food for everyone because the early lunch employees eat everything or there’s too much food and we all take some home. 
No cost healthcare including dental, vision and medical. No premiums, FSA plan, great coverage for in network. 
Very casual dress code, the VP wears shorts and flip flops all summer. I consistently wear leggings too work.","Management, there are few good managers but the majority write us off as fresh college graduates who know nothing. We aren’t treated well or care for - obvious from the recent lay offs. 
Salary isn’t even livable. I have a second job and I’m still struggling to make all my bills. Some people get bonuses and commission but it’s still not enough. 

At the end of the day it’s a call center, it will always be one."

Amazing HR Rep

-Be prepared for this. It's gonna happen, but don't take it personally.

Lay-offs 
- Really messed up here. 5 weeks prior we were told that cut backs would be made, but we didn't have to worry about people losing their jobs and that it wouldn't come out of nowhere. It came out of nowhere. Not cool.

Low Pay
- This is to be expected. It is a startup, but eliminating Catered lunches would afford people raises. It's always less expensive to prepare your food at home vs. having it ordered and delivered. It was also stated within the past year that, compensation would be evaluated and improved. The improvement was expanding the job position ladder and shuffling around pay, but not much here really happened. If you want to keep your talent, you will eventually have to pay for it. Do not expect to get rich working here. Take the job for the experience, fellowship, and positive mission.

Actions the are contrary to the company's mission and values.
- While partnering with a company like Walmart does financially benefit LendUp, it is important to remember, that as a company, Walmart is completely contrary to what LendUp stands for. Many people who work for Walmart are on government assistance because the company refuses to pay them a living wage and decent benefits. The result is a workforce that is forever reliant on Walmart's low prices. Partnering with them, does not say much for the integrity of the mission."

I'm also extremely impressed with the relationships people build here. I talk to someone new at every single friday happy hour, and people actually take the time to sit together and have lunch in the kitchen.

45,LendUp,All the trappings of a great startup but falls short in execution,2017-11-03,2.0,Account Manager,Most talented coworkers I’ve had the pleasure of working with. Great catered lunches and fun quarterly engagement activities. Nice physical space.,"LendUp looks like an exemplary employer however there is a clear and unmistakable difference between CI associates and the rest of the company. This deep distinction should be regarded with caution as you prepare to enter as a serf, ""Rva applicant beware.""

 The company reactive on many levels and passive to known issues regarding promotions, wages and meaningful employee recognition. Action evades the current operation. Lack of action communicates true intentions and priorities. company wide attrition is palpable but regarded as an industry norm.

Ambition and pushing past limits by working on the edge of what's possible, is discouraged in CI or exploited depending on your role. This is omni evident in the disjointed bi costal office cultures and lack of free flowing institutional wisdom. value is solely placed on the information flow from SF to RVA although RVA is the face of the company to the customer and the voice of the customer to the company. The cast system is most distinguished and notable in the low and uncompetitive compensation package as you will be allured by organizational potential. The potential is real however the equation is unbalanced in the short and mid term. 

Compensation is ""benchmarked"" however not based on technical job title and education nor experience but base upon core job function, which is covert to applicants when accepting the role. This is a call center! You will barely have an opportunity to go to the bathroom and some days you won't. When you do you will feel guilty.

CI vs all other operations in SF is modeled after the serfs and the lords. If you are in CI your are built into the lowest cast system. There is minimal regard for customer facing roles despite what may be communicated actions reveal the truth . You are merely a customer service representative no matter what key attributes or skills you walk in the door with. 

There is a disproportionate lack of focus on personal  and professional growth in RVA with a false weight on the importance of customer insights, given in title, but gravely dismissed in practice. 

The customer facing inequity is evident in advancement opportunities, development opportunities, compensation and significantly unbalanced operational exposure.

 Advancement is illusive and transparency is reduced to a buzz word which is tossed around but falls significantly short. Information is only shared on a need to know basis everything else is classified.  The company is slowly attempting to bridge the chasm but intentionally ignoring the key factors and details of what the embedded gap is."

They often promote workers without raises (discussed and confirmed by multiple people), workers openly joke about parents helping them out financially because of the pay... Great company, but you can't expect to keep qualified people there at the current rate. As a previous comment said, perks like chair massages and eatclub will not pay rent. Get that figured out and people won't look elsewhere."
52,LendUp,"[Updated after 1 year] Still a ""Mission-driven startup with brilliant people""",2017-01-16,5.0,Engineering,"Given my last review was voted ""most helpful"", I wanted to update it after ~1 year at the company for both insiders and potential candidates to get a more transparent look at what's changed since we are a company that is going through rapid change.

1) Still engineering/data driven. This means we focus on building and investing in technology first. There is a reason why we are scaling orders of magnitudes better than big banks! Had a recent hackathon for the first time and talented folks across departments built some really things - servicing tool written in purescript, real-time chat bot, static analysis tools, etc.

2) Our social mission is very clearly the top priority and last say in decision-making. It is really easy to see the passion some of my coworkers have for making a difference in our customers' financial lives. It is personally incredibly rewarding to be working for a company that is making such a huge difference. In 2016, we saved customers an estimated $18.3m dollars (this study is available on our blog) and raised their credit scores by a significant amount. We can't save our customers that much without our business is doing well- we are able to undercut and provide better services than existing lenders, and we choose to do so

3) Transparency- It's clear to me that the executive team and management places a big emphasis on gathering feedback and listening to employees concerns. If you read some our more recent reviews, you may be concerned but Sasha and Jake have addressed and discussed every single one multiple times (will elaborate on this more in the con section)

4) Comp/benefits are getting bumped up as we get more funding! We are more at the median level now but to be more competitive hiring, we should be in the top quartile.

5) Unlimited vacation - people are skeptical of this but it's real and people take advantage of it! Most people I see take the equivalent of a week off per quarter.

6) Diversity and inclusion. The people here really care about diversity and inclusion because they are central to our mission - we are trying to bring in a (huge) group of people that is currently excluded by our financial system. This has led to redefining our company values, renaming all conference rooms after influential women/POC, formation of a Black Lives Matter book club, and employee-initiated volunteering.

7) There has been recent bad press from the CFPB ruling but if you read what the violations actually were, it is amazing we have so few and minor mistakes in such a heavily regulated and scrutinized industry (most of the violations were failure to display certain text disclosures back when LendUp was super young). Heck, even TransUnion and Equifax got slapped with a fine recently and their compliance/legal departments are probably bigger than our whole company. This is no excuse but I can say with integrity that we've never made a product decision that hurts the customer.","Focus on eng/data means other departments often get overlooked or left behind. This is a general problem in tech, not just at LendUp. Specifically, most of the recent negative reviews have been from folks leaving from our Customer Insights/Account Servicing department. This is incredibly unfortunate- as someone who has worked closely with many of them on a day to day basis I know how valuable their product expertise is. From talking to some insiders, the gist of what happened is we hired an incredibly bright, excited (and overqualified) team at low pay in exchange for career opportunity. The day to day job is mostly account servicing and handling customer calls and through this you get valuable exposure to our users and the product. I've seen many of our CI agents get promoted and moved around into different teams with paths to become data analysts or work in product. There is a LOT of career growth opportunity here but not everyone gets this same opportunity because at the end of the day we still need folks to answer calls and there are a limited number of internal positions open. The result has been high turnover on this team and a decision to outsource most of our servicing to Richmond, VA where it is much cheaper to hire.

I still believe the future is bright for the company but it's unfortunate we lost some good people from CI (most left before a year) who left disgruntled and bitter at management."
53,LendUp,"""Account Manager""",2017-01-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Some great people trying help financially underserved.,"I've debated about sharing my experience with LendUp, but since I see they're still branding their call center/customer service role as an ""Account Manager,"" I've decided to write. 

I was grossly mis-sold the role of ""Account Manager"" when I interviewed to join the ""Customer Insights"" team at LendUp. The role was presented as though I was being hired to help build out a Client Relationship Management System, to catch bugs, and provide feedback to UX and product. However, shortly after on-boarding, I realized that I'd been tricked into working in a call center where I was judged on how many calls/emails I could get through in a day, and that my metrics were purely measured on how my ""numbers"" compared to my peers (all broadcast in real time on large flat screens!) 

Looking back, I don't know why I was hired in the first place.  I wasn't a fit for the role, but I gave it my best and hoped that I'd be able to better apply my skills elsewhere in the company at some point. However, I didn't play the ""game"" as the team's leadership would have liked, and I eventually stopped kidding myself that anything would ever change in the toxic environment in which I'd found myself. 

Leaving LendUp was one of the best decisions I've ever made for myself. I'm thankful for the experience because it gave me insight on what I want in a role, a team, and a manager. It also taught me how to ask the right questions so I wouldn't end up in a dead-end , mis-sold position again. 

In conclusion, I'd like to give you who may be considering applying for the Account Manager role a hi-level overview of what your day will entail:

-Have as many phone/emails interactions with LendUp's subprime short-term loan customers as you can. You’ll largely be assisting frustrated people with moving their due dates, resetting their passwords, and taking payments. You know when you call your bank or credit card company? Yeah, that. 

-Attend weekly performance reviews with your team-lead to  review the aforementioned calls and emails you made/wrote since you last met.

Takeaway:

If you can check your brain at the door and turn into a robot between the hours of 8-6, YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR CALLING! Just don't let yourself be fooled that you're getting your foot in the door of a tech company with room for advancement. You'll be low on the totem pole, you'll feel like you don't have a voice, you'll get burned out, and you'll leave. At least if you're smart. And guess what? No one will care because there will always be someone to replace you!"
54,LendUp,Account Manager,2017-01-16,2.0,Account Manager,"LendUp Account Management was certainly a learning process. I learned a lot about what I do like and don't like in a job and in management. I have been thoroughly impressed by the employees who care about the mission and truly want to help sub-prime borrowers. There was an intelligent, awesome group of people on the Customer Insights team that made coming to work enjoyable--I made some lifelong friends. LendUp does an inexplicably good job at hiring very smart, over-qualified people. In-office happy hours on Fridays also garnered a sense of camaraderie. Great office location.","LendUp did a great job of cultivating a good, fun, healthy, etc. culture when we were small (<110), but as the company grew, culture did not pivot well. This was especially true on the ""Customer Insights"" team when they tricked us into becoming a call center. Expectations were not set (although claimed they were later down the road). I felt like a hamster on the wheel or a horse with the carrot on a stick that is unattainable. I was definitely willing to work hard for that next step on the ladder, as were most of my peers. It was clear they were incentivizing people to make the calls needed by promising promotions/to move you to a different team but would never actually promote/move people out of the team because they needed people in their call center. ""Management"" (I use the term to mean the disparaging few, not all) would constantly pick at you at make you feel worthless if you couldn't keep up with the expected call numbers every single hour of the day (why did Person X make 110 calls today; he usually makes 150). At times, I felt it was a toxic working environment--from the micromanagement to the asinine gossip to making one feel guilty to stay at home when truly sick, etc. My intelligence as well as my peers' was not put to best use. Furthermore, in terms of management, it also seemed ridiculous and a complete waste of very capable people who should be doing other things than counting the number of calls I and my peers make every minute of the day."

It's for a good cause, but the day-to-day can be rough."
57,LendUp,Profound Learning Experience,2016-12-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,I worked alongside some really incredible teammates!,"My experience on the Customer Insights team at LendUp was a profound learning experience in a way that was much different than what I had originally anticipated.

While the Account Manager opportunity was originally NOT marketed at all as a customer service role, I quickly learned that this is indeed what the role encompassed. 

Aside from an incorrectly marketed role, the Customer Insights leadership team displayed a method of ""leadership"" that relied on belittling and demeaning team members. From being reduced to a number on a dashboard to being chided for requesting sick days (in the face of serious illnesses) to being misled about the nature of the opportunity to leaders who seemed to have no regard for the team's well-being or professional development, my experience on the Customer Insights team provided me with more ""insights"" that I had originally intended to collect - insights into how leaders should NOT act (a great learning experience in itself). 

I had accepted my role at LendUp as someone who was determined to make a real impact - someone who was interested in understanding the way in which this ""for profit, mission driven"" concept actually played out. Instead, I walked away feeling extremely disillusioned with both the model as well as the people behind this model. 

My LendUp experience was a negative one due to the misaligned value systems, but placing that aside, the maltreatment of employees is something that transcends my particular value system. I wish all the best to LendUp, but at the same time, I do not want to sit silently about the way both my co-workers and I were treated throughout the process."

The team here is phenomenal. What makes it so unique is really the focus on doing good for the customer that you see in every employee.  Because of that you see end to end product decisions that factor in the customer's best interests and leaves them in a position of better credit understanding and financial health. 

One thing that stands out to me is the focus on growth in key areas. The entire company aligns against 3 key goals and this keeps us moving forward positively.","We're growing rapidly and with that comes workload challenges and technical debt.

Also, free lunch, free happy hour every Friday, great benefits (100% health care, unlimited vacation) - great place that I'm proud to work at","Still early stage and there is a lot to get done, so hours can be long if you're used to big companies, but the work is very rewarding and also no one is asking you to stay late, just to get the job done."
88,LendUp,An awesome start-up company,2015-06-22,4.0,Controller,"Working for this company has been an awesome experience. The team is great and super smart. It's always ""all hands on deck"". The mission is one of the reasons I decided to work here. We are truly focused on helping people and providing our customers with the best experience possible. We also have a ton of fun and everyone genuinely likes each other.","As with most start-ups, work/life balance is challenging but it's not impossible."
89,LendUp,"Good social mission, but not a charity",2015-06-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"""The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads... That sucks."" 
– Jeff Hammerbacher

It's nice to work for a company that makes money without actively making the world a worse place.","Just moved offices, so the place is a little disorganized at the moment. But that's startup life for ya. It's the little things."
90,LendUp,Lots of room for growth,2015-06-22,5.0,,There is a lot of room for professional development here.,There is a lot of work to be done and this is not your basic 9-5.
91,LendUp,It doesn't even feel like work,2015-06-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Unbelievably smart and driven coworkers. A truly mission driven organization looking to make a difference in people's lives. Opportunity to work on interesting, impactful projects and shape the future of the company.","Growing quickly sometimes means things fall through the cracks or aren't correctly communicated to everyone who needs to know - certainly never intentional, but a side effect of being a fast growing startup. Sometimes hard to achieve work/life balance."
92,LendUp,Tech Company Innovating for the Greater Good,2015-06-22,5.0,,LendUp brings technological innovation to an industry that desperately needs it. The company's socially responsible mission to help customers build their credit is honest and easy for employees to get behind. The fast-paced work environment has been refreshing and I enjoy the constant challenges we face while introducing a new product into the online lending industry.,"Since the company is growing so quickly, expectations of employees are very high. You will be surrounded by extremely hard-working people who care about the product. This is not a bad thing unless you are not prepared to work for a company like this, so keep this in mind if applying to work here."
93,LendUp,Mission Driven and Means It,2015-06-22,5.0,Office and Facilities Manager,"I am Office/Facilities Manager of both our SF and our Lafayette offices.

The SF office is gorgeous, the team is super sharp and really cares about the mission of the company - helping folks in need of a loan, helping people rebuild their credit, and educating folks on personal finance.  It's inspiring to work with a team who isn't just out to ""disrupt"" a market and make a ton of cash in the startup world of SF - though I have no doubts we're doing just that.  The C levels also really DO trust their subordinates, and allow us to take ownership of our projects and positions.

Our Lafayette office is full of some of the most warm, welcoming people I've ever had the pleasure of working with.  They truly embody the ""attitude of gratitude"" so often missing in start up culture, and it makes me proud to know they are LendUp's direct representatives to our customers.

As a company - benefits are fantastic, both medical/dental/vision and super generous PTO.  We have lunch provided every day at both offices, as well as a stocked kitchen of snacks, happy hour every Friday, volunteer events where LendUp employees are able to give back to the community, and regular team building events and outings.","I truly cannot think of an actual con to LendUp.  It IS a start up - so there's naturally a lot of hard work / high productivity expected, but I purposely seek that out as I tend to get bored easily.  Not the job for someone who wants a place to just ""clock in and clock out."""
94,LendUp,Great mission with the tech to back it up,2015-06-21,5.0,Data Scientist,"The #1 reason to work at LendUp is the commitment to socially responsible lending. The software engineering is solid, and there's some truly innovative ML going on. LendUp could be the first profitable financial company with a conscience. It's also great to have career tracks for technical roles that don't involve moving into management.","Working at a startup is a double-edged sword. You get more done and move faster than at big companies, but unless you're personally invested in the mission or are willing to play the long game for equity payouts - the effort level and hours required could be rough."
95,LendUp,Awesome company that is disrupting the lending industry,2015-05-15,5.0,,"The company takes great care of the employees, and makes a strong effort to establish an awesome work culture. Management does an excellent job of developing all of the employees, and is constantly helping with vertical career growth within the company. There is a high value placed on transparency within the decision making process. Excellent benefits, catered lunches, and fun team events.",Can be extremely fast-paced at times. The ability to multitask is a must when working for this company.  Must be able to identify and resolve issues quickly and effectively.
96,LendUp,Opportunities Abound,2015-05-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This is a great place to work if you want to get in early at a transformative company. Positions ramp extremely fast. It is rewarding to clearly see the impact of the work we are doing. Team culture is a huge pro - it's an easygoing environment despite the fact that everyone is at full sprint all the time.  The mission is easy to get behind and definitely motivating. Management is very, very competent and has a clear view for the future of the company and how to get there.",Things are moving very quickly and it is easy to spread yourself thin across multiple responsibilities. This is not the place for complacency.
97,LendUp,Mission-driven and changing an industry,2015-05-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Everyone at the company is making an impact at this stage. We set ambitious goals, move fast, measure our results and then iterate and improve, all while putting the customer first. The team also gets along really well and we have plenty of opportunities to hang out like during our daily catered lunches and Friday happy hours, not to mention quarterly team-building events.","Not for people who want to slack off. And not necessarily a con, but there are a lot of elements to balance because the product is very complex. But I think it keeps things challenging and interesting."
98,LendUp,"Great team, fast moving company with an awesome mission!",2015-02-22,5.0,Account Manager,"Based on my experience, everybody @ LendUp plays a vital role and contributes 110%. If you're coming from a financial services background like myself, no more suits! To me, this was very important. Dress casually, put in the work, enjoy the free lunches, and get ready to be inspired by our company's mission! Oh yea, no egos and no bozos.That's not tolerated here.",You really do not know what working in a fast pace environment is like until you work here. Are you ready for the challenge?
99,LendUp,Innovative in technology and finance with a socially driven mission!,2015-02-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working at LendUp is an awesome experience! There are so many talented individuals that offer an array of experience and knowledge on various topics. The company mixes the best aspects of the technology and financial sectors and the leaderships makes sure that every employee is equipped with the right tools to perform at their best. Work-life balance follows the standard that you would find at other startups and benefits are well rewarded (free lunch, happy hours, etc.). Most of all, there is an expectation for both personal and professional growth within the company, that you wouldn't necessarily find within larger, more corporate structures. Overall, LendUp is a great place to be!","As with most startups, growth is a constant driver of the day to day life. If you enjoy an easy pace, larger, structured environment, LendUp isn't for you."
