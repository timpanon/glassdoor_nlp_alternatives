1,Leverate,Used to be a great place to work at,2022-01-24,2.0,Customer Success Manager,"Good company events, good atmosphere
Lower management is friendly and easy to work with","Upper management is unstable- many many waves of firing people and then re-hiring over and over. No appreciation for people's lives.
Non-competitive compensation- much lower than the market average.
Client base is ""unpleasant""- basically thieves and scammers looking to make a quick $ using Leverate's technology. Many of my former clients were in prison.
Very rigid when it comes to remote working. One day a week."

12,Leverate,Horrible backstabbing culture,2021-03-02,1.0,Business Development Manager,Good place to start if you are new to the industry and market.,Horrible backstabbing culture where FEAR is pervasive. The vast opportunity to improve and learn is hindered by the system implemented. You don't get what you are promised from when you signed up and join them. Employees are becoming more aware of how bad the situation is at Levirate and are leaving at an astonishing high rate.
13,Leverate,Amazing company,2021-02-16,5.0,Head of Success Department,"Very friendly environment, great staff,great working condition",No gym in the building

A lot of challenges
Every day there is something new",The offices do not reflect the atmosphere
16,Leverate,I do not enjoy the culture there,2021-02-03,1.0,Office Administrator,"Meeting new people, obtaining new knowledge.","Misleading would be the best way to describe the onboarding and overall culture at this company. No communication, no guidance, no proper training and no job security. If you are brilliant with integrity and vision, do not waste your time working at this place."

18,Leverate,Great People,2020-12-28,3.0,Customer Success Manager,Great people and atmosphere in the office,not sharing management no opportunity to grow
19,Leverate,Going nowhere,2020-12-19,2.0,Sales Representative,Being a broker is great if you're into thinking on your feet.,"This job was fine at first and slowly morphed into a truly unbearable situation in less than a year. Upper management is disconnected and middle management is generally useless. Systems are outdated, expectations are lacking in communication and they don't care about employees input. High staff turnover in the last few years."
20,Leverate,It disturbs your inner peace,2020-11-22,1.0,Team Leader,"It was good at first, till you get to that point.",The pay you get is not enough to compensate the work you do. including the headache and the stress. There's too much going on and it disturbs your inner peace. Then you know it's time to leave.
21,Leverate,No real sense of direction,2020-10-11,1.0,Client Success Manager,"If you just need something temporary, this is the ideal place. Not a long term career path though.","There is no real sense of direction within the company and no system in place that supports the business needs. Goals and targets are consistently not being met, causing frequent changes to how teams operate. Not a favorable working environment for any potential employees or for anyone looking to join the firm. Save your time and work elsewhere."
22,Leverate,Over fatigued from the daily grind,2020-09-28,2.0,Financial Advisor,The company events are generally fun and it's a good way to get people together.,Most employees here are over fatigued from the daily grind and overly competitive atmosphere. Teams are being set against each other and it gives too much pressure to each individual.

24,Leverate,Better leave this place as soon as you can,2020-05-18,1.0,Administrative Assistant,"They have interesting products, and employees are good to work with.","Employees here are being overworked despite having low salaries. You'll surely lose your dreams of having a good life once you work here. Management doesn't acknowledge or appreciate the employees, much more give them a reward for their diligence at work. Better leave this place as soon as you can."
25,Leverate,A lot to lose and not much to gain,2020-05-12,1.0,Administrative Assistant,I was lucky to be able to work with my team and enjoy the team building with them.,"There's a lot to lose and not much to gain in this company. Sure, you have the experience and pay, but that's because you worked for it.But you lose your time for yourself cause no matter how long you've been working in the company, your pay and position remains the same.You lose time for your family from the overtime you have to do just to give their demands.You lose your health from the stress and pressure from the management."
26,Leverate,No workplace culture,2020-04-12,1.0,Administrative,I got to work on and lean different technologies,"The management is blissfully unaware of the fact that a company needs good workplace culture to unite employees and help them bond. As a result, there is not enough communication between the teams, which leads to communication gaps and often impacts the work. Also the management rarely shares its plans with the employees. Overall, there is a lack of trust."
27,Leverate,Two Critical Problems,2020-03-08,1.0,Administrative Assistant,Many tech Gurus work at this place,"Two critical problems of this company are the lack of a better plan for the future and incompetent middle management. It is a bad combination as it's forcing many competent, energetic and loyal employees to quit."
28,Leverate,Middle Management Rules this Place,2020-02-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The company provides a bonus if middle management is favorable to an employee.,"The middle-management is the problem here. They push the junior employees to their limit. If they like someone, that person can just sit in the office the entire day and do nothing, and no one would say a word to that employee. If they dislike someone, they make him or her work all the time without any breaks. It's disgusting."
29,Leverate,Good times and bad times,2020-02-11,3.0,Technical Support Engineer,"Good vibes, nice perks like company-wide vacation to Cyprus and a yearly bonus",Management sides with mid-level managers abusing their power and staff
30,Leverate,Poor Management,2020-01-16,1.0,Marketing Associate,This place is full of energetic people.,"Unorganized and unsystematic processes. This place is poorly managed. Projects are pending, efforts and hard work are being wasted because of chaotic management. Employees don't know which project to focused on. It's confusing and frustrating to work in a place where the goals are unclear and you don't know what the company's objectives are."
31,Leverate,This company is going nowhere,2019-12-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The tech here is great. The work environment is also filled with energy due to the energetic employees.,"Management lacks any clear direction, and the company has no clear set of goals. Employees have no idea what management is trying to aim for. We are just made to do whatever the managers instruct us to do. There's also no job security. Some of my co-workers before got fired for without adequate warning. This company is going nowhere."
32,Leverate,Do something to hit targets,2019-11-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"We have a good team, schedule can be flexible and work can be interesting.","The system is falling apart from the lack of coordination between upper and middle management. Goals are not being met, targets are not being hit, plus the entire industry is not at its best."
33,Leverate,FOREX TECH PROVIDER,2019-09-10,4.0,Marketing Designer,"Pleasant staff, friendly atmosphere, nice place","Most company's clients are forex companies, this industry is now down, so Leverate company has not it best times"

39,Leverate,Solid experience all around,2018-12-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Leverate provided a great opportunity for me and I've been really thankful for the chance to work with the name as respected as theirs. My team is really dedicated which makes everything easier and I've gotten to work with some very impressive clients.,"Hard work is expected, I think it's the same thing with other companies."
40,Leverate,No longer leading company,2018-09-30,3.0,Product Manager,"Location is fine. 
Few colleagues  are fun and nice. 
Salary is reasonable.","Company turned to be boring.  The management is ""milking the cow""  with the legacy products and there is no technological challenge anymore.  
The most talented employees are leaving the company and no one will replace them. 
CEO wants to lower the risk and to reduce the expenses / resources. 
The fact that they are in problematic industry is also something you want to consider!"
