0,Lynx Capital Partners,Hypocritical and dishonest,2019-10-22,1.0,Senior Product Manager,The nice and professional development team,"Terrible top management: no feedback, lying about plans, KPI's and money; not organised, can't hire people and hire forest roleplayers who have no experience, don't know how to do anything but instead of it, they are loyal. 
There are no processes at all; no one introduces you to anyone; you should find out about your colleagues by yourself.
Lies about promotion and career plans; lies about responsibilities."

2,Lynx Capital Partners,"If you want the proper training, this is not your place",2010-09-28,3.0,Trader,"Free access to T3Live.com, nice office building located in the financial district, you are your own boss, good tech support","There is one big con to working at Lynx as a new trader, which is that training is not so great.  They train you in a specific scalping strategy, which I personally don't like, and if you want to learn other strategies, you're basically on your own.  When you try to learn new strategies on your own in an already difficult trading environment, it is extremely hard to be successful."
