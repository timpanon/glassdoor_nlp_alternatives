1,MCF Corporation,President,2016-11-04,5.0,President/Chief Operating Officer,"Great CEO, Open door policies",Not that I can think off
2,MCF Corporation,Slow motion train wreck finally reached the station and shut down,2016-08-02,1.0,Managing Director,There is absolutely nothing positive about my two years here.  Management has been making poor decisions for years.  No direction and FINRA finally shut it down.  Clueless from the top.,"The constant passing blame everywhere.  Cheap salesman talk from the CEO, he doesn't even realize people just laugh at his BS, jargon filled talking without saying a thing.

""Movin' and Shakin'"", such a pathetic attempt at a business.  No surprises at all the firm was shut down, well, maybe the CEO didn't see it but everyone else did."
3,MCF Corporation,"Good company, bad luck",2016-01-04,2.0,,"Worked with talented people across the board, small company and you/re exposed to many areas of the business.  Upper management was friendly, always said hello.  Monthly all-hands meeting were informative and happy hours were fun.",Bad luck - company got caught up in a scam involving one of the employees and a client.  The stock market overall had taken another downturn so those two together equally lost of funds/revenue.
4,MCF Corporation,Not so Smart management team,2015-11-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flexible working hours; Friendly environment.  Use to have great team working and taking care each other, but my last couple months are basically work by myself and had lots of free time.  The CEO, John, is a very nice and friendly person.  He will call you by name and initially say ""Hello"" to you, unlike many other upper management that will ignore you even you say ""Hi"" to them.","It was a good company but the management team had make lots of bad decisions.  They let go lots of good & productive employees and left those that were ""not-so"" productive, and hire some even more worst but with higher pay and wasting the company money.  So sad to see such a good company had drawn down by bunch of people who don't really know what they are doing but just collecting the high pay."

6,MCF Corporation,Merriman review,2009-10-09,2.0,,Fast placed and entrepreneurial work environment; very high learning curve in the beginning. Good culture mostly,Senior management doesn't appreciate analyst work at all and accidentally stated it; very low compensation
