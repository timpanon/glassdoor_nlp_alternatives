4,Madonna Management Services,THANK GOD I GOT ANOTHER JOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2014-07-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,NONE TO NAME. THEY HAVE AC IN THE SUMMER TIME!!!!,"There are too many to name so I will pinpoint a few glaring items:
The owners have obvious mental health issues which foster and contribute to the culture of bullying, distrust and counter-productivity.
Oppressive office environment where the employees every move is watched and tallied.
There is 0 upward mobility at this company.
Internal communication is “0” leading to confusion and the ultimate failure !
Upper level management does nothing to rectify a toxic environment of bullies, backstabbing and nepotism.
Management are liers, they promise raises and bonuses and then nothing happens.
They offer a very low pay!
Management will talk down to you! 
Almost everyone there is waiting for a better job to leave!
Turnover is extremely high!
No employee morale, you’d be lucky to see a smile ,unless it’s other employees poking fun at the company’s ways 
Everyone is disgruntled and hates working for MMS Group!
Staff is riddled with back stabbers, snitches, wannabes!"
