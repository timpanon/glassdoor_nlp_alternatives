0,Magnises,Do not work at this company,2017-07-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,At one point it seemed like a promising company.,"The CEO forced employees to lie. If you spoke up, you were threatened to be fired. If you suggested doing things the right way, you were threatened to be fired. Toxic working environment."
1,Magnises,No structure,2017-05-29,2.0,Marketing Manager,Invites to events in New York City and chill office environment.,Management is inexperienced and cliquey. There is no structure to the operation. The CEO is always MIA.
2,Magnises,The Lies,2017-05-12,1.0,Marketing,Magnises used to have a great brand image that people wanted to join because of the marketing the company has done. That's about it. Ther perception.,"Everything. The CEO is never there and when he was, he was always speaking nonsense. He's the definition of privilege.

We didn't even have our own office space. We were in a co-working space, and some of the other employees (aka his friends) were douches who did nothing but play on a hoverboard all day. Alley (owners of the actual office space) had to email everyone asking us to not ride hoverboards because our neighbors complained.

We were told to lie. Many times out of frustration, I was rude to the customer because of pressures from senior management to lie. I quit after 5 months and would not recommend anyone using this company."

-The 132 page marketing deck is comedic gold
-Employees banded together since it was so miserable, so we have stayed close even after leaving","EVERYTHING, but for more details:
-pay checks bounced
-dropped health insurance without telling us
-rampant sexism 
-inexperienced upper management that deferred to their own arrogance instead of listening to helpful advice
-You would actually get reprimanded if you did not participate in lies to customers"
4,Magnises,Scam,2017-03-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,You learn how not to treat people.,"Power hungry, immature management. You'll compromise your morals here. You'll be forced to work outside of work hours doing things far outside of your job description. Management lies to you and to each other. No room for respect or ideas. The opposite of a 'typical startup environment.' No room for creative ideas or conversation - it's all a power struggle. Blatant sexism with a touch of racism. Would be shocked if this company still existed next week. DO NOT WORK HERE (unless you need great material for a book or something)."
5,Magnises,RUN! All of the positive reviews are upper management. Don't be fooled! 0 Stars!,2017-02-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- CEO never shows up
- Free tampons in the bathroom","- Pay checks bounce
- Health insurance cancels with no notice
- Ponzi scheme 
- Upper management forces employees to lie to clients and if they don't they get fired
- Male employees get paid more than female employees
- CEO bases salary by who he is friends with

Don't be fooled. Upper management forces people to write good reviews. Worst place to work. Company is a sinking ship. 

Company had great potential at one time. If the right people were hired on the management team then things would be different."
