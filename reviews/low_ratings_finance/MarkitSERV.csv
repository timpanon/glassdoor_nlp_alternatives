3,MarkitSERV,Nothing is alright except salary,2016-07-31,1.0,Assistant Vice President,"If your diplomatic and political skills are great then you are gem for this company, if you are not looking to groom yourself technically then this is the best place for you. You will get to work with best donkeys in the industry where you can spoil yourself. You will be surrounded with number of dumb and politically bright people. Your boot licking skills will well recognized here irrespective of your knowledge.","Your technical skills will get rusted over a period of time. worst company to work for, worst management and HR. The US and UK establishments are still better, They call it R&D center but its actually the cost cutting center managed and run by bunch of AH's. The India operations, HR and administration has completely ruined this company's image. There is hell lot of corruption and cost cutting for each and every possible thing for Indian employees, even for tissues and toilet rolls. Don't fall in the trap that they are pay masters, if you have skills then there are numerous better companies who are ready to give you much better pay scales. Don't join this company and regret for the worst mistake of your lifetime later."

4) Leads want their ex colleague to join their team at any cost, Specifically i was in a team were VP made all sort of  :tricks"" to make sure he had his buddy as his junior ,  and Management awarded him as  Best employee of the year

Gym Subsidy","Poor management - Most managers (with certain exceptions) are either inexperienced at managing, do almost nothing on a D2D basis, and have no technical knowledge of the platforms.

Poor culture - No accountability for issue ownership.  Certain teams and employees will barely have a workload yet pass around an issue under their scope like hot potatoes.  This is widespread across processing and part of the company culture.

Politics - Certain employees that have solid technical knowledge, people, and leadership skills who have been around for years will not get promotions or recognition.  In contrast, certain employees who have almost no ability to manage or technical skills will be promoted to Director+ because they're focused on playing ""the game""

Lack of accountability and client focus"
11,MarkitSERV,Messed up Management + Full of Politics,2016-03-21,1.0,Assistant Vice President,Well i saw none. There were no pros i felt there.,"1. Managers are not qualified. Some managers are NIIT diploma holders with little or no team experience and no domain knowledge.
2. HR is just for the sake of it with no power. They do what the managers say.
3. Decisions are UK driven. An associate in London can pass bad reviews about a Director in India and the Director can be fired.
5. No retention policy. Project finish, you are in line of fire.
6. Too much micro management. Rules are meant for the subordinates and not the managers who make them or try to get them implemented.
7. Promises made during hiring never see the light of the day.
8. Too much internal politics.
9. Stupid leaves policy.
10. Employees are never given what they deserve. Non deserving candidates are promoted based on criteria upper management knows.
11. People at MD level do not know how to budget a simple/complex project and later they find out scapegoats to save themselves.
12. There is nothing that defines a healthy work culture. There is no culture at all."

Good comraderie.,"Pay isn't great, so while innovative there's no certainty that windfall flows to you. Sometimes office politics can get in the way of good outcomes. Can be difficult to move to different areas where employee has an ability to shine."
14,MarkitSERV,MarkitSERV,2016-03-05,2.0,Senior Developer,Fairly relaxed place with decent office environment. Company was growing very fast at the time and making many acquisitions.,Pay was lower than industry average as was the bonus. Large amount of acquisitions led to very fragmented culture with almost no communication with different groups. Technology infrastructure was very poor.

Offices,  used to be able to learn a lot but not sure that is true now.  Attempts have been made to make life more bearable through the social committee but benefits are minimal.","The management is terrible, politics are out of control,  sexist atmosphere.   They are employing cheap inexperienced staff rather than investing in good people with the result of poor quality and not getting things done.   Redundancies are rife as are resignations.   Not a happy place at the moment."
19,MarkitSERV,"ok benefits and relaxed working, but low pay",2015-07-30,2.0,C++ Programmer,"Working hours of 35 are amongst the lowest in the city.  Benefits are ok, people are nice to work with.","Not much chance to actually write in C++ and relatively low pay here.

If you're a C++ dev don't come here there is very little C++ dev done here, its mostly an inhouse bespoke language thats used. The management like to quantify your effort by number of lines of code written and number of checkins, yes really! Morale in the dev teams really low, loads of people wanting to jump ship"

- Nice colleagues who have become dear friends
- Working hours are flexible
- Excellent benefits package (although base salary & EOY comp can be better)","- Seriously messy & disorganized, nobody is capable of following a simple procedure
- Messiness is reflected in the staff, hardly anyone puts a suit on
- Emerging problems tend to be treated as ""hot potatoes"" that get passed on from team to team, or kicked down the road altogether
- the influx of 19 year old ""consultants,"" obviously bottom of the barrel but the cheapest alternative workforce around"

The company could be a bit more ruthless as clearly some employees do not know what they are doing and do not deserve to work here.
27,MarkitSERV,The boys club is at it again,2013-12-16,1.0,Director,Very little if anything is possitive about this company any more.  Gone are the days that you felt as if the company really cared about you as a human and not just a number.,"The male managers.  MarkitServ has become a company of mostly men in management, these men consistantly belittle any woman that dares have a thought.  They continue to take care of each other with nice bonuses while offering little to the women.  They provide opportunities for the men, while pushing women aside.  I would say if you are a woman looking to work here....don't.  You will get nowhere in this organization."
