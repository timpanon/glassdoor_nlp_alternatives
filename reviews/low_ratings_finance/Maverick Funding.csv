4,Maverick Funding,Case of the Mondays,2014-12-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,The products were diverse and the pricing attractive.,"This company was awesome when there was involvement day to day by the owners, once it was handed off and layers of middle management added it was hard to get anything done.  There is a clear divide between those that are ""in"" and those that are ""out.""    Underwriting and sales were at odds due to lack of enforced policy for escalations or questions.  Communication with brokers was terrible and the AEs are always getting frustrated with the underwriters because of it. Underwriters are expected to do too much."
