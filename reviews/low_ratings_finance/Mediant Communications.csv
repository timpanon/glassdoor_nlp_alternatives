0,Mediant Communications,terrible  company to work for,2022-04-04,2.0,Desktop Support Technician,"only pro is that the pay is solid, but money is not everything.",It is a toxic work environment where high school politics come into play where a coworker may tattletale on you for looking at your cellphone even if you had already caught up with tasks. Did not have a clear objective with having different people making requests that contradicted with each other often. Was expected to be onsite everyday even though the manager never comes onsite. All around toxic environment.
1,Mediant Communications,Not a place to grow or stay,2022-03-09,2.0,Regulatory Specialist,Decent pay and not bad experience,Management and work morale. No growth kind of a my way or the highway. If you don’t do what we say you’re gone. No work from home options.
2,Mediant Communications,Pretty Great,2021-09-15,5.0,Some Sort of High-ish Ranking IT Person,"Still sorta small, but rapidly growing company with lots of opportunity for learning, skill development, and career advancement within the technology departments.

8,Mediant Communications,Awesome Team!,2020-11-26,4.0,Administrative,Great group of employees.   Leadership is actively working to improve culture.,A lot of opportunity to establish or improve processes.
9,Mediant Communications,"Excellent Team, Awesome Company",2020-08-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people at Mediant are top notch and have a real sense of teamwork, and there is a drive to be the best in the industry.  Mediant hires on merit and skill which makes it an awesome place to work.  The work is fast-paced and never boring.  Mediant is a growth oriented company and has leadership with tenacity, skill, and expertise.",Not many cons here.  No job or company is perfect.
10,Mediant Communications,"Great people, decent pay",2020-07-29,5.0,Engineering,"great people, good flexibility, management is understanding and truly cares about the people.","there is a busy season where you will need to shape up or ship out, some people cant handle the extra work/stress... but it is rewarded"
11,Mediant Communications,"Temp workers, beware your pay",2020-05-21,1.0,Temp,"Everyone was super nice, at first. But the reviews about gossip upon management is very true.","They hire a bunch of temps for the busy proxy season and depends on how you get hire there WILL be a huge pay disparity. Like 50% pay difference. When you try to negotiate to a closer value to what everyone else is getting, my resume was picked a part and was lied to that everyone else was way more qualified and had more education than me (I knew the other temps, that was not true) and I should be thankful to be even getting paid that much. Mediant didn't lose my respect because they didn't give me a fair wage, they lost my respect on how they handled the whole situation. You cannot tell me that a you save more money hiring temps from a temp agency."
12,Mediant Communications,"Excellent Director, Nightnare manager",2020-02-20,2.0,Associate,"Jean, the director, truly wants to see you succeed and will bend over backwards and get her hands dirty to assist in any way possible","The  Manager Is the sole reason that I had to leave a company where I actually enjoyed the work and was good at it. She made it very clear that I was not going to succeed from the start and it became a little hidden secret between she and I that I would not be trained even though she told upper management I was being trained and she threw me in the fire when she left for vacation just so there I would fail in front of upper management. Extremely unprofessional, as I sat in the cube directly next to her and overheard her telling her boyfriend that ""The Girl"" (me)  Was going to get what I had coming to me next week while she was on vacation because she was going to leave me every daily task that I had never been trained on. I resigned. I am assuming not all managers, or hopefully any other managers, are as hateful And unprofessional as this manager was. It was a very disappointing situation because with proper training and a manager that didn't loathe me for no particular reason, I would have been very successful"
13,Mediant Communications,Toxic Environment,2019-10-15,1.0,Broker Services,"Friendly Co-workers
Good pay
Occasional lunch provided","Unprofessional and toxic management
Management is very rude - They love to gossip and bully"
14,Mediant Communications,Do not waste your time.,2019-10-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Leaving early on a Friday,"This is a cesspool for the unprofessional. Mediant is filled with backstabbbers including management and HR. There are absolutely no checks and balances. Management does what they want, when they want, and how they want. The time spent here has been nothing but agony."
15,Mediant Communications,Small to mid size company seeing changes,2018-04-21,3.0,Cybersecurity Risk & Audit,"The biggest pro is the people. They have done a solid job at hiring top notch people for full time roles. Especially in the IT & Security space. The Senior Management in the Cary office are great to work with and are the type of people you can actually talk to , there is a true open door policy. An overall great environment with caring people.","Health Care Benefits are not very good, no promotional or growth opportunity, no push for training or certification support, the role you start in is where you will be while you are there."

Poor Pay. No company moral programs or company spirit. Few if any performance reviews, and chances too earn a raise or a promotion."
18,Mediant Communications,Adding a little balance,2017-01-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I heard about this site and thought I would read the reviews, and it's true, people concentrate on the bad stuff. I've been working at Mediant for 4+ years and I think it's a really good company. The people I work with are great. We have an agile environment and everyone works hard and as a team. Often we get together outside of work for different activities, not because we have to, but because we want to. As for the work, there is so much going on and so many product offerings, you don't get bored doing the same thing and are exposed to many different technologies.","Don't get me wrong, it's not all roses. But I don't see any issues here that are worse than are at any other company."
19,Mediant Communications,Dead end job,2017-01-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Friendly employees, clean work environment","Worked here for over five years, only received one salary increase, management doesn't care about employees"

22,Mediant Communications,Nothing good to say......,2015-10-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,A few people that I've met.,I don't really have anything nice to say so I won't list any cons.  I think the other reviews have summed it up.
23,Mediant Communications,STAY AWAY. DISAPPOINTING.,2015-09-01,1.0,,"Met select, few good people","The worst place to work, point blank. Disrespectful environment. I should have paid more attention to these posts. If I wanted to revisit elementary school I would have done so. They have the wrong people as supervisors! The selection of supervisors and co-workers here is an abomination and complete embarrassment. Some of the employees don't know the definition of professionalism otherwise their actions would be different. A serious amount of people make the environment disgusting and a horrible place to work because of their moronic actions. People talk about each other and make fun of each like they're still in elementary school. Folks are jealous and extremely immature. Employees yell at each other whether across the room or next to each other. Keep in mind these are supposed to be adults. It makes no sense to be 30-50 years of age and not know how to be professional, kind, and respectful. There is no need to start trouble just get the job done! FOCUS!"
24,Mediant Communications,Could Use Some Improvement,2015-08-27,2.0,Anonymous Employee,I worked with a few wonderful people- a SELECT few.,"Large turnover rate; no opportunities for career advancement ; Some people who are supervisors in different departments SHOULD NOT be supervisors at all. There are people in their late 20s to late 40s acting like little kids jealous of other people and causing unnecessary problems due to their own stupidity. Don't get me wrong, there are some wonderful people in their positions. However, to a few others who are horrible, you're old enough to know to leave your personal life problems at the door the minute you come in and start working.  There needs to be more time for training employees about respecting each other and proper work etiquette besides fulfilling company duties in a certain time frame.  Plenty of people who've worked here before me warned me that this place was a trap and had issues. I should've listened to them."
25,Mediant Communications,"If you aren't desperate, KEEP LOOKING!",2015-07-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I worked with a great people.,"Compensation is probably one of the biggest issues, someone with a college degree should not be getting paid $16 an hour, and they wonder why the turnover rate is so high.  There is no career development, so advice to recent college grads, DO NOT get stuck at this place.  Use this company like they will use you, just build job history.  Don't stop looking for other career opportunities.  To those that may have lost their jobs and need work, if hired, keep DILIGENTLY looking, don't become complacent.  This is the most unprofessional environment I've ever worked and been a part of."
26,Mediant Communications,"Honest opinion of recent former employee, sorry I waisted my time at Mediant.",2015-02-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Absolutely none, I can't find any.","I am in complete agreement  with the previous review posted.  In addition I too was an employee of Mediant. I personally  experienced: unprofessionalism, lack of respect, dishonest to their clients.   If you're thinking of applying don't walk through the door with morals.
Hard work is not rewarded, revolving door."

29,Mediant Communications,Just Say No........,2013-12-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"When I left this company.
The few friends I made.","They will micro-manage you.
Management is incompetent, but swears they know what they are doing.
They cannot seem to manage their finances, yet somehow they have new investors
Their books are in the red year after year, and they struggle to make payroll.
Don't expect a raise, unless you are in management.
Expect some, not all, of management to lie on you if they feel their job is threatened.
Even recruiting agencies don't want to deal with them because they don't pay their bills."
