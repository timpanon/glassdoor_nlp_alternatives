2,Medley Capital,Stay Away,2020-09-14,1.0,Manager,Good people to work with,Limited transparency and tone at the top is horrendous
3,Medley Capital,The benefits is what keeps people around,2019-05-17,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"You will not find better benefits at another company. You get free lunch 3 days a week, 100% paid medical coverage for you and your family, annual bonus, matched retirement account, and unlimited time off","This office has so many great people who work really hard but there is no investment in culture. The culture is so dry and dead. The people who are friends, stick together because they do things outside of work. I've seen people say hi to the CEO and he doesn't reply back because he is not approachable. If you quit, they will talk bad about you and make sure you feel uncomfortable right until your last day in the office."
4,Medley Capital,Excellent exposure for investment accounting,2019-04-09,5.0,Junior Fund Accountant,"Working in a fast pace environment. You will always be busy.

Teams are hard working and are willing to help with specific projects. You'll learn a lot about 10-K's and private credit/CLO's",If you cannot handle the fast pace setting its not for you.
5,Medley Capital,Leadership Issues,2019-01-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Offers junior investment professionals a significant amount of deal evaluation experience (not an endorsement of the quality of experience).,"The tone at the top has created a toxic environment. Ownership controls by fear, willfully discourages firm-wide communication, and exhibits little to no respect for employees. With regards to investment performance and investment strategy, there is minimal consistency from leadership. The Investment Committee is dysfunctional and afraid to make decisions. If you take a job at Medley, prepare to be frustrated day in and day out."
6,Medley Capital,Do NOT Work Here,2018-09-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Absolutely nothing is a pro when it comes to Medley.,"Everything. 
This is the worst company that I have ever worked for. The office environment is extremely unprofessional and senior management has no clue what they are doing. They work everyone to the bone for minimal pay.  Facetime is more important than actual work time.  I gained zero experience working at this firm."
7,Medley Capital,Horrible Work Environment,2018-09-04,1.0,Associate,Benefits are decent and above industry average,"Upper management does not manage, period. Facetime is valued more than getting work done here."
