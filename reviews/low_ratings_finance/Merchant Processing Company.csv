1,Merchant Processing Company,horrible,2016-12-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I cant think of one single thing that is a pro for this company, absolutely the worst employer ever","where do i start, rate of pay is horrible, receiving pay in a timely manner next to impossible, training horrible getting help when needed... huh!"
2,Merchant Processing Company,All around bad experince,2016-08-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Hours - but I can sit at home and not make any money instead of driving around and losing money,"Bad leads that disappear, leaving only self prospecting - low pay per sale and terrible management"
3,Merchant Processing Company,"Criminal - Why isn't ""Zero Stars"" an option",2015-01-23,1.0,,"None at all. (Glass Door makes me use at least 5 words - so, there you have it)","Everyone in top management is criminal, they lie, cheat and steal.  If this is your only job opportunity and there is nothing else on your radar - don't take a job with this company.  They have changed their name at least 3 times, would you like to take a guess why????  Oh yeah, their hiring practices are discriminatory - at best."
4,Merchant Processing Company,Unfriendly Company - Unethical,2015-01-05,1.0,Human Resources Generalist,The pay was good and the building was nice. There was a gym located in the building. The drive wasn't too bad. Easy access off of 75.,"Management/Directors
The company itself was very unprofessional. The CEO didn't even know the name of his receptionist and he would often ask her to print something for him while he was sitting in his office. I guess he didn't know how or maybe that task was beneath him."
5,Merchant Processing Company,Sales Manager,2014-03-05,2.0,Sales Manager,"Inside sales; M-F; no nights, no weekends",zero integrity in signing up clients through field reps; sales managers frequently lied to business owners and independent contractors that worked the field.
6,Merchant Processing Company,Great pay but demanding,2013-09-05,3.0,Corporate Sales Manager,"good starting salary, no weekends",terrible training provided to employees and outside reps
7,Merchant Processing Company,So not right!!,2013-08-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Recruitment staff should be given bonuses on a weekly basis!!!,"Starting point - the Call Center - doesn't even come close to screening ""real"" sales opportunities.  I think they are told that anything that moves and/or breathes...book an appointment.  Then there is the fact that they are willing to send a single female to a ""home business"" only to find out that nobody lives there....trust me it only takes one time for something to happen to a female/male out there by themselves in an ""unknown"" sales environment - and they don't seem to care...a sale is a sale.  Also to take into consideration - there is NO upfront money.  If you are on a budget - don't have the money to buy gas and are limited on the number of minutes you have on your cell phone...you will have issues.  They will not pay you until the end of the month - and it's ""bonus"" - which means you don't receive the extra money every month; it's an incentive - and is subjected to how many deals you close throughout the month - based on the ""call center"".  However, you are REQUIRED to call your manager after every meeting you have - and call in every morning to determine whether or not you UNDERSTAND the tasking you received the day before - around 4/5:00 in the afternoon - which means you don't have any idea of your schedule until you get your notice.  SO those of us who don't have anything else to do in our lives; this would be great.  For those of use who actually have responsibilities...it doesn't work out too well."
8,Merchant Processing Company,Former Corporate Employee,2013-06-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"None, not a single one","This place is the worst work environment I have ever been in.  After my 1st day on the job I realized I had screwed up (big) by taking this job.  There is rampant age and sex discrimination here, I was told not to consider interviewing women or old people for the positions I was put in charge of filling.  When I did bring in a woman or older person I was reamed up one side and down the other by their ""consultant"".  Run, don't walk, run as fast as you can from this place!"
