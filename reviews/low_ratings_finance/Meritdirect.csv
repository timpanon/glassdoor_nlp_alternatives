0,Meritdirect,Company who does not care about their employees,2021-12-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Interesting work and industry. They have the potential to do great things IF they can get their act together.,"Instead of looking for ways to improve the culture and keep employees, they seem to be looking for ways to screw them over. No raises or 401k match for years. No communication and appears the upper management only cares about themselves and getting a huge kick back when they sell the company.

Little to no room for growth, no parties, team or culture building. Lack of communication often makes it difficult to do your job."
1,Meritdirect,"Just a job, great flexibility",2021-11-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Relaxed low key office. Flexible work but challenging/fun projects.
Occasional Happy Hours.",Gossipy staff. Company culture seems to be non-existent. Management seems to be too focused in their own tasks they forget there is other people in the office that they can talk to or reach out to.
2,Meritdirect,Unprofessional and Toxic Work Environment.,2020-03-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There were a few nice people.,"Unfortunately, I had a very negative experience at this company.  Very condescending, abrasive and toxic work environment.  Not only are there very few friendly employees but itâ€™s a very gossipy and unprofessional environment, which upper management partakes in.  This environment left me feeling very uncomfortable and unsettled.  Many times, when I need assistance/asked for help I was belittled and left with no guidance.  Also, duties and responsibilities for roles were vague and unclear.  If you have talent, passion to work, and a positive attitude I would not recommend working for this company."
3,Meritdirect,Odd and Toxic Environment,2020-03-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,A couple of people are friendly.,"I do not recommend or support this company. Toxic environment and abrasive, gossipy senior staff. The departments seem very siloed and it can sometimes be an uncomfortable work environment. HR plays favorites and it is obvious. Business practices vary by department and there is barely any formality for anything. This job does not offer attractive perks that can be found at virtually any company in this day and age. I do not to believe that other employees here are truly happy working at this company-- I assume they are too comfortable to leave or are in the process of finding a way out. Very strange company that could use a lot of improvement."
4,Meritdirect,Culture of Fear,2019-12-04,1.0,SQL Server Developer,Maybe one day you can leave,"Culture of fear, no communication, worse place I have ever been, this place has been bought twice over, chaotic, messy work environment, crawling with insects, arrogant staff (not my words, the words of another reviewer), hide everything during interviews, rude staff, I left to pursue my Master's and my doctorate and am maintaining a 4.0 GPA, condescending staff, very bad place to work, run while  you still can"
5,Meritdirect,Great Internship,2019-10-17,5.0,Intern,SSG Team is very Understanding and always willing to teach and help interns as they are learning new things,Loved my time at MeritDirect
6,Meritdirect,"A balanced, challenging company",2017-05-08,4.0,,"MeritDirect has found the right balance of not being stuffy and not being too trendy. No, you won't find unlimited snacks, and ping pong tables. But you can actually leave the office at 5 pm and live your life. Great work/life balance!
