1,Merus Capital Partners,"A great place to learn with smart people, but still young and unorganized",2013-10-13,4.0,Proprietary Trading Intern,"Everyone in the firm was accessible at any time, willing to help and share their knowledge.  A diverse place where every trader had a different background, specialty, or focus and were free to pursue their own trading decisions.","Merus is still a new company, and it was the first year they had done the internship.  Throughout the course of the summer, many ""classroom instruction"" meetings were cancelled due to the traders being busy or having a meeting.  There was also no measurement of performance against your peers"
