the suite of products isn't competitive
the company has many departments and it seems as though none of them talk to each other
training was a disaster in clear water, it seemed as though they had put no thought into how to properly train someone for this position, often times i was just sitting around in an office waiting for something to do
I was hired February 26, i was in ""training"" in Florida for a week, then had a trainer come to my territory with me. He was the only competent person  I came in contact with. Second week of March was my first time in the field by myself. 

The products are not an easy sell. Dealers see right through them and have no interest. Auction prices are high, MAF's net checks to dealers are low. I hit my goals in April and was let go in May for ""not getting enough apps in"" I was let go on my 77th day. The had flown the trainer out to my territory to work with me and no one even told me he was coming. Horribly unprofessional."
