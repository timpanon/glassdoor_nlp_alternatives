5,Mid-State Ventures,Pretty Decent,2015-10-08,3.0,Teller,"Great management, the manager and DM are super easy to get along with. I have an awesome coworker, everyone is friendly, the work is a breeze once you learn it. Very laid back environment.","The hours suck, I'm basically working for gas money, no benefits, the work area is small, dirty and dusty. We have no control over the air and heat, the location isn't nice, dingy, rather. I love the my job but they seem tight. The equipment is old and dated, the work area is cluttered, part time employees only get 16-22 hrs per week. I'm not okay with working one 8 hr shift and two 4 hr shifts a week. If 22 is the max you should give them to your employees. I'll probably get a second job because the pay is rather low."
