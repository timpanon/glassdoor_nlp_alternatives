3,MissionSquare Retirement,Pass the buck,2022-02-27,1.0,Retirement Plan Consultant,"Simple job tasks, fairly straight forward work.","No one working here cares. Nothing is urgent or important. Even my own coworkers only respond to inquiries 1/3 of the time. The corporate culture seems to be, don’t respond or pass the buck. I began working here after they cut the 401(k) match, but I can’t help feeling it probably contributes to the general lackadaisical outlook of most employees. Also, the pay is terrible. My salary is $25,000 less than the same role I had previously at a different company.
Due to the pandemic, everyone is still pretty much working remotely. When I received my new hire laptop and login instructions, they were completely illegible. The packet of paperwork I received was printed intermittently, as if the printer was almost out of ink, but no one cared to change it. This pretty much sums up what it’s like working here day to day."

Apparently the CEO Lynne Fordham has many years of experience. I Look at broker check and she has 24 years  of experience. I assume she got this job based on her qualifications. I am so happy for her and she deserves it . However, I hate to say this but many employees are hired or get promoted because they know someone .  There are people who do not know what is a stock , Mutual funds and Annuity. Moreover , they get the  high paying job. I have seen people witty investment knowledge and still do not get promoted .

Good products.","- Departments with too many VPs who do a lot of nothing, but think it's their job to point out everything you did wrong instead of actually lead. Some of them literally stay in their offices all day with their doors closed. The others walk around with their noses in the air or scowling. 
- A completely useless HR department that enables inefficient, widely despised managers and VPs by not acting on employee complaints and well documented problems. There are a few managers in particular who have had terrible reputations and dysfunctional teams for years, yet they still have jobs. Meanwhile, new talent leaves in droves while the dinosaurs stay. 
- Inefficient processes and outdated technologies. Very resistant to new ideas and fresh perspectives, which is why they are losing business to larger, more effective competitors. People have been there so long they have no perspective on how the big picture looks - and it shows. 
-Limited mobility. Only a handful of people seem to move around and advance, even though recruiters sell the company on being a place you can build a career. That is until you find that there are literally people all over the company who have never worked anywhere else and will probably never leave - and they don't want to see anyone new get ahead or grow.

Great location - right next to Union station, this is big for me","There are tons of changes in the industry with a lot of competition; therefore, there are a lot of changes happening at ICMA-RC - this could be challenging to some people.  

Not too much fresh leadership coming from outside at Senior Manager, Director, VP levels.  I believe this could cause stagnation, and complacency, and the less likelihood to continually improve processes, which is needed for great customer service.  However, recently a new VP was brought in that I do believe is helping to raise the standards."

If you are looking for someplace to park, you can stay there for a very long time.","Sales division compensation constantly changes;  your focus constantly changes; the corporation used to have the employer and participant relationship as their main focus, now, they are just like everyone else, worried mostly about their own bottom line. Everyone is out for themselves and you will have no real support. What they tout at sales meetings and annual trainings in DC is not really how they function. If you have issues with anyone you are considered a trouble maker.  Field sales are glorified enrollment machines in the eyes of management who have lost touch with the basis for success, relationship building, therefore, field sales personnel end up receiving the blame and taking all the heat. The home office is their own worst enemy promising high, delivering less. Cut throat sales people get promoted instead of great leaders and trainers. if you don't get on the train or question decisions you are black balled. If you get hired here, you will enjoy it for a while but do not become complacent and trust no one, particularly not HR nor your management staff.

In the call center they make you worked forced overtime and give you free food usually not the best because the person who orders is already doing way too much work and orders whats easiest but you constantly work overtime. They have a turnover rate of 3-9 months because be cannot take the terrible conditions from the director who is self serving and only sees people as stats and numbers not people with actual lives. HR does not care because all they will say is try to get your stats up or you know we are under staffed but we have been fully staffed and they could not hold the people because the conditions are so bad with micromanaging they have hired a glorified overseer and none of the stats are better. the call center runs like a plantation and will ruin your work ethic because you will begin to not care at all.

ICMA-RC is the most diverse population of employees I've ever had the pleasure of working with (home office in DC).  The work is steady.  Many employees have very long tenures which is generally indicative of a nice place to work.  Some internal departments are well run and very flexible when it comes to work-life balance.  Bonuses are great and in this economic environment raises are nice too.","Upward mobility by position is a problem because of a lack of career path and open opportunities.  Some positions have various levels, but management does not do a good job of providing tangible actions necessary for moving into a higher level.  Some internal departments, such as IT have a poor reputation for service.   This is generally because the Boar of Directors is frugal when it comes to expanding the employee population.  Some areas are simply understaffed. 
Where the company does pay bonuses annually, the annual raise is limited to 2-3% which is not in line with inflation.  
The CEO is RARELY seen by employees."
94,MissionSquare Retirement,Lacking in employee morale,2014-03-02,2.0,,Good amount of workload - won't get bored.,"Many of the employees that have been here longer are very cruel and do not handle their own work. If they have an intern, they will make that intern do everything while they sit back and relax."
95,MissionSquare Retirement,A good place to work,2014-02-25,4.0,,"Benefits are great, 4% match and 6% contribution to 401 and not too high medical premiums.  Great people to work with and an opportunity to truly help our clients ""Build retirement security""  If I work hard and effectively, I get paid well.  Saw an earlier post about poor pay and having to wait for certain bonuses.  I disagree, base could be higher but I know a few of my peers who make 6 figure comp. Not there yet but working towards it.  Also, I knew what I was getting into when I came on board, no one forced me to take this job.","Work/life balance could use some adjusting.  So many goals to reach and only so many hours in the day.  clients can be a challenge, need to be able to adjust to so many different personalities.  Do sometimes wonder how promotion decisions are made. Some seem truly deserved and others not so much."

99,MissionSquare Retirement,Limited opportunities for advancement due to promotions based on fear of litigation,2012-11-30,2.0,Specialist/Analyst,"Excellent 401(k) match.
Convenient location near Union Station that's good for public transportation.  
Very unlikely ever to have layoffs in economic downturns.","The first thing you have to know is that the interviewers are like used car salesman who will say anything to get you in the door.  I was recruited with promises of advancement, four weeks of leave every  year, and stories about what a great place it is to work.  The reality is that there are no defined career paths for many positions and, because people stay so long due to the benefits package, you have to wait for someone to die or retire for any chance to get ahead.  The other downside is that, because there are so many people who have been there for so long, that many long-time employees have no idea just how dysfunctional the environment there is.  It’s incredibly bureaucratic, in the worst possibly way.  The result is a bunch of people who’ve been there so long they are unemployable elsewhere and a constant churn of employees under them who get fed up and leave.   The four weeks of leave is two weeks of vaction, one week of short-term sick leave, and one week of long-term sick leave (can only be used if you’re out more than week for  a serious illness).  You never get to use vacation because there’s always some looming deadline, and it’s impossible to get out of the office to ever go to a doctor’s appointment.  You’ll be required to bring in proof when your grandmother dies because they won’t believe you.   This is a last-chance employer for the worst graduates of mediocre colleges, and it shows."
