1,Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA),Woke up from that bad dream,2022-01-14,1.0,Analyst,5percent bonus on annual basic which really isn't a pro if you consider how they break your back,"Managers are horrible. Annoyed to answer your questions yet demand the navs in unrealistic timing
Favoritism central. Stress headquarters 
Shoddy training. Looks like everyone is struggling with their job so dont expect any training that actually impacts you positively 
Pays peanut. Overtime isn't even paid yet you cannot meet deliverables at standard 9 to 5. Your life is leased to them"

6,Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA),No Infrastructure,2016-03-11,2.0,Analyst,"Small, ""start-up"" feel; not a lot of red tape; minimal compliance supervision","Compensation well under the industry average. HR is more or less a placeholder. Growth in spurts, not done prudently, not consistent over time. In particular, 1st year analysts get screwed (or a free ride) due to fixed bonus ranges with varying hours and degrees of responsibility."

Everyone is working for a common goal.,There are no real cons. This is a bank that has a very strong vision for the future. There goals are very clear. The bank is expanding globally.

crazy business users.
no respect to employee's contribution
too many turn over on both IT and Business sides
applications are replaced with systems in London office, which has very odd, bad designed system and full of political playing.
London office kept losing money and not stable."

I left the company with little or no useful experience for my next job. Only bad memories. This is a warning to all who are about to accept the ""Securities Technician"" entry level position they post for recent college grads.","Where do I start? The movie Office Space comes to mind. You are micro-managed and have to punch-in/out  everyday. If you are late 3 times even for a minute after 9 - you will be called into a meeting to discuss how you can make a better effort. I can go on, but I am hoping you get the drift by now."
15,Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA),"The company seemed inconsistent with respect to strategy, constantly shifting and chasing the last thing that worked.",2014-03-07,3.0,Director,I liked the people and they tried to pay pretty well.,I didn't like the political environment.

-Poor HR processes, with little support and professionalism
-Slow in development with severe growing pains
-Revenue generating departments are very skewed. Not able to develop into new markets.
-Mis-match of senior management priorities and implementation when priorities are filtered down to staff.
