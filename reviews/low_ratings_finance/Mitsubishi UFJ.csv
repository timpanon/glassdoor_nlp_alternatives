0,Mitsubishi UFJ,financially stable,2021-12-12,4.0,Consultant,"This company is financially stable. This is because the parent company, which is a bank, has a wide range of relationships with Japanese customers and will introduce services on behalf of this company.","Due to the social responsibility of the bank, the rules and procedures for business execution are complicated for this company as well."

3,Mitsubishi UFJ,Non-White and Women Run,2020-04-27,1.0,Manager,I can't think of any pros working for MUTB.,"The corporate culture allows sexism, gender inequality, racism, harassment, bullying, backstabbing and favoritism. Incompetent white men succeed as white privilege is a thing for the JPN mgmt. Perf does not matter for them as long as they are habitual liars, and yes men. I have seen so many more qualified and experienced women ended up losing their promotions to those men. There has not been a woman executive for a long time.  Even if there is one, she is a token.  Every year, responsibilities increase without compensated pay for those who actually work. If you say no, you are insubordinate. If you decide to speak up and report issues, the HR will deny any unlawful activities and claim the company has lack of resources for the business needs to shut you up.  Retaliation will then follow to make you not want to go to work until you decide to quit, so they don't have to face a risk of being sued and pay unemployment benefits and also increased tax rates. Talking about ""Turnover"" this place takes it to a whole new level. HR dept is unethical and dishonest."

10,Mitsubishi UFJ,Institutional Fixed Income Sales,2018-08-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Very few but for 'junior' staff the ability to use client contacts/relationships into next role.
A very small number of' knowledgeable and friendly staff' who make the place mildly tolerably.","Do not be mis-lead by the name. This is a broker/boiler-room 'hiding' behind the Mitsubishi name for some creditably. 

Whilst it can't be denied that they have some high profile clients who 'value' the service and it is a good stepping stone for sales people looking to move from Bloomberg to a career in sell-side sales,  the single biggest issue with the company is Management and specifically the CEO.
Things like, minimum number of minutes for being on the phone and performance league tables do nothing to dispel the 'call-centre/boiler-room' vibe. 

All the comments about the CEO and his interview style on Glassdoor are true and if anything do not give a clear indication of just how bad this guy is.  If he was in any other institution where he was not the top dog he would have been found out and thrown out within 5 minutes. 

The atmosphere in the firm is toxic as he  has created an atmosphere of fear, and from speaking to staff who have been at the firm for various lengths of time, it seems its the same story if you have been there 6mths or 10yrs years.

The Glassdoor reviews are very accurate and I only wish I had discovered, and read, the reviews before I had accepted the opportunity to interview there- let alone work there.  AVOID!!"
