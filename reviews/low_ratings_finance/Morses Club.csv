0,Morses Club,Wouldn't recommend,2022-01-18,2.0,Customer Service Representative,The company had invested in a new building with on site parking,"I'm not sure where to begin...

I worked for Morses club, Shelby finance (dotdot loans) when it was Wageday and before that also.

The management is terrible, they haven't a clue of what they're actually doing, its honestly like they wing it day by day. 
Previously reported trainers for being inappropriate by privately messaging staff but they was promoted to manager instead. 
They do not value their long term staff whatsoever, once you don't keep up with them they sack you.
The turn over is incredibly high.
Everyone there dislikes the company, I will be surprised if they last this year.
Absolutely no progression whatsoever. Multiple colleagues have been waiting YEARS to be in a management role but the senior manager takes in external friends instead who then have to be trained by current staff on how to do the job. 
You are not paid a livable wage, price of living is going up and people had to BEG for them to relook at the wages to which they raised them by £500 a year meanwhile multiple occasions have the managers been given a fat pay increase."
1,Morses Club,Previously was good under old leadership,2021-12-19,1.0,Area Manager,"Present:- None

Previous:-
Accountability of own area,
Help and support from others,
Great experience management team,
Growth plans,
Career route,","It all went downhill when the previous Director left the company. New Director in place is far too aggressive and is not a people person! Funny thing he only promoted people who he liked or worked with.  Also new structure came in force this year, promoted certain RM to DOM role! Some don’t deserve the title! It got to the part when we were told that we are ‘lucky’ to be there and have a job! Going through Covid this is not what I wanted to hear! Also new culture is poor no team work etc.  we did 60 - 70 hours a week even weekends to keep our jobs!
We had to fight to survive there. What life was this."

Low Pay,"

Field work
Manage own time","Have to do your own job, plus any of your team members who are off"
7,Morses Club,Great company,2021-06-21,4.0,Customer Relationship Manager,Good company to work for,Always on call never seem to finish work
8,Morses Club,"Black & white, no grey",2021-04-12,3.0,Business Manager,Get to manage own time,"Expected to work all hours until the job is done, have to work the agents job on top of your own if they are on holiday or ill etc."
9,Morses Club,Avoid,2021-02-06,2.0,Agent,Can work your hours around home life,"Equipment and system is terrible to use. No incentives but give out targets when they are not supposed to. Keep lowering commission, taken refinance commission away completely, expecting you to work more for less money. Despite you building your own customer base they can get rid of you with 2 weeks notice. They do not value their agents at all, always threatened with territory closure. No support in building your territory. The rules change constantly! They give you a new customer target and call it ""promotion"" but with no incentives to you, thats not a promotion that is the basis of your work. When you do get leads 50% of them are declined, you are given the most bizarre reasons for this so building a customer base is virtually impossible as your hands are tied as to how you can advertise. Web based leads not shared out fairly."
10,Morses Club,Perfect for parents,2021-01-11,3.0,Customer Collections Agent,Easy to work around the kids,Pushing loans on to people knowing they couldn’t always pay it back
11,Morses Club,Expect  far too much,2021-01-10,3.0,Customer Relationship Manager,"Varied role, company car included in package",they want blood from you every day
12,Morses Club,Good company,2020-10-22,4.0,Customer Service,"Easy targets
Good team to work with",Poor communication between some departments
13,Morses Club,Great company,2020-02-29,5.0,Business Manager,"Very good working environment, well looked after in terms of pension company car free company shares each year","Salary is a little bit short of competitors, job training could be improved"
14,Morses Club,Avoid at all costs!,2019-11-02,1.0,Business Manager,Really struggle to think of a positive.,"Transferred over on a TUPE. Morses culture is very toxic, constant pressure and no direction. BM's are expected to work a lot more than contracted hours, deliver leaflets and managing agents is impossible as you are NOT a manager. Orders come down from hierarchy and you have to drop everything to focus on what ever Senior Management say but then face the consequences of not doing what your suppose to, you just cannot win. Constantly tracked either by tablet or company car, asked your whereabouts and what you've been doing.  FACTS: 75% of managers in my branch have left within the past 2 months not related to the TUPE. Over 65% agents left from my old company within 6 months, absolutly shocking company. Reached out to senior management, nothing back at all. No empathy or concern for staff just focused on exploiting you. Also not compliant with FCA Regulation. If profits are slumping - raise the interest, vulnerable customers are now paying 70% interest!"
15,Morses Club,Business Manager,2019-03-13,1.0,Business Manager,There were no pros to working with this company,"Company car may sound good but when the tax allowance comes into it you are worse off
AM idea of management  skills include, threats, bulling, over familiarity with female staff and sheer lack of knowledge of what the job actually entails 
Upper management- bulling is the norm , whole company has a culture of it, if you don't say yes to everything your wrong and bullied for it, even though once they have let the suggestions sink in they come back and agree with you 
Shout first for everything = lame apology while they steal your ideas as their own later 
Job on paper nothing like the job you are forced to do and 37.5 hours work is a fantasy no overtime no bonus anymore and the culture of petty gossiping and back stabbing is too much to handle 

HR have no interest in employee complaints and never follow these up with you once complaint has been made"
16,Morses Club,Great people!,2018-11-22,5.0,,"What I enjoy the most about Morses Club are the people. Everyone is approachable and friendly. Morses Club is a growing company, so sometimes there isn’t an answer for everything, which for me is great; it means I have the autonomy to try new things.","There is so much change going on in the company, you have to be someone who is flexible and adaptable and enjoy working in an ever changing environment. I sit in an open floor office which can sometimes be noisy too. It’s great for getting to know other teams and what they do though."
17,Morses Club,collector,2018-08-01,3.0,Collector,good hours nice people prompt payers,low pay to much red tape
18,Morses Club,Business manager,2018-02-06,1.0,Business Development Manager,"Company car, fuel card, laptop and phone. The pension and health care are excellent. There are no pros associated with the actual role and running of branches.",Poor senior management who use micro managing and bullying in a bid to get results. Would defiantly not recommend this as a place to work. The pay structure is poor and they try to get people in on as low salary as possible but expect you to be working 45-60 hours per week to complete all tasks associated with the role.
19,Morses Club,BIGGEST REGRET EVER,2018-01-23,1.0,Business Manager,Absolutely no Pro's to this job.,"Micromanagement, Bullying and Harassment seems to be acceptable here. Secret service behaviour from longer serving managers that lack common sense and seem to do everything that they can to sabotage other managers and agents. Bonus scheme is ridiculous they make allowances for some and not others. Pay is nowhere near what it should be considering the amount of paper pushing and spread sheets upon spread sheets you have to do.  Very little to no confidence in the ability of upper management in this region. no wonder its figures are so bad. Advice to anyone considering this company is to continue searching unless you want to be underpaid, over worked and get no thanks for it."
