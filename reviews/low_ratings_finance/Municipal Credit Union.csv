I enjoyed working for my direct supervisors as they were helpful and did not micromanage at least in the department I worked.","I'll preface it by saying there are too many to count, but I'm still grateful for their opportunity despite such a lousy workplace atmosphere and inefficient practices.  But here are a few cons I noticed in my short time there.

Initially, I should've been expecting a terrible workplace from what HR  requested during the hiring process; they wanted a copy of my bachelor's degree, tax records, and paystubs of my previous employers. Why all this for a job paying 40K per year?

The decor in the HR department is in the 21st century, while other departments looked lite years behind. The department I worked in, Loan Ops, was a dinosaur. The cubicles appeared to be from the 1970s-1980s. The air vents in the ceiling were dirty; the lighting was dim. Oh, and to go to the bathroom, you had to push and open EIGHT DOORS! No lie. From an operations standpoint, you would think an employer would look to facilitate productivity. Still, I'm not sure what the rationale is for this kind of layout in an area that wasn't readily available to members of this credit union. 

Finally, the good folks that work at the credit union I'm sure are lovely people, but their motivation was minimal, and these folks seemed only there to collect a pension before retiring and have a job in which you could go through the motions.

In essence, months into working here, the credit union was taken into conservatorship by NCUA, and it was easy to see how this operation faced such a fate. 

There were many other annoying inconveniences, but I'm sure no one has all day to go through them."

The new management are expected to know much and do all these changes and great things but they don't have a clue so they used all the experienced people as scapegoats and save themselves from looking worse than they already did.  Karma will come, just a matter of time.  I've seen bad, but honestly what came in is heading towards a train wreck.

There are all these lengthy pages of dress codes and silly rules. Like no sandals in the summer, I guess your feet can just be smelly and sweaty in 90 degree + weather in June.

They make you do new hire orientation which is upwards of 3.5 - 6 hours on your dime and time. Meaning they don't pay you for first day orientation. You have to take a drug test, a written assessment, an in person interview (maybe one, maybe two) and once you jump past all those hoops, you get the pleasure of burning a day at their ugly offices for free for new hire orientation. They don't even provide lunch.  
And then on your lunch hour on the day of new hire orientation, which they are not paying you for mind you, you have to take time out from lunch to get fingerprinted! 
But wait, there's more. After you've done all that you are assigned homework to complete which they offer to pay you for 90 mins of. So if it takes you longer, oh well.

The current managers there are rude and unpleasant and nasty for no reason. They will offer you $16 to work part time in the call center. They want you to dress up like this is a real job, but you are treated like dirt and paid garbage wages. You are also forced to join the union and pay union fees on a cheap salary of only $16 an hour.  The part time role comes with no benefits.

I know the job market is rough, but believe me when I say you can do better than working at MCU. Just believe in yourself, tough it out a bit and find something else. Don't do it to yourself, as you'll severely regret it."

I 100 % agree with the previous review about the company being a black mafia and I am black. There is no diversity in the company. The staff is very rude and angry and then try to pretend that MCU is one big happy family whenever they want to throw a company party. I never thought I would complain about a company party but there is one thrown atleast 2-3 times a year. Like what is the point of so many parties when there were no major accomplishments achieved. All the money they spend on those parties can be used to improve their systems which is very outdated. I worked in the Contact Center and will never work at another one again because of my negative experience.  The call volume is ridiciously high every day for no reason. Most of the members are ignorant, uneducated and can't even tell you the difference between a debit and credit card. Some of them will call 2-3 times in a day to ask the same questions. The staff in the other departments will take forever and a day to resolve the member issues and the contact center rep will have to deal with the member anger because the employee who is working on the member issue will ignore them. The lunches/ breaks are constantly cut to handle the call volume that never goes down. So now you are taking a 30 min break to speak with 80 minimum irate callers, its mental abuse. We are also forced to work every other Saturday and is told when to take vacation. You can't grow within the company because its so short staff everywhere the management can't afford to give up their employee to another department.  The turn over rate is astonishing. The older staff will tell you themselves they are suprised if a employee makes it past a year. I am elated I was able to move on and will never look back. I would rather work in the fast food industry then to ever go back there."

He threatened me because I was in the bathroom and came back 60 seconds, seconds late. Well I explained to him I wasn't well and I wasn't. He didn't care. I passed there stupid training with a 94.6% average. All training that had nothing to do with my job. I was in Mortgage. 
they are are antiquated Mortgage operations and treat members like garbage. Simply the way they talk and treat the members, yes, typical black in the street "" Click"" mentality. All led by their Vice President. Who honestly has never Originated a Mortgage Loan is not a Licensed Loan Officer or has true concept of the business. I've been around the Finance Industry for 31 years and I tell you, the pipeline was extremely backed up. They barely returned anxious members calls and outright live a comfort zone because they are Union protected. It's a typical "" lacksadasale"" Inner city black sense of entitlement approach. They had over 400 loans in the Pipeline and 3-4 Loan officers. 1 of which was out for some time. Anyone who goes to MCU and needs a Mortgage is asking for the next 90-180 days of hell. Un returned follow up, long unnecessary Underwriting and a very non technically savy operation. Go to Wells Fargo or respond to this message I'll do your loan 10x the speed they would.

82,Municipal Credit Union,Contact Center,2017-08-27,1.0,Contact Center Representative,"FIRST OFF let me start by saying this is THE WORST JOB I'VE EVER HAD 
I'll highlight the few pros (that aren't enoough to negate the cons) 
Benefits/ Pension/401k/ also the company is really big on hiring within and promoting current employees. HR offers a pretty extensive training opportunities so you will learn a lot about finance if you're willing to apply yourself. 

There are pretty good company sponsored events. They also offer incentives and bonuses. 

Lastly, there is a union so all you really have to do is show up on time to keep your job and you'll have a great chance of being promoted whenever you'd like.","OVERALL, the way the company operates is very archaic and strictly corporate. Very little room for suggestion. 

Working on the weekends is mandatory although they do pay OT. Sometimes you will have to stay late for various reasons. They cut lunch breaks and force you to use the bathroom on the floor of the dept in a 34 story building. Which just so happens to be the same floor that the staff cafeteria is located on.  

Management team members are very condescending. Training for new hires is often extremely confusing and not thorough (very touch & go) yet they expect you to know everything. There is an electronic manual on the intranet. However, its roughly 400 PAGES long w. no table of contents...........They are very lazy and only focused on keeping their jobs (most employees have been w/ the company for 10+ years & retire once again it's VERY EASY to keep a job here)  than having a successful dept.  Also, there is a union so unless you're just not showing up for work at all or on time it's virtually impossible to get fired.  

The members are very rude and disrespectful so if you're not a robot with any self-respect this is not a good position for you."

You will find a few seasoned employees who think you owe them something. THE worst attitudes and behavior I've ever witnessed that contaminates the whole work environment.
88,Municipal Credit Union,Loan officer,2016-10-19,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Full pension after 6 years,"Low salaries, the lowest salaries of the industry"
89,Municipal Credit Union,Call Center Team Leader,2016-07-15,1.0,Team Leader/Supervisor,After working for MCU for 7 years i can honestly say that i cannot think of a single positive thing to say,"Management has the tendency to cause more stress than the customers do. They do not support your decisions although they implore you to make them on your own. They micro manage to the point where you feel as if you are being targeted. Most people in management do not even know how to do their own jobs which is the reason they are so hell bent on constantly telling you how to do yours. They obsess over the abandonment rate in the call center, but the company doesn't seem to want to fix all the back end technical issues that cause people to call in in the first place. If you need help it is almost always impossible to reach anyone in back office department and most of the time when you are looking for the answer to a question the management staff in the contact center will not know the answer. They will tell you to call another department, when you explain they can't be reached they advice you to send an email even though your customer is in your phone patiently waiting for an answer.  It is honestly the worst place i have ever worked."
90,Municipal Credit Union,Contact center representative,2016-03-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,It is very stable employer. It has benefits vacation time .,Hard to advance. Feels like there was favoritism.
91,Municipal Credit Union,head teller,2016-02-29,1.0,Head Teller,they have lots of benefits for employees,1st their training sucks. they give you one week of training which consists of  two days to prepare for your first exam. you ask what will be on the test and they tell one thing and the test is something totally different. second test is done on the 3rd day and the 3rd test on the following day. I feel that if it was my money that i want handled correctly there should be more training. 2nd if I was hired as a Head Teller i should be training for a head teller position. The training class consisted of CSR's Call Center Reps etc. 3rd the pay sucks 15.94 for a supervisor position is down right disgusting.
92,Municipal Credit Union,Work environment,2016-01-11,1.0,Collection Representative,Job security salary is good,Growth and management work environment lacks uneducated managers and inexperienced supervisors
93,Municipal Credit Union,Card Services Representative,2015-11-26,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Love the fact that there is a union and the hours are pretty good.,"The members could be pretty tough to deal with. I also feel that there is not that much career mobility since most of the staff has been there close 10, 20 and even 30+ years. The work flow can be a bit excessive and overwhelming at times."
94,Municipal Credit Union,You've been warned,2015-11-06,2.0,Anonymous,"vacation time increases with tenure
health benefits package
free turkey during holiday
it can be for you depending which department you get hired with","low pay
uneducated managers. 
most of them don't have degrees, or barely went through a semester of college. 
the pay is a joke
ignorant, backstabbers, micromanagement. 
no opportunity for growth unless you build a personal relationship with higher management. 
the pay sucks
good luck with that since their views about employees are skewed anyway. 
hr doesn't help to build a healthy environment between employees and management which makes for a toxic workplace. 
you don't get paid enough to deal"
95,Municipal Credit Union,foot in the door,2015-10-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,great benefits and promotion,pay is below from other member services job.
96,Municipal Credit Union,Ok company,2015-10-14,2.0,Contact Center Representative,free food and more food,everything in the contact center
97,Municipal Credit Union,Great people & benefits,2015-10-08,4.0,Marketing Project Coordinator,"Benefits are excellent. Very intelligent people work here, and most employees have been here a very long time. Education assistance, an actual pension (which is great, if you stay 25+ years and retire here). Convenient headquarters location. Very flexible, allowed to work autonomously for the most part. Room for growth, especially cross-departmental.","Communication between departments can be poor. Pay is on the low side for NYC, and you may often be over-worked. Change takes a very, very long to occur. Projects involving multiple levels or departments can be extremely slow. Technology and policies are outdated. In general, the credit union's stated values don't necessarily align with the actions they take with its members."
98,Municipal Credit Union,Very Busy. Work independently. Took on many roles.,2015-10-06,4.0,Administrative Assistant to Vice President IT,"Company morale as far as perks go. Small ways of company appreciation I.e. Lunch, office games, prizes etc.","Usual office politics. When u exercise an exceptional work ethic, it can be held against you. Some may field threatened by your professionalism."
99,Municipal Credit Union,Exploitative Organization with little benefits,2015-09-02,2.0,Member Service Representative,"Great health and dental benefits. 
There are no risks of loosing your job for under-performance
Mostly friendly working environment  
Great 401k investment options for Employ plans","No long paid paternity leave, very short maternity leave
Non existent earnings for great performance
Most bonuses are issued based on seniority and not performance
Pathetic bonuses are issued at the end of the year and they get smaller and smaller
Nepotism is ripe on the upper management and back office personnel
All worthy positions and promotions are acquired also by extensive ass-kissing
Infrastructure in the branches is ""medieval"" at best. Computers are old and outdated, working desks provide no privacy between clients(like a welfare office).
Oh also the costumer base you deal with in this company is one of the most ignorant and wretched group of people you will have to deal with. Just like in an welfare office(actually they are mostly the same people anyway, no joke) .
The costumer service skills required to perform in this company have to be adaptable to a low IQ costumer base."
100,Municipal Credit Union,MSR,2015-08-04,1.0,,You get early leave for Holidays,"Pay is Extremely low 32,000 yr. for MSR but when asked other reps on the floor some salaries were lower. 8-4 leaves on time while 9-5 shift cannot leave until all calls are completely gone. Which means everyday you stay over and because it's very busy, you can be over 30mins or more everyday. Mind you this is not over time pay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The training instructor a male very rude to women. Supervisors and regular employees all train in the same class at the same time with the same information."
101,Municipal Credit Union,Only Executives Enjoy Working Here,2015-07-16,2.0,,Benefits and loyal people. The organization staff is very supportive and many of the staff members are very close.,"Leadership entrenched. Many of the executive leadership have worked at MCU their entire careers. No opportunity for advancement. Little empathy for line staff, or branch managers. Branch managers get promoted, get demoted, relocated, reassigned, without regard."

105,Municipal Credit Union,MSR,2015-04-23,2.0,Msr,I worked there for 4 years and the hours where good.  They are also unionized so you have someone backing you up when management tries to do wrong by their employees (and they do).  you also do not have sales goals which is good.,"Management is shady.  Pay is low, branches are understaffed, products are sub par no back office support to the branches."

The loan process is over 6 pages of steps and the ""Loan officers"" do NOT assists you in the process."
