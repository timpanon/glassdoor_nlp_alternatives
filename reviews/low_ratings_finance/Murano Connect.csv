An in-depth training program second to none!

You will work hard and be rewarded for your hard work.

Entrepreneurial and a growing company! 
An excellent work environment where there is not one day I feel like I am not supported.",I have none at all. Work hard and appreciate the opportunity that Murano have given you.
1,Murano Connect,Do Not Work Here,2021-12-22,1.0,Private Bank Investor Analyst,They may occasionally buy you lunch (once every few months) and we are talking a panini or burrito nothing over £10,"Management give you unrealistic targets and will micromanage you constantly. They listen to all your phonecalls. you have to source all of your leads yourself with 0 help.

Salary is terrible and staff turnover is high and you are expected to work early mornings and late nights. It is a sales role without any of the benefits. extremely low salary and no commission. The job is an absolute free for all. If you think this is an Investment sector job, think again. 

Most people can do this role, but not worth the effort. Just a waste of time"
2,Murano Connect,Snapshot,2021-09-07,2.0,Labourer,"Junior analysts are the most genuine, resilient, and hardworking people.","Pay below industry standards 
Personal development is not emphasized enough
Micromanagement and tight hours 
Repetitive work

Some disheartened/jaded employees who settled

3,Murano Connect,Significant exposure and trust,2021-08-10,5.0,Vice President,"- Senior sales role which comes with clear targets and expectations, and support to reach them.
- Significant opportunity for international travel, including high profile events and conferences.
- Freedom to create own prospecting plan and execute on it.
- Trust from senior management to be the 'front person' and lead on external relationship building, including daily opportunity to pitch directly to C-Suite executives. A level of exposure which would not be possible at a larger institution. 
- Commitment to further education, including financial and mentoring support through professional qualifications.
- Success based component means there is exponential opportunity to grow compensation for any self starting and motivated individual. 
- Inclusive and supportive culture, with all members of the team pitching in to help grow the business.","- Clear targets and expectations come, understandably, with the responsibility to meet them! Though that does lead to pressure to deliver, there is support from the wider team to get there."

I think that especially for analysts, making a lot of calls every day is hard, but it is a skill set that is transferable to every aspect of your life. You become fearless!","It's a pretty flat organization so there's not a lot of internal upward mobility after a few years, but you have a great springboard to apply for external positions for BD at a hedge fund."
5,Murano Connect,You have one life - don't waste it here,2021-07-20,1.0,Analyst,Free fruit? Some Pret croissants on a Friday?,"Where to begin... toxic culture, no learning opportunities, senior ""leadership"" will milk you for everything you have. You're better off working in a call centre"
6,Murano Connect,Difficult Task with good Learning Opportunities,2021-06-29,4.0,INvestor Analyst,Exposure to a large amount of information from financial services industry and you are able to listen to presentations from Fund managers. The owner treats his staff extremely well. Unfortunately the nature of the task (cold calling) puts management under strenuous delivery requirements and they have to place that on the employees. I would say that many of the reviews here are unnecessarily negative and Murano are honest about their requirements from the beginning. Great location.,Cold Calling is very difficult. No long term career progression opportunities at the company.
7,Murano Connect,Investments,2021-06-22,1.0,INvestor Analyst,No pros apart from location,Poor pay and bad stuff
8,Murano Connect,Thankless work,2021-02-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Career progression (Post Murano) - Gives you access to jobs not available before.,Soul destroying work for a management team that patronize you at every opportunity. The pay is absalutely shocking. The CEO makes Ebenezer Scrooge look generous.
9,Murano Connect,Working at Murano Connect,2021-01-13,4.0,Investment Analyst,Client facing time and opportunities to complete the CAIA certification.,Lack of flexibility surrounding days off.
10,Murano Connect,Delusions of Grandeur,2020-11-07,1.0,INvestor Analyst,"Unparalleled opportunity to memorise international dialling codes.

Usefully expanded my concept of tedium and despair.","Murano have the audacity to describe this role as financial journalism/research, which I can only assume is their idea of a joke. 

I felt the rhetoric from certain team members was deluded at best and unjustifiable arrogance at worst; either way, it was embarrassing to hear. 

Top and middle management wax lyrical on the now and future benefits of working for Murano, which appears to be their idea of a control tactic; it will probably take you about two weeks to consider those claims laughable in the extreme. Unfortunately, plenty of analysts on the floor seem to have internalised this ludicrous narrative. 

I think the reviews suggesting that Murano’s hiring policies are based on a sense of social responsibility, as opposed to finding cheap unskilled labour, are ignorant, stupid and/or disingenuous.

In short, refuse their job offer, steer clear and do something worthwhile instead."
11,Murano Connect,Great place to start a career.,2020-01-27,4.0,Analyst,"- Great exposure to an industry that is typically hard to access. This usually starts from day one. 

- Some incredibly smart staff members who offer support when needed. A lot of investment from senior management into their employees. 

- Room for progression. A lot of opportunities to be client-facing.

- Frequent presentations from fund managers/BD professionals, with a lot of opportunities to ask questions and learn best practices.

- Good exposure to all segments of the LP universe (from family offices to sovereign wealth funds), which presents opportunities to build a long-term network.

- Insight into LP asset allocation trends, which proves very valuable in future roles. This is evidenced by alumni who typically go on to fruitful careers in business development at either asset managers or funds. 

- A good company to build a fundamental knowledge of the alternatives industry, with opportunities to take qualifications (eg. CFA/CAIA/IMC).","- Work loads are frequently imbalanced, with some analysts being relied on to pick up the work of others.

- Cold calling element of the job is tough at the start and definitely filters out some potentially good employees. 

- The internal progression system is somewhat rigid and at the higher end it doesn't effectuate engagement from employees. 

- Salary is below industry standard."
12,Murano Connect,Institutional Investor was right!,2020-01-23,1.0,Analyst,"To call this place a boileroom/sweatshop insults all the other boiler rooms, sweatshops, and low rent telemarketers.  There are many easier and legitimate ways to make a living.","The CEO is a stammering, bloviating con-artist. Clients invariably drop the service soon after receiving their worthless leads, get wise to the con, and terminate their one-sided contracts."
13,Murano Connect,Ideal start to my career in asset management,2019-10-22,5.0,INvestor Analyst,"I worked at Murano for 2 years as an Investor Analyst. I am writing because I do not think some of the earlier reviews are very fair to the firm. It was only really on leaving Murano and joining an asset management company that I was able to fully appreciate the exposure I was able to get, from graduate entry level and throughout the analyst program, to an industry which is typically very hard to get into.
Murano hires a lot of recent graduates who have never even worked in an office before and so require a lot of training and development, but the analysts must equally themselves put in the hard work in order to make the most out of the role. It is a great entry point into the industry and perhaps the phone calling aspect is not for everybody but they are very clear about what the role entails during the recruitment process. 
The company grew significantly during my time there and so they were always building out new roles and infrastructure. The client base they have is of exceptionally high quality and growing all the time so I was able to meet a lot of senior people at blue chip companies. This is rare for a first or second job. I also understand they have really improved their training program over the last couple of years. 
I would recommend the analyst role to hard-working grads with a genuine interest in getting into the industry. It will get you a long way and you will reap the benefits for your next move.",A lot of the graduates hired have never worked in an office or corporate environment before. I do not think they appreciate the opportunity they have been given. They need to put in hard work themselves as they are entry level and work their way up.
14,Murano Connect,Great way to get your foot in the door,2019-10-21,5.0,Analyst,"-Great industry breakthrough opportunity
- Presentations given by funds   
-Management work at your pace of learning and understanding( you will have to be proactive).
-Perks (Roadshows, industry events & networking opportunities).","-Big amount of responsibility that one may find intimidating. 
-Pressured environment that can be challenging in the beginning."
15,Murano Connect,"Bad reputation, bad management",2019-08-22,1.0,Analyst,"If you fit the narrow profile, the camaraderie amongst the analysts is good. Potentially good exposure/exit opportunities but probably not more so than anywhere else.","As is a common theme in reviews: the management clearly operate in a different world. Total lack of effective communication and collaboration between management and analysts. The male:female ratio is very very embarrassing. You are allowed to operate within a very narrow capacity and stepping outside this is not only discouraged, it's punished. Pay is abysmal. Employee turnover is high and job satisfaction is very low."
16,Murano Connect,Poor Management.,2019-06-24,1.0,INvestor Analyst,-Training gives a good insight into the world of investment management if you are new to it.,"-cold calling aspect of the role
-poor management
-pay is lower than industry standards
-the company has no commitment to diversity. They need to employ more women, fix the diversity issues.
-there is no work life balance. You cannot take any time off during training 
-murano is known to have bad employee turnover
-you can't use the microwave in the office sometimes
-there is a weekly cleaning rota for each employee so you have to be prepared to clean especially taking bins out of both male and female toilets."
17,Murano Connect,cold calling,2019-06-11,1.0,INvestor Analyst,-presentations given by clients are quite interesting,"You need to cold call people. The training provided is not effective as the person who will be training you is a good analyst not a good trainer. Very high retention of staff as new starters are often not prepared appropriately for the calls. Employment is never secured as it is dependant on performance metrics. Some directors are focus on micromanaging employees, rather than letting them grow."
18,Murano Connect,Cold calling center,2019-05-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Trully useful if u want to break into cold
Calling",Not what they make you expect. Turnaround of employees extremely high only managers and receptionists stay instact
19,Murano Connect,Great opportunity - mismanaged,2019-04-30,4.0,INvestor Analyst,"Unbelievable exposure to normally insular industry. Great contact with top tier clients in the fund management industry and large investors (all the biggest Sovereign Wealth, Pension Fund, Private Bank and Asset Management Firms). A lot of responsibility early on, allowed to work fairly independently. Steep learning curve at the start - sink or swim/prove yourself culture.

If you are good at the role you become a relied upon resource by your clients and trusted consultant to investors.

The negative reviews are normally from slightly disgruntled employees, who failed to pass the training stage. Whilst there is some truth to them they should certainly be taken with a pinch of salt.","Pay is very low for industry. Micro management is rife. Although there is a lot of responsibility early on management want to monitor and control down everything. The KPIs and performance metrics are a bit arbitrary. After short time the progression plateaus, although management have made efforts to improve this. There is a cold calling element especially at the start."

-Zero Life in the office, the concept of ""FUN"" is non existent
-No incentives to keep employees motivates except for the tiny bonus that new starters will never see 
-No monetary increases after passing training (although they mislead you to think there will be)

The list is endless, if you know what's good for your mental health steer clear"
21,Murano Connect,just a cold calling center,2019-03-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"training provided to make cold calls, pretty stressful as your only task is to make calls good learning experience in case you want to move to customer service or call center",just wanted to clarify that this is a glorified calling center. All you have to do is 100 calls to random ppl every day. no experience on funds or finance whatsoever
22,Murano Connect,Investor Analyst,2017-10-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Quick learning curve into the Alternatives industry

- Exposure to some exceptional funds and managers who will present to the Analyst team

- They pay for the CAIA exam in full if you pass

- Some clever and friendly people work here","- Management is completely and utterly incapable of listening to criticism

- Management is completely disconnected from the Investor Analyst team

- Recruitment process is diabolical, leading to some poor hiring decisions

- Compensation is poor compared to industry standards"
23,Murano Connect,Murano Connect - Investor Analyst review,2017-09-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Multiple in-office presentations from some of the top-performing funds globally
Good exposure to the Hedge Fund & Private Equity space
Opportunities to manage your own clients in a relatively short time 
Good starting role for graduates looking to build a career in the alternatives sector
Option to sit the CAIA exams (fully funded unless you do not pass)
Cash bonus for the monthly top performer","Call trainer is awkward to talk to & does not like being approached for help
Phone lines are not always clear
Not much advice on how to source leads outside of the CRM
Guidelines and procedures could be made more clearer"
24,Murano Connect,Good stepping stone to the Alternatives industry,2016-12-10,4.0,Senior Analyst,"-Lots of exposure to many different Hedge Fund, Long Only and Private Equity strategies. So it is a great way to be introduced to the industry. Fund managers will often come to the firm to present their strategy, which is always fascinating. There is usually a 1-2 week crash course on the Alternatives industry at the beginning and there will always be the chance to ask fund managers questions.
-They fund the CAIA qualification which is an added bonus.
-After 1.5-2 years, (providing they are good and passionate about their role) analysts will have the opportunity to progress within the company or Murano can help facilitate them to move onto a fund.  I was very transparent about my objectives right from the start and Murano were very helpful in setting up interviews with their contacts (3 different interviews for me specifically). Around 50% of people who leave Murano do end up going to a work for a Hedge Fund (me being one of them) or Long Only Fund. Most of the other 50% are usually aiming for a different career path or the job was not a right fit for them.
-Very social and client facing role. The majority of time is spent on the phone to institutional investors and there is also a reasonable amount of client facing time after the analysts pass their probationary period.
-During my time there was a great culture where everyone was very helpful and we all got on exceptionally well.","- It is fair to say that the pay is below industry standards. If you are looking to have a comfortable income  straight away, this is not the role for you. I accepted the low pay as career progression and future pay is more important to me. I should also state that the pay definitely improves once promoted to become a Senior Analyst. 
- After a few months, it is really down to the analyst in terms of the amount they learn. It has been known that analysts ""plateau"" after a few months. That being said, the opportunity to continue learning is there for those who take it (ask fund managers questions and taking the CAIA for example), it is just not compulsory.
- The cold calling element at the beginning can be daunting. Interpersonal skills are vital for this role and Business Development/Investor Relations roles in the future."

26,Murano Connect,Sounded a lot better on paper than in reality,2016-06-22,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Contacting companies finding out about their investment criteria and objectives in terms of hedge fund strategies and matching this up with relevant funds. People join the company with the hope to start working for one of the funds down the road.,"Bad corporate culture and way of treating employees, very poor management."
27,Murano Connect,"Unique Learning/Networking Opportunity, Great People & Culture",2016-06-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Having worked in this industry for a number of years in various different roles including Equity Research, Credit Portfolio Management and Capital Introduction, I was pleased and surprised when I had my first conversation with the management at Murano. They were refreshingly honest and direct, but they were also very energetic and positive. They have expected a lot from me, but unlike other firms I have worked with I have the feeling that I am valued as both an individual and as part of a team rather then as a revenue-generating machine. 

This is a growing company, where you are expected to be self-motivated and accept responsibility for your work. As with most companies of this size, the benefits are that you feel like you actually make a difference and can see the impact of your work, you'll know the Founder of the company on a first-name basis and more importantly, he will know you. The management structure is very flat, and they value openness and honesty- if you have a problem with someone or something, you are able to directly address the issue.  

The company has a unique international flavor for an NYC-based finance company. From day one you will be interacting heavily with colleagues in London and clients from all over the world. The company definitely retains some of its ""European"" feel. The team is young, energetic and very cohesive. I would call everyone that works here my friend- something I certainly have not been able to say in previous roles. We all eat lunch together, go out after work and there is the general sense that we are all on the same page.

I would say the Salary/Benefits package is about standard for a relatively entry-level finance role in NYC. There is some incentive pay that is easily attainable if you meet some basic, easily quantifiable goals, with this included I would say the total compensation is on the higher-end of average for this type of role. However, the real benefits of the position are the relationships you are able to develop from day one. Right away you will interact with high-level individuals in the Hedge Fund, Private Equity, Real Estate, Long only and Real Asset spaces, as well as top contacts at some of the biggest institutional investors in the country. 

The culture of Murano and the opportunities presented by the role are probably best summed up by the fact that as the role isn't expected to be something you do forever, after being here for a couple of years the Founder of the company will actively work with you to find a new position at one of our clients in the Alternative Investment Fund business or with one of the Institutional investors we work with.","Having been in the business for a few years, my feeling is that most of the ""negatives"" of a particularly company/role are really a result of the wrong people working for the wrong company. This is a unique role that puts a lot of responsibility on your shoulders and certainly isn't for everyone...

- This isn't the right company for If you aren't comfortable being on the phone having in-depth conversations with very experienced and intelligent people, some of which may not know you or the company. You aren't ""cold calling"" people in the sense that we aren't selling anything, but you are expected to win contacts over to the concept of how we can help them and not everyone is receptive to it right away. Passive, shy and timid people should look elsewhere.

- This job isn't for you if you cannot work in a smaller, entrepreneurial office environment. The NYC office in particular is growing from relatively small numbers. You will work closely with other members of the team and it's not an environment where you can ""hide"" from your work because you're not up to it on a given day.

- This isn't the job for you if you are not ambitious and able to understand the value of gaining relationships and experience. Someone who isn't willing to work hard today for the chance at a big opportunities in 1.5-2 years isn't going to value the role.

- This isn't the right company for you if you are the type of person that needs to have a manager over your shoulder 24/7 to stay motivated and on task."
