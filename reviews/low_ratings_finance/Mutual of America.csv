Listen to their employees","Old fashion 
need to update with new world tech"
1,Mutual of America,Company is modern-day Titanic,2022-04-02,1.0,Business Analyst,"1. Excellent health benefits 
2. PTO Time
3. Pension Plan (for now - rumors are that it will be ""frozen"" in the near future)
4. Great Collaboration across groups
5. Employees and Middle Level Managers are pleasant to work with
6. Fully Remote during COVID19 and Hybrid after pandemic under control","1. Company has taken a drastic nose dive since the current CEO took over losing $ hand over fist. Look at company rating and how it has dropped in the past 5 years. 
2. Nepotism runs rampant and is both practiced and encouraged by the CEO himself. 
3. Company does not pay COLA. Some people have gone 10 + years without an increase. Awful situation when inflation at 40 year high and gas prices over $4.
4. Exceptional employees without nepotism behind them are not recognized and financially rewarded.   It's not what you know, it's who you know. 
5. There is a wide revolving door...people are leaving left and right and the company is not replacing them. The CEO expects employees to do ""more with less"" and quotes JFK when saying employees should think of doing for the company instead of thinking of themselves and providing for their families.
6. Several high-level initiatives going on simultaneously and are causing employees to be overwhelmed. Death spiral. People can't take it - they quit - are not replaced - their work is given to others who are already overwhelmed - and then another quits. Cycle is repeating at a quicker pace as time goes on.
7.  Employees are worked as mules. No appreciation for working 12 + hour days, nights, and weekends in order to meet extremely unrealistic deadlines. Employee Burnout has become the norm."

3,Mutual of America,Don't apply here,2022-03-25,2.0,Project Manager,You get medical benefits right away and pto + sick days,"Salary is a joke and not based on merit at all. In order to move up you have to be bros with the CEO. They also do not give increases to keep up with COL. There are people who have been working here for over 10years who still get paid an entry level salary!

My mental health has been compromised with this company let alone having to deal with misogyny and nepotism. This is a company dominated by non-BIPOC who don't care about their employees or their well being."

Wages will stagnate over time.

401k match is only 3%.  Mediocre to poor.

Then I was told I needed to take an additional insurance certification. I was told I had until the end of the year to complete. I was yelled at and belittled when I completed it in early December. There was no guidance or direction. Its a sales role which I enjoy but any resources given are outdated and not very helpful. I was so excited about this job but my soul was crushed after I realized there was no help in sight.
10,Mutual of America,Solid Company,2022-02-03,4.0,Group Account Representative,The pay goes up quickly if you perform well and the benefits package is pretty good.,"These guys are behind on the new child leave benefit.

11,Mutual of America,Nepotism + Woke = Horrible work environment,2022-01-14,1.0,Participant Account Representative,Building relationships among the groups was very rewarding professionally and personally.,"Micromanaging and blame shifting leads to a culture of undercutting and playing favorites. Zero training on antiquated systems that are not updated with correct information. Front line employees are held responsible for previous lies told to clients by management when the clients expectations are not met. Was told that the clients perception makes thier statement true.

The company wants to to achieve your goals, but if you have a down year, you're head's not on a chopping block. If you work in a producing office your bonus could be substantial ($35k+) my largest bonus was $45k. Base pay is OK but $5k/yr raises are the norm if you hit sales goals. Decent products for the clients they regularly service - mainly non-profit employees with modest incomes. Incentive trips are second to none - spare no expense.","If you're in a non-producing office, this can reduce your bonus. Technology is lacking. More of a transactional position vs building relationships. Not dealing with the most sophisticated of investors can be frustrating - expect a lot of panic selling calls during a market downturn. The only path for substantial income growth is through a management track. Products are not designed for clients with any real $$$. High fees for a limited menu of funds that you're ""not supposed to give advice on."""

Change control software doesn't work and upper management refuses to improve or replace it. No modern development methodologies like DevOps, CI, or Agile. Culture of political optics, blame, and gaslighting employees. Low wall cubicles have no privacy. No documentation on custom software products. No tiered software support levels. New CEO is out of touch. Devs have to work even when they are ill. The facility is in disrepair. Time theft is rampant. There is so much technical debt it is unsurmountable by current staff levels.

With the new CEO I thought things would improve. Instead they have only gotten worse. Nepotism runs rampant and the company is bias against women.  They punish employees who speak up so keep quiet.  If the company cared about their employees they would read these reviews and do something. I've attended a few anniversary lunches for employees and the CEO uses them as arena to talk about himself  and his love and more love for football which he also does at company lunches. He has no respect from employees.  Management is useless and looks out at for themselves. Employees who don't perform and should be let go are kept which causes resentment among their co workers who are told they have to pick up the slack.  There is no accountability. On a scale  from 1 to 10 .. moral is a 1.

No women in a position of authority making company-wide decisions and less than you can count on one hand running regional offices.

High turnover as employees realize there are better companies and opportunities elsewhere. Clients are understandably unhappy to hear about representatives and management leaving.

Average salary for this position elsewhere is higher. Mutual of America does not pay as much, because they say they make up for it with benefits. Most managers and leaders are good to work for, but there are some really terrible ones.

The Executive Vice President of the Office Of Technology and the MIS departments is the CEO's wife which is bad is every which way. I'm not sure how the Board of Directors can allow this.  
   
Hard work, dedication and loyalty are meaningless. No annual raises or cost of living. You annual salary is based on your title. There are no grades within a title/position. Therefore everyone who is a Senior Business Analyst is paid the same. The ONLY time you pay is increased is if you are promoted.

Problem number 1: No one has ever hear of Mutual of America. 
Problem number 2: Cold Calling for retirement plans is in no way a viable marketing plan.  It is both naive and completely unrealistic to think that cold calling is an effective methodology for obtaining conversion plan business.  Relationship leverage is the key to consistent penetration in the 401(k)/403(b) conversion market and Mutual of America has no meaningful relationships of which they can leverage- No alternative products to cross sell off of, no broker relationships to build off of, and no direct marketing that produces significant leads.  They just don't get it:  One needs to spend money to make money.
 Problem number 3:  Mutual of America has field offices that are grossly understaffed to handle the demands of their EXISTING client base let alone any new clients.  For example for an entire state in the metro east area there are only 2 customer service representatives.  THAT'S RIGHT: 2!   The Group Account Representatives/Consultants (Get this) are expected to handle:
A sales quota/terminations/amendments/implementation/tax forms and other inappropriate requests which deter a Group Consultant from ever achieving their sales quota..  No one in this business and I mean NO REAL player in this business handles things in this manner.  There are always separate departments for every non sales related task.
