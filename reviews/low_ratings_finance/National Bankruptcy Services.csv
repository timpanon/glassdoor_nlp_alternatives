They will work you like a dog and make it known that staff reductions are normal there to push processors to work harder.

If I could give zero stars I would but it won't let me.,2017-05-11,1.0,,I can't think of any pros at the moment other than I got paid.,Below standard pay. Theft of personal belongings. Parking is terrible. Training is with multiple people and you have multiple ways of being taught to do things. No Policies and Procedures guide for jobs and no job aids unless you attempt to create it yourself from the many ways of doing one job. Worst career move ever.

36,National Bankruptcy Services,It is what you make it.,2017-05-11,4.0,Bankruptcy Specialist,"Location is excellent. The building has a nice Gym you can access for free as an NBS employee. There is an on site cafe that has a full grill menu, salad bar, pasta bar, and specials every day.  I love the team I work with and can tell there are many other tight knit work groups in other Departments as well.  HR is good about consistently advocating for the employees and have been able to make some improvements to the moral and retention recently. Benefits are reasonable and the company contributes to employee HSA.",Training is inconsistent across the departments.  Some managers and supervisors have put a great deal of effort into their training and are excellent but other teams suffer dramatically. There is no 401K Match or tuition reimbursement.
37,National Bankruptcy Services,Not Worth It,2017-05-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Some managers will work with you if you have personal issues you need to take time off for.,"No training. Inexperienced and poor management who are usually friends, relatives, or business contacts. It is very obvious they aren't selected for their management skills.  Annual budget cuts are conducted to eliminate higher, more skilled, and more experienced employees so executives can give themselves bonuses."
38,National Bankruptcy Services,Worst Work Environment,2017-05-04,1.0,Bankruptcy Auditor,There are no pros to working at NBS. There are never any team bonding activities. It's all about work and no fun at all.,"This is directly about the West Des Moines office. NBS makes you feel like you're worthless and your opinion does not matter. Management could care less about keeping employees around which is why there is such a huge turnover rate. Management does not support their teams and help them become successful. You're constantly over worked and if you ask for any time off, even in advance, their response will always be ""you have to hit your goal to earn that time off"". Management can be overheard talking poorly about other employees constantly, which makes you feel even more worthless of a person. Management, specifically the SVP, should be replaced. She does nothing but demand people make their goals even if that means sacrificing a work/life balance. I am thankful I was able to get out of there and gain a new employer who values my hard work and dedication and treats me with respect. Beware of working in such a terrible environment."
39,National Bankruptcy Services,DO NOT TRUST HUMAN RESOURCES,2017-05-04,1.0,Foreclosure Specialist,"There are no pros for NBS, RUN THE OTHER WAY","Do not trust human resources for anything. They blatantly violated their open door policy for the sake of not paying a week of vacation time. They do not care about their employees and will run to your manager with anything you tell them. Watch out HR, you're about to have a serious law suit on your hands."
40,National Bankruptcy Services,Great place to work,2017-05-02,4.0,Management,"The moral is good, the upper management is great.  Communication is always clear and the expectations are realistic. Flexible schedules",any company match in the 401K would be a plus
41,National Bankruptcy Services,Great Place to Work,2017-05-01,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Personnel within the company, from HR to managers to executives, have an open door policy. It feels good to realize your valid concerns will not only be heard but will be addressed. Plenty of room for growth. Diverse atmosphere. PTO awarded on day one.",Does not match 401K or have tuition reimbursement. Should have a classroom training about the nature of the company as a whole.
42,National Bankruptcy Services,Employee Morale lacking,2017-05-01,3.0,Manager,"My experience with NBS has overall been positive as I've been able to prove myself and advance within the company. For the most part, the other employees that I've been able to work with have been friendly and helpful and it seems that people are trying to do a good job.","From both an entry level and management employee perspective, the company itself does little to promote a positive work experience or good employee morale. As an hourly administrator, the management that was in place at the time did not work actively to promote a positive workplace. For my employees I do try to work hard on this but it seems as though their perspective is that the company does not care for them. The fact that it is May 1st and the budget/merit increases have not yet been approved is a pretty obvious example. People are at the point where they just shrug this sort of thing off as ‘typical’ of the company."
43,National Bankruptcy Services,Poor Management,2017-04-27,2.0,Operations Supervisor,Most of the people are easy to work with.,"Poor management, low salaries, high work flow. Unorganized training and structure."

No room for advancement"
45,National Bankruptcy Services,"Think long, hard, and twice before before you step into this toxic place",2017-04-19,1.0,IT Analyst,I'll come back and make sure to edit this review if I come across any before I leave. I'd love to walk away with one good thing from NBS so I don't completely regret this career decision.,"Let's see where do I start!? This place is toxic. They will break your spirit and crush you so bad you'll need therapy. I can't believe I'm still here but not for long. 

1. Incompetent management with zero leadership skills. Most of them are actually very unprofessional, rude, and condescending. 
2. The worst technology and applications I have ever seen; full of bugs and defects which have gone unaddressed for ages. 
3. The bureaucratic company culture has bled into employees beyond salvage and you can't get anything done. You are surrounded by colleagues who literally come to work and leave without accomplishing a single thing and are perfectly okay with it. Colleagues with no drive or passion, simply put they just aren't bright. Bright employees either don't stick around or get fired for not tolerating the abuse. Management will criticizes you for your lack of ambition but will do nothing to empower you or help you grow and be successful.
4. HR is not on your side, whatever you do, DO NOT trust HR at NBS. 
5. Management will humiliate you in ways you can't even imagine. They will question your work ethics, livelihood, and integrity with no shame. They'll monitor your every move and punish you like you're a child. The micromanaging is out of control.
6. Team, managers, departments operate in silos and get nothing done.
7. Nepotism here is worst than I've ever witnessed anywhere else in my 10 years of professional experience.
8. From day one are set up to FAIL; once you join you have approximately 4 weeks to LEARN EVERYTHING. However, don't expect any training. Oh and if you aren't all caught up in that 4 week period, you will most likely be let go. No action plan to improve performance or coaching. They will just straight up pull you aside and say goodbye. 
9. You are not compensated well for everything you have to put up with. Below market pay, health benefits are awful with high deductible plans, PTO is low. 

In Short, please do not join this company if you have any self respect and ambition. On the other hand this place is perfect you if you want to be humiliated and poorly compensated."
46,National Bankruptcy Services,Run while you can,2017-04-04,1.0,Bankruptcy Auditor,"The only pro is being able to listen to music, which should be expected with the work you're doing. Nothing to help further your career. I worked at the West Des Moines location.","Where to start. Micromanagement is the name of the game here. Training is poor. You'll be told training is 6 - 8 weeks when in reality it will be 3 -4. Half of the time the trainer will talk about their own personal life. They care more about favoritism. It doesn't matter if you're constantly hitting your numbers for production. They always expect more for a poor salary. With that in mind. Don't think about asking for a promotion. They'll give you $0.25 or put it off for another 6 months. Any email from management is condescending and does not provide constructive criticism. Management communicates through email and will be unprofessional. If you stay late you will overhear management talk horribly about the employees. Benefits are overpriced for what you get. Overall, worst job I've ever had."

52,National Bankruptcy Services,Not good but not bad,2017-01-25,3.0,Bankruptcy Audit Clerk !,Work is mostly done independently. Can have headphones in if you want.,"Management constantly breathes down your neck for results. It doesn't matter how much production was done in the preceding days, if you fall even a little behind, you hear about it. E-mail communication from management could get a bit condescending."
53,National Bankruptcy Services,RUN!!!,2017-01-22,1.0,Bankruptcy Auditor,"That I final got wise and walked out and turned in my badge.   Rather than make you feel valued, they go out of their way to single people out and make feel like a nobody.","Worked at the West Des Moines location and this is the worst job I have ever had. The training is terrible!! If you are willing to sit during training period and listen to the trainer tell stories about their personal life most of the day but be expected to know what the hell you are doing when u hit the floor, this is the right job for you. This place discourage interaction with peers and you get reprimanded if you seek help from your peers. Trainers are overworked and stretched thin, mind you. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Very hostile work environment and favoritism is very common. 
PLEASE, don't waste your time!!!!"
54,National Bankruptcy Services,Not Good,2017-01-19,1.0,Bankruptcy Auditor,You are not micro-managed. Smaller corporate environment. Workload is heavy perhaps giving some longevity.,"I was at the West Des Moines, IA NBS location.
Although the training staff / management is spread extremely thin based off of span of control, the new hires coming in off the streets are not getting the training needed to do their job in an accurate and timely manner. They provide a visual example on overhead projection system of the audit process. They break the audit into different sections. One example is provided, and then trainees are sent to their desk to do on their own. The trainers or managers never come around to see if their are questions, and if you go to them to ask, you're lucky if they get back to you before the end of the day.  Zero flexibility, and unfriendly environment. Worst place I have ever been employed."

- Poor management, communication is terrible. 
I have worked here over a year and have never seen the CEO. I have also never even spoken to the VP who works in the same building as me! I would think for a company so small you could at least take the time to meet your employees, and step off of your high horse for a few minutes to speak to those who make it possible for you to sit in your tower.
- No bonuses or employee gratitude shown from management or the company (I've been here a year and we had lunch bought for us one time after a special project, and that was only for a select group) the whole office morale is beyond words."

A lot of favoritism with those that suck up. They wouldn't hire anyone and instead throw a 3 person workload onto 1 person. The pay was a joke. In 2014 everyone was given a 25 cent raise. This company is a joke and won't go anywhere fast.

No matter how hard you work you will never get praise.
Management seems to lead you on and dangle an unattainable carrot in front of your face to keep you on, however none of their promises for advancement opportunities ever come to fruition.
I use to love this place and had such high hopes for my future here, however the low moral that floods this office and empty promises have made me dread coming to work on a daily basis.
Needless to say, I am looking for something better where I am allowed to get out of my seat more than twice a day for a fifteen minute break and able to chat with my neighbor every once and a while to bring some light to this horrible place."

Overtime is where you make your money.,"No reviews, (it took 2 years for 1 review that was supposed to have happened) Too many ""buddies"" brought in to be management to ""fix"" the problems and they just created more work. There was no work life balance. If you wanted to stay on top of your work load, you worked evenings and weekend. And even then, that was never enough. 
No room for advancement, people would throw you under the bus to save their own skin faster than you can say HI. And the ethics used by some of the attorneys was less than stellar.  Once the management that is in place now took over, they started to run that firm into the ground."

Senior managements focus on month goals only, has lost the overall appeal of what the company values were.  They lost focus on their number 1 asset, their employees.  Due to that loss, everyone loses."

83,National Bankruptcy Services,Current Investors and executives are slowly destroying a once viable company,2014-05-11,2.0,Portfolio Administrator,"At one time, opportunities existed for knowledgeable and loyal employees to advance.  Employees learn a lot about bankruptcy.","Upper management and investors have laid off so many knowledgeable employees that the business cannot possibly rebound from financial troubles fast enough to save itself.  It will be years before remaining employees are able to replace the experts that have disappeared.  Considering the executives that are left only promote back-stabbing, lying white males to prominent positions, most people currently employed don't qualify for any prominent positions anyway. The executives are so hung up on themselves and people who are just like them that the business will eventually implode.  Employees that are left cannot keep up with the work, so the work keeps disappearing.  Clients are leaving.  Eventually, we won't need any employees."
84,National Bankruptcy Services,"Long Hours, Horrible Turnover Rate and too much work to do in one day but required to do.",2014-04-10,2.0,Login/POC Administrator,Pay is ok along with annual raises and ok benefits.  MOST co-workers are awesome,"Management don't know what or want to listen or learn what you do but expect so much to be done in an unreasonable time, no communication with clients, management or some associates so everything is always all over the place.  The lack of communication ALWAYS causes ""Special Projects"" that take you away from your own pile of work and its something that could have been avoided had they just listened to their employees ""the ones that are doing the work"" the first time.  No room for growth unless you kissing butt cause working YOUR butt off don't count, you have about 10 different bosses telling you to do different things and they have horrible training techniques.  Management talks crazy about you to other associates so its messy all the way to the top.  Also, back stabbing employees to get to the top.  They don't want you to learn the ins and outs of the business they just want you to get the work done and expect you to work till midnight or 1am to do it towards the end of the month at times.  If you just need money and want to sit down at a computer all day without talking to customers, work here but look for something else real soon."

89,National Bankruptcy Services,NBS,2013-09-07,1.0,Bankruptcy Analyst,You can gain some good experience.,"Managers spend more time trying to cut corners than actually getting work done.  The culture does not support people who work hard and want to make an impact but supports a culture of hiring and promoting friends and people who are well liked.  After a layoff, the company does not allow employees to gather belongings, instead HR cleans the desk and arranges a time to pick them up, but usually vultures will pick items clean before that happens.  The location is in a questionable area, and the office itself is dirty.  Everyone is overworked and there is no training provided to employees.  The systems are outdated and inefficient and the the company does not appreciate its employees.  Layoffs are a common occurrence and happen about every four months because the company has trouble retaining its clients."
