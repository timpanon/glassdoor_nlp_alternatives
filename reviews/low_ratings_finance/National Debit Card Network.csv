0,National Debit Card Network,Not Good,2016-12-19,1.0,Sales Representative,None that I can think of.,"Was hired by VOLT Payments, then found out I was working for National Debit Card Network...bait and switch. Very little training and provided appointments never happened. Spent money on business cards and 6 hours in training with nothing to show for it.  Do your research on these guys and their other business connections. Be smarter than I was and look elsewhere for employment."
1,National Debit Card Network,The whole system is so unprofessional,2016-11-19,1.0,,You get about 10.50 a hour,You will get yelled at and threatened with the lost of your employment if you don't meet quota. The supervisors are so unprofessional . And it's not a happy place to work at all. This place is always hiring because people are always quitting
2,National Debit Card Network,waste of time and money,2016-09-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,the preset appts was a plus,you burn up gas for $100 deals. lied about pay
3,National Debit Card Network,Regional Sales Executive,2016-09-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great Income Potential at this company, with the life time residual and upfront paid commissions its easy to grow financially quick. Also hours are great , M-F from 9-5. The 3-5 warm to hot a appoints is a huge perk as well.","Not to many here,  giving free equipment to customers can effect a larger commission sometimes ."
4,National Debit Card Network,"Good salary, generous commissions, reliable residual income",2016-09-02,5.0,,"Good Salary, generous residuals, reliable residual income. Safe and ethical work environment. Good 401K, benefits and discounts. Encouragement for growth and mentoring","without salary, your commissions are up to you. You choose how big your bonus/ commission/ residual income figure is"
5,National Debit Card Network,Terrible experience. Stay away!!,2016-08-06,1.0,Sales,The only Pros here are all the negative comments below. All negative comments or head on. Make sure you read all comments.,All of the positive comments on this company appears  to be internal. Definitely a burn churn company. The company comes across professional at first then disappears.
6,National Debit Card Network,Sales,2016-04-16,1.0,,"Pay on time
Initially work/support you, but then drop off","1. didn't send me a 1099.
2. Churn and burn operation
3. Say anything to get the deal
4. Couldn't handle big, major deals. 
5. Guaranteed appts, 90% of which were fish hooked by the gills - you show up and the merchant has no idea what you're doing there, or they were wackos pulling your chain
6. If you didn't go out and get/sell your own leads, you were cut off from appts.
7. Buy your own bus cards, support material."
7,National Debit Card Network,A good place to work (if you're willing to put in the effort),2016-03-25,5.0,Customer Service,"There is opportunity for growth and advancement which I have seen and taken advantage of.  I have always been well taken care of if I have ever needed time off or adjusting schedule to fit needs.  Good workers are recognized for their contributions.  I have seen many suggestions (some of my own as well as other people) implemented for the betterment of the company.  It is also a very friendly atmosphere, which sometimes even has a family feel to it.","The wages, while competitive, could always be higher.  However, that could be as much a function of the economy as anything else."
8,National Debit Card Network,Overall - A Great Company To Work For!!,2016-03-11,5.0,Floor Manager,"When all the gears from the top down run smoothly together, it makes for an efficient, well oiled machine. That's exactly what we have here. The TM's are well trained, knowledgeable about our services and work well with each other to constantly help when new hires are struggling. The management team goes above and beyond to ensure that each appointment we set is a solid sales opportunity for the field reps. We don't lie to or mislead merchants, and at the end of the day we do exactly what we say we do. The transparency between our office and the New York Corporate office are second to none. On any given day, our TM's can reach our corporate officers immediately if they have an issue that in-house management can't handle; which is rare if not non-existent. The office hours are a breeze too, which still allows plenty of time for families and outside activities. Besides all this, our TM's walk out the door every day with incentive cash in hand! What else can I say? National Debit Card Network is an awesome place to work for and I'm happy I put my application in almost four years ago. It's a great opportunity for anyone who can take the guidance given.","There are no cons, with the exception that former employees who couldn't produce and ultimately were either terminated or resigned can leave bad reviews."
9,National Debit Card Network,A Great Place To Work,2016-02-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have worked for the operations division for 8 years, and can genuinely say I have enjoyed the experience.

I also love their monthly pot lucks, and community involvement programs.   

I have worked at many companies over the years, and can truly say that National Debit Card Network does more for their employees and customers than most other companies.

The staff is friendly and always helpful, and I feel empowered to make decisions 

As an employee I am constantly learning (even after all of these years), and there is no shortage of mentors to learn from.   

The pay is competitive and the benefits package is robust.","In my experience, I have not identified any negatives to working at National Debit Card Network, so I don't really have anything to report here."
10,National Debit Card Network,"Stay away, it's a giant scam",2015-11-24,1.0,,They provide good training and insight into the business where you can close a deal,"After closing a deal,  good luck getting paid on it in a timely fashion.  They give you one run around after another on when you'll get paid and how much.  It's just shady tactics and when you call them on it they terminate your agreement like its nothing.  They don't care about your bills and obligations but expect you to just shell out your own money to be able to do your job out there.  Hell they even charge you to print up business cards."
11,National Debit Card Network,BEEN HERE 3 YEARS - WOULDN'T THINK OF SWITCHING,2015-11-12,5.0,Sales,"This is an excellent company to work for!   They have a real family environment with a strong corporate culture.  I have seen quite a few talented individuals start off in our call center and been promoted to sales and merchant support positions.    It’s important to know that is you work hard and produce, you will be rewarded.  Happened to me personally several times.  Executive team is very loyal to their employees which is not the case in many companies in today’s environment.   I would highly recommend to anyone seeking a career with strong growth potential in a company that is financially sound and offers excellent support.  My regional manager is a phone call away and is a huge help when the merchant has questions.","Like any competitive industry, you have to attend the advanced training classes, seek the help of your manager in closing deals when needed, look at your portal to check for any requests from your customers and keep your manager updated on the outcome of each appointment you have."
12,National Debit Card Network,Best Merchant Processing Company I have worked for,2015-11-10,5.0,Regional Manager,"National Debit Card is the most classy, well managed organization I have worked for. They do things the right way here. Their most important assets, their employees, are well compensated and given all the tools necessary to succeed. Their handling of their customers is second to none. They are responsive and always helpful. Merchants want to stay using us for their processing needs and employees want nothing more than making a long term successful career here.",I have yet to see anything that would make me want to put a single negative word here.
13,National Debit Card Network,"Great company, great culture!",2015-11-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great people in a good environment.  There is a tremendous amount of support here and everyone works together toward the same goal.,There are no cons to this position.  I earn a base salary with a great residual plan.
14,National Debit Card Network,Horrible stay away!,2015-09-21,1.0,Appointment Setter,They're are no good reasons that validate working for this place. Under new management means nothing. It's awful.,I cant't say enough about the poor management. It's a terrible place to work for. No opportunities for improvement or extra hours.
15,National Debit Card Network,Fake and full of lies.,2015-08-01,1.0,Contractor,Never had such a bad experience working with a company as i had with this one. They work for Global payments but say that they have their own network. Liar's.,The worst experience of my life in the worst company ever. Forced appointment. People say no when you arrive.
16,National Debit Card Network,Not good.,2015-04-14,1.0,,70% of the leads are good.  Good back up team.,"Only the first week I got 3 to 4 leads per day. After that 1 lead and far away from my home address.  They can be rude too.  They will not provide any car allowance or cover expenses.  The commission that you get pay in reality is coming from the leasing company or deduct from the merchant's bank account when you charge them an application fee.  You can not provide free equipment and if you do, you have to pay for the equipment. 
You will not make enough money with this company.  Maybe $1000 a month.  Conference calls: they want you to attend a 2 hrs conference call, after hours.  Those calls are terrible and a waste of time.  And if you don't attend those calls they won't send you leads as a punishment."
17,National Debit Card Network,STAY AWAY!!!  SHAM!!!,2014-12-24,1.0,Sales Representative,None that I can even think of!!!,"I was recruited by a very polished individual who told me that I can expect to make between 50K to 60K just with the leads that are provided by the company taking into consideration a 20 percent client retention rate.  I was initially told that I would receive 2 to 4 real client leads per day.  That in fact did occur within the first 3 weeks.  Then the quality of the leads decreased as well as the amount of leads, to the extent that I finally was receiving no leads on some days.  But the straw that broke the camel's back for me was when I received my first residual commission check which was no more than the cost of a happy meal.  And that was based on 4 well generating merchants.  I never received any merchant accounting in advance of my residual deposit.  No transparency!!  Not worth your time!!  Stay away!!!  This business is a sham!!"
18,National Debit Card Network,Great company to be employed.,2014-09-23,5.0,Sales,"working for this company is like working in a well oiled machine. From top to bottom this company has all the tools to make a work place wonderful. The management is fair and understanding yet stern and honest. The employees are a direct reflection of the ,management which makes for a great and well tuned company to work for. My experiences working here is one of the best work environments of any company I have been employed.",I cannot speak of any cons that are able to write about due to the companies cunningness and due dilligence to take care of in house issues.
19,National Debit Card Network,great place to work,2014-09-23,4.0,Anonymous Employee,managers are very helpful and knowledgeable. co-works are friendly and are always willing to help. to me its a great company to work for,none to really talk about i enjoy coming to work everyday
