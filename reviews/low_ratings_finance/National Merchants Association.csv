If I could give it zero stars, I would. It is a toxic environment where even the most authentic people can get caught up in the problems with inexperienced and immature leadership."

Free avocados and free (bottom-shelf) wine.,"This place was so terrible. We laid off more than 200 people while I worked there… which was only about two years. The number of times a new exec was brought in only to be fired after moving their entire life was insane. The wedding of a C-Suite member was billed as an event for tax and expense purposes. And said member invited media and agents so it could be written off. This place is incestuous. It’s gross. The marketing team is periodically asked to write reviews on various sites (including here) and asked to write tabloid like stories about NNA and competitors.

There were times the checks didn’t clear… then they were late. Then, they were late AND didn’t clear."

It's a very merit-based organization – do a great job and you'll be greatly valued by the leadership team.

The payments industry is massive and growing explosively, and the NMA leadership team has found a niche that we can serve exceptionally well, and that can propel us to continued growth. Effective execution toward well-defined strategy helped us make the Inc. 5000 list twice, and it will help us reach even higher goals in the future.

If you're the type of person that wants to hang out, not rock the boat, and collect a paycheck, you will not like it here (as you'll see from other reviews). But if you're not afraid to have an opinion, if you want to work hard and be rewarded for it, and take responsibility for your role, you have an unlimited opportunity to succeed.","Because it's a fast-growing company, some people struggle with ambiguity and shifting responsibilities. You do need a high tolerance for change and a high level of flexibility to be successful here."

Every week we scrambled to find money to pay the outrageous amount of bills. During my time there, hundreds of thousands of dollars were put on credit cards that the company did not intend to pay back. I don't know how they continue to operate and why the state of California has not held them liable for the amount of layoffs they have each year.  Their business practice is they hire employees and then lay them off within months after their hire date. So beware and don't fall for the ""smoke and mirrors"". They appear to have money, but in truth, employees are lucky to be paid."

They say that employees were fired when they left on their own terms due to the companies downward spiral. You are treated extremely terribly for putting your family first because you NEED to pay your bills. Every employee that has decided to leave has been embarrassed in front of co-workers simply just for putting their two weeks in because the company is dwindling.  Perfect reviews pop up when negative reviews are brought to managements attention on SOCIAL MEDIA.  Read through all the negative comments, you will notice everyone's review is either REALLY bad or REALLY good, and the really good ones are far and few... so it's no surprise that they are coming from management."

Great coffee.","The CEO has hired great people, but she never listens to them. She's had two great CFO's who saw where the company was going and recommended ways to save the company but were ignored. The CEO had to hire people and spend money right up until the moment she finally was convinced she needed to fire people. She needlessly filled the company with lots of employees, only to have put lots of people on unemployment.  I think part of why she had to do that was she spent company money on her wedding and on her horse ranch and winery instead of focusing on saving her business and listening to her C-level advisors like her CFO's and others."

-Environment which you feel afraid to lose job at any moment

-Inconsistent in promotions and terminations (Ive seen team members fired for poor attendance and team members promoted with worse attendance)

-Demotivating environment because nothing is merit based and career paths are not clear

-Company does not predict change well. So you are consistently putting out fires, focusing on retention and minimizing attrition, rather than growth.

-Startup company trying to be put on corporate pants

-Shaky foundation with people elevated to positions they have no experience in. Feels like everyone is just treading water

-No accountability for performance. Just politics. Some sales people have terrible numbers, but are paid well because of politics.  Its like two wolves and a sheep deciding whats for dinner.

-The best people leave because they see their hard work being wasted and no growth opportunities.

-When you put in your two weeks notice you are usually terminated the same day and not paid for the two weeks. So burn your sick time before leaving and put in your two weeks on a payday."

There are Managers and Directors should be fired for harassment! Document people! I really wish the CEO would take a better look how she has running her company. She is a very smart woman! To her,  take a look at the departments that have the highest turnovers! The attorney has to fire everyone.  When they fire you there is no reason given due to the At Will Contact they make you sign.

The company jumped on the nutraceutical bandwagon (basically companies that sell fake pills/products and take advantage of dumb consumers) when no other bank/payments company was willing to work with these types of companies. Because these companies screw consumers, NMA screws them by charging them 6%, 7%, and 8% + on credit card fees. Because they are one of the only companies that will deal with these types of companies, they make a freaking ton of money. However, they have spent like crazy almost all of that money in an attempt to try and ""catch up"" to other players in the payments space by creating a more stable company. They have been VERY VERY unsuccessful and will likely be out of business in the next 12 months. They regularly do corrupt practices and are constantly making unethical decisions and being dishonest with their agents and partners. This is the most unethical company I have ever worked for. The employees (even the great ones) feel like they could be fired at any moment and the executive team has little respect for the employees and take literally no interest in their lives."

There are red flags all over this company -- read all the reviews before you make a decision to work here; unfortunately, they are all true. If you have another job, don't leave it! If you don't have a job and are desperate, it's better to stay on unemployment and continue to look...

The two executives/owners are unprofessional, uncaring, egotistical, and the list goes on -- aside from them, there are a couple of bad eggs in the bunch that help make this place the worst place to work. Employees are not valued, the mentality around the office is ""you're lucky you even have a job."" Don't get me wrong,  a lot of the personnel is awesome but unfortunately, this is unrecognized and unacknowledged by those two who lead by micromanaging everything and don't give anyone the authority or empowerment to make decisions for their departments, subordinates, core duties and so on. 

The CEO rarely comes into the office but when she does, she is usually in and out after going into one of the conference rooms to argue with the COO (who is also her ex). The COO is constantly in the office, texting on his phone at his desk and having ""meetings"" with his best friends club, which consists of some of the sales team that rarely do any work and only have jobs since they're buddies, some relationships going back to high school.

I'm sure that this review is not really going to make a difference and they'll play it off as ""she's upset because we let her go""; but let me tell you that these are things that I should have said prior to not working here any longer. Being let go was actually more of a relief than anything else and I'm not upset that  I'm no longer with the company, but I am embarrassed that I even worked here.

The way in which people are let go is also done in a way I have never seen in any other organization... I was let go with no warning, no disciplinary or corrective action of any kind. When I asked why I was being let go, I was told there was no reason. Ummm, what?

The CEO and COO are extremely controlling and if you aren't in their ""in-crowd"" you should be looking for another job since it will only be a matter of time before they fire you. I was given a great performance review at my 90-days, given a promotion and an increase in pay. My manager was not even the person who decided to let me go, he was told by the CEO and/or COO that the decision had been made, whereas they know nothing about the quality of my work or even what projects I was working on, they only know whether or not they can get you to bow down to their ridiculous way of leading, if you can even call it that."

Mainly, the money is spent on the CEO's close friends (who she hires for twice as much money as the normal folk) or people that stroke her ego , OR people that she wants to impress. The male executive team regularly makes the female staff feel uncomfortable,  everybody feels like they can be fired any day, and there is an understanding by 2/3's of the place that it's a ship waiting to sink. The solution always tends to be spend money when a better solution would be to get rid of the CEO's unqualified ""buddies"" who are running this company into the ground.

1. Free coffee robot.
2. They will hire anyone.
3. The office is clean and modern.
4. 84% of the employees are genuinely awesome people.","The owners are inexperienced. There is little to no structure as far as processes and procedures. The executives have large egos and perpetuate a divide between themselves and the lower employees. The long-term goals and projections of the company are wildly over-optimistic.

Major Cons:

1. No job security. 
Almost 50% of the employees hired in 2016 were gone at the end of 2016.

2. Poor leadership.
There is a general lack of direction, training, and overall mentor-ship.

3. Poor Pay.
Low pay in the majority of positions below Executive level. Pay scales are not based on any research or industry trends, they are set at the whim of an Executive.

4. The ""Throw at wall, see what sticks"" strategy.
They put little to no research or preparation into many of their initiatives. Often the solution to their problems is to throw more money at them.


Minor Cons:
1. ""Open, collaborative office"" = Tiny, wall-less cubicles and non-stop interruptions.
2. 30 parking spots.. 200 employees. 
3. Steep learning curve of niche industry information you will never use again.



I would strongly recommend not working here unless..
- You currently have no job, no prospects, and desperately need income.
- You work in fast food, retail, or other low paying no-future job.

Do not UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE leave a stable job to come here in search of a better opportunity."
61,National Merchants Association,Good so far,2017-02-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Very well structured and organized. When it comes to growth this company is on it. They are hiring a lot of employees right now and realize where they need to focus on. Leadership is strong and going through growing pains, they are adapting, listening and changing. Strong growth rates, security, and good products. Tons of room for growth and opportunities individually. They are looking for strong employee so you must have your A game.
Great office and location.
Very Professional.","Parking, if you get in later get ready to walk"
62,National Merchants Association,Great People and Exciting Work Environment,2017-02-02,5.0,FileMaker Software Engineer III,"I haven't worked in an office environment for over 30 years, but since I started here at NMA almost 3 months ago I have found it very easy to get back into the rhythm of a 9-5 job. The IT department where I work has fine, talented, brilliant people all of whom have a great sense of humor. The work is challenging and helps me to keep growing as a developer. The building is very new and stocked with the latest tech gear. Although my interaction has been limited, I have found the executive team and management to be very nice and accessible. Benefits are great and kick in after 90 days. They just added 4 more paid holidays to the calendar. They even give you a paid day off on your birthday! Who does that?","The parking is limited, and there are too many in-office distractions that sometimes makes it hard to concentrate on my work. Remote work is not allowed except for a few individuals. I have seen several unfavorable reviews here, and I expect in hindsight these are the result of situations that perhaps could have been handled better by management."
63,National Merchants Association,Best Company I've EVER Worked For!!!!!,2017-02-02,5.0,Partner Support Representative,"The CEO, Heather Petersen, is an absolutely fantastic person. She just loves all of her employees and takes amazing care of us all. She is always smiling, stops to say hello, and says goodbye when she leaves. We are all a big gigantic family, and you absolutely feel it everyday at work. We eat, breathe and live ""team."" From our open concept work environment to our break room, it is all about us being a team. Without one another, we could not make our processes as seamless and effective as they are. We have an open door policy, and it completely stands. Our managers and peers receive our feedback well. Not only do they listen, but they take our feedback and put it into action. I can undoubtedly say that I walk into work everyday happy, ready to work, and all of it with a smile.","The parking is a bit difficult, but only results in good exercise!"
64,National Merchants Association,Good place to learn and grow professionally,2017-02-02,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Fast paced, company is progressing...received Inc 500 award, nice employees, free benefits, just added more holidays, bonuses to those who work hard, security, free coffee, great location and view, good environment for networking, nice company gatherings",Parking...some people don't like to walk too far
65,National Merchants Association,Absolutely the WORST company ever. DO NOT work here if you need a stable job.,2017-01-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Good people to work with,Horrible management. They lie to your face. They ignore the employees. They have no direction. They hire to many relatives. The CEO is bi-polar. Management is so cheap they can't even pay you a compliment. The benefits are free but very poor. Only two paid holidays per year!
66,National Merchants Association,LOOK ELSEWHERE !!!!,2017-01-26,1.0,Sales Representative,-the main office is nice. But beside that and the coffee machine in the break/ lounge area there isn't really any positives.,"-Shady corporation
-liars
-no accountability
-waste of time 
-recruiter doesn't even know what the hell he's doing important steps of a new job process should be laid out and simple but nope. Hard to reach, had to re arrange my schedule of existing work because was told that I need to get a drug test 1 day prior to working and that It was mandatory or else my start day would be postponed."
67,National Merchants Association,"Very Misleading, Dishonest, Unprofessional, STAY AWAY!!!",2017-01-26,1.0,Management,"Free Coffee, and good people, coworkers who have been mislead and are now stuck looking for other jobs while working here.","It appears the CEO doesn't care, she is never in the office, and is far too distracted by other business interests. it Appears the she cares more about her public image than the success of the business. The company lied to me during the recruiting process (I have the emails and text messages to prove this), they made promises they never intended to keep. They changed my job role several times, basically with the threat of termination if I didn't agree, now I work in a dungeon a (old smelly room with no windows) with a hostile, inexperienced manager who is not qualified to do her job employees complained but the company doesn't care! 

The Chief Technology Officer (no experience) is CEO's fiancee, (many long standing employees refer to him as her ""Boy Toy"") he spends his rare few days in the office reading peoples emails and chat messages, then reports them to the CEO so they can fire people who question their choices or poor decisions. The CEO walks around talking about firing people, when she does come to the office, this creates a culture of fear and mistrust. Employees are standing around most of the day with really nothing to do, there is no direction, there are not enough customers or business to support the weak business model. The company is burning money you can see the waste everywhere but don't speak up. Its unnerving to see the company needs to have armed security guards at the office.... a little scary in a small town, that has to tell you something. 

Benefits are terrible only 2 paid holidays and the CEO is annoyed about paying for those. There is no parking at the office, cars get vandalized (probably by disgruntled ex employees) from parking on the street. Combative work environment where bullying and harassment are common place, did I mention that a company of less than 150 employees needs two attorneys on staff full time,,,,, 

If you have a career don't consider moving here, they will make promises they never intend to fulfill, with far too much inexperience at the CEO level I believe this company will be sold or out of business within the next 2 years. They will most likely remove this review because image is everything. I feel bad for the great professionals who have already wasted their time working for this very bad company, and this very bad leadership. There are better opportunities out there with successful leaders not ones who make an image out of nothing. Do your homework on this company the grass is not greener!!"
68,National Merchants Association,You do not want to work here!!!!,2017-01-26,1.0,Supervisor,"The only good things about the company are a nice building, cool coffee machine and free coffee, and SOME great people who are not at the management level.","This place is awful!! The CEO and her management team (mostly friends who are not qualified for their roles) are not friendly! They will walk right passed you like you are invisible.  The office is an open concept area with low wall cubes and the management team, called the Super 8, sit in the middle of the office space in cubes.  Employees are not allowed to eat at their desks but the Super 8 do and it's hard to walk by and she them all eating!! You cannot have pictures at your desk and the dress code is profession business attire every day but they don't enforce it enough and some of the outfits are not professional work attire!  The paid holiday schedule is HORRIBLE, and I mean horrible.  Only two paid holidays!!  The vacation policy is lacking as well. It doesn't matter how many years of work experience you've had, everyone starts off at one week.  Except for the Super 8.  The benefits are lacking as well.  Managers are not motivating they are demeaning!! Employees fear for their jobs everyday!!  It's a cold environment!  Run, I mean run!! You do not want to work here!!!"

70,National Merchants Association,This place is a joke!,2017-01-05,1.0,,"Some of the employees are great. Since everyone is new, they are all still getting to know each other.","If you are not in the ""inner circle"", forget about keeping your job. Most of the directors are friends of the CEO, and only a few actually have experience. This place is house of cards waiting to fall, and the management is so blind, that they do not see it. Every day that I showed up to work, I was waiting for the place to be closed down., or for myself to be fired. There is zero job security, and people are fired without warning, and with no explanation.
Every day at work felt like I was ""playing"" office. Everyone was pretending that it was a legit company, and that we were doing real work. I have never been in such a dysfunctional environment, with zero processes or procedures in place., and no intellectual purpose for the way everything is run. When I was first hired, a newly promoted (underqualified and undeserving) manager, started telling everyone that she was my manager. Although she was clearly in a completely different department, the obvious lack of leadership led to me being moved under a manager that did not understand my job requirements. Instead of allowing me to do my job, she decided to instead demote me to her personal assistant. Upon trying to stand up for myself, I was immediately let go by my ""department head"", who had never bothered to speak a word to me before that day. 
I was shocked at the lack of professionalism that exists at NMA. Credit card information is stored on post-it notes, left in drawers, and placed in notebooks that are taken home by employees nightly. NMA is a web of fraternization, with managers dating low-level employees, and directors dating each other. This place is worse than high-school, and I actually feel dumber having worked there. Run for your life!"
71,National Merchants Association,Quality control analyst,2017-01-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,There are some great people who worked there and I made some forever friends.,"This company does not appreciate their employees or the work that their employees put in; they care about the money that gets in there pocket.

You could be the best worker and doing the most work but if your not buddy buddy with your manager or the CEOs your screwed .

They love to bring in new people,and pay them triple what your making even though you both have the same title and your doing more work.

Unless your friends with the CEO your job is never secure. They may hire 10 people a week but they also fire 5 a week. I guarantee over half the employee's walk around on egg shales waiting to be let go.

Its a good place for a between job but for a career job... Don't quit your day job"

I personally did not care for their sales training techniques.  Very impersonal and too fast.  If they are open to hiring sales agents with no experience, then they should divide the inexperience and the experienced and provide applicable training to each group.  And their attitude should be more positive and inspiring instead of criticism and scare tactics of losing your job on a daily basis!"

I've never seen a company who took care of your benefits, invested money into growing your personal brand, offered workshops (after hours) to help build your LinkedIn, they've invested a lot of time and hard work to make NMA a place that people WANT to work for. There is something about the CEO people can get behind.... She's determined to make NMA the biggest employers in Temecula, one of the biggest processors in the industry, and most importantly the most profitable business she can. I would have no issues recommending NMA to anyone willing to get in the industry.","When a business is growing like NMA is, it's easy to forget the little people, as management becomes a little top heavy, the ""smaller"" employees have become less important in the eyes of management (not the CEO)

I can only speak for the sales and member support teams, but there are some managers that are there currently (June 2016) that are trying their best to make their department stronger, but there are some managers who are really hurting their department. If you don't mind working for(at times)  bad management, then I would recommend NMA 100%"
