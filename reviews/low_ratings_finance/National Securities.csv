The interviews were very easy and straightforward 
No Finacial knowledge needed to get your foot in the door

-You will spend over 10 hours a day cold-calling
-They will not teach you anything about the Finacial industry
-They will constantly sell you the dream that you can easily make 100k a month if you put in 12 hour days, 6 days a week

This job this like the twilight zone, you'll notice that upper management has everyone convinced that by cold calling 12 hours a day and sometimes 7 days a week that they should be making 6 figures per month. The reality is only the gentleman that have been in this game for 10+ years are making money, everyone else is skimming the bottom trying to generate an account a month. Your co-workers do not think for themselves, these people have nowhere to go and are so convinced they can make it here that even after 2 even 3 years of not making any money, they will keep saying ""3 years is really when we peak"". Being a stock broker is nothing like the Wolf on Wall Street, don't believe that for a second. Brilliant people, people that don't buy into dreams, see things for what they really are, people who are truly going places, should not go here for money. You will not get it. If you do get into this position, get your series 7 and take off."
67,National Securities,Don't waste your time!!!!,2015-09-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Nothing. Really except you get your licenses.,"This is one of the firms on Wall Street whom have no knowledge or experience in investment.  They pick stocks to pitch basically  like playing darts. Working 12 a day 6 days a week and 300 bucks a week. This is slavery. I was told that after I give them 20 accounts as obligation they will come back to me as part of joint book with the senior broker. But no after I gave them 20 I had to go out and get my own clients with 0 help from the same senior broker. Basically you are slave until you do 20 accounts for them and after they don't care about you.  So no don't waste your time. Best advice if you are starting out, work for reputable company at lower entry and then after learning about the Market and company,  move forward to becoming financial advisor.  Stock broker jobs are really dead. It was in 90s.  So no just don't waste your time."

88,National Securities,Chop Shop. Do not be fooled by the smoke and mirrors. Do not work here unless you have an established book of business.,2014-08-01,1.0,Financial Advisor,"There are some great people who work here. Intelligent, hard-working, capable individuals who are simply content with where they are, or do not realize their ability to work at a better institution. Some may also prefer the more casual, laid-back, unprofessional no-tie atmosphere. 

You will learn the art of selling, otherwise known as the art of deception. 

Your recruiter will pretend to be your best friend.","Pyramid Scheme consisting of 3 levels: Portfolio Managers, Account Openers (Licensed brokers), and Cold Callers (""Interns""). Only the portfolio managers make any real money, while the other two levels cold call 60-80 hours a week to either generate new leads or open new accounts for their hiring manager (Of which commissions will be split for the initial trade as well as any trades that may follow). You are promised the opportunity to start your own book of business after opening 20 accounts. However, assuming you've completed this task, it will become clear that due to the lack of training--you are in no position to manage a client's money. Your training is sales-based, you will attain minimal knowledge regarding investments or finance. A monkey can be trained to dial the phone 300-500 times a day and memorize a series of pitches and rebuttals, they should consider recruiting brokers at the Bronx Zoo.

You will be overworked. You will be underpaid ($1,000 base salary a month--far below the industry average). As compensation for this insignificant salary you will be promised the world--including higher commissions rates than other firms. You will be promised a six-figure income after two years. You will be promised a training regimen equal to that of Merrill Lynch. They will pitch you harder than you will ever pitch potential clients. They want to give you this job--if you fail it costs them nothing and at worst you opened a few accounts for your manager. 

I highly recommend that you only consider a position at National Securities if you have an existing book of business. If you MUST take this job, use it as a stepping stone to get licensed and gain the necessary experience to transfer elsewhere. You should also be sure to look up your hiring manager on brokercheck.finra.org to make sure that they do not have a history of illegal business practices such as churning client accounts. If they do not care about their clients, they most certainly do not care about you.

DO NOT WORK FOR FREE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, NOT A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY."

90,National Securities,Former Trainee,2014-07-15,4.0,Financial Advisor Trainee,I started in the industry with Merrill ynch in the training program and ended up switching to National. As far as training goes Merrill's program wasnt all that different from nationals in the sense of education. The biggest differance i saw between the 2 was Merrill hurdles were basically designed to make your fail or go after friends and family where as National will actually work with you and management would actually work with you more when you need it. Merrill will help you too as long as you meet the hurdles and dont need the help.,I wish they paid you more salary but they make up for it by paying your commisions earlier and higher percentage of gross

100,National Securities,"Not a place to work at forever, good to learn the business and then move on.",2013-11-20,3.0,Registered Representative,Great place to intern or as a first finance job to learn the business if you're still in college or a recent graduate.,"12 hour days except Fridays and  several hours on Saturdays.  Base pay is $1,000 a month what you make is not guaranteed, it is up to how many people you can close. If you cannot close then you'll be a glorified telemarketer making 600 cold calls a day. Very repetitive and boring most days. Management is very sensitive and if you are not buddy buddy with the boss, if you mess up you are easily replaceable. Every month there are new faces. This job is definitely not for everyone."
101,National Securities,Good place to work but movement is null to impossible and pay is horrible,2013-10-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flexible hours, open-door policy, dynamic work environment","Horrible pay, no growth movement, no trainings, high-turn over"
102,National Securities,Not a great place to start a Wall Street career,2013-03-05,2.0,Investment Specialist,None to speak of really,"The culture is poor
Boys club type environment
Very much like a sweatshop"
103,National Securities,Very fun but extremely low pay,2013-01-15,2.0,Investment Specialist,"I really liked the people who worked there and they also provided good training for their new hires.  Also, they would take us out at times after work here and there.","Lots of cold calling where they want to get in 300 dials a day and at least 10 leads.  Employees are 1099'd and there are no benefits whatsoever.  Even after our team opened up over 50 new accounts from my leads (10K-100K typically) and I opened up new accounts on the phone and in person, management still wouldn't budge and put me on ANY commissions! R U Kidding Me!?!?"
104,National Securities,Great place for advisors with existing books of business,2012-09-21,4.0,Investment Specialist,"Great payouts, not micro managed","No leads provided, Syndicate does not get enough stock of the good deals"
105,National Securities,"Upsetting experience, stay far away from them",2012-06-09,1.0,Senior Broker,"sponsored me to attain my licenses brokering in stocks and insurance. (Then again, most companies in the industry will- its just about a standard by now)","First 3 months were unpaid 
management was supremely unhelpful in training (if you can call my 2 days of calling people from a restricted line training)
You cold call and lie to people constantly
The promise of filing people under your superior and having them transfer back down underneath you when you become a Sr. Broker is a joke.
After your 3 month induction period is over (and you hopefully generated leads for the company) they cut 90 percent of the group i was hired in and told the other 10 percent that they would need another 6 months of cold calling without pay to determine if they had a spot for us on their ""Elite Team""..

Also ALOT of discrepancies and complaints. just look it up under the SEC website."
106,National Securities,There are Much Better Places to Work,2012-05-16,2.0,,The potential to operate and grow your own business can be very appealing if you have the time necessary to get it off the ground.,Limited support and training.

108,National Securities,Fake Financial Sector Job,2011-07-06,2.0,,Cold calling is a skill that various jobs will value.  Any job in the financial sector bolsters a resume if that is your intended sector.,"Cold calling all day.  Calling the same people every day.  Calling to New Zealand in the evenings was a joke; no one wanted to talk to you.  Great deal of talk from the existing brokers, but it's hardly a challenging position.  The key to success: relinquish your conscience."
109,National Securities,good place to intern,2011-06-20,3.0,,"flexible intern hours, learned a lot about the business, great place to learn and experince the financial industry as a whole","once hired you receive straight commision, no salary, no benefits or medical/dental"
