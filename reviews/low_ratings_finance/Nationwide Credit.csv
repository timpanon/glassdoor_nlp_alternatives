There are monthly incentives to make more money which isn’t too bad
During busy times of the year there’s options to do overtime and work holidays, which is great.","BREAKS & LUNCHES are micromanaged!
A 15 minute break twice a shift and a 30 min/1he lunch depending on your shift.. and not a minute over. 
Since it’s a vendor for national grid, inbound callers are not the happiest, so calls aren’t pleasant. As a result, the work environment is kind of “on edge” or crabby. 
Eating on the work floor is strictly enforced
Using cellphones on the floor, even if for an emergency is strictly enforced.

Multiple HR complains have been made with nothing done. 
-Ridiculous turnover. 
-You're set up to fail as they have a very small team of people who take inbound calls (where the money actually is) and the rest are pressured to collect with only outbound calls. 
-You can make 300+ calls a day with zero contact which = zero commission. You will be treated like crap for this regardless of it being your fault. 
-Environment and cutthroat atmosphere created by upper management encourages employees to stab each other in the back for paying files. 
-Constant drama fueled by management.

26,Nationwide Credit,High levels of professionalism are required,2018-10-20,1.0,Customer Service Representative,It’s a job with free junk food and coffee,"A few hours after I passed the final test for training, I was sitting with a coworker listening to one of her calls. Her manager became upset that she was on a 12 minute call with a customer. My coworker couldn’t get the customer off the call, and the manager proceeded to throw a poop emoji pillow at the back of my head. I became quite ill, and was prescribed medication from a physician. I told HR, and during our meeting I was told I exaggerated. Due to the fact that retaliation exists for those who file complaints, my coworkers said the poop emoji pillow lightly grazed my hair. I was bed ridden for a few days. Management saw it as an extreme inconvenience that I didn’t want this to be my manager. The same manager decided to transfer a customer that needed medical documentation for a medical emergency reconnect to the card payment phone number few weeks later. Of course, the customer didn’t want to make a payment with a card, and called back quite upset. 

Close to 6 months later, things did not improve. I went back to school that week, and I was trained in UCB. With in a week, my manager told me that I would be required to work full time for moves training. There was ZERO professionalism when I was not told any idea of the date of my training. I became upset, because I had exams to study for. I frantically attempted to learn moves during any breaks in between calls. Eventually, I became burned out, and quit. Call center metrics are top priority, and the requirement to have an AHT within 5 seconds of 5 minutes and 45 seconds becomes draining. The work and life balance did not exist. I was not guaranteed time to study for my exams, and did not want to fail. Prior to this, I never had an issue, and used to work plus attend school. University can be demanding when some exams require 5 pages typed of equations to memorize. I felt disrespected, and did not want to leave a 2 week notice."

Upper management barely speak english and rarely ever come out of thier office. Representatives who are considered favorites get away with just about anything they want, while everyone else is micro managed and talked in a very non-professional way. HR does not listen, only acts when management tells them to."

Middle managemement is unbelieveably incompetent and is willing to flat out lie to the staff about anything and everything - from job expectations, to what support they are willing to give and compensation.
