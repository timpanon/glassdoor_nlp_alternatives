0,Ned Davis Research Group,Work life balance,2020-10-26,4.0,Account Manager,Good and smart people around.,management and strategy change quite frequent
1,Ned Davis Research Group,Great Place to learn,2020-10-23,3.0,Director,Access to top Hedge Funds and Asset Managers,Constant turnover and change in strategy.
2,Ned Davis Research Group,Great opportunity to learn the market and great people to learn from,2020-06-06,5.0,Investment Research Analyst,"-Strategist here are always willing to share their knowledge & experience with new analyst. A great learning opportunity.
- Chances to learn financial big data analysis / programming skills. Those skills become essential in today's investment industry and NDR is one of the earliest firm who use big data/programming in their research.
-Decent pay & benefit on local level
-Work life balance is great",-Firm location is not ideal
3,Ned Davis Research Group,Integrity needed to survive,2019-10-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are many astute, sophisticated and intelligent people employed at the firm. Many of the research, IT, and sales staff give a lot to the success of the company. The level of expertise that encompasses a subscription at NDR is paramount. The atmosphere tends to be relaxed and the people are friendly. My direct manager was outstanding as well.","You have to lead by integrity, innovation, and honesty to produce the results that are needed for NDR to thrive. Upon starting with the firm, there were accusations that portions of commission compensation were missing.  Subsequently, an executive departed the firm. Executive management has a tendency to change like the seasons, which causes inconsistency in direction and strategy. Some minorities noted that they felt as if they were treated differently than their counterparts. Compensation structures continued to be altered, disgruntling some employees. I personally felt that much of senior leadership could not be trusted."
4,Ned Davis Research Group,Lovely team but bad outlook,2019-01-16,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"A team of lovely people. The strategists produce excellent analysis, so it is helpful if you want to learn about what drives markets and need information on how to invest your own portfolio. Great flexibility to work from anywhere in the world, as long as things get done. Lots of travel for some roles. Lots of email communications as many work remote on a regular basis.",The acquisition by Euromoney Institutional Investor did not create added value from a resource or distribution point of view. Some politics and ego battles but not more than other companies. The company has historically been managed almost like a family business without a long-term growth strategy or keeping an eye on the competition. The offering suffered and the company struggled with increasing its footprint.
5,Ned Davis Research Group,Netual,2018-10-30,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Flexible schedule and the workload is OK,Technologies used there was kind of outdated...
6,Ned Davis Research Group,Overall it is good to be here,2018-10-17,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flexible schedule
Healthy relationships between employees",The business is not doing great
7,Ned Davis Research Group,Great Employer,2018-04-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Casual atmosphere and work environment. Friendly co-workers, many of whom are long term employees which speaks volumes about the company overall.  Good salaries, great benefits and work/life balance (especially for Florida)","Some previous upper level management changes had created issues that need to be rectified, but the latest CEO is moving the company forward in the right direction."
8,Ned Davis Research Group,Great company with really smart people,2018-03-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Working here I am surrounded by the smartest people around. The company although large still has an entrepreneurial spirit and our clients constantly give great feedback. This is the first financial services company I have worked for that truly cares about work / life balance.,There have been a few senior management changes but the environment seems much more stable now.
9,Ned Davis Research Group,"BAD COMPANY, ignore fake positive reviews",2017-09-29,1.0,Analyst,"Little work to do for most folks in Venice. 
One of the few finance employers in Central Florida","Management hired trolls or asked employees to fill some fake positive reviews. Do not trust them. Yes, there is a new CEO and he wants to make things better but he will fail like his (many) predecessors because:
(1) the best sales people and strategists have left
(2) 90% of the product is worthless: people pay for Ned's hotline, a handful of models and Tim's market calls. Everyone one else is a parasite (a lot of mouths to feed...)
(3) Senior management team is hopeless"
10,Ned Davis Research Group,Great Place to Work,2017-05-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Very casual and friendly atmosphere.  Options for advancement.  Flexible with hours.   Employee morale is good due to good management now in place. Workload is never overwhelming and education opportunities are available to further your career here.,Growing pains....top management has been changed several times the past few years which lowered employee morale.
11,Ned Davis Research Group,"Great company, under new leadership!",2017-05-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Excellent research provider, with very talented people. Employees are committed to providing high quality and innovative work to clients. Very friendly and casual work environment. Full  gym and other recreational activities are available onsite. 

Great benefits with a variety options to choose from, including multiple health plans and a 401k with a 50% company match on contributions. NDR provides employees with employer funded term life, paid paternity/maternity leave, flexible and remote work schedules, and long term disability benefits.","Prior,  multiple changes in leadership."
12,Ned Davis Research Group,Stay away from this company for developer / researcher roles!,2017-02-16,1.0,Software Engineer,the only pro I see is that the management does not mind working from home,"In the 1990s and 2000s the company built a set of programming tools in-house - and they force all the researchers and developers to work on those for building charts and reports. Nobody outside NDR uses the programming language that is used to build the charts / reports. In a way, programming using the language makes your skillset non-marketable outside the company. Several employees are stuck in their career. Also, there are not many companies in Sarasota / Venice area.

Some guys in IT use other languages for internal tools and the website, but the technology stack is pretty outdated. Its like travelling 10 years back in time. Their website do not support more than 20-30 users at a time, which is ridiculous.

They have no plans to change their technology stack and their technical debt. If you are considering a position here, better stay away or you would ruin your career !"
13,Ned Davis Research Group,"Very poorly-managed company, getting worse",2016-11-22,1.0,Associate,Good beaches nearby if you work in the Florida office and you get to wear flip flops at the office,"Terrible atmosphere in the Boston office.
Very political bureaucracy, and ""good old boys"" culture.
Enormous turnover among sales

No one in management has produced research, sold financial services, or managed money. Every initiative they take fails miserably. Rather than take any responsibility, management usually fires a couple salespeople and comes up with another failed business idea, like ""the data product"".

Good strategists (head of commodities, ETFs, Europe) have left and not been replaced. The rest are interviewing or waiting for retirement. Many are stuck there and just hope to draw their paychecks until the place goes bust.

Management puts insane sales targets, provides no training, and does not care about the product: sales' jobs is to force good customers to accept crazy price hikes every year. Some clients still pay because Ned and Tim had good calls over the years, but this place is done when they retire."
14,Ned Davis Research Group,"Sales -- Avoid: carzy sales turnover, poor management, declining product",2016-09-16,1.0,Sales,"Very lax dress code
Good if you are looking for a back office job with no real work
Good exposure to buy-side, you can network for your next job","No respect for sales: most get fired within a year. Commissions are not paid until you fight for months. Expect to get nickel and dimed on expenses.
Product quality is collapsing. The best strategists have left. The founder and CIO are still respected, but US macro strategist is a joke. The last big initiative for the quant/data product is a disaster: product is super expensive and does not work"
15,Ned Davis Research Group,WORST COMPANY I HAVE EVER WORKED FOR,2016-04-12,1.0,,"NONE, NONE, NONE, NONE, NONE","-Horrible management
-Sales teams are awful
-oh you need training? Nope, you better figure things out on your own."
16,Ned Davis Research Group,"Euromoney Should Sell, Ned Should wake-up",2015-11-11,1.0,Strategist,"The people at NDR are the greatest asset. The work environment is still fairly entrepreneurial, and relaxed. Venice Florida is a retirement town, but not bad for raising kids.","Now part of a public company, costs are the number one priority. Euromoney wants a publishing company, not a top-notch research firm. The employees are line-items now, and are seen as easily replaceable widgets. Upper management are managers by default, but not true managers inspiring their employees and promoting firm-wide team work. New German CEO is a robot, has zero people skills doesn't understand the business, is only concerned about the bottom line, and has no vision. Unfortunately, Ned has removed himself from any management responsibilities. He sold the company at the top, and is in the twilight of his career.  Ned is out of touch with the great company that he built, and which is now in a irreversible decline under Euromoney management."
17,Ned Davis Research Group,Intern,2015-10-28,4.0,Intern,A good work environment to be in,not in the best location
18,Ned Davis Research Group,"Puts Out Great Research, Quiet Setting",2015-10-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Ned Davis Research is known in the market for putting out great financial research. The people there are mostly very intelligent. The IT Department is significant and the most of the Analysts have CFAs and know their category quite well. Many of the major funds/banks know of NDR.,Company is very quiet and very slow paced. Very casual work atmosphere where sometimes it gets boring.
