5,New England Financial,Well intentioned but difficult,2016-06-15,3.0,,Many smart people and well to-do people work here. There are many unnecessary meetings but for the first couple of months they can be insightful.  After the first couple of months they can be a nuisance if you are trying to sell but still a great refresher.,Any sales position is going to be difficult but the mandatory meetings that are very repetitive in content makes it annoying.  They make you travel sometimes on your own dime.
6,New England Financial,Financial Advisor,2016-03-10,2.0,Financial Advisor,"Open product platform, no pressure to sell proprietary products.  No micro management.",Is now fully integrated into MetLife.  Too many negative issues with this company.

8,New England Financial,Nice Company to work for,2015-06-22,4.0,,The flexibility was nice & management was good at getting things scheduled,recruiting financial advisors is very difficult because it is a commission only job and people are very hesitant to move companies
9,New England Financial,Good training - fair long-term prospects,2015-04-13,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"NEF spent considerable time and energy ensuring all associates were well-trained, and financially knowledgeable.  The company provides extensive resources and tools for all planners. Young, energetic workforce.  Positive work atmosphere",Several layers of management - good ideas often got mired in bureaucratic quagmire.  Monthly redirection of corporate strategies and initiatives.  High employee turn-over rate made continuity and consistency problematic.
10,New England Financial,Registered Representative Selling Life Insurance and Retirement Investments to clients.,2014-11-15,4.0,Registered Representative,Met Life Insurance Company is a well establish company selling insurance and investment products in New England Financial as a part of MetLife. My Sales Manager and support staff used high standards of conduct to support all Sales Representatives and provided adequate training and satisfied customer accounts.,I encountered higher levels of management who aggressively demanded excessive time commitments and manipulated account assignments that were unacceptable.

Attractive office and conference room space
Free parking
Metlife connection helpful
Supported getting and keeping licenses","Needed more structure for those starting out in their career
Low name recognition
Incomplete information on compensation plan
Needed to pay E&O yourself"
12,New England Financial,"Good place to start, but get out when you can",2014-05-22,2.0,Financial Advisor,"Good place to start your career, they provide training and resources. If you have a good manager then you will learn a lot.","Proprietary, be prepared to sell only their products or have your commissions cut. Little to no investment knowledge in this place, only insurance."
13,New England Financial,Starved to death,2014-04-29,1.0,Registered Representative,"Great salespeople in the San Ramon office, training was decent",They promised leads that never materialized so it's 100% cold calling; very high turnover same as every other insurance company.
14,New England Financial,Workplace Review,2014-04-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Fast paced office with some really great people to work with.  Better than average to work for.  Representatives were very knowledgeable and helpful.  New their product well.,No assistance with continuing education (i.e. support or reimbursement) for staff.  New representative turn over was a little much. Company should look at their recruiting efforts.
15,New England Financial,Unstable and tough to make money,2014-03-25,2.0,Registered Representative,Freedom. You have all the time in the world to build your business how and when you want to.,"Pay. If you are okay spending more time in product meetings than trying to make sales, this is the place for you"
16,New England Financial,"NEF AKA MAFG, Metlife puppet co.",2014-02-27,3.0,New Business,"There are good benefits for salaried employees, as well as the rare part-timer. Very structured and politically correct.","Many levels of management cause many decisions to be made ""by the numbers"" and not by logic. People in Boston call the shots for offices all around the country, large and small. Some very unrealistic goals get set on sales people, and experiments with off-shore outsourcing of back-end processing are unfortunate but enduring. Sudden lay-offs happen more than they admit."
17,New England Financial,Fast pace office working with agents and management to complete & finalize all  applications into New Policy's.,2013-12-26,4.0,Administrative Assistant,"Some of the best reasons to work at New England Financial are: professional and friendly agents, regular updating & training, office manager positive attitude and great work ethic.",The only downside I came across was that there were a lot of agents who would quit the agency for better advancement potential.
18,New England Financial,"Lots of showing off, little accomplished",2013-12-06,2.0,Marketing Director,"Director trainings were interesting and fun...plus an excuse to stay in a nice hotel.
Lots of marketing resources.
Small agencies allow for greater growth opportunities.
Decent infrastructure.","New York City agency was like being in a bad sitcom. Office politics were crippling the agency when I left.
Too much bureaucracy.
Raises were a joke, while upper management ordered feasts to be delivered for themselves every day for lunch."
19,New England Financial,Going down hill fast - no leadership,2013-03-05,1.0,Financial Advisor,Was a great place. Now greedy MP and bad leadership from Metlife has doomed NEF,"MP's out for themselves- Money driven, unethical and greedy
No Support for agent
Fired all good management
Expenses are out of control to drive more money to MP's
MetLife is about Shareholder equity not policy holders 
Metlife/NEF selling against own sales force"
20,New England Financial,They are not invested in your success,2012-10-04,1.0,Financial Advisor,Training program is adequate. word,They don't pay so they have no interest in your long-term success. I brought in more than $100k and made less than $1k. When you leave they will not pay you the money you EARNED.
21,New England Financial,"Might be good for a second career, not if you need a job ASAP",2012-09-06,1.0,Financial Advisor,"- Interview process was very laid back
- People were friendly
- Unlimited earning potential; if you are successful then you can make a lot of money","- You have to pay for your own licensing, whereas most other companies in the industry will pay for it
- Unclear about compensation; some people told me it was salary+commission while others told me it was commission only.
- Licensing process is long; you must study for and pass the life/health insurance exam, and then once you do that THEN they will tell you that you must pass either the Series 6 or 7, which adds at least another month onto the process. 
- They literally expect you to set up meetings with every single one of your friends and family members to try and sell to them/ask for referrals. If you do not do this, you will be cold calling all day. 
- Know that if you are a new rep, it could be months before you actually start working and getting paid due to the time it takes to get licensed. 
- You must use your own car and gas to drive around to go prospecting, which adds up, especially if you are not actually making any money. 

Probably good for someone with an established network/lots of wealthy friends. I would look somewhere else if you are just starting out and have no money."
22,New England Financial,"pay isn't great, but the environment is relaxed enough to keep you onboard",2012-08-21,3.0,,"- friendly people in the office
- except for deadlines, there isn't too much work to do
- the agents range from 20s to 50s, all are knowledgeable","- they charge rent on agents that own offices/desks
- a bit strict on the break times [10min]"
23,New England Financial,"Good in theory, not in practice.",2012-08-07,3.0,Financial Advisor,"Better than industry average new agent financing plan, access to some sophisticated financial instruments and platforms w/ proper registrations, paid continued education to achieve CFP designation","Very little visibility in local market, does very little firm-wide marketing leaving the costs of promotions left to the agents and largely falls on new hires, poor leadership for new hires finding their way in the industry"
24,New England Financial,"OK, but management lacking",2012-08-06,3.0,Financial Advisor,flexibility to set your own hours and appointments.  Professional approach to the financial services industry. decent product support as well.,"Sell, Sell, Sell! Big push for MetLife products even when not best fit.  Management lacking in supporting agents.  Also managers keep their own book and will try to get in on their own agent's sales."
25,New England Financial,"Middle of the road. Good products and platform, but nothing outstanding either.",2012-05-22,3.0,Financial Advisor,"Open platform. Good advisory fund platform, many things online. Good name recognition with METLife","Awful outside insurance agency, some systems are totally backwards and disjointed. Room for so many human errors and requires advisor constant follow up. Can't do financial planning, high tech fees, software fees, E&O fees, copy fees. Fees fees fees. (Oh and the monthly ""financing"" they put you on is conveniently just about the amount you pay in fees per month... thus a zero sum game)"
26,New England Financial,It's okay,2012-05-18,2.0,Financial Representative,"Good training provided, good atmosphere, great place to work for established financial advisers. If you're a proven successful revenue driver, you'll be handsomely rewarded. 

Great place to start out at if you've got an already established network of people with disposable income and insurance needs.","Heavy emphasis on life insurance. Some emphasis on annuities, very little on investments/wealth management. 

Training is thorough and effective, but biased. Selling techniques emphasized. Life insurance is over-glorified. Agents are told to make the ethical decision, but they are not educated enough on anything outside of insurance and annuities. 

You'll be expected to setup meetings with literally everyone you know. aggressive sales methods encouraged. 

No one cares about the hours and work you put in. Management doesn't focus on development and long-term potential; it's all about maximizing revenue in the short term. 

Virtually all leads and marketing support are concentrated on veteran producers with a successful track record. No money invested into the development of new agents."
27,New England Financial,Over all good.,2012-03-17,3.0,Financial Advisor,"work enviroment was good and positive,","Training, management follow through could have been better."

30,New England Financial,"Good start to my career, but glad my time there is over",2012-02-03,2.0,Marketing Director,"Smaller agencies make it easier to advance through the ranks quickly
Marketing training and support was more than adequate
Benefit of being under the umbrella of a large company, MetLife","Agency structure makes it possible for managing partners to become overly cocky and corrupt
Human resources does not have enough of an influence in maintaining balance between employees and management
Employees are treated like commodities"

37,New England Financial,"Do absolutelyt everything yourself and don't expect any support, or it's a complete waste of time.",2011-06-09,1.0,Financial Advisor,"Basically self-employed so you make your own schedule.
Health benefits are good
Definitely not a crack the whip, or quota driven mind-set.","Management is well versed in one product, Life Insurance.  So if you have an investment slant then don't expect them to know what to do or how to help.  The Broker-Dealer is not well organized or well trained so you get mis-information regularly."
38,New England Financial,Stressful,2011-05-16,4.0,,"Flexibility to do what you want with your clients
Large company
Career freedom
Nice people
