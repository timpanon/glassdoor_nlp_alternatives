1. There is absolutely  no Training at all which would empower their employee's and make them a stronger company their solution is to watch VIDEO'S which is totally ridiculous and basically they are creating an environment for failure.

2. Their Senior Management needs to take a course on Management Basics 101 and stop instilling fear into their employee's and creating a Toxic environment

14,NewOak Capital,Uncertain Future,2016-01-26,1.0,,I liked the parking situation. I was able to work downtown. The company provided snacks and drinks.,"Communication between the NYC office and the Dallas satellite office was not great. The company is staffed with many young analyst managers that just don't have the experience. The make capricious, autocratic decisions that contributes to a very haphazard work environment."
15,NewOak Capital,Associate,2016-01-25,2.0,Associate,Great location (Midtown East - on Lexington Ave). CEO & President are great people. Work with all the major law firms and major banks.,"Managing Directors in the Credit Risk/Litigation department can be difficult to work with. Credit Risk department only hires applicants as contract employees.

16,NewOak Capital,Decent stepping stone,2015-10-26,3.0,,"* Free stuff like food and shirts
* Equinox hookups
* Most people who work here are nice","* It's obvious that certain members of upper management play favorites
* Too many managing directors and directors but not enough people to actually manage
* A lot of these managing directors and directors are actually incompetent and don't provide any value to the company, they just keep the seat warm and make a decent salary
* You move seats every few months for no reason at all
* There is always talk of transparency but there's not enough of it
* TERRIBLE base pay, you are so far under market but they will always try to convince you you are being fairly compensated
* If you're an analyst for MCS, you will develop absolutely no transferable skills, so prepare to lie about that on your resume
* Everyone wants to have a meeting about everything
* ""Facetime"" is important"

18,NewOak Capital,"Great People, Great Company",2014-09-25,5.0,Developer,"A small firm giving employees the opportunity to dig their teeth into as much work as possible. 
Friendly and accessible management. 
The pay was solid.
I learned a ton from the senior technology team there.
Growing and evolving company, always an opportunity to learn something new.
Don't read too much into other people's reviews, if you have an opportunity to work at NewOak, see for yourself!!",Work load was heavy but that was on me as well as I got more invested into our projects.
19,NewOak Capital,Worst experience big mistake,2014-08-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Nothing really, If I had to pick a pro it will be location probably and the fact that you can say that you work in ""Wall Street"" impress your friends and such but shortly you will realize that this is all a big lie. 

I suffered every single day I was wit this firm (a bit more than a year). At the time I accepted the offer I had the chance to go with other firms and I completely disregarded the reviews on this website so I thought of writing one myself and confirm what other have already stated about this place.","The firm is completely unstructured. After six years they are still trying to find their own line of business.The firm is full with people with big egos and the attitude of most of the people there is completely innapropriate for a ""formal"" firm.

If you are interviewing for MCS you should know that this is the most boring job you can ever find, the people leading this business line will make your life miserable and needless to say there is no room for professional development since EVERY single person at the firm is a Managing Director so basically makes politics within the firm very complicated. 

The Advisory side is a bit more interesting and there are two or three very talented people although they are involved in very few deals and I don't see that changing in the future considering the politics of the firm."
