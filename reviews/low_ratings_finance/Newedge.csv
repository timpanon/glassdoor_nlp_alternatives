I've worked in financial services for 20+ years, and in my opinion Newedge is still a good place to grow.  Benefits from my perspective is the size of the firm relative to our leadership position and the global scale of our operations.  

Firm size is relatively small at around 2,700.  The team I work with is very thin.  I've worked at the large shops and prefer the Newedge atmosphere as I find it more rewarding.  Smaller teams mean the opportunity to learn more on any project.  You also have more direct control for a project's success and means to completion.
 
This is the first global firm I have worked for.  Although the hours are not always ideal, in my role I do get to interact with colleagues around the globe.  That perspective and experience is beneficial for this role and whatever may be next for me down the road.","FCMs have had a rough road the last few years and that has had a cascading effect throughout the industry and at Newedge.  A side effect of all of this is greater regulatory scrutiny which in turn equates to more checkpoints.  Internal/external audit, reporting, compliance oversight are all at fairly elevated levels.  The volume of forms to be completed for this request or that request seems overly bureaucratic at times.  This all makes the completion of projects that much more challenging."

The desks are okay, Finance and Ops had some okay people but they were shafted by their own paranoid managers and individuals in the business management seeking to discredit them as they were perceived as a threat or  would stop false accountancy/declarations so Business Managers weren't able to inflate bonuses for personal friends in front office. Anyone who refused to sign off incorrect inflated figures was trashed and warned their career would be curtailed. This place is the worst place I have ever worked or will ever work.

I truly enjoyed 3.5 out of my 4 years there. My position did not offer growth, but others did.","There are some good people there, but their efforts are often overshadowed by lack of strong leadership. Often, the doers seem to care more about the company than the managers.

My primary contacts were with Communications, IT. Communications is a very small and very hard working team, but - as they realize - it is viewed as a necessary evil and thus gets very little attention or credit. They do well with what they're given.

I can think of exactly two effective IT leaders left in the firm - and I believe they are the only people keeping things afloat. The rest seem to be concerned with heavy politicking and the focus on quantity over quality. I've seen hundreds of thousands of dollars and months wasted on projects despite panicked pleas from those on the ground. IT morale is horrible and good people are leaving in droves - and then the bad ones get promotions...

The HR department are very nice people, but do not count on them being employee advocates. I was treated unprofessionally and with sheer incompetence during my last few months there. Unfortunately it is a experience shared by many current employees. it was very disappointing to leave with negative feelings toward the company considering I truly liked my job at one point. 

Generally the company appears in flux. From the employees I'm still in touch with, the overall sense appears to be one of exasperation. It was present when I was there and it just seems to be getting worse."

They named employees 'bodies'. Yes you read me, not buddy, but Body. Great management idea being to remove the 'bodies' as much as they can. Their Middle management's only interests are either their own survival or their exit package. In a few months, the company completely turned its focus inwardly, despising clients and employees, with only a few left to try to keep some kind of service level.

They make decisions that are not based on what is good for business and has a negative impact on employee morale.  It is difficult sometimes dealing with French models of business and egos.  Many times efforts are made from upper management directives that squander important resources; often these overly consuming efforts are wasted when upper management decides to go in another direction away from original efforts.  Business lines are always dictating the priority of their projects/initiatives and when priorities are not agreeable to them they will waste no time stating displeasure to the highest management that will hear them.  There has been little to keep very talented staff on the payroll and little effort to hire talent to replace vacancies despite fairly shallow programs to attract new hires.  The aren't enough people to do what this firm wants to do.  2 years ago there was, but the company wasted lots of money and left their employees holding the bag.

Sadly it's the people that can move that do, the people that can't stay.
