0,Niagara’s Choice Credit Union,Not worth it,2019-06-21,2.0,Bank Teller,"Fun people to work with, 1.25 for vision and 5.00 for dental and $40.00 for single insurance. That’s about it.","You get paid below what you should be getting paid, you are told you only work 1 weekend a month And end up working every weekend. You are moved around to different places. They go through employees like tissues. They have some pretty rude managers. They honestly could care less about you and your problems. If your over or under better start looking for a new job. They write you up for everything. Look at a customer the wrong way. Write up. Breath to heavy. Write up. It’s honestly a joke half the people who work there rather step on legos all day. Customers are rude as hell they can’t keep company polices the same. Each branch is different."
