During covid one of my employees tested positive and the ceo made the Branch open the very next day, that's goes to show how much they could care less about their employees. I also had to fight for a raise, we agreed on the set number. After it was put into place they changed the raise amount without any notice to myself or my direct management,. When approached about this matter they said ""she gets what she gets tell her be happy"". The happiest money in working for this company was the day I quit. Good luck and RUN!!!"

They expect managers to work 6 days a week with no time off.  Not competitive in the industry.  Upper (top) management is a joke.  Does not follow fair lending practices.  Shows favoritism.   Charges dealers different fees depending if they like them or not.  Customer rates charged depends on what they can get away with, not on what customer actually qualifies for.  Collectors  call customers numerous times a day and not leave messages and will call references numerous times. Very unscrupulous.  Extremely little advancement opportunities."
25,Nicholas Financial,Needs better training and management attitudes are terrible,2019-09-03,4.0,Collector,The benefits and pay are decent,"There is limited to no training, and upper management has terrible attitudes"

29,Nicholas Financial,CEO and Management are scammers..to employees and clients,2019-05-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Nothing is positive about this company, not even the pay",everything.

Poor support from corporate HQ - difficult to know “who to go to” for various issues.   

Mid-upper management lacks a basic understanding of human resources laws and management skills.   How this company hasn’t been sued yet is a mystery.   

Poor communication at all levels.   

Extraordinary lack of concern for employees’ well being.  

Middle/upper level management unhelpful in almost every regard, and refuses to solicit feedback or listen to unsolicited feedback from employees.  

Business/underwriting system too bloated and cumbersome to facilitate efficient and timely decisions.   Yet the company continues to scratch its head about why business has fallen off so precipitously."
31,Nicholas Financial,PLEASE READ THE REVIEWS !!!!! THEY ARE SPOT ON,2019-03-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,So little not worth mentioning.  The negatives totally out weigh the positives.,Upper management are a bunch of YES MEN.  The CEO is slowly taking this company to the grave.

34,Nicholas Financial,Ever changing,2018-12-16,4.0,Collector,"Small office, friendly environment, easy work. If you are a seasoned collector and know your laws you will succeed. Upper management is understanding and helpful.","Difficult to bonus. If your sales team does not make money, your percentage goes up, and it makes you look bad. You cannot succeed on your own here. You have to rely on your team to do their job as well. Also if the collector bonuses, everyone bonuses. If sales bonuses, only they reap the rewards. If sales team buys bad deals collector suffers."

Poor management 
Unattainable"

37,Nicholas Financial,Collections,2018-04-02,2.0,Collections,Occasionally bonuses are given based on earnings for the company.,"Nicholas Financial shows favoritism to long time employees and lets them get away with numerous mistakes and even covers for them when they break laws. Introduced new policy on 4/2/18 that all employees are required to work Saturdays, with  no concern for the 40 hours already put in that week. What kind of a company requires 6 days a week and overtime every single week of the year? That is ridiculous."
38,Nicholas Financial,cut the head off the snake!,2017-09-27,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's close to home, and no weekends","I have worked with this company for several years, Things where great with the previous CEO Peter. Since he stepped down the current senior management  in charge of sales and lending is running this company to the ground. He is Unqualified to be in his current position, and until he is ousted this company is going to continue to bleed out. The company continues to engage in predatory lending practices, writing unverified loans to people who could never afford them. The current CEO was ousted for shady behavior that the company is trying to cover up to protect its stock evaluation. As of October 1st the company will be operating with no CEO. and no prospects in the horizon. Its unfortunate that the next in line is the one and only running this company into the ground. Another issue is the fact that Nicholas Financial has been trying to operate without a trained H.R manager, so when issues arise, and they often do at Nicholas Financial you might want to talk to a lawyer before thinking about engaging H.R"

They finally got internet!,"Where do I begin..The manager I had didn't know how to buy a deal if it slapped her in the face. She would find ways to "" make a deal work"" then hound the collectors because of bad deals.  You've also got mangers, regional managers and corporate who are all on different pages.  Everyone does stuff differently and it leads to mass confusion and mixed signals. These people don't know if they are coming or going. No training at all. Its a sink or swim situation. And don't ask for vacation time! And if you have kids or are pregnant this is not the place for you!  You also are required to clean the office, bathrooms and take all trash out 9 mths pregnant or not.  Insurance is expensive, no overtime. Most of the equipment they use is out dated ( dot matrix printers) . And it's like working in a high school with all the gossip."

Not to much good i can say honestly.","Where do I begin, this is not the place if you are young and actually take your job seriously. The environment is toxic along with discriminatory, No real professionalism just a bunch of good old boys who have worked here to long. There can be no real growth here, working long hours being counter productive no true leader ship and constant change to see what sticks to the wall. Antique computer systems, unrealistic expectations, 0 communication. You will never be recognized for all the good you do but you will be reminded and told if you you mess up!"

57,Nicholas Financial,Has gotten alot better,2015-04-10,3.0,Anonymous Employee,It's not hard labor. Management (for the most part) treats you fairly. You also get a paycheck every couple of weeks. That's a bonus I guess....,Company has high overhead so it's hard for them to stay competitive with rates and fees. They rely heavily on relationships because the product itself isn't nearly the best option out there.
