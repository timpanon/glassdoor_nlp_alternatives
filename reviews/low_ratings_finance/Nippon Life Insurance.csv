The salary level is high compared to other domestic insurers in Japan.","The corporate culture is super anachronistic. The company’s structure is hierarchical. The management is occupied with Japanese male in middle age, only a few woman. I have never seen a manager with disability. No diversity at all. 
Due to micromanagement and excessive pursuit, some people get mentally ill. Such people who harass others also stay in the company and are allowed to have subordinates so that victims are born again."

23,Nippon Life Insurance,Worst working experience ever,2020-02-22,1.0,Associate,good location in Midtown if you're are commuting.  Friendly coworkers outside of the PE operation team.,"Very low salary and bonus compare to an investment firm.  There's no profit sharing or performance bonus like other ""investment firm"".  It's pretty much a sub of an insurance company and structure as one.  It's tough to live on an $86k salary in NYC so it's a complete waste of time to work there other than being an adult daycare.  For example, I ended up with twice the salary at my current firm and I'm loving my job.  I was miserable that Nippon specifically with the PE team.  The operation manager is socially ackward and is completely rude and short-sighted.  I also experience harrasments from the team assistant who has been there for years but feel defensive about anyone with a higher position, she reported me for changing in the women bathroom.  I have never experience that in my life with any other firms.  Maybe it's part of a Japanese toxic culture.  The analysts on the team are great.  senior management are all Japanese male.  We had a former SVP that was very articulate, great to work with and knowledgable but he left for Japan.  He was replaced by the most recent one who can't even put sentences together.  He would never make it any other investment firm.   He would also stare at your chest and send flirty messages.  He face time me after I left the company.   The other team outside of private equity was all great and they were just really nice people.  We would have lunch together and have drinks after work occasionally.  I wish I didn't waste my time working there but glad I left.  I was miserable and depressed at Nippon and now I love my new current worker and job.  I felt lucky to have no longer be in such an environment."
