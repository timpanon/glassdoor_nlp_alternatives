8,Noah Bank,Specialist,2017-09-30,2.0,Anonymous Employee,People are really friendly and helpful. Often offered free food. Can get hired even without no / little work experience.,"Always short staffed, lack of training and overwork almost everyday.  I hardly see anyone going home on time, trust me - literally everyone is working overtime you will even feel guilty leaving the work on time even when you really shouldn't. The worst part is, you DO NOT get paid for those extra work hours. Benefits are not good, you have a lot of co-pay and deductible.Knowing Korean language and culture is a must. Because it is a small bank with only 5 branches, experiences you can have are very limited, as well as training.  Not to mention that company's name value is very low as it is small sized. So think twice."
