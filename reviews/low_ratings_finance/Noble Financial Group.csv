0,Noble Financial Group,NFG is a great Company for both entry level and seasoned Wall street professionals,2021-01-19,5.0,Director of Sales,Great company culture and environment for professional growth,None that I can think of
1,Noble Financial Group,Bottom of the Barrel,2021-01-14,1.0,Sales Representative,The only way to go from here is up!,"Highest turnover rate in the industry. Went through 4 sales directors during my tenure. All the good analysts are gone. Firm gets paid by writing glowing reports on bad companies no one wants to cover and doing biotech banking deals on obscure firms. Because he was paid by the company, one senior analyst continued to write bullish reports on a company as it went bankrupt. CEO and a sales rep almost got into a fist fight over broken promises."
2,Noble Financial Group,A learning experience in exchange for a poor salary.,2020-09-17,3.0,Research Assistant,I learned quite a bit and was given the chance to assist senior management with analysis. If I had good data my voice was heard.,"Work expectations were not commensurate with salary. Long hours, which some people expect in this industry, but sometimes this almost more cultural than practical ."
3,Noble Financial Group,Firm was under FINRA investigation. CEO was suspended,2019-03-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The only pro I can think of is that I know longer work there,"Aside from the very bad management practices that led to the FINRA investigation and suspension (all public records available online) the firm is really bad. Noble hasnt successfully led an equity deal in years and not for lack of trying. Deal flow is generally bottom of the barrel penny stocks that no one wants to invest in. The firm has been struggling to compete and that is reflected in compensation. You will never make money at Noble. They ALWAYS come up with some reason not to pay what your owed, and what they said they would pay. This is a constant that you will hear from EVERY former employee that they dont pay at all. No respect or professionalism shown to employees. Incredibly poor management and decision makers running the show. There are some very friendly people who work there but no real producers. Most people with talent left years ago due to very bad comp. CEO demands production from everyone but produces and generates almost no business or revenue himself."
4,Noble Financial Group,Director of Institutional Sales 2013,2018-10-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Noble is a vibrant full service investment bank in South Florida!
The firm allows its employees and interns grow and gain Wall Street Experience without multi-layers of Management.
If you are seeking an opportunity in Research, Investment Banking and or Institutional Sales Noble is a great place to work!",No cons for Noble Financial
5,Noble Financial Group,"Bad, struggling firm. Avoid",2018-09-06,1.0,Institutional Sales,"Good office location. A few blocks from the beach and next to lots of restaurants and bars

Some nice people work at the firm but only one or two who actually know what theyre doing

No one works very hard. Office is a ghost town by 5pm so decent work life balance","Pretty shady firm. CEO Niko Pronk was suspended by FINRA for some very sketchy stuff

Ridiculous turnover. Only 2 of 12 institutional sales people I started with two years ago are still there

Deceptive compenstation plan. They're always changing the comp plan and then never stick to it.  The very little money that comes in stays at the top

Pressured by management to sell low quality/penny stock investment banking deals. Spent months and months trying to sell deals that never ever close. NEVER. EVER. CLOSE."
6,Noble Financial Group,Poised for Growth,2017-04-02,5.0,Investment Banking Analyst,Recent success has allowed the firm to invest in key areas to support growth. New employees have joined all departments and the management have shown great initiative in fostering growth from within as well as brining on excellent leaders when needed.,The company does not have to many negatives
7,Noble Financial Group,Stay Away,2017-01-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Micro management is minimal
Gives graduates from second tier schools an opportunity to work in investment
Most favorable reviews on glassdoor are from interns","Highest turnover rate in the industry
Cheap no bonuses, money stays at the top
Record of broken promises
Hack shop that pumps bad microcap stocks
Most talent has gone, four of five remaining Analysts are one star"
8,Noble Financial Group,"Great exposure to seasoned, well-respected senior equity analysts made working at Noble a great learning environment",2015-09-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"As a junior analyst, I had the opportunity to learn from a team of seasoned equity analysts, most of which had joined Noble after many years of experience in equity research at larger investment banks.  Another plus is that you get exposure to several industry verticals as a junior analyst, rather than focusing on just one industry.  

Great place to start a career in equity research or institutional equity sales.","Hours for a junior equity analyst can be long, although, to be fair, are generally in line with industry average"
9,Noble Financial Group,A decent starting point into the finance world.,2014-12-17,4.0,Consumer Loan Officer,"Fun, fast paced, friendly environment, where you can start your career in finance","The offices are typically a little bit outdated, and not very appealing to the eyes."
