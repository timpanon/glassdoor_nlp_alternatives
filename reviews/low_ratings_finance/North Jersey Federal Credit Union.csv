8,North Jersey Federal Credit Union,Run away.,2019-10-04,1.0,Former Employee,"SOME of the co-workers are nice. Don't trust anyone, specially management. 
The health insurance is great though!","The employees that remain working here are two kinds of people: desperate souls and people that can't find a job anywhere else. Management is very unprofessional. If you work here, you will be frustrated and drained all the time and afraid of losing your job. Sometimes you will question if you are the problem, but you'll soon figure out that management is the problem.  They will also pay you an insulting salary + adding more responsibilities to your workload."
9,North Jersey Federal Credit Union,Would not recommend working here,2019-08-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Nothing other than close to home.,Honestly I have never worked for a place like this before (not in a good way) this credit union is very dysfunctional very short staffed no communication  and no help managers are always too busy to help with anything and the system is always breaking down. Members are very rude to top it off.
10,North Jersey Federal Credit Union,This place is totally lost.,2018-09-09,1.0,,"It used to be the people, but I can't say that any more. It used to be location, but I cant'say that any more. It was always the money, I can say its still that. In other words. There are no pros to working here.","No staff, employees are hired, then leave before their probation period  is up. They lie to new employees, make promises to get them in, then say they didn't say that. No one knows what's going on, this is on any day you choose. President and CEO is never at work.  Upper management is completely clueless, and forever in the dark. This credit union is a joke, credit unions all over know about them. No respect for employees. Always pointing fingers, and throwing former  employees under the bus. We were constantly losing employees, that will not be replaced. So that work gets split amongst employees still there. They used to tell employees to write good reviews here. Seriously, every body knows its a lie. You will never find a good honest review here."
11,North Jersey Federal Credit Union,This place needs help.,2018-09-07,1.0,,Coworkers are very nice and helpful,"This has been the worst company I have ever worked for. The pay is terrible and does not compensate for what you do. The management is also impeccable. The turn over is at an all time high. Almost everyone is looking for another job (including long term employees). There are many errors with the member’s bank accounts/loans that are on behalf of the credit union and upper management continues to point fingers and blame employees for their mistakes. They do not care for their employees. If there is something wrong with your personal account there, you are called a liar and treated like a fraud. Loyal members are leaving and taking their money elsewhere. Upper management also complains about the wait time in the lobby and on the phone for customers but does not take into consideration how short staffed we are, however we are still blamed and they do nothing to help. They prioritize on the unimportant things and push important things to side. Unnecessary projects are continually being thrown on employees with short deadlines that causes them to be stressed and overwhelmed, but have no one to help with their required daily tasks which causes a delay. This place is corrupt and what’s even more sad is that change is nonexistent. So many hardworking/loyal employees have left and are continually to leave for the same exact reason. If you like mistreatment, corruption, and being overworked for a small pay... then this is the place for you ."
12,North Jersey Federal Credit Union,Manager,2018-05-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,None whatever other than they do pay you.,"Way to many family members of Lourdes Cortez work at this credit union.  Do Not Apply at this company, stay far away."
13,North Jersey Federal Credit Union,Teller,2018-05-16,1.0,Member Service Representative,People with your exact job description are easy to get along with because there is a relatable struggle.,"Would you like me to begin with the pay? Or the broken promises? How about this. Ask the turn over rate? I don’t even think it exists literally this place will not thrive. Any good review up here is upper management pretending. I don’t know anyone who loves there jobs. The few ppl that have been there 10 years plus are the same miserable ppl still holding the same job title begging to make 35,000 a year. Vacation days? Lies! Days off? Lies the only ppl who thrive are senior level employees. So yes, they cut holiday parties and cry broke. As a teller you will never make over 11$ no matter how long you’re there. They do universal training but the pay doesn’t equate to work. You will NEVER move up. If you go for an interview ask someone the number of years they’ve been there and the different titles. Pay attention to how you will get hired Monday and Tuesday the person hiring you is packing for a new job. They leave out the part where if you’re kind you’ll work like a dog. Every day someone quits or stops showing up. But they lie to customers and say the person was fired. There’s so many corrupt things about this place but the BIGGEST ONE THERES KNOWN SNEAKY BUSINESS GOING KN WITHIN THIS CORP. but the little ppl are used and are disposable. RUNNN!! I would not recommend working here unless you have no motivation and enjoy ignorant atmosphere. Also work here if you want to be around a bunch of people who barely got a GED."

location pretty close to the highway so it's quick to get to.
The members are good people too.","Way big nepotism going on in that workplace. The C.E.O. gets all her information from one source and makes the decisions on it. No appreciation for a good job just always made to focus on the bad things. It doesn't matter how much good you do if you forgot to dot an ""i"" it is made the biggest deal ever and goes past whatever the good was. Always promoting her family on top of other people who have more experience or even been there longer time. its so very obvious too.
Very disorganized management always making last minute decisions or having the other people do there jobs and blame them.
there is always an excuse and it is never there fault always someone else or some other company or something like that."

Long hours including every Friday night , and Saturday. No training. Low low pay. Exhaustive work load. Low morale. They make promises they dont keep. Don't bother telling anyone, that don't care."

29,North Jersey Federal Credit Union,accounting,2015-08-05,5.0,,Friendly  family like environment. Management seems to really take an interest in the staff. They promote from within  with internal job postings. It is a great place for your first job to get experience. Sometimes I regret leaving,they don't pay as well as for profit banks but the benefits are good for a small company. I would still be working  there but I got a better  pay raise and job offer
