9,Northeast Community Bancorp,"""Run as fast as you can. Worse company to work for.""",2014-05-28,1.0,NECB Employee,The hours of operation are pretty good. The office hours are 8:30am to 4:30pm with one hour paid lunch break.,"This place is classless and egregious and this is due to poor management and stale leadership. The workplace dynamics in a nutshell is horrible. The atmosphere is unprofessional, toxic, volatile and abusive. They provide next to no training. From the onset, you are set to fail and then management harshly criticizes you out in the open. It's a very closed environment. They often jump to conclusion and judgement almost immediately with no open mindedness. They tend to assassinate a persons character and take great pride in reducing you to nothing. The harsh culture is not conducive to learning and ultimately stifles productivity. If you are looking for a workplace where they lack morals and values, and narcissism nepotism, and constant harassment runs rampant, then this is the place for you."
