9,Northern Leasing Systems,Customer service,2016-12-28,1.0,,"Great atmosphere, works easily with personal needs and schedule","Paid twice a month, low pay, worked piled on you with no raise in sight"
10,Northern Leasing Systems,Worse Female Managers Ever!!! Do NOT work here!!!,2016-06-15,1.0,Verifications Specialist,"The only pro here would be the relationship that you build with your co workers (not management). Everyone's problems here are all the same, so you build a bond and you encourage each other to get out. The only reason I gave this place 1 star is because there wasn't an option for NO stars.","It's just a downward spiral here. The employees are wonderful down to the cleaning staff. MANAGEMENT however, is a different story. The main department run by two egotistical, selfish, controlling women who think that just because their husbands support their lifestyle, they somehow should be considered royalty. There's favoritism here. The people who DONT do any work, are kept only because they are friends but the people who do all the work get treated unfairly as if they have no choice but to pick up the slack for their lazy employees (friends). No days off... only when they tell you... and no raise. When i was there, people had worked there for 8 years with out a raise. But that's what management wants. People to be there be cause they have no choice so they accept everything thrown their way. They lie to you about your schedule. You think you're working 9-6 and all of a sudden it's 10-7 ""take it or leave it"". HR is always on the side of management. You are never validated for doing a good job, everything is a problem. You have to keep records of all of your conversations with management there because they like to make you feel like you are the crazy one and that you have no idea what you're talking about. If you have the evidence there, then they will leave it alone. And if you're off (which they hate approving days off even though you're entitled to 17 but w/e) they will text you non stop trying to get you to come in. I used to ignore them. Their ""summer Fridays"" is a joke... you cannot miss ANY DAY from memorial day to labor day. If you do, you don't get to leave at 3PM on a Friday. This is only to get everyone to come in during the summer time and because they're too greedy to let everyone out 3 HOURS earlier. God forbid you get pregnant while working in this company and you can't help that you have constant morning sickness. But if the manager is pregnant, no one can stress her out and she gets to work from home."
11,Northern Leasing Systems,Account Manager,2016-06-08,2.0,Account Manager,"Great experience in collecting, working with a diverse group of people, marketable knowledge of fair credit reporting and legal oroceedings","The organization has not invested in an actual training program. Employees are just left to wing it, get knowledge from co workers and are trained on issues of the job as they arrive."
12,Northern Leasing Systems,Don't work here,2016-05-05,1.0,Customer Service Representative,There are no pros working for this company.,Everything about this company sucks.
13,Northern Leasing Systems,Administrative,2016-04-23,2.0,Equipment Liaison- Administrative Assistant,Constant challenges to make an eroding system work. Never a dull moment. Last minute deadlines due to mismanagement. But always a chance to look better than the last guy.,No management at all. Disorganization that leads to last minute deadlines and migraines over trying to manage two sections without aid of any management. A sink or swim situation all the time.
14,Northern Leasing Systems,Your soul will die a little more each day you work at NLSI,2016-04-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Medical benefits, quarterly bonuses, competitive salary","Guilt associated with essentially robbing and scamming thousands of cudtomets, management does not value employees"
15,Northern Leasing Systems,Commercial Collector,2016-03-24,1.0,Commercial Collections Representative,Has unisex bathrooms. Easy on and off the highway. Early Fridays for Shabbat. Has elevators in building.Pays 2 times per monthNone,"Sales affiliates are scam artists preying on ignorant immigrants who do not understand  American greed. Through deceptive practices, sales engages businesses with unwanted boiler plate leases, then threaten lawsuits for non payment."
16,Northern Leasing Systems,Scamming small businesses one lease at a time,2016-01-18,2.0,Asset Management,"Good way to get your foot in the door (if you're trying to transition from retail to an office setting).
Decent hourly wage 
Convenient location near the Subway
Learn A LOT about the minutiae of finalizing legal/financial documents
Good for entry level","Where do I begin...
-Just a quick Google search can give you some idea of what the Asset Management/Sales positions entail...lots of lying (or slick maneuvering around legal loopholes to get people stuck paying their leases/signing up for new ones).
-Typical call center environment, so the usual ""perks"" such as timed bathroom breaks, recorded phone calls and middle management breathing down your neck while you receive death threats over the phone.
-Disgruntled customers have LITERALLY come to the headquarters to confront the staff. Not very safe."
17,Northern Leasing Systems,Only good for freshgrads with zero experience,2016-01-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flexible schedule and PTO. The company is willing to work around your schedule, you may leave early for personal errand and it won't be counted against your PTO.

You learn a lot from working here because everything is hands-on.","Poor management, poor benefits, no performance review, no yearly raise, the company is not expanding in terms of size nor technology. The company does not care about keeping the employees happy, which leads to low employee morale. No opportunity to move up within the company. There's only so much to learn until you get bored with your job because the company is not expanding."
18,Northern Leasing Systems,Company teaches you in training how to be sneaky and get the customers to sign the contract,2015-07-13,1.0,Equipment Room,I likes the people I worked with except for my boss.,My boss lied about me and had me fired because he didn't like me.
19,Northern Leasing Systems,Manager,2015-06-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,It's a paycheck. That's about it. In a world where jobs are difficult to find it is an average job to complete as long as you're ok with routine.,Direct Management get overridden by Vice Presidents. It makes management look incompetent even though they were doing what is best for the company. No vertical movement at all.
