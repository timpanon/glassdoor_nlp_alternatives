12,Northfield Bank,"Unprofessional ""Management"", Hostile Workplace & Zero Diversity",2021-01-23,1.0,Back Office,"I cannot honestly think of one good thing that came out of working for this company. If I had to really pick something it would be the benefits they offered; 401K, PTO and medical/ dental.","Unfortunately this list is extremely long. What started out to be an exciting opportunity took a turn for the worse, within weeks. While the company holds pride in operating as a choose knit family, they all have mini groups filled with drama and talking behind each others' backs. The company employs managers, if you can even call them that, who create hostile workplace environments, have anger management issues and quite frankly do not understand what the word professionalism is. HR is all due respect, a joke. It was quite funny when managers talked badly about the HR team and told stories of this department never having the best interest of their employees, while enjoying the luxury of HR protecting them from poor behavior. I guess it makes sense now since they were once not people managers and experienced the same as us regularly employees. There are no set trainings, no SOPs in place, the technology is extremely outdated and creates difficulties in getting the job done in a timely manner. There is an ""HR handbook"" but new rules always magically appear out of thin air and cited as ""business needs"". This company does not follow rules, they make their own rules depening on the day and who it applies to. Managers rather talk to you about your personal life and the latest gossip in town than provide you feedback or help you with work. If you don't ""fit in"" with the department you are immediately criticized and get looks that something is wrong with you and you don't like your job. However, aside from all this, the biggest con is the lack of diversity of employees and leadership, particularly the back office. Representation is extremely important!"
