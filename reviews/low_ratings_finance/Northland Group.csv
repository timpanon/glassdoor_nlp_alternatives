6,Northland Group,Collection rep,2018-11-26,5.0,Collections Representative,Monticello location was awesome to work at lots of good people there and manager she was nice,If you make a small screw up you loose your commission on the money you recovered
7,Northland Group,"Great people, bad management.",2018-07-03,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Co workers are great and supportive and help you gain more skills in counseling.  Everything was great working there besides a couple of things..,Bad management and people get fired for nearly no reason.  Also very hard to climb up the ladder there in anyway unless you have a degree that you yourself can pay for. Which most people dont have the money for it.
8,Northland Group,Ok job,2018-04-02,4.0,Client Service Representative,"Great managers, very understanding. Don't micromanage","A lot of sitting, very boring and repetitive."
9,Northland Group,Horrible place to work Stay Away,2017-12-05,1.0,Debt Collector,They start you at $16.82 but it isnâ€™t really worth it,They discriminated against me because I missed a couple of days due to my child being severely ill I brought in documentation and they waited until my shift the next day and fired me through a text message
10,Northland Group,Programmer Data Analyst,2017-10-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Pay was ok! Benefits the same.,"Very negative atmosphere, they say they will train you and then they kind of forget."

12,Northland Group,Easy job but repetitive,2017-07-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great people, easy work, fun",None really besides short lunches
13,Northland Group,Manager,2017-07-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Fair in their decisions. Everyone needs to understand that decisions are made for the overall health of the company, but to impact one side or the other. Very stable company. Cutting edge in compliance that keeps everyone informed of changes in the industry  that impact their job duties.","Collections is a fickle business. Many people look at decisions and determine who this impacts me because all I care about is what is best for me. That can create turnover. This is not the most glamorous job, but if each individual can step back and look at everything from a different point of view, it will help them understand why things change. Collections is always going to be a changing business, so it can be frustrating, but that is part of the industry, not a Northland problem."
14,Northland Group,Northland group is a huge waste of time.,2017-02-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,1st and 2nd shifts available only.,"Lack of care from supervisors, high schooler attitudes from employees. Very low pay. Low job security. Very strenuous tasks with not enough reward. CEO is very strange."

The site when I was there was hitting goal, but they were not compliant with there scripting in Monticello.  Very stressful, work place, not enough managers for the amount of people  1 manager for approximately 25 people and no team leads."
23,Northland Group,Call Center Agent,2015-12-20,3.0,Call Center Agent,Great work environment and experience,Low hourly rate pay scale
24,Northland Group,"Some good people there, but that's about it...",2015-12-13,1.0,Account Representative,I met many nice people while working there. Doughnuts on Friday's and at one-time allowed unlimited overtime.,"Constant changes to compensation plans, which never benefited the collectors. Disorganized management which employed an ""us vs. them"" mentality with the front line staff. Irregular hours including late nights and early mornings as well as pressure to work on Saturdays."
25,Northland Group,Do the job,2015-11-04,3.0,Leadership Roll,"NGI is a fairly positive employee experience within the industry. Compliance is key within the office, and shady or negative practices are highly penalized or very discouraged throughout the culture and standards within the office. I learned a lot while working here. They spend some time and money on their employees through activities or catering food on occasion. Some alright people. Okayish benefits. No need to bring work home.","Money is the name of the game, a person's effectiveness very much impacts the perception of their value within the office. It's a business in collecting money, the company is transparent in it's intention. No 401K match. Not a ton of paths for advancement."
26,Northland Group,Great co-workers and environment,2015-06-24,4.0,,"Great bunch of co-workers at Northland Group.  Flexible scheduling, good pay and benefits.","Sometimes have to work either really early or late, do a few things that are outside my job duties, and can be a lot of new policies and procedures to learn."
27,Northland Group,unfair,2015-01-21,1.0,,none none none none none,would not rehire me after a buy out
28,Northland Group,okay if you need a job right away,2014-10-21,1.0,Account Representative,I stayed at Northland Group for longer than I should have because the people were great and we were able to make our own schedule. Also the PTO time given was decent for a small company.,"The benefits are not great.  They offer health benefits, however they are very expensive and there is no 401k match. Benefits for a family run 600 a month!   You cannot even access your own money in the 401k if you need it you have to take a loan out. They constantly change the pay structure and have no regard for their employees well being.  All of a sudden you are making 20,000 less a year and cannot pay your mortgage but you have to have clean credit to be work there, how does that make sense. There is no room for growth as all of the managers have been there for a long time and they rarely hire managers.  If you are a woman and want to move up forget it.  There were two women managers and one was laid off!  It is a boys club for sure!   Things are constantly changing and they make up stories and lie to you about why they make the changes(like we really do not know they are lying).  You have hefty goals to meet and if you are lucky and get fed accounts from the managers you will do okay.  If not it is really tough to meet the goals as most of the money comes from inbound calls. Most of the accounts are really old and people are shocked when you call them.  It is a really boring and stressful job.  If you have a college degree and are not desperate for a job I would look elsewhere."
29,Northland Group,Do not go to work here!,2014-09-22,1.0,Debt Collector,Other collectors are easy to get along with.,"They treat their employees like their a piece of meat. Low pay, they did have a $16.83 pay scale with a lower commission rate, however they have gotten rid of this and are firing  most collectors in that salary range and hiring new ones, at a much lower wage. There software system sucks just like the management, both so outdated. 
They are big on firing employees with no valid justification, because they know it is a work at will state. 

Future potential clients if your reading this, you don't want to do business with this co."
