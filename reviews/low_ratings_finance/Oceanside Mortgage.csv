0,Oceanside Mortgage,BEWARE RIP OFF ALERT,2019-07-16,1.0,QUALIFIED EMPLOYEE NEVADA Senior LOAN OFFICER,THIS WAS NOTHING BUT AN EMBARRASSMENT AND  WASTE OF TIME COSTING ME MONEY.,"WASN'T PAID for the purchase loan that funded June 20, 2019. I have submitted a formal COMPLAINT with the California Department of Corporations Business Oversight to warn and protect Borrowers and other Loan Officers of this unethical and fraudulent business practices and conduct.
I was not paid for my time nor my Nevada License as I was approved as the Qualified Employee for the State of Nevada.

I was subjected to unprofessional and unethical conduct and intimidation by Oceanside Mortgage Company management.

I believe this is a SCAM to Ripoff Loan Officers of their commission very sketchy at best.
