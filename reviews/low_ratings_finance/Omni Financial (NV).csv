1,Omni Financial (NV),Just Ok,2021-08-19,3.0,Anonymous Employee,You can learn new things but very little ownership in projects.,Very little upward mobility. No clear strategies used for improvement.

6,Omni Financial (NV),Ok place to work,2020-12-30,3.0,Customer Care Specialist,"small space, work with the same people","poor management, not enough pay."
7,Omni Financial (NV),HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!,2020-08-07,1.0,Customer Service Specialist,Coworkers (minus ALL management) are great sometimes and it feels like a small family,MANAGEMENT IS TERRIBLE! Absolutely terrible. That is the only word that comes to mind when thinking about this whole company. Management thinks of you as just another number to them. There is no work-life balance at all. If you need to take time off to be with your child during a pandemic or for anything at all then all they tell you is that they are very disappointed and NEED you to be there. They change policies all the time which makes it impossible to keep up with what is correct. There is no room for advancement and management does everything in their power to make sure that you never get raises or move up in the company.
8,Omni Financial (NV),Tough,2019-08-15,2.0,General Manager,I had an excellent and dedicated staff.,My boss stole my position out from under me.
9,Omni Financial (NV),"Good potential, but weak upper management makes it hard to breathe",2019-02-06,4.0,General Manager,17 paid days and the federal holidays are a definite plus.,"Image working for a place where things changed last week and you find out today. Where they use bonus as an incentive during hiring process, but do everything to take it away."
10,Omni Financial (NV),Collector,2018-08-16,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great pay, bonus program is awesome, and the coworkers",Management is horrible and does not care about you.
11,Omni Financial (NV),CSR,2018-07-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Paid back work environment. 
They were understanding when things unexpected came up.
Pay was OK.
Hours were good","You didn't get any of the benefits until after 90 days. (Except the holidays off, but you don't get paid for them)
Some rude people on the phone."
12,Omni Financial (NV),Not worth it,2018-07-11,1.0,Ccs,"The work never changes, you do the same thing everyday. It’s not a hard job, just frustrating when you’re getting people to commit to loans and they don’t understand what they’re signing. Omni isn’t a bad job if you’re looking for something easy and flexible if you’re a milspo but if you get bored quickly it’s not for you. Each individual office has their own vibes and a lot of people stay for years so they get complacent and believe that it’s “their” office. It’s a great learning opportunity for a new/young spouse, but definitely not something to make a career out of.","You cannot take any vacation days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. You can get audited for the smallest thing and your manager will act like it’s the end of the world. The hours aren’t terrible unless you don’t want to get home after 7 every night. Bonuses are okay, you have to hit all 5 marks to get a good one. They tend to use and abuse certain employees to make sure everything gets done."
13,Omni Financial (NV),TERRIBLE COMPANY & UPPER MANAGEMENT,2018-01-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Business hours
 Co-workers
Learned a new skill","No breaks, no opportunities for advancement, miserable pay, unsupportive upper management that only cares about the office meeting $ goals, gives a bonus but tries to find a reason to revoke it before you get it and the list goes on and on."
14,Omni Financial (NV),Omni...,2018-01-25,3.0,Customer Care Specialist,"Good benefits, scheduling manager works with you, bonuses are great and we even haven auctions every month.","SVP does not care about anything/anyone unless it's making our numbers. Numerous good employees have quit due to this. Maybe if management cared more about their employees, they'd be more motivated."
15,Omni Financial (NV),Entry level lending,2017-10-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Easy to get hired, easy to gain experience in financial industry. If you are a hard worker they are very flexible. Doesn't start at very good pay but it is entry level and not that hard to get promoted and get raises if you are a hard worker.",Can be very stressful especially around the holidays.
16,Omni Financial (NV),Satisfactory-needs major improvement,2017-05-05,2.0,Credit Specialist,"Work stations are spacious, parking is good. Work hours are okay.  Bonuses (after 90 days of employment)","Pay, pay, pay!
Trainer 
Pettiness 
Employee's credit requirements 
Hiring process 
No natural light (blinds closed) allowed in, feels like you're in a basement."
17,Omni Financial (NV),Omni Financial Services,2017-01-24,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Expierence in lending and compliance is wonderful.,Pay is barely over minimum wage
18,Omni Financial (NV),Customer Care Specialist,2016-11-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Absolutely Loved the office and people I worked with. Manager was great, he really cared about his employees and customers.","Pay was not comparable to the geographic area for the amount of work we were responsible for. We were doing two jobs, sales and collections, for the pay of one."
19,Omni Financial (NV),Great company.,2015-10-13,5.0,Customer Service Representative,Excellent staff. Small company. You get the family feel. The company is wonderful at acknowledging your personal accomplishments as well as how well your office is doing. Good bonuses for each month. 5 bonus opportunities per month. Potential for raise every 6 months. You get your loan officer license paid by the company. The customers are often long-time customers and are great to work with. Great company.,The pay isn't great. Sometimes there is a TON of work to do and other times there is barely anything to do. If you are not a self-motivated individual this can be difficult. Collections are not fun to do and can feel a bit high pressured.
