3,Opal Financial Group,Awful,2021-09-25,1.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),It was a job at least. Wasn’t that great.,"Pays people pennies to do outreach & commission structure was terrible. Only a few events were successful so if you weren’t on them, tough luck."
4,Opal Financial Group,Terrible.,2021-08-06,1.0,Former Employee,Conference traveling was the best part.,"Dealing with terrible management. They will hire anyone willing to work for peanuts. It’s NYC, you literally cannot live off of what they pay. They micromanage to a high extent check how many calls you have been making. Even the mouse thats moving. You’re better off working at McDonalds for 15 an hour since its the same thing. They pay you what you make in a regular retail stores, but they want a degree. They used to have a bonus not anymore, its legit bogus. When i first came in it gave me pyramid scheme vibes. Staying there is masochism, you can find a better job. Super expensive health care, legit like a quarter after taxes on your paycheck is gone."
5,Opal Financial Group,Overbearing,2021-05-10,1.0,Business Development,They have summer Fridays which is good.,Would not recommend working here.
6,Opal Financial Group,Great staff. Poor management.,2021-05-01,3.0,Anonymous Employee,The people and relationships built within.,Management. Lack of accountability & structure as it pertains to career mapping/growth.
7,Opal Financial Group,Nothing good here,2021-04-03,2.0,Business Development,There are no pros to this company.,"Low pay

9,Opal Financial Group,Good,2020-09-24,5.0,Business Development Associate,There is a room for growth,Get improve training but overall its good
10,Opal Financial Group,Worse than Awful,2020-08-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,You get to bond with your colleagues who equally hate this job and company as much as you do.,"Honestly, this place is beyond unprofessional and toxic. The managers are extremely gossipy with bullying culture. They are fake and incompetent. The CEO is a coward who sits in his office and nags team leads why people aren’t performing, while not understanding that his business model is outdated. He has no sense of reality, or respect for his employees. The salaries are an actual joke. Competitors offer double, do the research. He pries on people desperate for a job, or eager young people coming out of college. This job is a call center at best. Office culture is extremely catty and none of the teams will work together. Please take the time to review these ratings seriously, it’s not far from the truth. The positive ratings you see here are because the CEO forces HR and marketing to write positive reviews. Most of us who leave are in a way better place and those who are still there will pretty much be there for their lifetime because they know nothing else. There’s so many better opportunities with professionalism and proper pay. Do not apply."
11,Opal Financial Group,Honest,2020-07-05,1.0,“Business Development”,"You learn how to communicate, it’s a stepping stone. Have a plan to exit after a year at the most!","Management is the worst in my career, not a long term company. They are unprofessional and toxic."
12,Opal Financial Group,"No growth, Micromanaging, Gossipy",2020-06-15,2.0,Anonymous,There aren't much pros about working at Opal Group besides the fact that they are located in Midtown and that you can actually learn something from the conferences.,"- Low pay all around and benefits is terrible. 
- Micromanaging to the MAX - the CEO and IT monitors your every move on the computer and calls 
- They expect you to make over 100 calls/day, they don't care about the quality of the call and they don't care how much money you can bring in from each call. They only care about you making over 100 calls 
- The CEO only cares about money and sales people that brings in the money 
- The office is full of gossip, it is highschool all over again
- People that have worked there for a while think they are entitled and don't have to follow company policies. 
- Leadership ALWAYS argue, you could hear them screaming at each other through the walls"
13,Opal Financial Group,Business development,2020-03-01,1.0,Business Development,"As someone mentioned free pizza, it’s in midtown so lots of places to eat and shop","Everything about this place is horrible, management is a joke, Hr is a joke, the legal team isn’t legitimate, there’s nothing to learn, there’s no way up"
14,Opal Financial Group,The worst place to work. BEWARE. You will be poor,2020-02-14,1.0,Investor Relations,"All these reviews are fake and I think Glassdoor should investigate the IP address because not one is accurate. Absolutely no pros. This place is a scam with unethical policies , I would urge any young person looking for experience to not apply! You are ruining your reputation by agreeing to work for such an awful company. 
Where do I even start? First off agreeing to work here you are selling yourself short and signing up to be paid below minimum wage . Just keep looking for other jobs and don’t settle for this embarrassment. Not one successful person in that company except the CEO. People have been working their 10+ and are barely making ends meat. No homeowners, zero assets , laughable health insurance that’s god awful and no 401ks. These people are doomed. It’s sad, but those same people are the problem. They have zero respect for their employees. They have bizarre business practices , the CEO owes ex employees 5-10k of thousands of dollars in commission. The IT guy is a weird perv. And a lot of times you will hear the CEO having screaming matches with his staff.. to a point where us employees have to ask him to please shut his office door so the rest of us can make 100+ cold calls.  They will hire anybody, homeless, junkie, one tooth, neck tattoos, no college degree - it doesn’t matter because they pay nothing!",To continue on with the sad truth of this company. So many weird business practices I don’t know where to begin. Anytime you travel for business it’s under the CEOs name so when they send you for a conference they will book you a double room under the CEOs name and you have to tell the hotel staff yes he will be coming later when he is Ofcourse not and just a cheapo who books everything under points.
15,Opal Financial Group,"Good first job, would not stay too long",2020-02-04,3.0,Business Development Associate,They will hire you if you apply,Have to make 70+ cold calls a day which can be excruciatingly tiring
16,Opal Financial Group,Could do with a lot of changes,2020-02-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The job looked fairly easy and had a lot of growth opportunities because they are still stuck with 90s technology.
Innovation opportunities (or so I thought)","Unfortunately they set me up with a team that had 0 knowledge on the position I was hired for so they would ask for random files to be created for no reason. Would then redo them because you did not use the format that they wanted and then rub it in your face that you had not done the work.

Could not get them to understand anything, even during calls, as they only heard one out of every 10 things out of my mouth. One of the team members would actually question every single thing proposed with “what do you mean by...” and would go on to rant about a random subject not important to the role. This same colleague would constantly be condescending and treat you like you didn’t know anything when you asked or proposed things. Should really work on their people skills.

There were multiple opportunities to advance and innovate because their current structure was very outdated but since my direct team had no idea what I was talking about 90% of the time, none of that could even be implemented or planned.

The first week I asked for data and numbers so a correct assessment could be done so we could improve and I was literally told I was thinking too much and just to work on gaining followers.

The CEO apparently has crazy expectations that can’t be met. And restricts the content almost entirely.

The second week I was asked to do a full marketing strategy and later was told I was once again going too in depth.  

I was only here for a very short time as I could tell it would be a pain to deal with the coworkers and implement any successful strategies with their current mindset."

24,Opal Financial Group,Life Sucking Experience,2018-03-26,1.0,,"At most a jump start, little to no barrier to entry as it hires anyone who is willing to work for peanuts","Where do I begin? 
You are left to your devices literally with no support other than ""you got to work hard to succeed"" advise. I do agree that you have to work hard at anything you do but you need direction and a strong product that people want. The pay, is laughable at best and the amount of work it takes to get that one sale,  honestly not worth it. There is a lot of favoritism and unless you really need the experience, just move on to the next job."

-Low pay, with no bonuses, or raises. 
- You're micromanaged by a few people who place themselves in charge of the rest of the business development staff. 
-Greedy, upper management who  will not even speak to you.
-The office is filthy, bed bugs, dirty tables, floors etc.
-You work with a bunch of teenagers because you can pay them practically nothing, and they'll stay for the experience.

If you're looking for a suit and tie atmosphere this is definitely not your place, as Opal Group is a casual place to work. We don't see clients inside the office (unless scheduled) so it is an enjoyable, comfortable atmosphere. It's a great place to learn and build a foundation for your resume and enjoy doing so. Managers and CEO are super involved and have an open door policy so whenever you want to stop by and speak to them, they make time for you.","It's a small Company, so the budget is pretty strict.
