0,Optinuity Alliance,"""Misery"" with Kathy Bates is a good metaphor.",2014-02-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Free parking, close proximity to Westchester County Airport, so you can flee at jet-speed once you've collected your wits.","Unpaid, un-thanked, mandatory overtime. Work/life balance is a joke. A management style that makes ""Mad Men"" look like The Puppy Bowl. Filled to the brim with condescending, mean, self-important people with limited social skills, many of whom have let the best years of their lives slip by. Don't be one of them. This company is actually MBIA, pretending to be something else in order to assist it's considerable litigation challenges. Do not climb aboard this iceberg-bound cruise to somewhere north of nowhere."
