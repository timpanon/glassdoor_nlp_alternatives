1,Opus CMC,"Stay far, far away...",2020-09-29,1.0,Underwriter,Option to work from home.,Far too many to list.
2,Opus CMC,Defending the negative,2020-02-19,3.0,Forensic Underwriter,"I feel like I need to defend some of the negative reviews here. 
I have been a contractor with Opus for just over a year. While granted the pay is not what I would like, or used to receive with contract positions in the past, you are paid commensurate with the type of work being performed. 
You work autonomously with little to no management or lead interference. 
You have the ability to work OT up to the limits of what is permitted for your group. You are pretty much able to set your own schedule. 
If you need time away for an appointment or emergency it is not a problem so long as you are a good producing team member.  
I recently had a family emergency following a cross country move. I had to either work very few hours or none at all. It was not a problem. Granted my time off was not paid, but I also was able to retain my position without interruption. I am grateful for this as I believe my time off from any other company would have resulted in my not having a job at all. 
The work is very easy, but you really need to pay attention to the training tools you have been provided. 
Each client has specific items the elect to write defects for. If you are trying to reinvent the wheel by trying to underwrite via your frontline knowledge this type of review will be frustrating for you. You really have to just do the review the way the client has asked. 
You have a large group of available mentors who have spent extensive time working for each client and they are readily available to help and answer questions. Most questions are answered within minutes of sending the initial request. 
At times it does get a bit confusing as there are frequent changes to the process. But it has been my experience that this is due to the senior core members “tweeking” the process to make it more efficient for the type of review being performed. 
Things do move quickly so if you don’t like change, or are afraid to pay attention this will not be the place for you. 
There are deadlines and you are often asked to help make the push towards meeting this goal. It is not different than any job in their requesting this. It is not forced OT, just the request that you help if you are able. 
There are multiple contract agencies that stuff for this position and each have their own pay scales. Of course they want to pay you the lowest salary possible to ensure they are getting the most income in return for placing you. Again, this is no different from any company. 
If you don’t like the salary being offered, don’t take the position. It isn’t Opus’ fault that you accepted a position that you feel is paying you less than you feel you are entitled. 
If you enjoy working autonomously, aren’t afraid to follow directions and willing to step up and put in some extra hours when the push is needed, you will be fine here. 
If you don’t want to put in the effort to be a part of a team, don’t take the position.","We do have some IT challenges. 
We do have times when the system is down. Some of it is paid down time and some of it isn’t. 
The main system we use for the client is a bit outdated and could be updated to a more user friendly and efficient model. 
But again, to do this would result in downtime and extra cost to the company. 
At times, the training is confusing as you are given a lot of information in a short period where those doing the training are simply regurgitating what is written on paper. 
More hands on during training would help people when they go live. 
Recognition isn’t always given to contract staff for their efforts, but a lot of recognition goes out to core staff. This can be frustrating and you often have to pat yourself on the back. 
A lot of people hired do not have mortgage experience and this is reflected on the file flow where you receive things that frustrate you due to lack of “pre file work” or you just shake your head asking “how did this file get this far”.  It is often easier to just do what has been missed and keep it moving vs sending it back for completion. 
I did recently have an interview for a major bank/mortgage company where I was told in no uncertain terms that they will not hire anyone who has worked with Opus. So I am not sure if the company reputation is a result of this or what. I can’t have an extended gap on my resume without explanation. 
Other than this I really don’t have a lot of “cons” to state for what I do in my position. 
Work life is what you make it."
3,Opus CMC,Good Pay,2020-01-29,4.0,Agronomist,The pay was good and they offered overtime,I enjoyed it when there was a lot of work to do but when projects slow down they would send us home with no pay and we would have to wait for more work to come in so that part was not so great

5,Opus CMC,Worst employer in my 25 year career,2019-07-14,1.0,Underwriter,Company is so desperate for staff they hire anyone.   Management has no clue about actual qualifications needed.,"Lowest wages in the industry.  Owned by a foreign staffing company which explains the lack of raises for 3 years running.  Original owners sold out to foreign company and left, but old guard management still present and does not care about morale.  Profits above everything.

7,Opus CMC,Great place to work,2019-05-22,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great flexibility. Pay is competitive with the competition. Less layoffs than competition. When it is busy, there is ample overtime available. Ability to work on new live loans, closed loans, to forensic investigate loans. If you have a positive attitude, it is a good place to work for sure. Much of the staff thinks they are ""owed"" something from this company. The only thing that is owed is a paycheck for the hours they work. It is run like a corporate business which is a change from what most of the tenured staff is used to.","If you are a negative person with a bad attitude, this is not the place for you. It is very cyclical so there could be on-call situations periodically which will push your negativity. Most of the tenured staff is not affected by on-call."
8,Opus CMC,Escape the normal routine,2019-03-19,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been at Opus for a few years and what I appreciate most are the flexible work hours, the ability to work from home, and comparatively low stress in relation to other mortgage operations jobs.

They never have work, and they put their employees on call every other month. Management never gets back to you. And the pay isn’t that good compared to other underwriting jobs.","The pay sucks, there’s hardly any work. Always on call. No communication from upper management. When they put you on call they don’t offer you any type of assistance, and if they let you go from being on call for over 30 days there is no severance package.  They use and abuse their employees. When they have work they want you to work all this extra overtime however the other amount of time spent at home not working"

28,Opus CMC,Nepatism City,2016-02-16,1.0,Forensic Underwriter,OPUS has an Office conveniently located close to my residence making the commute short and sweet. If your related or  College Cronies your advancement is assured. No real knowledge necessary,After working at OPUS for a few weeks you find out all the or most of the Quality Control Staff  and leads are all related and most have only worked for OPUS and have no other Mortgage Experience. You get told  a Final Inspection Cert. isnt required for an Appraisal that is'' subject to'' or rescission is required for a 2nd home. Your assigned to  Forensics with an emphasis on Fraud and no one on the floor even knows common fraud scheme terminology. I have worked for 3 Due Diligence Firms so far and they are the most nepotistic work environments Ive ever encountered
29,Opus CMC,Opus tainted my career,2016-02-13,1.0,Deal Manager,"Before the massive layoffs, you could work as much O/T as you could handle.  Quality is 3rd nature - just produce.  You can work remote, but the work is sporadic.  Surfing the web and taking extra long lunch breaks are normal with no punishment.","Brookfield-office ops managers said staff should be happy to have a job.  Less than 3 months later - 30% are gone.  Company's reputation makes getting another job very tough.  My old company would not hire me because I work for Opus CMC.  Lots of back-stabbing and lies.  Pay is at the bottom of the industry.  Bonuses are just lip-service and tied to production.  Production numbers are set before deals are ready.  When the true extent of the work involved is found out, management says ""Tough.""  Brookfield office is small with no privacy and lots of noise.  With the big layoffs, remaining staff take their time doing what work remains and ops managers seem blind.  Parking is horrible and bathrooms are broken 1/2 the time.   Lay-offs are done by email!  Managers have no ethics or capabilities.   Company owned by foreign outsourcing company tat is moving jobs back home at 1/3 of the salaries."
30,Opus CMC,"No direction, no understanding of the industry or their employees",2016-02-05,1.0,QC Underwriter,"Very little pros. I would say that little supervision would be a positive but the is also a negative because no one effectively manages the incompetent employees. 
Pay can be good when you work. If you like to work inconsistently then this would be a positive.","An Indian company bought them (WIPRO) a year ago and  a year later, as everyone predicted (even though they lied and said it wasn't going to close)-- Seattle office is now closed. Good thing I quit before this happened. Lack of qualified management and who they put in management is baffling. Clickey office politics. If you don't know some one of importance, you will go no where. Experienced, seasoned employees put into menial roles. You have to beg to get onto a deal or they will lay you off. Poor communication from the top down. Promises of more work coming, broken, lies galore. Underwriters doing redundant work, low morale due to not knowing if you will have a job every day you come in because the project you are on will be ending but then on the other hand there are overworked employees required to work 5-10 hours of overtime for over 2 months (including during the holidays) because they don't know how to load balance and utilize the seasoned staff and qualified resources. Absolutely NO oversight of employees that take advantage of the system. I have to say, for the most part, the other negative reviews are pretty spot on."
31,Opus CMC,Underwriter,2016-01-26,1.0,Underwriter,Flexible schedule if you can call it that.  Sometimes the deal manager wanted 80 hours a week if they were on a deadline to make their huge bonus for completing the job on time.,"No consistency.  I was placed on call for a while, then my employment was terminated  ( I was not informed of the termination).  When a big job came up they called me back but required I complete all paperwork for a new hire...... after being with the company for 11 years, this was an insult!  No wonder they can not keep good people!"
32,Opus CMC,New level of lying and arrogant greed,2016-01-17,1.0,Human Resources Director,"No one gets fired.  Easy to work lots of overtime and not have to increase production.  Managers are not smart enough to see what staff is doing.  Easy to surf Internet, play games on cell phones and run errands, but get paid for all it.  You do not need any underwriting experience to underwrite here.  Just lie on your resume.",Top managers care about money and nothing else.  CEO lies with smile on her face.  95% of all managers were promoted with no competition and the poor level of business acumen shows.  Clientele is leaving for competition after serious mistakes.
33,Opus CMC,Must be flexible,2016-01-17,4.0,QC Analyst,"Frequent availability of overtime work. Able to work one day a week and overtime from home. Casual work attire.

Staff can work extra hours without increasing production - just get the day's numbers done by the end of the day.  Easy to pad your paycheck without doing extra work.,"Company is run by lying to staff.  Production, production, production - make money for the managers.  Quality is a low priority though managers pay lip-service to it in front of clients.  Management said everything was great, more and more work coming in, expanded the office in Seattle then closed it less than 2 months later.  Ops manager said, nothing to worry about - rumors of closing are just rumors.  We got less than 2 weeks notice we would be out of a job.  Completely blindsided!  Health insurance is very very expensive with high premiums especially for spouses and children.  Work being sent overseas to cut costs.  Found out that competition does not want to hire ex-employees?  It was like a stain on my resume.  ""Yes"" people are promoted and fail to get job done.  Takes 3 ""managers"" to do the job of 1 manager at other companies.   Uncoordinated staff planning - lots of changes - mass confusion."

The deals I worked were very well run and the local deal managers are approachable plus updated us weekly.","There is little or no collaboration let alone communication between departments, unless there are major mistakes made. When errors are made, often the files along are just passed along without your knowledge. When you will be informed of your errors it is frequently weeks or months later. There is absolutely no consistency with quality assurance reviews, asking multiple sources results in several contradictory answers..There are glaring issues in the review process, which are not addressed because, "" We have never be asked to look for that in the past."""
57,Opus CMC,"Prepare to Work....For ""FREE"" Often...",2014-04-01,1.0,Underwriter,"When you first start at Opus you are excited to be back in the saddle within the mortgage industry that these days consists of bread crumb pickings.  They pay a decent salary for what the work requires and offer an incentive based on production (incentive is very low).  After about a month or so you quickly realize you don't really have a schedule per say, it's more of complete your ""8"" hours in the day which they assume you will meet your production requirement and on to the next day.  So from the outside looking in the ""flexible schedule and good pay"" seems very attractive and at times it is.  Personal time off is also very easy to get approval for which is great.  But the DARKNESS falls quickly on this illusion.  Read entire ""CONS"" post.","Where to start....  I've been with the company for 1-1/2 years and I am considered a permanent Underwriter.  What that means vs. being contracted at this point alludes me because we are all being put on-call constantly with no rime or reason after the Indian company buyout in December.  The promises of growth to our faces has turned out to be lies to keep us at bay while they slowly diminish the UW population down by putting people on-call for extended periods of time.  The other dynamic which is unheard of is the office ambiance that management has created.  The place is an open offices so there are no cubicle walls to seperate your neighbor from you so the office is entirely open where you can see all of the staff.  This may sound like an awesome environment where ""freedom of speech"" would run wild but in this case its the complete opposite.  Management has it like this so they can monitor who get's up when, and how often and who is talking to who, etc.  They don't want people interacting together to build any sort of comradery because they would face the possibility that all the staff would revolt.  The Director of my office told one of my colleagues after 2 months of being on staff to not bring in any personal pictures or belongings when asked if she could to dress up her desk.  Never heard that before unless the company has a very high turnover rate.. 

Now on to Wipro, the Indian firm that purchased Opus in December.  They have promised the employees the world from the word go with relation to endless growth possibilities both within Opus and with Wipro alike.  They have promised advanced technology platforms to enhance the production capabilities of each Underwriter and Quality Control Specialist.  So far what we have seen is the following:  they have had integration issues, no updates to the due diligence OS to enhance productivity with the exception of providing more ""Indian"" staff the capability to do more of the data entry / Underwriting on multiple projects taking away the hours from Underwriters being put on-call throughout the Opus office locations.  God forbid you ask anyone in a supervisory role what is going on, the typical response is ""we don't know what's going on.....""(with a dumb founded facial expression)

The truth is, at least in my office the individuals in a managerial capacity are all friends and or former colleagues for many years.  They like to keep to themselves and are very cryptic about what is going on and what is coming next.  These days we don't know if we have projects lined up for the next day, the next week or if they are going to lay everyone off.  The new theme is to have weekly meetings with the office staff to provide a sense of ""transparency"" as the office Director likes to call it.  This meeting provides the staff with updates to the latest projects that are in the pipeline scheduled to start on ""X"" date with ""X"" # of files to review.  So far in the last 2 months we've had at least 5 staff meetings and just about every project that has been mentioned has either been an illusion to avoid panic or has been drastically smaller from its originally anticipated size causing Opus management to ""adjust"" the number of Underwriters it needs for said project.  

This brings me to the part that is the largest ""CON"" literally:
A large portion of the Underwriting staff has experienced being put on-call collectively to total weeks worth of income loss with no reasoning.  How is it that a firm that promotes itself profitable and sound and is also now owned by a very large Indian firm with a very large balance sheet.  How can they treat there employee's with such carelessness?  I'll tell you how, because they know they can.  They know the mortgage / lending market is all but dried up and they have the choice to use and abuse its staff with no recourse to them.  ""If you don't like being put on call then quit"" (one underwriter was told by phone).  THE OTHER PORTION OF THIS THAT IS ILLEGAL IS THE FACT THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE FACING A VERY LARGE LAWSUIT FOR VIOLATING LABOR LAWS.  Let me explain:  Opus's timekeeping system is based on a productivity basis which means Opus pays it's staff for the amount of time the staff is actually working on it's files vs. actual work time all together.  Example:  You work on a file for 3 hours from start to finish.  When you login in to the due diligence platform and pull up your file is when your ""actual clock"" starts and stops when you ""complete"" you loan.  This is a flawed system and they know it because they are not paying you for the time you are walking into your office location, sitting at your desk, booting up your system, logging in to the system, searching for your project and finding your file.  If you add up the amount of time loss from just this example the minutes add up.  And if you do the math and add up the time collectively from each office location your looking at many hours of ""unpaid labor"".  I am a hourly Underwriter and i am not getting paid hourly for being at work, working.  I am being paid for my productivity in the due diligence platform.  My contractual agreement with Opus states I am an hourly employee not paid on production, however incentive is based on production (remote staff are paid per file which makes sense using the above example).  THE OTHER PART TO THIS EQUATION WHICH IS ALSO ILLEGAL is how many Underwriters work more hours than reported daily to meet the production goals set by management to fly under the radar.  Example:  The project I'll be working on calls for 15 loans to be produced at an 8 hour clip.  If it takes me 10-12 hours to meet my 15 loan requirement that day and only report 8 hours worked then it looks as if I am meeting my production goal.  This is common place and is illegal.  This is the same reason why Bank of America was sued and lost a class action lawsuit several years back because they required employees to meet certain goals and ""expected"" them to meet those goals with whatever means available.  Many worked for free for months until someone woke up and sued them.  They are now fighting a 2nd lawsuit with a similar labor dispute from 2012-2013 for not paying overtime to employees that ""worked"" those hours but the system did not report it.  

Unfortunately OPUS is heading down the same path because management is aware of this and they do nothing about it besides ""congratulate"" the staff that is actually meeting production (be it working excessive hours for free).  They promote this behavior by setting the production goal well above the attainable figure to not only get free labor but to not have to pay the incentive out to the Underwriting ""masses"".

I had high hopes to grow with this company and made every attempt to enhance my understanding of the workflow, inner workings of the deals and interoffice dynamics with it's management staff.  All I have experienced is ""it will never happen"" because they are not designed for you to grow.  Think of a factory setting with the workers working in a line.  The foreman does not want the line worker to advance because they have fear that the line worker will one day replace them so they repress the staff to not know what they do and or what their boss does.  All a mystery and secret.  At this point it doesn't really matter what happens with the company because the owners and directors made out like bandits with the sale of the company.  Last I heard the dual owners sold the company for $80+ million with a 2 year golden parachute guaranteed position.  I have to imagine that the Directors of the offices also received nice perks and golden parachutes after the conclusion of the sale.

MY APOLOGIES FOR THE LONG POST BUT I WANTED TO CLEAR THE AIR WITH MANY FACTS SURROUNDING THIS FIRM, AND I HOPE THIS HELPS ANY AND ALL OUT THERE THAT NEED CLARITY.

Bottom line:  If you are an existing employee like myself and or are a former employee and you read my post and have experienced similar activities to those outlined as not within the scope of the law please be patient because this will come out and it will be addressed soon and you will have your day to speak out as well."
58,Opus CMC,Great company - stay out of IT,2014-03-31,2.0,Anonymous Employee,The staff is like a small family.  Upper management is very friendly (in operations) and they truly want to do what is right for the company. Stay on the operations side and out of  IT.,"A group of people came from another company and they are stuck in their ways. No outward thinking.  If you are in the click then you are safe even if you under perform. If you are not a part of the click then be careful on what you do, as they think you are against them. Childish for a company of this size."
59,Opus CMC,Worst Experience Ever,2014-03-26,1.0,Employee Relations Manager,"They have direct deposit, if you get an interview there use it to sharpen your skills but if an offer comes your way; you should really think about it. 

I enjoyed working with and engaging with my teammates.","Like any new job your going to be excited, want to bring great/new/different perspectives and new thinking on how to approach things. Sadly every idea, innovation, improvement brought forward was met with a resounding ""no"". Talk about crushing ANY initiative or desire to make things better - forget it. 

ZERO collaboration - you'll have no idea whats going on with the business - your one on ones will be one way only. Expect cryptic answers as to why certain things are done. If your looking for transparency you wont find it here. 

People quit bosses not Companies. I had high expectations of my direct superior & their boss sadly it was a HUGE disappointment over all."
60,Opus CMC,You get what you put in,2014-03-23,4.0,Deal Manager,"The company is very flexible in work schedules and dress codes. I'm not saying I would recommend doing this, you are not going to be disciplined for being a little late to work here and there or if you want to wear a hoody and jeans to work. They provide free coffee, and cheap fitness programs for you to participate in on breaks or after work. The company tries to accommodate people with long commutes or just hectic family lives and schedules by allowing them to work remotely. If you put in the work that any half decent employee should, the pay is pretty decent also.

Employees choose to work remotely for their own benefit and the company tries hard to accommodate them. I see other reviews saying that remote employees are treated poorly... They are not treated poorly but they don't have he same benefits as in office employees. In my opinion remote employees who work in the comfort of their own home and are given the ability to take care of their house and kids cannot expect to be treated just the same as employees who come in to the office and bust their butts every day. It is a proven fact that remote employees are less productive, provide lower quality work, and require a LOT more effort to manage effectively. Remote employees are not provided the same benefits as full time employees in office and I see nothing wrong with that. The company is accommodating YOU. If you want benefits, drive your butt into the office. You get what you put in. If you want the company to work hard for you, you better work hard for them.","Employees find it difficult to jump from one project to another and need to find the ability to acclimate and learn quickly. With an abundance of work coming in, there is always a big push for quality production, but it's pretty typical for the mortgage industry."
