The company doesn't treat you to lunch or anything. They don't make the job fun. It's legit an 8 hour job where you're like a robot, especially if you're a college student. That's it. Once you start it's only school, work, school, work. EVERYDAY! and the company is understaffed so they're currently overworking their workers, only for $15/ hour. $2 commission for every scam debit card you sell.  Job is definitely not worth it. You lose your family and friends, relationship and religion! C'mon, that's so messed up. Also for lunch you can't even leave the location without permission.

47,PAYOMATIC,"It is what you make of it! A great stepping stone, truly.",2017-11-23,4.0,Customer Service Representative,"Honestly, it's an easy job as long as you're careful and conscientious. There's a lot to learn--a lot of which training doesn't cover--but if you're determined you'll get the swing of things quickly.  There's always something that needs doing, so shifts tend to pass quickly for the most part. The company also has a lot of amazing employees--my district manager is great, my store manager is wonderful, and my co-workers are the best. You really have to be a team-player if you intend to work the morning/day/evening shift because peak hours can get really hectic. Overall, it's a great job if you're looking for something easy that doesn't require you to stand on your feet 8 hours a day. It's also a great stepping stone if you allow it to be--I know managers who were promoted after only 1-2 years of working as a teller. Benefits are good--full-timers get sick time, vacation time , affordable medical/dental insurance packages, etc. The ""higher-ups"" are pretty great--most are quick to assist if you have a problem and genuinely want to help you.","The pay is crap for all the work you do, honestly. I made the same amount working as a sales associate and I didn't do half as much work. Customers are a mixed-bag--most are polite, for the most part, but you get a lot of angry customers looking to lash out. You also have to be super vigilant about being conned--lots of people come in with fake IDs, counterfeit bills, altered checks, etc, and it's easy to lose your job if you're not careful.  This isn't a job for people who are shy or afraid to speak up and stand your ground--the customers WILL take advantage if you give them an inch, which you can't, because the rules exist for a reason. Don't count on getting overtime, and be prepared to float to other stores when they need you, which they will. Co-workers are hit or miss--mine are great, but whenever I float to other stores I often have to stay late because the person scheduled to relieve me is late. I've even temporarily worked under lazy managers. It's also frustratingly easy to come up short in your drawer if you're not careful--you'll be processing hundreds of transactions a day and dealing with A LOT of money, and sometimes customers will even attempt to distract you while you're counting, or try to confuse you, to cause you to make mistakes. You have to be able to multi-task and focus. Also, unless you're really lucky you won't have a set schedule, which can be really frustrating."
