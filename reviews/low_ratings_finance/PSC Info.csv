2,PSC Info,A strong company but not a good place to work,2011-04-21,2.0,Data Programming Analyst,"Company is strong and profitable.
Centrally located
Company will be around for a long time to come.
A good business concept","Complete lack of training. This company started out very small and has become a medium sized business that is very successful. However, their internal training, such as it is, has not kept up with its growth. All the training is too informal. It may have worked fine when they were a one-horse operation but not now.

Some of the lower management lack proper people skills."
