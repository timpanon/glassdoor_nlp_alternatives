0,Palisades Federal Credit Union,Palisades,2018-09-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,None come to mind. Palisades is  full of employees who don’t care about the members.,The employees of the credit union disregard any concern for members of the credit union. The management is absolutely horrible. Not just in the branch level but the “senior management” are all disconnected from the institution. Have no idea what actually takes place in their branches. They have no opportunity within the intuition itself. I am surprised they are still in business do to the complete lack of morals of employees.
1,Palisades Federal Credit Union,"No management, no leadership, nothing but a hollow shell",2014-10-09,1.0,Full Time Staff,"Hard to really find one. The pay is about average. Management sits upon their perch like they're the emperors of the world when there's only like 20 employees here. I love it when some of them refer to themselves as ""senior management"". What a joke, there's nothing between tellers and the CEO!","Incompetent management. Yes, I'm sure everyone has heard this before but this is no joke. There's been 3 CEOs in a year, no CFO, a COO who's had more jobs in his life than I've had shoes. No marketing manager. It's an ever-revolving door of managers and staff because there's nothing to work for here. No goals, no plans, just sitting at your desk. I feel bad like I'm collecting a paycheck and want to work but the managers won't give whatever work there is. I really don't know why this place is even still open. It hasn't grown in years. It just doesn't make sense."
