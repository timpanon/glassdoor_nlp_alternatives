1,Park Sutton Advisors,Embarrassing to work for,2022-01-24,1.0,Investment Banking Analyst,Get a lot of responsibility on your first day when you realize the person you just interviewed with just quit,"The Firm is a disorganized mess. The MD is MIA 90% of the time even though he calls himself a star banker. There is no leadership or mentorship to be found, and the Jr staff has insane turnover. The level of fake arrogance from insecurity in some of the senior staff is astounding and pathetic."
2,Park Sutton Advisors,Unorganized & overall bad culture,2022-01-16,1.0,Investment Banking Analyst,"You get great deal experience, mainly because you have to lead assignments by yourself with very little mentorship.","2 of the 3 senior bankers are dreadful. One is a robotic, the other has the social awareness of a kindergartner, and the good one is a thousand miles away working in GA. The day-to-day is so brutal trying to get the attention of the senior bankers who are clearly overwhelmed and not paying attention. The junior staff is left scrambling and doing work way above their heads."
3,Park Sutton Advisors,Toxic culture,2022-01-16,1.0,Investment Banking Analyst,Good deal flow and exposure to the Wealth Management space,Management team is toxic with too much reliance on junior staff. Unprofessional in many ways.
4,Park Sutton Advisors,Unorganized Boutique Bank,2022-01-10,1.0,Investment Banking Analyst,Solid deal flow for size,"MD doesn't pay attention on deals, toxic culture, lots of employee turnover (even for banking- a lot of people leave in after a few months)"
5,Park Sutton Advisors,N/A,2021-03-29,5.0,Investment Banking Analyst,A lot of deal flow.,None that I can think of
