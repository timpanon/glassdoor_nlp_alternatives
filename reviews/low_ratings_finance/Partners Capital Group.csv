To any car guys out there wanting to join Partners Capital Group DO IT, you will actually get to see your family of a weekend and of a night. 

What I love about this place is there is an open door with upper management, whether it's Marcello, Brad or Marcus they are there to help you.

Joining a new company is daunting but from the first minute working there , there has been help from all corners, colleagues willing to help you at any time. 

The commission that can be made here is unreal, you simply don't get that anywhere else that's all made possible thanks to The CEO.

Sales is what you get back you put in, not only do you have to work hard but more importantly it's about working smart and PCG is the perfect to achieve this.

I left the car business to join PCG it's the best decision I ever made.

If you're afraid of picking up the phone and calling people this ain't for you but if you're a relentless telephone monster then joining PCG will be the best thing you will ever do.",There is nothing negative to say.

I am very grateful for the opportunity they have given me, especially Nate Truong for believing in me and giving me a chance to reach my full potential. He is one of the most knowledgeable and creative interviewers I ever interviewed with! He challenged me, he made me think and he reassured me on why I wanted to become part of the PCG family. I can’t wait to help the company grow and become even more successful than they already are! 
They have been in business for over 15 years and while I have first-hand experience watching them exceed their customers expectations, they continue to offer competitive rates and phenomenal customer service to many different businesses and equipment vendors all over the nation.
When I started with this company, the staff welcomed me with open arms and really knew how to make a girl feel important in her role. Not only do they have excellent management, high-quality peers, outstanding training and great career opportunities; they are flexible, have a family work life balance, and the managers are very understanding when it comes to family commitment.

 I can go on, I recently took a VP position here and I'm not going to lie at first I was very skeptical only because the offer they gave me was ""to good to be true""  Not only did they blow out my old company's comp plan out the water but they really put me in a position where the skies the limit. They say the proof is in the pudding , not sure how many other people are going to take some one under 25 and give them this type of chance. It really speaks volumes of what they see in people. Other places would have said he's to young. This company cares more about what you have done and can do more then anything regardless of age where your from etc. If that doesn't show what type of employer this is not sure what will..",Honestly none the new system is a bit harder then  my old one but other then that nothing to complain about

Jeff, the manager in the Utah office, is the best manager I have ever had. I have some experience in equipment finance, I've never had a boss that fights for me and my deals the way Jeff does. He doesn't ever pass up an opportunity to help my clients and myself out to ensure we close and fund our transactions. Week one they fly you out to California you so can see the headquarters and get a small one week training. All expenses paid. It's a blast. Partners allows me to be creative as an account executive. I am able to create my very own proposals, and handle my clients from cradle to grave. Those of you who have worked in similar positions knows this is a big deal. I am not just another number at Partners, and as long as I work hard I have job security. Within my first month at Partners I funded a transaction, due to the incredible management and guidance I have received from all of upper management, and of course a manager in the past the guided me and taught me this industry. Grateful for my experience here at Partners, grateful that I get to care about my clients and build long lasting relationships with co-workers and my clients. If you're looking for a career, with some serious opportunity you've found it.","You can't see your stats, or where your numbers are at until the next day.
