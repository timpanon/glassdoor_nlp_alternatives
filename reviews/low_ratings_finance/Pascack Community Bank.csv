4,Pascack Community Bank,The worst bank ever to work for!,2014-02-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"some nice people, and cookies in every branch.","At first, everyone and everything appears to be VERY nice.  However, this bank operates under intimidation. Everything has to go through one person, which makes the whole institution feel like you're working for a dictator.  Everything you do, including the most mundane things, has to go through and gets back to this one person.  It creates fear of ""big brother"" in everyone.  Every program and service is antiquated and barely in the 21st Century!  Do not get taken in by their nice attitude upon initial meeting,  it's very deceptive."
