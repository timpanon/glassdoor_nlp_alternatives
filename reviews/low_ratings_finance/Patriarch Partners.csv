4,Patriarch Partners,CEO Thinks Everyone Is Replaceable,2018-08-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Salary is decent. Some of the staff is extremely nice, but this is not an environment where you are friendly with your coworkers outside of work.","Too many to list. 
-Lynn refused to give bonus's/raises until she was finished with her near endless lawsuits. 
-Staff at the child companies are treated MUCH better than at the main parent company. They are often off for holidays that the parent company is not off for.
-CEO micromanages everything, yet is never in office so nothing gets approved
-Disorganized"

6,Patriarch Partners,graveyard for business,2016-12-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The people you meet and work with in the operating units can be as good (or bad) as in any other company.  I met a lot of good ones.,"Read the prior 2015 reviews for April, October and November.  They are dead on and not isolated cases.  Unfortunately, the warnings will probably not be heeded by applicants.  This isn't a PE company turning around failing businesses.  This is a fund management company that sucks the lifeblood out of the operating companies for interest and fees.  Things started changing only a bit after the lawsuits took hold but it's like putting make-up on a pig."
7,Patriarch Partners,Desperation only,2016-03-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I cannot think of anything to write here other than in the right hands, there is potential.","What a mess.  Almost every brand in its portfolio is under-funded and minutes away from closing doors.  There is no future with any of the Patriarch Partner brands.  Run, don't walk from the group.."
8,Patriarch Partners,Send her to jail,2015-11-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good group of CEOs running the companies but belittled, threatened and being taken advantage of day in and day out.","She regularly steals from the companies she owns and steals from the CEOs as well. She  hires some good people to run the businesses and then cheats, steals and takes more fees than she deserves. She thinks that because she is wealthy and capable of engaging tol law firms, she could care less about a former CEO trying to sue her for money or ownership interest that is owed to them. The lowest, amd most discussing of people. She should be in jail for fraud, robbery and illegal tampering of stockholders interests. Go SEC, go investors, go former CEOs. You all deserve to take her down"
9,Patriarch Partners,Worst Environment Imaginable,2015-10-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Difficult to ascribe pros. I suppose company co-workers have developed tremendous, meaningful relationships in the way soldiers in trenches or patients in tuberculosis clinics might. It is such a horrible, dysfunctional environment wherein we cling to one another to validate our sanity. Beyond the work environment, none of the leadership has any idea how to run a business. Even their questions are embarrassing.","Where would I even begin? It would be easy to call the owner/CEO names, but beyond her volatility, unprofessionalism and demeaning condescension, she is classless, unpredictable and the most egomaniacal person I’ve ever known – and I am no stranger to corporations or egos.

Worse than her personality, however, is her complete lack of business acumen. You may wonder how she came to be successful and wealthy, but it had more to do with law suits and salesmanship than it did her ability to manage a business. She truly has no idea what she’s doing in nearly every respect, surrounding herself with pedigreed yes-men whose primary skill set is sycophancy.  These “management teams” are beyond pitiful, where the ability to suck-up supersedes any potential contribution to the Patriarch companies they are supposed to support. Truly, these minions are the hallmark of meaninglessness in a micro-managed, dying company. As a hiring agent, if you ever see a resume from someone in a leadership role at Patriarch Partners, avoid them like the plague.  Having an empty chair would produce greater results than management from a Patriarch alumnus. Frankly, I could deal with her ego if she wasn’t so bad at running a business. Still, her mania does something to you far beyond what you would imagine. If you think you are tough and thick-skinned and this review must be written by a newbie or a soft shell, think again. Patriarch is a grinding, poisonous, festering lesion, populated (at the highest levels) by men and women who aren’t very bright, but insist they are. Somewhere inside them, however, they must know they aren’t the sharpest tools in the shed, because they continue to suffer her abuse as cowards and water carriers, instead of actually proving themselves elsewhere."
10,Patriarch Partners,Unique,2015-09-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great business vision statement and mission statements.   Dust to diamonds and saving American manufacturing operations are noble and lofty goals.   The ""Clarion in Call"" in the NY times was epic.",Extreme drive for EBITDA trumps vision and mission statements.  Work life balance was marginalized Even day to day activity is frenetic and exigent is word of the day.
11,Patriarch Partners,CONFIDENTIAL,2015-08-27,2.0,Confidential,Good people working for the CEO,"CEO is very difficult as in ""out of touch""."
12,Patriarch Partners,The ultimate meritocracy,2015-08-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Very intense environment. Most people don't have the determination, perseverance and thick skin it takes to survive. She is a polarizing figure but in you have the opportunity to work on several complex investments where I felt I had true ownership.",Very intense environment. Hours are very long.
13,Patriarch Partners,Current Employee's Views,2015-06-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Highly competitive salary, higher than market for similar positions
When bonuses are paid, they are generous
Small environment, co-workers are a great group of people,intelligent, funny, hard workers-you make friends fast
If you are one degree away, the environment is not as stressful","Long hours and face-time required
Annual bonus payment timeline is at sole discretion of Executive but it is a discretionary bonus
Stressful work environment at times"
14,Patriarch Partners,Even though I was warned about how awful the job would be nothing could compare to the horrid reality of working here.,2015-04-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"A few of the higher ups are genuinely nice people. 
The salary was highly competitive.  
Benefits kick in on day one.","The reality of the culture and environment at Patriarch Partners makes the press that they and Tilton receive seem like a tame understatement. 
Whole company operates like a vanity project for the CEO who treats her employees in an abusive and unprofessional fashion.  This in turn creates bad morale, insecurity and instability among the staff. 
Coarse, offensive, sexist language is regularly used, as is language of an overt sexual nature which doesn't seem to be frowned upon as long as it's directed downward from the top. 
Tilton seems to derive her own energy from squeezing the life out of her talent, expecting them to regularly work 12-15 hour days and be on-call via email and cell 24 hours a day/seven days a week.  
Weekends and off hours are not respected. The same applies to holidays. 
Benefits could be much better for such a small firm managing billions of dollars. 
Sadly, I could keep going but I'll conclude by saying that Patriarch Partners is simply one woman run amok and drunk with power and only those who serve her obediently and without question (and eventually without a spine)...or else."
15,Patriarch Partners,"Working for a Patriarch company
Would love the opportunity to meet CEO to see how bad she is really portrayed.",2014-12-28,3.0,,Work hard....they pay hard....u play hard!,"Lots of turn over 
No direction from top down.  It's bottoms up!!"
16,Patriarch Partners,3 years and counting,2014-12-03,4.0,,"Competitive compensation, great people, interesting work (depending on team/department)

Ultimately, your experience at Patriarch will be whatever you make of it - it sounds cliche, but it's true. Most of the people who don't last came into the environment without doing their due diligence.  It's tough, demanding and at times your ""feeling"" will be hurt.  But if you're good at what you do and have thick skin, you can be extremely successful.","Bonuses are not paid on time
We don't get Boxing Day off"
17,Patriarch Partners,Do NOT work here! Be warned!,2014-11-29,1.0,Credit,None I can think of.,"It was my worst decision ever to join this company. I guess I wanted ""Private Equity"" on my Resume. This is not the PE firm that you want to put on your Resume. There are lots of negative words in the industry about this firm.  It's just not worth it. 

Here are the list of cons.
1. High turnover and firing people for no reason. Much worse than investment banks. I have been here for less than a year and I have seen/heard about so many firings especially before bonus. People here have extremely low moral and work in fear every day. I don't see how this company can survive much longer with this kind of staff mentality. 
2. The pay is not really that competitive even if you get your bonus. Also the bonus is extremely unreliable. I've heard that in the past, the bonus has been paid out in August. It's like you work for 8 months without your bonus and there is a good chance you will be let go before bonus. Considering this probability, the pay here is very low relatively.  
3. The work environment is very stressful. The CEO thinks she is the Queen. If you google her, you'll see. There is lots of verbal abuse. Nobodies dares to leave office before she leaves. That means lots of late nights and sometimes you have to come in on weekends. 
4. There is not a lot worth learning here unless you want to learn how to be an b**ch. You only work on some little things you are told to do. There is no career advance or mentoring. 

On the retrospect, I should never have joined this company even if they doubled my salary. The stress and the odds of getting the bonus is not worth it. Anyone thinking of joining this firm, be warned and stay clear of this sh*t hole! If you really want to join, make sure you negotiate a high base salary, not the bonus! The odds of getting the bonus is not on your side."
18,Patriarch Partners,RUN this is the WORST,2014-11-24,1.0,,There are no Pros I can write about,"The biggest con is the CEO and owner - she is CRAZY and MEAN! She thinks she knows everything (she does not), she thinks she is never wrong (she usually is), she contradicts herself all the time (and you get screamed at either way). You can hear her yelling down the hall. Everything on the internet about her is true!  

The people who work for her are brain-washed or have no brain. Plus they are all scared of her. It is like the Twilight Zone because does no one else see she is so mean? To plagiarize someone else who wrote this in a review because they are SO right: ""Terrible place to work. They lie to you about bonuses. No raises. You have no responsibility. No job growth. They fire people for no reason and without notice. No job security. Tons of turnover. Wouldn't recommend this place."" Seriously, do not work here. No paycheck is worth your own respect. Don't let yourself work here. I can't wait to get out."
