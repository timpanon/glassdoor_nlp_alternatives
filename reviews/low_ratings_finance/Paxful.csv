Paxful has not been a meritocracy for a long time. Now leadership is chosen not based on merit, experience or any other substantive criteria but willingness to be a lackey for the CEO. Strong people have been fired or forced out only to be replaced with people who are less educated, less experienced and far less talented. There is no transparency from leadership about anything. There is no longer a clear vision. Paxful went from wanting to bank the unbank to chasing the rich. 
The culture has become toxic. Casual racism, sexism and homophobia are the status quo. There is no regard for ethics and barely a regard for the law. 
Basic corporate functions do not happen anymore because there are no longer functioning HR nor Finance departments.  
The company is over 5 years old, yet most employees were hired in 2020 or 2021. There was a time when Paxful was a great place to work. That time is long gone. There is no desire nor for improvement. Anyone joining Paxful at this stage needs to understand that the chaos a feature; not a bug."

CEO thinks he knows and does everything better than everyone else, so don't expect to be valued.
Competent people with management experience never lasted longer than a few months because CEO was feeling threatened. That actually also caused his dictatorship to come out in even stronger form in the end of 2020.
Everything needs to be done by hustlers, not employees with experience in their field, so if you're not ready to jump through hoops by being an all-round person 24/7, you probably should skip applying to this company.

15,Paxful,"If you value your mental health, stay away!!",2021-12-21,1.0,Manager,Good perks - that‚Äôs about it.,"The cons list is veeery long, but I would like to start with a small tip for everyone that‚Äôs even considering joining this company:

Don‚Äôt fall for all the recent ‚Äúgood‚Äù reviews. The executives are using intimidation or public pressure to make employees write them. They are trying to clean up the company‚Äôs public profile in Glassdoor instead of solving the pressing internal problems.

Here comes the cons list: 
1. No stability. Doing a good job might get you fired, specially if your good results expose the incompetence of those that are close to the CEO and know how to manipulate him. A lot of really good employees have been let go with no reason at all. But the reality is that it could happen to anyone, one day the founder loves you the next day you are gone. 

2. Lack of direction. The founders have no idea how to run a company. The leadership team never questions him, either because they are afraid to get fired or because they are too busy licking the CEO‚Äôs boots. There is only one clear goal: grow 10x - how? Nobody knows, but the only people responsible for not accomplishing it are the employees.

3. No structure. There is not clear processes which makes it really complicated to get your job done and track real results. Specially when a high number of employees are in a raise to get the CEO‚Äôs attention. 

4. Toxic leadership. The CEO will humiliate employees in public, he constantly comes high to meetings, he thinks he is making everyone a favor by allowing them to work at Paxful. 

6. Employees are not appreciated. The only people that get some sort of appreciation are the CEO‚Äôs favorites at the time. This includes some Executive Leadership Team members,  they don‚Äôt know enough about the product to bring marketing qualified customers, but they know how to play politics to keep their position. 

5. High turnover. Employees are getting sick of this toxic work environment and a lot of them prefer to resign than keep dealing with it. Others are let go in masses (another characteristic of a toxic workplace)

The list can go on, but this review is already too long."

The work: You're given a lot freedom to take your work where you want to. Pitch new ideas, initiate projects, create new processes - the opportunity is there if you're motivated and proactive.

The leadership: I previously worked at a startup that only cared about making money. It's refreshing and empowering to work at a place where the CEO and leadership TRULY care about their mission and creating positive change in the world.

Culture: As a super global company, leadership does an amazing job of connecting the teams from around the world, and celebrating all the different cultures.

In general, the company is very wasteful with money you might get a business class ticket or two out of it - personally, I think this is bad for the environment but they will put hidden pressure on you to fly business so as to not make execs look greedy.","In my opinion, it's easier to make a list of some of the things I witnessed or found strange our my 3 years..

*CEO regularly coming to the office on drugs / under the influence of drugs. He is currently on probation serving a three-year jail sentence in Estonia for possession of about 100g of assorted hard drugs such as MDMA, cocaine and hashish, this is public data * case number 1-17-6673 (16930000093) Harju Maakohus *Harju county court, Estonia What more do you need to know.. 

*Rat eat rat culture, I personally witnessed people colluding to get a middle manager fired by those above and below chain of command! 
I witnessed a co-founder demanding my superior fire a colleague who had no previous issues with performance and eventually that employee sued the company and won in Estonia t√∂√∂komission case number 4-1/1188/20 (employment commission) 

*The above alone is probably enough to figure out you are working in a circus act that's best stayed clear of but being a sucker for a good story I stayed in the madhouse a bit longer until eventually, I suspect I might have spoken up a bit too much about some of the concerns I was seeing regarding fraud and the platforms approach to effectively handling it which ultimately amounted to (drum roll please).... Random sexual assault allegations... Naturally enough they said they had to suspend me to ""protect the workplace"" but yet somehow they never thought that perhaps a person getting serious allegations against them has a chance to defend themselves...NOT ACCORDING TO PAXFUL.

but the labour court found they did this illegally (case number 4-1/747/21-21) and were ordered to pay restitution in the sum of over Eur: 30,000

Add to that the founders being arrested for drugs and guns in Miami google ""paxful Miami guns cocaine"" and you will find all the media.

That's only the really nuts stuff I have time to list btw, but if you are good with google, search ""technozombie"" ""ray savant"" ""tech zombie"", this is not the first rodeo for this guy who in my opinion seems to be a career scammer based on what I've been told about his previous business form those working directly with him. 
It's my personal opinion excessive drug use on his part coupled with sycophantic adoration and compliance from staff that fear if they don't praise him they will be fired is whats lead to such a toxic culture that is destined to spiral either the company into bankruptcy or him into jail (again)

just the fact you need to be a total sycophant to management to get past probation is a major tell that something much much darker is lurking under the scenes. they only keep the adoring little sheep who would never bark against the master,)

As usual, they will probably try to say ""isolated case"" ""one unhappy unemployed"" but I just say, look through the real reviews here and paint me a picture of what you see.

there are one or two good people here but 95% including all the C level either got duped into this and are looking for a way out now or they are just happy to take a fat paycheck to be immoral in their decisions, either way, I welcome the good ones reach out to me when the eventual end comes as we can make a Netflix documentary based on the BS that goes on here daily.

55,Paxful,Worst combo ever: Toxic environment + incompetent  executives + lack of structure,2021-07-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Company has overall good perks and benefits,"- There is not stability, one day you are doing a great job and the next day you are fired you for no reason. 
- Zero guidance from the executive team. Priorities change everyday, there is not a strategy. 
- Hard working people are not recognized. Only the ones that praise the ""easy-to-manipulate"" CEO get promotions, even when they are not qualified or know ANYTHING about the product.
- Since the only way to go up is for the CEO to like you, employees are always fighting to get his recognition and don't care about stepping on other's shoes. 
- It is easier for the founders and some people in the executive team to blame employees, fire them and public humiliate them instead of taking their responsibility and solving the lack of guidance and structural issues. 
-If your work is perceived as a threat or you challenge one of the CEO's favorite executives, they will use their influence to get you fired.
- Key positions like Marketing and Product heads don't know anything about the product, which is an example of how favoritism works in this company.
- Lack of data driven decision making. Decision are made based on how the CEO felt when he was high."

It is not only inspiring to see the co-founders of the company willing to sacrifice so much for the betterment and success of the company, it is motivates me to do the same. I appreciate the inclusion of so many diverse backgrounds, cultures, languages, and people welcomed at this company. It is the culture that continues to drive Paxful into the right direction.

There was a case when on a meeting we got a request to increase one metric two times, when we asked what's the current numbers we literally got an answer like 'we don't know the numbers but we need to increase them'. Teams managers don't defend their partners they just trying to keep their chairs. Nobody talks about problems the company just do paperwork (send warning letter with fake information) and fires people. All employee comments are ignored, even when they ask people face-to-face they just keep silence and just want them to sign documents. The company even does't allow people to say goodbye to their team members, it just needs 'potatoes' to get out as soon as possible. That could happen even after a couple of performance bonuses and salary increase. Also seems there are some people who snitch and keep top management informed about everything what happens on the kitchen. In general this is not a family and even not a team."
