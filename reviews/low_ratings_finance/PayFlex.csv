2,PayFlex,Constantly going through growing pains.,2021-09-22,2.0,Operations Manager,Innovation and creative autonomy are encouraged.,"Executive leadership kicks the proverbial can down the road when it comes to addressing resource and structural needs raised by lower level management. When resources are finally aligned for success, they're poached by other executive leaders for their own pet projects without regard for the negative impact it'll cause to the area they're poaching from. This results in a stressful environment being a daily normal rather than the occasional exception."

10,PayFlex,Claims Department - Worst Ever,2017-12-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Customer Services department tried there best to resolve the issues but even they didnt had any luck,Unfortunately i have to give one star but the claims department sucks. Bunch of illiterate and drunk people are processing the claims. Sorry for the language but without any reason they kept on rejecting multiple claims and will never provide correct reason. Customer service doesnt even have access to the actual reason and then they try their best to explain and keep customer happy. I have to submit same claim 4 times and still didnt got processed. Called 5 times for it and still no result. Customer service kept on raising tickets but no result still.

Unorganized,, poorly trained employees.  They start employees that they hire from a staffing service and  they start them on the  job before they are trained properly.  They give employees a crash course on a million things and start them to work.  In essence, the temporary employees are answering members questions when they aren't even sure of what they are doing.  Payflex has them put members on hold while trying to find the correct answer, resulting in members being on hold for so long that they often hang up."
