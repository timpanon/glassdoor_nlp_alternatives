They'll pay you peanuts to get enough licenses (7 and 63) to make you hireable at real firms.,"They'll pay you peanuts.  Period.  If you make it through their so-called ""training program"" (which basically means you develop the art of telephone terrorism by cold-calling the same bone-dry leads that have been done to death for the previous umpteen years), you'll be rewarded by a pathetic payscale (25%), constantly getting berated by anyone and everyone who's higher than you on the totem pole, and watch a ""good old boys"" network in action, complete with ""mentorship"" from a buddy of theirs who pops in and out of the office and was previously barred from the securities industry.  Just who I want ""grooming"" me to be a million dollar producer."
