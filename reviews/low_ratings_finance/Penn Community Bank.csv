Ok medical and dental","Upper management only cares for themselves and will blame you for anything that goes wrong, even if it's not your fault. 
If you need to tell HR something be careful, they will throw you under the bus. Also, if you have a complaint about someone, make sure you tell them 1st or the other person's story is the one that'll be true. 
Needs better pay. You can make more at McDs or Walmart."

3,Penn Community Bank,Does not care about employees,2022-03-28,1.0,Supervisor,Decent benefits and good PTO,Unless you are in with certain people your career will not go well. Coaching and feedback are terrible. They pretend to act like a local bank while constantly pushing big bank ideals. Don’t bother talking to HR because they don’t care. Too busy pushing their agenda
4,Penn Community Bank,Worst company,2022-03-24,1.0,Sales and Service Manager,Friendly coworkers which makes for a decent work environment.,"Not enough pay for the work you have to do. The bank overall doesn’t care about the employees, especially the HR department. Too much stress on a daily basis for a company that doesn’t care about you."

Acceptable sales culture
Positive work life balance","Upper level management is content to be disconnected with the reality of the day to day
Human Resources who is heavily involved in business operations is inconsistent with upholding their own policy
Lack of of interdepartmental teamwork
Severely underpaid
Short handed staffing levels are the norm
Training dept doesn’t know/understand how to train"
6,Penn Community Bank,Long time employee,2022-02-20,3.0,Loans,A lot of good people work there. Good salary and work life balance.,Human Resources did not care about employee input... they did not seek to make things better when there were problems. A lot of good people left. Bank merger made things bad for a lot of employees too. Not everyone is treated equally. Gone Woke

pay market average
hire people to replace those who left

The list goes on. Only work here if you want to have to play ""the game"" to get promoted."

Easy no brain job","Upper management doesn't understand what they want to be
Pay is horrible, better off at Walmart
Bank waste money on horrible marketing team"
9,Penn Community Bank,Glass Ceiling,2021-10-12,1.0,Relationship Banker,"- The other employees that are stuck under the glass ceiling understand your pain and are great people.

- They give you 6 free sessions at the penn foundation for therapy. (Trust me you will need it)","Do you like not receiving any overtime? Do you like breaking rules(and sometimes laws)? Do you like giving 110% and getting nothing in return? What about having all responsibility and stress of a branch manager but being paid as a teller? You will love PCB! Thier motto is ""here we grow"" but it's a empty promise for both customers as well as employees. If you show any compassion, you will be used for every once. You will be drained of all joy in 3 years tops. Good luck breaking the ceiling."
10,Penn Community Bank,Old bank was better,2021-06-15,4.0,Customer Service Representative,"Okay pay
Team events 
Paid holidays","Favoritism 
Lost community feel 
Lack of empathy"
11,Penn Community Bank,Strong Community Minded Mutual Savings Bank,2021-06-15,5.0,Delivery Services Manager,Mutual savings banks care more about their customers and communities than they would if there were shareholders involved. This bank gets it right.,Communication is not always the clearest
12,Penn Community Bank,Could have had potential,2021-06-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Upper management was accessible and friendly,"Very little training, no clear direction from new Manager , she didn’t take the time to build a relationship and had unrealistic expectations after only 30 days, no loyalty to employees at all."
13,Penn Community Bank,"PCB Review, Bristol Branch",2021-03-02,2.0,Customer Service Representative,Good values and good training.,"I was consistently treated unfairly by upper-management at the Bristol branch and would not recommend this position. I was polite, on top of my role and hit all of my marks, yet was consistently nit-picked and criticized by upper-management whereas other employees were regularly missing marks, taking longer breaks then allowed and wee late, but were treated well for the same things I was picked apart for. The majority of the time I was criticized by the branch manager, the thing that upset her did not happen. Treatment was definitely not equal and fair across branch employees. I worked here in 2016-2017 and felt discriminated against during most of my tenure. It was more of a ""I did not belong"" vibe and no amount of great performance and politeness could change that. I went on to hold higher roles elsewhere. I can't say this job was for me, but I consistently did a great job and was treated pretty unwell without reason. Would not recommend! Save yourself the stress."
14,Penn Community Bank,Good job,2021-02-06,5.0,Sales and Service Manager,Flexibility and the life balance.,No cons for this job
15,Penn Community Bank,They play favorites,2021-01-19,1.0,Customer Service Representative,"Generous 401k Match, Paid PTO","Hours, Terrible Pay, Poor bonuses"
16,Penn Community Bank,Very Good Place to work,2020-09-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Calm work environment, not tremendously sales based. No wild hours. Great customer relationships.",Benefits were okay; neither stellar nor bad. Retirement match was great though
17,Penn Community Bank,Empty promised,2020-04-21,3.0,Sales and Service Manager,"Regular hours, okay pay and benefits.",Retail management has favorites. Unless you are one of them you will get alot of promises with very little action or follow-up. A lot of people over sell themselves. Each branch has almost the same staffing but very different demands. I worked at 3 branches. The slow branch had the more people than needed. The busy branch never had enough staff on busy days. Job descriptions don't really reflect the type of work you do in each branch. Very inconsistent job duties.
18,Penn Community Bank,Watch out abd Beware of false promises.,2019-02-28,1.0,Supervisor,"Nothing really. If it wouldn't be for a couple of businesses they would be out of business. If your looking for a bank that doesn't care about service or your business, there the bank for you.","No consideration for yourself as a person. They don't pay what they offer, even if on a offer letter. Their famous words are 'we will look into it'. Lack of training. If you stand up for yourself you will be let go; they are well known for that."
19,Penn Community Bank,Great Place to Work,2018-06-26,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Great diverse work culture with a pleasant atmosphere. They are customer service focus vs goal driven.,Network is very slow and system is out dated.
20,Penn Community Bank,teller,2018-03-13,3.0,,"Regular bank hours, most co-workers are nice, nice pay","clicky groups, working saturdays,"
21,Penn Community Bank,Phenomenal place to work,2017-10-31,5.0,Sales and Service Manager,"The best part about PCB is that they give their employees the tools and coaching needed to grow in the company.  PCB management is able to recognize talent and empower their employees to succeed in their career path.  I have been working at PCB for 19 months and I have been promoted 3 times.  I am very happy to work for a company that recognizes my hard work and effort.  If you are looking for a job at a bank that cares about their employees, gives back to the local community, and provides excellent customer service, Penn Community Bank is the place to be!","Every company has room to improve, but I do not have any cons at this time."
22,Penn Community Bank,It was a good start,2017-09-24,3.0,Branch Staff,"There is a really good network of some people (SOME) that work there and that are very supportive and care about you and want you to succeed. I really liked that atmosphere. There are also great education benefits if you are going to school, and a great 401k package and medical benefits.","Room for advancement seems to be only if you know someone who knows someone. I had to interview multiple times before I was given a bump up in position, and some others who were less experienced than me were promoted before I was, which I felt was unfair. 

Get rid of the cliquey environment. No one should have to feel outcasted because they are new or because they don't know as much as others. Encourage the existing staff to be supportive of new hires and not throw them to the wolves when they first start. A new job is very stressful for some people, and if you don't have that support from your new co-workers when you first start, you won't have employees that will perform well.

Branch managers really need to treat everyone equally. A teller thats been in the branch for 5 years should receive the same treatment as a teller that has been there a month. Granted you know the 5 year teller better than you do the newbie, but don't play favorites. 

Pay could be better. I was moved to a different department and it was considered lateral, but I was still paid the same taking on probably 30%  - 50% more work, with a very small team at the time. Consider that when you are moving employees or employees want to advance."
23,Penn Community Bank,Not the place to start your career,2017-05-03,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good benefits, good people that work here, tuition reimbursement.","No room for advancement. Not a small community bank anymore, the practices are becoming very similar to corporate banks. Every job opening now requires a bachelor's degree and ten years of experience in that specific job; bank experience is never considered and they are too lazy to train. I loved working here before it became Penn Community and got new upper management."
24,Penn Community Bank,Credit Analyst,2016-11-30,2.0,Credit Analyst,Small company willing to promote within. Willing to work in the community and allow employees to do the same. Some management is willing to work with them,Too many cliques and some senior management tend to be right in the middle of it. Makes promises they do not intend to keep. Very segregated between departments and between old first savings employees vs old first federal employees
25,Penn Community Bank,Opportunities for Growth,2016-10-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Plenty of opportunities for professional development, strong internal job posting program, great benefits, fun company events. Senior Management cares about the employees.","Every company has its ups and downs, but my experience at Penn Community has been a positive one. Management addresses employee concerns as they arise."
26,Penn Community Bank,Good Place to Work,2016-08-04,4.0,,Community caring employer who invests money and resources back into Bucks county. Excellent 401k and Paid time off.,"Overall the bank has a good group of employees, however there are cliques and an uncomfortable feeling with certain units."

28,Penn Community Bank,ABM,2016-06-02,3.0,,Nice company to work for,Starting pay could be higher when promoted
29,Penn Community Bank,Teller,2016-02-09,4.0,Teller,"It's such a positive, up-beat and energetic environment. This has been the first job where I am excited to go to work.","Sometimes it's too busy to even think, and it can get stressful; but that comes with anything, as well as any job."
