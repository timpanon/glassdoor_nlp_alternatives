1,Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency,Review former employee,2022-03-25,3.0,Customer Service Lead,Good pay and good benefits,"Being yelled at by customers, cannot get emergency calls even when death is involved of immediate family"
2,Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency,pheaa review,2022-03-24,3.0,Business Analyst,"work from 2 days a week, benefits if state",can't trust the management there
3,Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency,"Overall, great department to work for!",2022-03-18,4.0,State Grant Representative,"Friendly co-workers and managers, clock in/out at the same time every day, laid back dress code, desk personalization",Repetitive and growth takes entirely too long.

sometimes clique-ish environment"
5,Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency,Us Against Them,2022-03-10,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The team you find yourself with will quickly become your 2nd family. Everyone at PHEAA is a good person (save for upper management (not including Jim Steeley)). You will find yourself having mutual interests, knowing mutual people, etc. The manager you have hopefully (like mine) will go to bat for you no matter what. I can't explain how good of a manager mine was, she was really the best. The benefits are nice too. 

These are the only pros.","PHEAA has, without trying, created an environment where it's staff against upper management. In the recent years, PHEAA has changed leadership multiple times, be it due to someone stealing money (which happened), or someone taking a bonus of 50k+ and then leaving soon after (which happened). Either way, the newest executioner to the block is perhaps the worst. She (the CIO) takes no effort at all, whatsoever, to learn who the employees are. She takes no effort in even trying to meet us face to face. Instead, the witch hides in her ivory tower demanding that we work in the office 3 times a week as opposed to the 2 days a week other departments have. On top of this, upper management was so gracious in providing us a 3% wage increase when inflation went up above 7%. Oh, and the gas prices raising too. What PHEAA is doing to assist their employees through this time is demanding they drive into work and make an appearance so Carol (CIO) can feel like she means something.

I look forward to the day the House of Representatives and the Senate vote and pass a resolution dissolving PHEAA and all related entities. It's what they deserve for hiring a ""leader"" who has the leadership skills of former and current facists."
6,Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency,Pros/cons,2022-03-05,3.0,Loan Servicing Specialist,Coworkers were amazing to work with. Call center had a good environment. Different good parties.,"Management and the inability to move around. Overtime was becoming excessive, the turnover rate is too high. Pay was not worth the demand of the job"
7,Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency,Do not recommend,2022-03-02,1.0,,Insurance and Time off are the 2 reasons I have stayed as long as I have,"Pay is horrible unless you are in the Union, in upper management or one of the randoms who receive out of the blue raises. Snarky  management. No room for advancement.  And now with fed contract not being renewed everybody is terribly overworked and underpaid."
8,Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency,N/A,2022-03-01,1.0,Customer Service Representative,There isn’t any pros working here.,Majority of your calls are people complaining and yelling at you about their loans. Management doesn’t seem to care about what we have to go through over the phone. And every day/week there’s always something changing in the department.
9,Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency,DO NOT TAKE AN IT POSITION HERE!,2022-02-25,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Benefits are good, People at ground level are great to work with.",VP level appears to be gutting the place to allow for PWC to come in and take over. They have laid off or severed many very skilled and good people here in the last few months. They're new CIO is a previous PWC employee. She is now currently stripping out all of their IT staff and key positions and appears to be positioning the agency to be completely outsourced to PWC for the IT work that is to be done here. I give it about a year or less before the full compliment of staff is completely transitioned out. There is zero job security here.
10,Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency,Good place to work,2022-02-24,4.0,Manager,"The pay is good and there are state employee benefits, which are better than average. The hybrid work-from-home is great and they are very flexible with schedules. 
I genuinely enjoy working with my team, both coworkers and boss. Many people have worked their entire careers here, it is not unusual to meet people with 30+ years. They take diversity and inclusion seriously and put in strong effort to build a good workplace and culture. 
This would be a great place to stay, except for the uncertainty around the future related to the federal contract.","With the federal servicing contract ending. the agency is shrinking and shedding a shocking percentage of jobs - rumors say 50-70% smaller by the end of the contract. Early retirements and people finding other jobs in anticipation leave a mess behind with unfinished projects and unclear responsibilities, even though there is still quite a lot of work to do. With the agency shrinking so much, the building feels empty when I'm there. 
The company has taken a beating in the press and in Congress from its involvement with federal loan servicing. People enjoy dragging the agency's name out to blame them for student loan problems."
11,Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency,excessive overtime - micromanaging- dirty office,2022-02-23,1.0,Customer Service Representative,No pros to this company,they demand way to much overtime. if you cant complete it you get threatened with disciplinary action. the office is filthy and the supervisors dont know how to do your job and micromanage. stay away

17,Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency,"Well, they're trying...",2022-01-17,3.0,Loan Operations,You're still able to work remotely,"While they are admittedly trying to change the culture of this company, there's still a lot of work to be done.

The employees that cared were overlooked for advancement opportunities in favor of the favorites. Horrific PTO policy. Within a few months I learned that it was better to call in sick than to request a day off. No reason a company would deny a request off 7 months in advance. Due to the minimal socialization opportunities, your love for the work culture depends on your supervisor."

Positions dealing with this contract were informed via email 1 hour before a news article was released about us not extending our contract. As of this review, still no indication about what is going to happen to those employees.

Currently employees working in any department dealing with the federal contract have no idea what is going to happen to their jobs. The atmosphere is you may or may not lose your job. Pretty difficult to work effectively with that sentiment."

Every time positive changes were announced, it could legitimately be called lip service because initiatives would just go dark and never discussed again until questioned. It was always then that you were told the agency priorities have changed or going a different way, despite the previously lauded benefits of the faded plans. Management too often lacked accountability for decisions they made, and routinely blamed those that report to them for failures, as opposed to failed leadership. Departments seldom knew what the others were doing, contributing to sometimes redundant and conflicting guidance as well as internal risk."

The Records department is decent. You're pretty much assigned miscellaneous tasks throughout the day from sorting mail, QA of applications, data entry, or even mundane stuff like going through bins of opened mail to make sure no other forms were missed. You start out as an hourly employee but have the opportunity to move up to ""state"" status where you are officially considered a salaried and union-protected state employee. It was a guaranteed 40 hour a week job that paid overtime. Occasionally, they do fun activities like holiday raffle drawings or contests for prizes in order to keep things fun.","Moving up to State status is nothing more than a popularity contest that has more to do with how well you can kiss up rather than how hard you can work. It's a typical bureaucratic environment and you need to be very careful who you can trust. Lots of gossip, lot's of secret tattling on each other, and lots of ""nothing is ever enough"" from management. No positive reinforcement. When you're doing a good job, everyone is quiet.

Don’t EVER leave your desk for any reason unless it is break time or lunch time. Absolutely Horrible!!! Also don’t expect to get any time off for any reason either. Your manager doesn’t decide, instead it is some other person from another department gives the yes or no. Ridiculous!"

Management then cries that we are too poor to fill jobs when someone quits so you get more work your plate for no extra money.  IT contractor brought on to wipe out all PHEAA IT jobs in favor of contractors.  Just wait when the fees begin to go up in a few years and PHEAA is paying more and looking to get out.  By then the chief digital officer will be off to a new venture and laughing as PHEAA tries to deal with the proprietary code the contractor leaves behind.  What a joke.

Some of your coworkers will be good company, but typically not the people that end up in higher management positions.","Constantly feeling dehumanized. A cafeteria that will make you physically ill with their greasy vittles. Pointless, inane busywork presented to you under the guise of “job security.”* Being told how your personal problems shouldn’t affect your job performance, no matter how serious whatever you’re going through is. Rampant nepotism in hiring practices, especially in upper management, though of course it helps to be physically attractive as well if you’d like to get ahead. Having a manager tell everyone on the “team” “if you don’t like it, there’s the door” and other incredibly unprofessional things during completely inane meetings that solely consist of information that’s already been communicated to you and everyone else in attendance more than once.

* No matter how many times you hear the phrase “job security” here, it’s all a ruse at this point—they’re computerizing and they just don’t need you anymore."

Good work/life balance.","Other than the casual .025% that is approved maybe once every 3-4 years, your only shot at getting a raise in this company is leaving a position you love for another position at a higher pay grade. Unless, of course, you are senior management already making 6 figures or close to it....then you will constantly get more money. Every year we have 'performance evaluations', management are told they are not allowed to give superb ratings so the most you will ever get is satisfactory with an occasional above satisfactory. Even then, dont ever expect more than a pat on the back. When you ask for a raise because you are completing the job of positions where people are making at least 10k more than you, you are told its just not in the budget. Oh, or my favorite excuse, 'HR is conducting market analysis'. Funny because that hasn't ended in over a year. This company uses and abuses and breaks you down.  Turnover is insane here, not just in the call center but also in business units. They are focusing so much on 'employee engagement' now to turn reviews like this around but news flash: people need money to live. You can only tell people they are doing a good job so many times without SHOWING them in their salary."

128,Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency,don't bother with this company,2018-07-30,1.0,Loan Officer,"There's a gym, a basic Starbucks, and okay chicken fries in the cafeteria. The work itself wasn't terribly difficult once you figured out what you were doing, plus there was help, if you needed it.  Also you'll love your teachers during training, which unfortunately often gives people the sense that their supervisors will be as nice. Unfortunately, most supervisors are nasty and lazy :(","I was a full time loan officer and it was a horrible overall experience. First off know that you'll be starting at a 12 pm (or 12:30 depending on how long you take a lunch) shift. During the interview the interviewer may try to dodge how long you'll be on that shift since at least when I interviewed I was told 3-6 months at most. In reality once you get on the floor (after a 6 week training), the minimum time is closer to 9 months to a year. So if you have any sort of family don't apply to this job. When I was hired I was also told that mandatory overtime would be done by the time I got done with training, when in reality it went from 3 hour to 4 hours per weekend. I learned after I left that they took away the mandatory overtime but don't be shocked if it comes back. I had a few health issues come up before I left and while I had plenty of vacation time I wasn't allowed to use it on the weekends for overtime, so seriously be aware of that.   In addition most supervisors do the bare minimum so don't be shocked if you either can't find them at their cubicles.  Lastly be aware of how long it takes you to get to/from pheaa. You may not mind driving 30 minutes one way, but during rush hour (during training) and in the darkness (during your regular shift), the drive gets old fast. There is a parking garage but it fills up fast so while I didn't start till 12pm I usually ended up being at pheaa by 9am to get a parking spot.  There is a small parking lot across the street, but where pheaa is located, well let's just say the street gets busy. Plus during the winter season, it stunk for those people having to go outside in the snow, try not to get hit by cars, then dig out their cars."

173,Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency,It's a Job (Some Side Effects May Occur),2017-05-09,2.0,Customer Service Representative,The pay is decent; especially if you remain with the company for a longer period of time.  Most employees are able to become a state employee through this organization (and receive health benefits) usually within a year to 18 months.  The schedule remains (mostly) consistent and there are plenty opportunities to advance within the company.,"Here's where the aforementioned side effects come into play.  The entry level positions within the company is within one of the call center departments about 99% of the time.  This company is under contract with several agencies where they must deliver quality customer service and answer calls within a set period of time.  These requirements are way too ridiculous for the workforce that is currently employed there at the time of this review.

This requirement frequently means that pressure is placed on you to ensure you meet the demands of the contract.  You can expect to be watched like a hawk for everything that you do, occasionally deal with supervisors getting frustrated with you over things you did not do, and there is often periods of required overtime.  This overtime has the potential to last for six or more months without a break AND can be upwards of a minimum of ten extra hours per week.  If you are not a state employee and you get sick, especially with the amount of overtime you may be forced to work, you can expect to get reprimanded.  People, such as myself, who have worked with the agency for an extended period of time have been known to become stressed and anxious, often leading to being diagnosed with a mental illness over the ineptitude of the business."

No annual deductible for 2% of your pay, amazing coverage. Retirement is UNBEATABLE. You must contribute 6.25% but they contribute over 17% so nearly TRIPLE your contribution. Always job security. Voluntary overtime is offered generally year-round, depending on which department you work in. You also accrue SICK TIME separately from vacation time.","You must work there 10 years to be vested for the amazing retirement. Very bad benefits for entry level, at least it's something, but as soon as you get a position with the state of Pennsylvania, which can happen within the first 6 months up to 9 months on average, you get the amazing benefits as listed in the pros. The biggest con, again, depends on which department you work in. All entry level positions are In a union environment, so you definitely have a lot of workers rights, but since there is a huge emphasis on seniority within unions, it will take a very, very long time to get approved time off any part of the year. Your first few years you will only be approved days off during non popular times (like late September-mid April)if you are aware of this going in, it's not as disappointing and you can strategically plan your vacations, but don't expect to ever get a Monday or Friday off from may-August/September. Again this depends on which department you work in. Also, the amount of leave time you accrue is not very much (7 days per year that acrrue throughout that year for the first three years, 11 days per year if you're a state employee for the first 3 years.  but if you wait it out, you get generous leave time (3-15 years you accrue 19 days off per year. YOU ARE ALLOWED TO ANTICIPATE LEAVE TIME after a year of service as long you don't ""borrow"" more time than will accrue before dec. 31 of that year. After 15 years your leave accrual goes up again. Not all departments are difficult to schedule time off, only some of them. You can inquire in your interview if that department uses a ""selection period"" if the answer is yes, these are the departments that make it very difficult to take time off at the beginning. BUT these are also the departments that offer the MOST earning potential, aka have the most availability for voluntary overtime so you can really beef up your income if you need to make more money. Also, note that seniority in the agency only really affects you for things like permanent shift changes and scheduling time off, seniority is NOT a huge factor in being considered for promotions, your work performance can skip you past many people ahead of you if you have remarkable employee stats!"

Built in raise system for union employees, non-union salary workers also get raises. 
Training takes 8 weeks and is fully paid. Everyone is required to do this training, even if you aren't working in the customer service dept. 
A stepping stone to other jobs within the state. 
You can get raises faster if you get hire level degree's. 
Hire's from within for better jobs.","Entry level workers pay union dues, but are not actually covered by the Union for 18 months. his job has an insanely high turnover rate and they actually celebrate when people make it to a year, because so many people don't make it that far. Anyone paying union dues should get all union benefits as soon as they begin paying into that.

You are expected to meet a metric of success that is not always possible, this metric decides whether you'll get a raise. Also if you don't meet the metric, you'll find yourself hounded by leads and supervisors to fix it. 

They are upgrading their system right now to a rather unstable program that's still a work in progress which caused loads of confusion and even days when we couldn't properly access the database needed to do paper work. 

Benefits for entry level employment are bare minimum, expect to pay 40% of your medical bills to meet a VERY high deductible that goes up each year until you are a Full STATE employee. 

While overtime pays well and is usually optional, about once a year around Sept or January the whole office is pulled into mandatory overtime. During my time there mandatory ranged from 5-20 mandatory hours. The leads get pulled onto calls because the queues are so big, supervisors begin doing lead work and their own work. Other depts are required to do the paperwork from the call center to try and keep the system working. Usually it's temporary but one time we were on mandatory 50 hours a week for nearly 4 months, and nearly everyone was burned out.  

Once you've already been trained on the base understanding of loans. If there's a need in another sector, you'll get a half a day of training and they'll drop you into a new area and expect you to be just as good as you were at the information they spent 8 weeks training on."

You have to explain why you are getting up from your seat even if using the restroom and sometimes you are followed. If you have loans through PHEEA good luck. If you are late making a payment even by one day you will be pulled into HR. PHEAA forces mandatory overtime. If you are unable to work 8-12 hours of overtime a week you will be written up. There is high turnover hence why they are always hiring. The union is useless and you are automatically enrolled at date of hire.  The union dues kill your paycheck. I hope that PHEAA will be eventually bought out by a more professional and ethical company, soon. Oh managers, leads, and supervisors- keep the instant messaging professional and work related. We don't need to know about Facebook and your personal life when we have unrealistic statistics to meet and still have to read the instant messaging because we are being monitored. Advice to employees: learn and move on, and anything you are told to do that can't be monitored, (read instant messages, updating success factors, make a trip to another department, make copies, told to invite and re-invite staff to a chat, get a soda for your supervisor, etc), put on your ""stat sheet."" You will spend a lot of time having to do things that cannot be accounted for."

Great pay and benefits.",No one knows what there doing every customers I talked to was told something's completely not true. They were told that forbearances that brought account current would last no longer than one year in fact it only brought acct current for them to begin payments again next month. Your only to be on phone so many minutes but when you try to explain the truth to customer it takes longer. No way to personally mail paperwork to them when they called 4 or 5 times and still have not got paperwork. When acct s can be brought current with direct debit customers are not always brought current and some ppl tell them no you can't other tell them yes you can. I only worked here a few weeks it was frustrating to me that no one was on the same page as me when talking to customers I'm honest person and want them to hang up knowing I did all I could to help bring there acct current and saving them money in process. But when others mislead them it takes a while to explain truth of matter to them.

245,Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency,Do Not Work Here! Even If Last Option!!!,2015-03-01,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Good starting pay and the trainers there were very thorough and liked to have fun which made it less harsh.,You work the same thing day after day without any type of change. Keep in mind when Pheaas job description says you could take up to 70 phone calls a day is a lie. I have taken 95 phone calls a day without stopping. Management does nothing and can not even offer help to new employees. Once in a while you get a good supervisor that is willing to help but it's rare... The so called leads do nothing but watch your every single move. You can't even go to the bathroom without them questioning why you were gone for so long. Everyone higher than a customer service rep acts like they are too good for anyone and can't even answer a question without acting that way or making a big deal that they had to do something. The area you work in is also just boring not any room to socialize and looking at the same thing is just completely depressing. Pheaa treats employees with no respect and absolutely no incentives for working there and picking up everyone else's slack. In the harrisburg office when there was a mandatory overtime of 10 extra hours per week for two months nothing extra was done for employees that were stuck doing this. And once you are hired you always get stuck with the 12-9 shift unless you get approved for an earlier shift

250,Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency,Call Center at It's ABSOLUTE WORST!,2014-10-02,1.0,Loan Counselor,"It's a job.  That's about it.  Though I'm making more than I ever have in a long time, it still barely pays the bills.","This is typical of most call centers, but PHEAA ""takes the taco"" for the WORST EVER!


1) ""Management"" has absolutely no clue whatsoever how we peons suffer throughout the day.  This is most likely because ""management"" NEVER HAD TO DO our job!

2) Phone call standards are ""pie in the sky""; much like every other metric the dimwits in ""management"" formulate.

3) Don't count on becoming a ""state employee"" anytime soon!  Even if you've worked at PHEAA for the requisite six months, ""management"" will find just about every reason under the sun NOT to ""promote"" you.  ""Management"" NEVER smiles UNLESS they're escorting someone to the door or talking behind your back.

4) When you start, you are a lowly ""clerical wage employee"" until you ""make state"".  Don't worry!  You'll also be treated like a third-class citizen.

5) We supposedly have a Union.  It takes forever to receive a welcome package and ID card, BUT they'll make sure that they deduct their ""fair share"" from your bi-weekly checks.

6) MANDATORY retirement contribution is 6.25% of pre-tax pay.  For the ""rich ones"" who work here, that amount can be elevated to 9% (or thereabouts).  Once you change elections, you cannot go back.

7) PA payroll taxes are ""highway robbery""!

8) Don't expect to be treated as an individual.  All you are is a robot that they use and dispose of when you can no longer ""produce"" (or heaven forbid, don't ""master"" a concept within their time frame).

9) Training SUCKS!  The Trainers themselves are awesome, but don't expect to have the proper tools to do the job; EVEN IN TRAINING.

10)  Eight weeks of training is certainly NOT enough time to comprehend and effect all of the crap they throw at you all at-once.

11) The Federal student loan system is seriously flawed.  No wonder the student loan debt in this country is astronomical!

12) Don't ever expect the ""right hand to know what the left hand is doing"" ... EVER!

13) Change is good... BUT EVERYDAY?!  

14) Morons are promoted.  Don't expect to be promoted for having common sense, know-how and ""people skills"".

15) The computers and 500 different systems that you have to access in order to do your job SUCK!  

16) Job security?!  NO job is ""secure"" these days, I know.  PHEAA signs contracts with the Federal Government to do exactly that which the Federal Government CAN'T DO effectively... manage student loans!  If we don't ""meet our contracted numbers"" as a company, the Feds can rip the contract out right from underneath us!

17) Ever heard of the expression, ""too many chiefs and no Indians""?!  Well, if you haven't, apply at PHEAA!

18) Turnover's sky-high (gee, I wonder why?!), but it's just ""business as usual"" to the eighth-wits who ""run the show"".

19) Compassionate?  Understanding?  TRULY invested in the employees' success?  Not here!  You'll be treated better at McDonald's!

20) Minus the physical exertion of course, PHEAA's nothing more than a labor camp!  In fact, there's really no real difference between the two. 

21)They'll deny it up one end and down the other, BUT payroll's so incredibly inefficient that it takes ONE MONTH to produce FIRST PAYCHECKS!"

They are closed on state holidays which makes it great around Christmas and the new year. There is an open door policy and management is easy going.,There is no clear path to move up in the company.  Nobody knows how people get picked for promotions.  Many individuals who would make excellent candidates for the many open positions end up leaving out of frustration. Certain jobs tie you down and makes you stuck where you are for a long time. It also takes a long time to get good benefits because you have to apply for a state position.
261,Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency,"A job, not a career",2013-08-06,1.0,Loan Counselor,Nothing/Leaving the office every night,Don't get on the bad side of management.

There are some opportunities to move up or around, and the opportunity to move into a salaried state job with benefits is there as well.","Unfortunately, the job comes with a lot of pressure. You are rated on your ability to get as many borrowers current and off the phone as possible while maintaining the fantasy that the borrower's issue will be resolved on the one call. Promotions are often given on the basis of longevity, not on any qualifications, and these promotions are not always predictable. (It also makes it The work schedule of 12 or 12:30 to 9 p.m. is convenient for some things, but it can be very difficult if you have a family, and there must be openings if you want a schedule change; you lose the shift differential, as well, so you have to take a pay cut."

On the floor you spend 8 hrs taking 1 call after the other  and some people know nothing about the student loans they signed for, others feel that if they didn't get a bill they shouldn't pay (even if they never called in to say they moved) although their Master Promissory Note states billing is only a courtesy. There are no real breaks between calls, and your scheduled breaks are individual (won't be going same time as your team members), and your 1/2 hr lunch and 2- 15 min breaks are timed and 1 min late here and there works against you (as well as absences) and are the number 1 reason for being let go."
