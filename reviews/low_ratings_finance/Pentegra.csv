0,Pentegra,quality control,2022-03-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Nice cowokers with whom you can rely on,the salary is below average. Some Seniors are really bad in management
1,Pentegra,Company Cares about Employess,2022-02-18,4.0,(Professional Employee),My experience at Pentegra has always been that there is flexibility and attention to what employees need. Since the onset of COVID this company has stepped up and given the employees the option to work remote since March of 2020. I appreciate the fact that Pentegra works to acknowledge employees and keep them engaged. There is individual attention that you do not find at other firms.,Some co-workers are not aware of what it is like at other firms and should take a really good look at what they have at Pentegra.
2,Pentegra,Not too much work,2022-01-31,1.0,Software QA Tester,"QA analysis are working remotely give her laptop to family members to move the mouse to look like active in Skype.
There is not much work to do.",Nothing to learn from this company.
3,Pentegra,Management went downhill fast.,2021-10-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There used to be some.,"Lazy management, poor communication, terrible work life balance, company culture went down the toilet, expects you to be able to read your manager's mind as an excuse to not train or notify employees on new policies and procedures."
4,Pentegra,Great place to work,2021-03-16,5.0,Former Employee,"I think the culture was a pro as it appeared that management wanted to do things here and there to build moral, even thought he job itself is inherently a stressful job","I dont have a whole lot of cons, Pay could be a little better."
5,Pentegra,Not bad at all,2021-03-04,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Good good good good good not bad,N/A can not not complain
6,Pentegra,Thumbs Up,2021-03-03,4.0,Client Service Representative,"Public transportation accessible, easy commute",Parking lot shared with other companies
7,Pentegra,Pentegra Services Job Review,2021-02-15,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Good work life balance and nice people,"The technology (website, and software) are not great. Working can be challenging when dealing with errors and slowness"
8,Pentegra,"""Be careful, not a great place to build a career nor continue a career.""",2020-10-28,1.0,Regional Director,Parking when in the area but other than that it was a terrible decision to join.,"Bad company culture that they claim they are working on--Senior Management does not care about anyone below them...SELL SELL SELL is all they care about. Charge clients an absurd amount and now are paying for it with a couple legal action notices. Charging fees to participants/clients without notifying them. They treat you like a machine. No One cares about your health. Salary is too less compared to the market salary. The culture at Pentegra is literally toxic. Management that says they care but actually don't. Constant random reorganizations. Top talent manning the life boats to get out before the ship sinks
Low morale due to instability. Need I say more. Just do some digging on Pentegra before thinking of applying."
9,Pentegra,This company should appear in Human Resources curriculums as the model of INEFFICIENCY,2020-10-23,1.0,Internal Sales,The ability to work from home.,Every department in this company operates like they have square wheels. This makes completing your workload in a timely and accurate fashion nearly impossible. None of the systems communicate with each other which leads to many errors and inhibits the client experience. This causes an extreme amount of frustration in completing even small tasks. Management has been informed on numerous occasions but each time acts like they have heard it for the first time. Their system inefficiencies and lack of training lead to high turnover in every role of the company from account manager to sales.
10,Pentegra,Pentegra is a Directionless Ship,2020-10-10,1.0,Regional Director,The only pro here is for their own purpose. I mean just look at their recent history “THEY ARE BEING SUED”. Just google it.,"No direction starting from the top. Poor management especially in Sales! They rip off the employee just like they rip off the participants. Pentegra Retirement Services Inc. was recently sued in a New York federal court by two retirement plan participants who claim the company engages in self-dealing and charges excessive fees in a $2.1 billion retirement plan it administers for more than 27,000 employees at nearly 250 financial institutions. Do you want to work for a company like this? Good thing I left in time!!!"
11,Pentegra,The Kind of CEO that Creates a Loyal Employee,2020-06-08,5.0,Account Manager,"Our CEO John Pinto, has been a phenomenal leader during such trying times. During a global pandemic as we live through history, I have bragged and continue to do so about the way that he has handled the company. He has most certainly put the health of his employees and our families first. In these unprecedented times, his compassion is priceless and greatly appreciated. This is truly one for the books.","Honestly speaking, I do not have any cons to list. No company that strives for growth is without trials and tribulations."
12,Pentegra,Pentegra is taking care of us!,2020-05-14,5.0,Prefer Not to Answer,"At a time when so many people do not know how they are going to pay their bills or get food, Pentegra has kept all employees working with no interruption of income.",At this time I can't think of any.
13,Pentegra,Pay attention Pentegra,2020-01-05,2.0,Administrative,"Benefits, locations, ergonomics of workplace.","TPA Management decisions are based on self centered, survival reasons and keeps the truth of failing strategies from the board that do not aligning with the company's culture that we are being taught."
14,Pentegra,Great Company  Working to Better Themselves Everyday,2019-12-09,5.0,Marketing Coordinator,"The company is on the upswing. They are working on total technology upgrade which will improve not only employee experience but also Pentegra's clients. 

Everyone is working as a team to make Pentegra a better place to work. They instilled a culture program aiming to better the work environment for all employees. So far the impact has been great! It's a great place to work where your input is valued and your hard work is appreciated.",Not enough staff in each department but with all the things happening that will change in the future
15,Pentegra,Senior Team Management,2019-12-08,2.0,Marketing Coordinator,Who are those people. Almost feel like they should have managerial position at most.,Culture. They try to make it as if they care but it’s totally bogus.
16,Pentegra,"A company in flux, but seems to be on the upswing",2019-10-30,3.0,Analyst,It was at a great location and the intra-office culture was really supportive and communicative.,"The company seems to be in flux, multiple employees shifting roles, positions or duties, the positions themselves either being removed or changed seemingly each quarter, and technology that may be incompatible with each other."
17,Pentegra,Read the fine print,2018-08-23,1.0,,"Flexible schedule, free parking, remote access","Under market  Pay, expensive/poor medical coverage, poor C-Level management and leadership, lack of diversity in Senior Management, low employee morale, low retention of good talent"
18,Pentegra,Getting better every day.....,2018-07-13,3.0,Anonymous Employee,It is evident that the company management is committed to the employees.  There is a huge initiative to upgrade technology and implement change in the overall processes and culture.  All employees are being asked to be part of this endeavor.,"While the majority of the employee are excited and positive, there are those that still complain.  I just wish if people weren't happy they would either be part of the projects or work somewhere else."
19,Pentegra,Big turnover,2018-02-23,2.0,Anonymous Employee,The company offered great benefits.,After management changed there was a high turnover.
20,Pentegra,Decent,2018-02-05,4.0,Anonymous,Very laid back atmosphere. Management is not constantly on your back asking for things to get done. Flexible working hours,A lot of miss communication between account managers and billing. Things can go a lot of smoother if there was better communication
21,Pentegra,Stay away,2017-11-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Casual dress code. Flexible work hours,Everything else. Clear favorites. You’re punished for speaking up. Management hates to be challenged & you will never forget it by the way they treat you If you do question their procedures. Managment has no idea what the day to day job entails. Expectations are impossible. Very hard to give all of your time -overtime is expected- to a company that will tear you down every single chance they get. They do not back up or encourage their employees. I wish I had ample words for their lack of training. It’s a complete joke. As soon as you are hired you are set up to fail. No procedures or training guidelines. You would think that the company was started just last week. The pay is terrible compared to what Is expected of you and not even close to competitive. Benefits are average.
22,Pentegra,Great Company-- Great People,2017-08-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pentegra is a great company that has been around for almost 75 years .  Recently, Pentegra has received some bad press on Glassdoor – it’s time we recognize what is right at Pentegra on Glassdoor!

Pentegra affords all employees the ability to make a good living, increase their overall industry knowledge, receive their professional designations, and attain a higher level of education.   Pentegra offers competitive benefits including  health & welfare plans,  education benefits, a 401(k) plan with an above average matching contribution,  a cash balance plan offered to all full time regular employees, comfortable work environment in all locations along with flexible work arrangements with at home work opportunities for many positions.  Pentegra has consistently given raises to employees even during market downturns such as the major downturns of 2008 and 2009.  All employees have bonus opportunity which is based on both individual and corporate results. 

The senior management team is accessible to all employees,  they are honest and forthcoming—second to none in terms of integrity—the team does not live by the motto—“us first and the employees last”—we are in this together.  The senior team realizes the biggest asset to Pentegra are the folks who come to work every day.  The entire company wants to do the right thing—for our employees, clients and advisors—we care!!!   We have a CEO who is honest as the day is long and approachable.  He cares about the organization and the people in it.  Employees genuinely like each other here. 

Rather than focus on the negative comments from former employees  who may or may not have voluntarily resigned, we are continuing to move forward.  Many of the employees that have voluntarily left over the last few years to explore other opportunities have approached us to return.  We have re-hired many former employees and are happy to have them back where they belong.  When people want to return it speaks volumes about an organization.",My only negative though with regard to  Pentegra is that I didn’t get here sooner in my career!

24,Pentegra,Sales Director,2017-07-30,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Total benefits package very competitive.,"Old company culture identified as needing to be changed was good, however very slow to implement.  Not as entrepreneur mind set as is needed in competitive environment"
25,Pentegra,My Co-workers Are Awesome,2017-07-13,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people at Pentegra are great.  It's like a family and it feels like they really care.     
 I've seen people come together to support each other both inside and outside of work.  That doesn't happen everywhere.  There is flexibility in scheduling that is valuable to me.  The benefits the company offers are just as good or better than the other places I've seen.",There is room for advancement but I'm hoping as the company grows there will be even more opportunities in the future.
26,Pentegra,Turn Over is Unbelievable,2017-06-08,2.0,Office Support Role,Free coffee and tea and parking.,"Senior management is not aware of inner workings of lower level employees and the time each task actually takes to perform and does not consider how the uncertainty of parts of that work regarding quantities which could not be predicted and how it affects your intended schedule.  Work tasks/responsibilities were so many and tightly scheduled that any added volume would keep you from completing the daily workload.  There were not enough hours in the day to get all the work done.

Benefits were not that good and expensive for what you got for the money.  Hospitalization coverage was nearly nonexistent. 

Salary was ok but low for what was expected of you.  Management shys away from approved overtime for some and not others.  You cannot get your job done without it.

Some employees are treated differently in an unfair way and have much too much leeway in how they choose to work with others.  Bad behavior seems to be rewarded here."
27,Pentegra,Clueless Senior Management,2017-06-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some friendly co-workers, free coffee and ample parking spaces.  That's about it and I'm reaching on those.","Of all the problems this company has, they stem from the top.  All of the Senior VPs have been around way too long (20+ years in most cases) and exhibit absolutely real world direction or vision.  Completely pathetic.  Add to that a Board of Directors that has no clue about the retirement plan industry.  There is no career path, a bunch of old school managers and zero excitement.  Only work here as a last resort."
28,Pentegra,strong history and ethics,2017-05-26,4.0,Sales Representative,Incredibly focused on doing the right thing for retirement plan participants.,outdated technology that is being updated but too slowly.

30,Pentegra,"Flexible Work Environment, Great Colleagues",2017-03-15,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people who work at Pentegra are wonderful. With very few exceptions, everyone is helpful, smart, and willing to go above and beyond, and really are what make Pentegra a good place to work. Senior management is not just there to collect a paycheck; they seem to genuinely care about employees and the company overall, and hold regular ""status update"" meetings with employees to keep people informed and get feedback.

Flex-time schedules are an option, as is the ability to work from home. There is a decent vacation time/personal day package as well. 

There is an education program that provides for bonuses and raises upon earning certifications, so there is a great incentive to learn and grow with the company.","A lot of the great things about Pentegra stem from the fact that it is not a large company. It gives it a ""community"" feel. But this is also the source of some negatives as well. Resources (staff & budget) can be limited, and as a result overtime is expected during some busy times of year. Benefits are still on par with the industry average, but have been cut back several times over the last few years."
31,Pentegra,Administrative Assistant,2016-10-31,5.0,,This company is a great company to work for. Management is super flexible and always willing to help.

33,Pentegra,Politics in Management,2016-10-05,2.0,,Flexible work schedule and good benefits.,There's a tangled web of politics within the management level.
34,Pentegra,Horrible,2016-09-16,1.0,DCS,Benefits slightly above average but that's so they can pay you 40% below market rates.

I have had some great mentors at this company that I keep in contact, are friends and still rely on to provide good career advice and direction.","Because it still is ""old school"" , technology and communications down the lines are a little backward.  The actuaries and ""operational"" types still don't recognize the importance/ values of the sales production side and management doesn't really do anything to create unity and promote a team approach."

Only reason I am here is due to layoffs a few years ago in the biz, and had to work again.  It's amazing how this place stays in business - total incompetance at every level and it starts at the top with a CEO who knows nothing about the retirement services industry, and neither does the next level of managment.  The corporate culture stems from a resitance to change, and an abundance of people who have never had any training, and would not be able to work at a real company."
