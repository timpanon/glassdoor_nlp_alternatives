9,People’s Trust FCU,Good if you would like to provide free labor,2018-07-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Community, friendly, plenty of work to go around","The work never stops, seriously!
Most people who are around have been there for 5, 10, even 20 years though they are lacking experience in the departments they manage or head.

Lots of talking and great ideas, however thats all there is, talking.... no actual progress is done to the benefit of the credit union unless it is the absolute minimum to get projects or assignments done on time after their scheduled complement date.

Expect for tons of work, not only durring your working hours, but this company also expects for you to volunteer for numerous events throughout the year, and if you dont, you will get a bad review and not receive your bonus or a raise."
