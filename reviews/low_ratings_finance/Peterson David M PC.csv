0,Peterson David M PC,Small Law Firm,2020-12-12,4.0,Summer Intern,You gain legal experience working here. Coworkers are willing to help you if you are confused.,Rough start if you are unaccustomed to a stressful workplace.
1,Peterson David M PC,I loved the flexibility at this job.,2020-10-10,4.0,Legal Assistant,"flexibility, great people, simple work, fun",I can't think of anything
2,Peterson David M PC,Do Better,2019-01-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Not much.  You are sold on the fact that you can gain a lot of experience because its a smaller firm. Also pays minimum wage. Free water.,"You realize pretty quickly that the firm consists of just one attorney surrounded by mostly students/grads doing all of the clerical work that should be done by a actual paralegal/s. He sells you on gaining experience however unless you intend on becoming a personal injury paralegal I would avoid.  If your goal is to go to law school or become an attorney I would recommend forgoing the minimum wage and actually just get an internship to a reputable firm (which is what happened to many of his employees). Also, he's extremely rude and borderline abusive to some of his most tenured employees, often times difficult to watch."
3,Peterson David M PC,Don’t sell yourself short,2019-01-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Not much after you realize you are working for a tiny personal injury law firm. It was the first time I applied to a law firm and we found something in common during my interview because his mother was a professor at my university, so I figured why not.

Free paper cup of water.","Pretty much uses young students or grads who want to enter law to do all of his assistant work for minimum wage while he dangles the possibility of writing a rec for when you apply to law school.  

If you are truly sold on becoming a personal injury attorney then this can be a good fit depending on your patience. Otherwise, I would definitely forgo the minimum wage and actually just intern at a reputable firm (one with more than one attorney) and gain your experience that way.

Wasn’t necessary tough on me, but the way he treated some of his tenured folks seemed cruel and borderline abusive. 

Really odd enovirment. He surrounds himself with mostly females and everyone is almost half his age. 

A lot of current and former employees mention the experience as a pro..I would suggest this is highly overrated."
4,Peterson David M PC,Rich but Cheap,2018-12-22,1.0,Legal Assistant,"-You learn a lot about the industry very quickly, but only because they want to squeeze every last bit out work out of you.","-Very stressful workplace. The seniors constantly ask if you have things to do, even though your to-do list is already 20 items long.
-There's very obvious bullying and favoritism going on. He calls someone ""pathetic"" right in front of her face to another staff.
-The boss has about 3 different ways to earn money in addition to being a lawyer, lives in a  luxurious apartment, but pays at minimum wage, and offers the office nothing but ""free water"". Those tiny 1-cup bottled waters."
5,Peterson David M PC,Legal Assistant Review,2018-12-04,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working at David M. Peterson P.C. is a rewarding experience. The turnover for work is constant and every day, there are new cases to work on, new paperwork to draft and new issues that need to be addressed. The work is fast-paced and demanding, which makes the learning curve a steep one.
The firm focuses on two areas, personal injury/negligence and 9/11 claims. Language skills are vital to communicating with clients, which highlights another part of the job that is unique. There is no such thing as ""back office"" work. Employees are given the opportunity to speak with clients, and to provide input into the cases.  Helping with judgment calls really allows for critical thinking.  Employees partake in every step of the case process and this is really useful for people who are interested in going to law school.","As in all law firms, the work is demanding and requires work ethic and diligence. When there are emergencies or deadlines,  the proper attitude is to understand that criticism is not personal, and only meant to maintain high performance for the clients. 
There are times where it may seem disorganized but keeping track of your own work will fix the issue. This is a sole practitioner's office, and the amount of work will naturally accumulate and require concentration and efficiency to complete."
6,Peterson David M PC,Legal Assistant at David M Peterson PC,2018-12-02,5.0,Legal Assistant,"Working at this firm is somewhat similar to attending a class in law school. At the end of the day, you’ll learn so many things that can expand your field of knowledge and interest in law. 

Like in most jobs, you’ll face challenges and responsibilities. It’s perfect for those who enjoy problem solving and working in a team. Don’t be afraid to ask questions! 

You’ll develop the habit of being organized. e.g., taking notes of each meeting and conversation, making lists of your daily to-dos, and keeping track of important deadlines.

There are many opportunities for you to interact with clients/attorneys in person and over the phone. 

As employees in a personal injury law firm, our biggest goal is to do the best for our clients. Here you’ll work with a group of diligent and motivated people who will do everything they can to provide assistants for their clients.","It can feel a bit stressful sometimes, but it tends to get better after working for a while and gaining more experience.

Job does not offer overtime."
7,Peterson David M PC,Do not work here!,2018-08-08,1.0,Legal Assistant,If you're a female everything is fine and dandy. Other than that he gives free water.,"1. Egotistical and arrogant. Does not care about employees, cannot remember simple name in over 3 months.
2. Sexist. Treats the females employees over males, when working on cases he is surrounded by female employees. Male employees are left do do work alone and are assigned harder tasks. Also has tried to stop people from talking to co-workers for no reason. Female employees also have higher pay than male employees on average. 
3. Petty. Once he finds issues with employees he will try anything to cause trouble, ie. hour cuts, assigns harder tasks, even blatant attempts to fire for no reason.
4. Eccentric. He does not like people smiling, has given a suspension for smiling and also has attempted to fire employees for doing so
5. Alcohol. Drinks on the job.
6. Plain annoying. Gives work to people but assigns more work on top of that, blames employees for not finishing work on time."
8,Peterson David M PC,This firm will teach you skills that worth a million dollars!,2018-05-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"1.	You learn to never come in late because the boss calls the office at 8am sharp every morning to check if anyone is late. be on time unless you are one of those old employees
2.	""Anyone who comes in 10 mins late, twice a week will get fired from now on!"" don't worry if you are one of those old employees, this rule doesn't apply to you!
3.	you learn to always have your ears wide open when you are looking for redweld in the corner, never let the atty assume that you ignore the office manager on purpose… or else he will yell at you 
4.	You learn to never let anyone notice that you are mad or something unless you are the office manager. Especially don’t let the atty notice that, or else he might complain about your look will freak all his clients away.
5.	You learn to have a cup of coffee in the morning or/and in the noon, never come to work with a tiring look or else this will be considered as daydreaming.
6.	You learn to always back up your files with your own usb so you can restore them when someone delete yours
7.	You learn that he has more respects and trusts for those kr gossip girls…
8.	You learn that when he told you to call insurance, look around first to see if he’s also on the phone before you actually call, or else he will blame you for distracting him by hanging up your phone
9.	You can leave early on your 4th day of week since he won't let you exceed 40 hours. just when you are about to roll over, he will start the countdown thing.","If you can’t wait to get into a job and you don’t mind it’s only minimum wage, and you are happy to encounter the following experience, then…

1. Don’t try to explain anything when he yells at you because he won't let you. 
2. Try taking only one break a day even though you are hungry as hell. just wait till you get off work which is after 7 or so. because some gossip girls out there would go to the boss and complain about you taking more break than all the other staffs, when in fact they are the ones who took break at the maximal point. 
3. Walk as fast as you can when they send you out to oca or/and bank, and jog as you return. because the gossip girls are using this precious moment to make up dramas and complain against you.
4. The old employees are being quite aggressive while the new people can only remain silent when things don't sound fair to them
5. The old employees created as many dramas as they can and the atty won't bother to find out the truth before he yells at you
6. There is no equality nor freedom of speech for new people
7. You might get blamed on being slow when you scan and make copy because there are paper jam 5x within a min. if someone assign you 500 pages to scan, it’s going to be a tragedy because they won’t understand how much time you spent fixing the paper jam. Bear with them anyways!"
9,Peterson David M PC,Legal Assistant,2017-09-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"You'll learn to grow thicker skin and some basic legal assistant knowledge....
If you go to an Ivy League School but your as dumb as a goldfish...you will be put on a pedestal (so dont worry....you can take naps and still be praised)","If you don't go to and Ivy league and not much of a ""pretty girl"" ....don't work here....you'll get the worst mental abuse you can ever imagine for minimum wage (dont dont even go through that abuse at Mcdonalds and they get paid more)...the boss is extremely bipolar and will take it out on you... 

MAKE SURE YOU READ ""This job is neither indicative nor educative on ""law"" review on here. They are spot on with their comments."
