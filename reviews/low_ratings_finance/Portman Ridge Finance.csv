0,Portman Ridge Finance,Cons outweigh pros,2016-11-06,3.0,,Great benefits.  Work not too difficult and lots of redundant investments across the CLO portfolios so one analysis covers multiple CLOs.  CLOs are dwindling though and outlook is dim.,"Downer environment; underperforming stock, greedy mgmt.  No good ideas from execs.  Wondering how to keep things going - mgmt knows the CLO platform is a dead end but tries to keep it on life support.  But CLO platform has dropped in size and value tremendously (see public filings) and is still overvalued.  Always on cusp of leverage compliance - seems odd."
1,Portman Ridge Finance,KCRAP Financial,2015-07-15,1.0,,Generally well paid for mediocre work.  Good hours.  Managed CLOs cruising along - same work across platform of multiple CLOs.  Junior staff & jr. mgmt work well together.,"Egos.  Quirky managers.  Their way or the highway.  Chiefs don't work too hard.  Chiefs strying to figure out how to earn dividend on owned portfolio - good credits earn low rates, poorer credits with higher rates still marginal.  EPS keeps dwindling as CLOs are not paying off as expected.  Chiefs run the biz  to benefit of mgmt, not shareholders (see proxy and last 10-K - huge restatement of NII yet huge increase in mgmt salaries - go figure {2x to 3x increase in sr. mgmt salaries over 3 year period when restatements took earnings lower}) Questionable ethics?"
2,Portman Ridge Finance,Frustrating,2012-07-25,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Most employees have a good working relationship; back-office functions worked well together.  Analysts generally worked well together but could be cliquey,"No growth, some quirky people.  Too much tension amongst most senior execs between the business lines of asset mgmt vs. balance sheet portfolio"
