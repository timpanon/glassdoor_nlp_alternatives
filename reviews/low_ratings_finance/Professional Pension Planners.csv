2,Professional Pension Planners,awful,2017-11-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"some friendly coworkers, decent office environment","The Management is constantly thinking about replacing each team member. This company is all about cutting expenses and that means denying employees benefits or cutting them off all together.  The upper management have a very cold critical approach to worker relations. They seem to be overly paranoid that employees aren't worth their wage. They refuse to hire a janitor, a plumber, or electrician because they'd rather guilt their low end employee into doing  this kind of grunt work.  It's a group of pushers, who are constantly pressing you about the same minor annoyances.  A lot of the typical office politics.  Wage is pretty average."
