You know what to do when you get there and you get it done.  The bonuses were good too.,Getting some of your bonus taken away for errors or quality mistakes was extremely disappointing.
8,Progressive Financial Services,ehh,2017-04-28,2.0,Collections Specialist,The hourly base pay was decent.,Ridiculous goals that leave you relying on other people to do what they are supposed to do in order for you to do your job.  Almost impossible to bonus.

management would not listen to your suggestions on anything. there seemed to be a lot of pilferage of commissions, you may have worked on an account and got close to a collection and someone would take the final collection call and get credit for it."

Also the constant changing goals and work was difficult, not challenging in a good way.","Terrible management, training not representing floor, terrible work environment, hostile employees and management"
20,Progressive Financial Services,My manager Helped groomed me into a hard working individual. He showed me how to run a collection company.,2016-03-04,4.0,Assistant Dorector,"Great owners, senior management, and environment for collectors. Great commission structure for all levels of employment. One of the best if not the best in the valley with hourly. Bonus quarterly for most the clients on top of commission.","Benefits, not working 37.5 hours. This is a huge Disadvantage for us when we are competing for more business. Some upper management not being fair and looking for ways to get you out to save there own. Basically business 101 I guess."

22,Progressive Financial Services,Don't bother,2015-08-18,1.0,,"Good pay
Laid back work atmosphere","there are so many Cons it's hard to list them all! 
The management doesn't care at all about their employees, The company as a whole sucks! The building is constantly dirty, not too sure where they find the employees who like to trash the bathrooms, steal other peoples lunches and seem to be some of the rudest people you could ever meet. On top of dealing with that it's like pulling teeth to try and get a raise! After 8 years and 2 raises (which had to be given to everyone due to the contract we're on) telling your boss you are leaving because your paycheck doesn't leave you with not enough to pay bills.. a raise magically happens! You have to tell them you're leaving to get that?! And it's only if they feel they need you enough. It doesn't seem like enough though to deal with all the ignorant coworkers you have to deal with. I'm not even sure how some people are even employed after 5+ years and still can't manage to do a job they have been taught multiple times. If you know someone higher up it sure helps I'll tell you that. Everyone else who seems to actually care about their job just get overlooked. Especially when management delegates all of their work out to go chat with other areas or take a walk or basically do anything except their job! It's a waste of time and effort to work at such a place where the don't value their employees."
23,Progressive Financial Services,Resolutions Specialist,2015-08-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Decent pay. Nothing else nice to say about this place. Don't ever work here. The managers are horrible and don't ever do anything but delegate their work and treat employees like garbage.,"Horrible management, get treated like a 5 year old child, company operates on contracts so no job security. Constantly have to have floor meetings about how people treat the bathrooms. Air quality sucks, vents are covered in dust and probably mold, which means everyone in this disgusting building is always sick. The ceilings leak and all they do is replace the ceiling tiles to get rid of the stains. Regularly see fights break out on the floor because managers don't know how to deal with people. Most people don't last more than a few weeks. Honestly have no clue where they find the people they hire in this place. Ghetto girls come in dressed like they're headed to the club or the gym. The bathrooms are always torn up, sometimes unusable because of the frightening things people do in there. I will say it again. Do not apply here."
24,Progressive Financial Services,progressive review,2015-08-12,1.0,"Rehab Account Reviewer, Team Leader",i enjoyed the steady pay check,"no windows, extremely depressing environment"
25,Progressive Financial Services,ED Clerical,2015-06-11,2.0,QA Clerical,"Good money, health benefits, get same Holidays as the State","Very stressful, no mistakes, called out in front of people"
26,Progressive Financial Services,Executive Assistant,2015-06-08,4.0,Executive Assistant,"Laid-back environment, fun coworkers, easy work load","day goes by slowly, low salary"
27,Progressive Financial Services,its okay,2015-02-21,3.0,,"the dress code is pretty much the same in high school, its a repetitive job so its not hard to master unless your technologically challenged, people are friendly, and managers are easy to talk to","often changing polices and bonus structure, high standards to meet, feel as though there is no way to move up in the company"
28,Progressive Financial Services,Collaborative Mediocrity,2014-12-20,1.0,Debt Collector,Met some good people while I worked there.,"Limited potential at this company regarding compensation and career.  The culture is pretty negative, and I just didn't enjoy going to work.  I don't want to be so negative, but I would like candidates who are considering this company to know what they are getting into.  I really feel like the managers are a group of people that couldn't hack it where they were, so they formed a club."
29,Progressive Financial Services,Overall decent job,2014-11-12,3.0,,"Good pay, most co workers are very nice as well as some management",Only con was worrying about not having a job if quota wasn't metal
30,Progressive Financial Services,"Keep Going, not worth the stress",2014-09-29,1.0,Debt Collector,Good Commission only during tax time,The director completely micromanages the entire building. I worked on the collections side for 6 months and found better employment elsewhere. It is not worth the stress of knowing whether or not your going to have a job the next day. For only starting at 11.50 an hour it's not worth it.
31,Progressive Financial Services,Degrading,2014-09-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,hours / dress code flex breaks,micro managed - you are degraded daiily
32,Progressive Financial Services,The arm pit of collection.  So much if you're the managers pet you are great if not your up the creek without a paddle.,2014-06-17,1.0,Debt Collector,If you're one of the favorites your golden.  If not too bad for you.,This place is a huge con also the managers are control freaks it's so micromanage it's crazy. If you are straight out of high school it's good not if you're ban adult.
33,Progressive Financial Services,Worst collection company to work.,2014-06-06,1.0,Debt Collector,"It's easy, and you don't really have to have a work history. This is a job while you look for a real one or going to college. Please don't stay there pass these two reasons.","Rampant favoritism, discrimination and harassment is swept under the rug, staff is treated like children,  management rewards good workers with extra work for no additional pay, no where to move up within the company, management makes it clear that you're expendable.  Office culture is exactly like high school. Policies change everyday. Very High turnover rate
Accounts assigned to collectors are controlled and distributed by managers whom play favoritism.
This allowed for management to control your overall salary when working on commission."
34,Progressive Financial Services,"Good company, not so good industry",2014-06-05,4.0,Debt Collector,"Brutally honest and upfront company.   No secrets are concealed here, you are told what is expected from day one and they hold you accountable for your own actions after.   You can and will succeed if you have a proper work ethic.  Fair scheduling, professional staff, and basic training suitable for a quick learner.    
Receiving high dollar bonus checks are not as rare as I thought it would be, almost 30% of the floor was receiving bonuses in the thousands.","Not a good fit for all persons transitioning from a customer service background.   The position is fast paced and based in a typically loud call center like environment.   Though the environment is not  terribly unprofessional , I do not personally have the ability to listen to a manager screaming in my left ear while trying to listen to a conversation being held in my right ear.  Turn over is high.  They will terminate your employment based on attendance and/or overall performance.  

I consider myself (as do a few others)to be fairly intelligent however, I am not perfect. I feel the occasional typo or incorrect call disposition code should not be penalized, especially considering the rapid nature of the position and tendency for frequent technological crashes."
35,Progressive Financial Services,Adults work here not children,2014-03-15,3.0,Department of Ed Collector,"There is good money to be made. Due to all the recent changes in the way collection are handled for defaulted student loans, collections no longer feels like collections but rather you feel like you are really helping people.","The management. WE are adults working to make OUR money. Working to HELP people. WE do not need to be scolded like small children. More importantly keep in mind we are human beings not computers, we will error from time to time, it is not out of laziness or nefarious behavior to be deceitful, it is because we are human and it happens."
36,Progressive Financial Services,company sucks,2014-02-02,2.0,Debt Collector,the employees will help more than the so called managers,managers are greedy just want to figure out how not to pay out bonus so they can go to the casino..and don't think to can talk to a manager about something personal the whole office will know by the end of the day...too much back stabbing
37,Progressive Financial Services,Can't wait to leave,2014-01-23,2.0,Debt Collector,"Good co-workers, nice commissions, laid back managers. I like the vacation pay out. I've made lots of money but willing to give it up for a more stable environment .","It would take all day. Firstly the bonus structure is constantly changing. Every month they find someway to pay you less and less. Constant turn over, I've seen new hires who didn't make it 1 week on the floor. HR is a joke if you are ever uncomfortable with any given situation you just have to keep your mouth shut or risk loosing your job. You can't post your resume online for fear the recruiter is going to see it and tell the director and then you'll be on your way. Constant restructuring make it hard to want to continue to work for this company"
38,Progressive Financial Services,Great opportunity,2014-01-19,3.0,Supervisor,Alot of money to make,Micro Management by the director ...not open minded at all. His way or the highway
39,Progressive Financial Services,"It was a great place to work, I miss it.",2013-12-06,5.0,Collection Manager,Good salary Benefits.  good working environment.,long hours but worth It
