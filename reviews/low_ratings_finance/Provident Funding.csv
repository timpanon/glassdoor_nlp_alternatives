2,Provident Funding,Best to keep searching,2022-03-22,1.0,Analyst,"Worked with some really great people over the years resulting in many long term friendships (but you really can’t give credit to the company for that).

Most work is done remotely now (but see below for more on that).","No proper HR Department : The owner with no prior education or experience is the HR person. This becomes a real problem when one of the many relatives or personal friends they employ is harassing you.

Pay disparity: Salaries vary wildly even within the same job title. Female employees being paid less despite same education and experience as male peers.

Bare minimum benefits: No 401k match, very few PTO days comparatively. No accommodations whatsoever unless they are legally required to do so.

Cheap, astoundingly cheap: When working in an office was more common it took an act of Congress to get approval to order post it notes and pens. Now that remote work is more common they are saving on all those leases and rented space but still chose to layoff about 10% of the work force. They’ve also steadily increased the portion of employee cost for benefits while reducing the percentage they pay. It’s ok to look for ways to save money it it’s not ok to do it at the expense of the very people who made you richer.

Poor management and layoffs: Management is mostly family member or personal friends with no actual qualifications or the required temperament to manage. No diversity either, their management team with very few exceptions tend to be all white and all male. A few women or minorities have been given superficial “lead” roles and even still it’s alarming how little diversity there is.

Toxic business model: Their goal is to hire inexperienced recent college graduates and work them to death for a couple of years. Because they haven’t done any meaningful hiring in 10 years the population has aged, started families, are caring for aging parents, etc. Employees can’t or simply don’t want to work 12 hour days any longer but they don’t adjust to the changing needs of their workforce.

Remote workers do not have tools required: I’m working with people who don’t have a scanners or printers or even proper desks or chairs. This company services billions of dollars, but can’t see to it 2 years into the pandemic that employees have basic office equipment to do their jobs?

In summary, find a company that wants you to stick around and backs it up with action by investing in their people, not just the occasional $10 stipend for a fast food lunch that’s suppose to replace the customary holiday party."

- No layoffs/stable","- Company is dying and the CEO is checked out or ready for retirement. Haven’t had a large new grad hiring class since 2012 (headcount on a consistent decline for almost 10 yrs), no aspirations to expand market share or product offerings like other mortgage companies, and limited investment in technology. The writings on the wall. Remaining employees now have to take on the job of previous colleagues since they’re not hiring to replace those who have left 
- underwriters and closers are worked to the bone. They do the work of 2-3 employees at any other company, while severely underpaid 
- Very limited career advancement opportunities unless you’re already in the inter circle or part of the Pica family.
- so cheap. $13 a person for the holiday party, need mgmt exception to order Kleenex instead of Office Depot tissues back when there were offices
- no layoffs and very limited hiring means an accumulation of poor performers who would have been laid off elsewhere. Those who are competent or “super stars” (as provident likes to call them), have already left the company, and those who remain there either can’t find a new job because they’re not the sharpest tool in the shed or need the stability of no layoff in their lifestyle over a good career 
- terrible benefits (no 401k match, expensive insurance, limited PTO days bc you need PTO for every little thing and drains the hours)
- not flexible/accommodating. Staff need to submit PTO in advance to take even 1 or 2 hrs off during the day for simple things like picking up their child"

Management stresses that their production employees are a great asset for the company, yet they fail to realize many people there are unhappy and they don’t take action to implement changes.  There’s also not a lot of room for upward movement, even if you are hardworking.  They’ll promote a few people to team leads just because these individuals are good at their jobs, but don’t realize these people aren’t leaders.  I’ve even witnessed management and “leaders” talking bad about other employees.  Additionally, they allow family members to manage each other which I always saw as very unprofessional, despite the company essentially being founded on nepotism.  Aside from the unreasonable workload and expectations, the benefits are atrocious.  No 401K match, no sick days, no maternity leave.  They make it extremely hard for parents to have a decent work-life balance as well because they’re so strict about your hours and don’t allow you to work from home.   During the time I worked there, I saw the very few perks we had get taken away.  I’ve seen good people get let go for no reason at all, and I’ve seen people get moved to lower positions just to get work done because they won’t spend the money to hire more people.  Lastly, management will try to win you over with the salary and make false promises to you, but when you find out what the actual job is that they NEED you to do, it’s not worth it anymore."

The Pica family who own Provident Funding do not consider the vast majority of their employees to be human beings, deserving of basic respect. Now you might be thinking ""I will distinguish myself by becoming a top performer through sheer willpower and hard work!"" This is what I and many others planned to do when we accepted offers to work here directly out of college, ready to set the world on fire. Irrelevant. They will not care if you put up the best numbers in the company every day for the rest of time (this would net you at best canned email praise from a pointless middle manager and would never result in a raise, promotion, or any meaningful appreciation). The Pica family has already installed family and friends in any relevant management positions, and does not consider input or ideas from anyone outside of that pre-formed group, which is closed for entry. 

Oh by the way, there is no Human Resources department, so there is no outlet to report harassment, abuse, misconduct, or other problems. This is a clear signal that PF does not care about employee concerns, well-being, or mental health. 

There is also no effort to develop employees or present any sort of career path. Advancement was mentioned during my interview, and by humble-bragging middle managers on occasion, where their advice was to do things I had already been doing, which confirmed no one noticed or cared that I had been doing those things (work lots of overtime, be # 1 in production measures). 

As a result of the above, employees do not develop any transferable skills. Because they hire almost exclusively fresh college grads, most employees have never worked a corporate job elsewhere. This makes them vulnerable to think the culture at PF and the bleak nature of working there is a normal part of professional life. This saddens me, as PF is swallowing the potential their employees don't know they have. No one at PF has much success job hunting, because they do not have any skills that are valued by the job market. 

The daily drudgery of going to a job you hate, being faceless and without acknowledgment for your achievements, and receiving only negative feedback about your performance can really get to you. It makes good people start to question their self worth as human beings, and start to believe they are failures who are unworthy of basic human needs, such as love, companionship, and happiness. PF is a factory that produces depressed people. When I recently watched Game of Thrones, the downward spiral of Theon Greyjoy to become ""Reek"" immediately struck me as similar to the descent of continuing to work at PF as days go by (obviously GoT is way more dramatic and this is an exaggeration, but the point stands).

The Hope: Employees must reject self-doubt and take back their self-worth and control of their careers and lives. My advice as someone who has survived this dark chapter and gone on to thrive: 

1. Fully admit to yourself that your PF career is going nowhere: the blood sweat and tears you have put in have not mattered to the company, and you must come to acceptance with that. This is by far the most difficult step. I was in denial of this for years--years I wish I could get back.
2. Stop channeling your work ethic toward your job. Be there physically, but not mentally. You'll need your your mental effort for the rest of these steps.
3. Focus on finding out what skills are in highest demand, and which ones overlap with your aspirations. Google ""LinkedIn's top skills in demand this year"" to get a start. You don't need to know anything about what you choose, in fact that's the point.
4. Google for free online learning resources in your chosen area to get your start. The best news is that if a skill is in demand, there are great online resources available for you to learn it for free.
5. See if certifications exist for the topic/field you have chosen and pursue them relentlessly. If they do not exist, see if there are open badges available to certify your knowledge (Google ""open badges"" or ""mooc"").
6. Do not be afraid to fail at the above step. Failing only slightly delays success. Not trying and then aging is much scarier.
7. Look up people who have the job you want on LinkedIn, and see what parts of their summary/job descriptions you could incorporate or adapt to your profile. It is ok if a duty mentioned is a minor part of your job, as long as you can speak competently on the subject in an interview. Set your profile to not share updates before making edits.
8. Update your LinkedIn profile and resume to fully commit to marketing yourself to the role you want, highlighting only relevant experience. Delete even your core job responsibilities or achievements from PF that are not relevant to the job you want. Do not worry that your coworkers might see it, if they care about you they will understand and respect the hustle. Block or remove your boss if you're that worried, they won't notice.
9. Consider searching for volunteer opportunities with non-profits if you can find them, or search for online niche groups for people in the field and ask them for opportunities to do volunteer work. You can add this to your resume to make yourself a more appealing candidate.
10. You're a mentally tough survivor who has endured a lot, celebrate your life after Provident.

Ok, back to the review:

-- Complete disregard for customers / partners:

Due to the closed group of non-diverse family and friends running the company who do not think anyone else has worthwhile ideas, the company makes no effort to solicit feedback from customers, pay attention to feedback that customers voluntarily provide, measure impact of decisions made that affect the customer experience, or listen to employees who interact with customers or partners full-time. Competition has left PF in the dust due to this sheer lack of feedback loops, organizational learning, and continuous improvement which are basic building blocks for success in today's business world.

It was extremely frustrating to hear customers and partners both complaining about the same, unnecessary, easy-to-fix issues day after day, bubbling this feedback up the chain, and watching as absolutely nothing gets done. The reason? Fatcats at the top do not give a damn about their customers. Customers are not seen as human beings capable of critical thinking, they are wallets who should be silenced. PF has many unreasonable nickel and dime fees that accomplish nothing but enraging good customers, often when the customer is not at fault. It is a grind to pretend to defend this company's inexcusably unjust policies in the Servicing division. 


-- Horrible technology:

Their website touts technology as one of their differentiators. This is laughable. It is also ironic since the website looks like it was last updated in the 90s. All technology is proprietary and therefore very difficult to adapt to increasing expectations around usability that come with society's technological advancement. They are too cheap to either a) hire enough developers to keep up, or b) invest in a CRM or AUS platform to make development work quicker, simpler, and easier. To claim technology as a strength when it is such a glaring weakness is to pretend there has been no technological progress in the past 20 years. Competitors such as Rocket Mortgage or Better Mortgage must be laugh-crying over this claim, if they have heard of Provident.


-- Bad benefits

You will lose a lot of your paycheck to medical coverage, especially if you have a spouse and children on your plan. Better hope your spouse has a better employer. There is also no 401k match. But hey, if you stick with PF, who are you kidding, you'll never retire anyway."
41,Provident Funding,Fundamentally Exploitative,2018-02-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Provident was the definition of the dangling carrot. They provided a salary that was slightly above average to incoming college graduates (how and why is explained below). Raises were consistent in the rage of 5-10% (higher or lower depending on your proximity to the power of the ruling Provident family, or showcasing of meager talents).","Provident is a business school case study in the impact of automation on jobs in the financial service sector and how labor can be exploited for short term gain. Here's why: 

0. Heavy automation has allowed the company to automate the most trivial and monotonous jobs. Unfortunately, the jobs left over requiring even little skill are few . As a result, much of the ""jobs"" are actually paper pushing jobs or jobs that require very little skill. There are VERY few people at this company who actually perform job tasks that are transferable or valuable in today's market. 
1. The business is family owned and run. Nepotism is so apparent and common that everyone knows that your only ticket to climb the ranks is your proximity to family members in power. 
2. Young labor is recycled. This is the actual business model. Young workers are attracted to the job by an above average advertised pay, and then very little is invested for retention, because this is an intentional business model. This allows the company to provide quick training to young ambitious kids, and then cycle in new kids once the older class realizes whats going on. It's a genius model. 
3. Benefits are absymal (pay itself is above average, but medical, bonuses, and other fringe benefits are laughable or non-existent). The company functions on a ""low-cost-structure"". In business speak, this means that overhead costs are heavily minimized so that the company can survive market downswings. Unfortunately, costs are kept so low, the company not only appears cheap, IT IS cheap. We received $13 per person stipend for our company holiday party. Put this in perspective. The company makes hundreds of millions in revenue and is highly profitable. The Pica family is VERY wealthy.  VERY. They can spare a few more dollars for things."

-system improvements take ages to implement

-they treat you like cattle and move you around where ever they need you. When you are a first out of college, that's fine, you learn different roles however when you've worked there for a while, worked you way up a bit, then they move you to an entry level role, that's really demoralizing. I guess that's better than being laid off...
-The internal system was build by people that don't really know what their doing or didn't go to school for software engineering. Needless to say, things break all the time. When they implement new processes, they break the other processes. Then you're expected to just use work arounds to do your simple daily job functions.
-there's a severe lack of transparency. If a decision is made that directly affects you, its rare you will get an explanation of why the new process is in place.

You do have to take some initiative to get ahead, but if you communicate your goals they will help you reach them and promotions are based on merit not seniority. The company is very loyal to its employees, never having made a mass layoff despite the market is unheard of for mortgage companies.  You receive a performance evaluation every year and get the opportunity for a pay increase annually based on performance.  Multiple offices with opportunity to transfer to new location if you want to move.  Company has improved significantly over past several years in listening to its employees, and making changes for the better to how it operates.  Large discount is offered to employees who want to get a loan as a benefit, allows you to get very good mortgage rate.

But the job itself blows.  The senior managers are liars snd awful people yet have the CEOs full support so are untouchable.  So, middle managers try to emulate them as matching their a-holeness.  While this is hard to do, they give it a good shot.  Don't work here if you want to ever be treated with any respect.  You won't be.  If they feel the company needs you elsewhere, they'll move you whether you want a complete job change or not.  If you're an underwriter, they'll make you make collection calls over night and tell you that you have a terrible attitude if you don't get excited about your move.  The CEO recently loosened up his guidelines considerably.  Either he's been totally wrong in his thought process since 1991 or he's selling.  Since he never thinks he's wrong, I think he's selling soon.  Managers at this company would have difficulty transitioning to other companies so they better hope he decides not to sell.  Would not recommend anyone to work here unless desperate.","No upward mobility opportunities, terrible benefits, treated with complete disrespect from middle management, CEO nowhere to be found and will probably sell company soon.

In short, he is either ignorant by accident or on purpose, neither of which characterize a respectable CEO.

As is emphasized in several other posts, the level of nepotism is unapologetically laughable. Unfortunately subjective interpretation of performance has become a running joke within the company.

Management makes an effort to provide the illusion of culture over culture itself. The true in-office camaraderie comes from bonding over feelings toward management. Unfortunately those who could change this sentiment either don't understand or don't care.

- Company culture: Expect to be treated as an expendable worker.

All non-work websites are restricted and no social events are organized. You will receive a $10 per diem for food around the holiday season but only if your team performs up to standard.  The management will then tell you how special you are to get this per diem, basically making you think they treat you so extraordinarily well. This couldn't be further from the truth.
- Constant job security threats: You are required to go through testing once you begin as an employee with the threat of termination should you do poorly on the tests. From the get go you get the feeling that you are expendable and not welcomed in with open arms.

72,Provident Funding,# Unethical Company,2015-07-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Can't think of any Pros aside from the days off or when I quit just like many of my peers have done.,"So many... 

- Company claims to be ethical yet when a mistake is made the managers tell you to put blame on the other party. An example is when I was funding,  I informed   management  I  had made a mistake and I was told   to not  admit to it and  to  find a way to put blame on the escrow officer. Other times we've been told by senior management  to try and put blame on the other party(s) i.e  broker or escrow . How ethical is that? 

- Lack of respect for their customers and employees. So much micro managing and Provident funding's way or the highway.

-Demotions are prevalent even if you have many years of say underwriting experience or you take maternity or paternity leave. I've seen quite a few managers being demoted for this.  The only way you won't get demoted is if  you are a family member, dating one, or a friend.

-Managers are constantly talking down to employees, per one of the managers it's coming from the top meaning the CEO and or  COO.

-Not a profession, simply a paycheck. Be careful college grads. Don't be deceived... I've seen so many positive reviews lately that it's quite shocking. I can't think of 1 person in the company who would post a positive review aside from the owners or their cronies and I know a lot including top management.  Just look at one of the positive reviews here, not 1 con listed, WHAT A JOKE!!!

-Sick days are part of your PTO. No 401k Limited holidays.

-Place is toxic.

- Just like the other reviewer said, the COO  referred to brokers as ""Riff-Raff"", so we can only imagine what she refers to the employees."
73,Provident Funding,Dead End Job,2015-07-07,1.0,Anonymous,You have Saturday and Sunday off.,"Gave it one start because zero is not an option. There are very few loans being submitted, so the job has become nothing more than a call center worthy of India. The ""Servicing Analyst"" (AKA Customer Service) manager monitors your every move on the phone to make sure you take call after call after call all day. The expectation is that you take 80 calls a day. The majority of employees that were Underwriters or Funders have been demoted to Customer Service, unless of course you're a relative, a friend, or dating one. That's how you get promoted. In an office of 24, the office dwindled down to 9 employees. Everyone resigned, and the ones left are looking for a job. Now, if you read positive reviews, be wary of them as it is believed that ""Provident Funding and Friends"" are posting their own to increase their ratings and also to attract new naive graduates to do the mundane work. There is discrimination when it somes to religion, as an employee was denied time off for religious reasons to travel to Israel. The ""Witnesses"" can work part-time and work 3 days a week so they can attend/teach bible studies and knock on doors. Managers have been demoted for taking maternity/paternity leave."
74,Provident Funding,A two star company at best.,2015-07-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Generally speaking, the majority of offices are young, so that makes for a good office environment.","Upper management seems to be far removed from the needs of its employees, which is why the turnover rate is so high. Beyond that, the company is pushing for servicing, meaning it's only hiring for individuals to take calls from angry customers (unfortunately, customers don't call to tell you what a great job PF is doing). There's not much support for these positions from middle or upper management, so the job is ten times harder than it should be. This would be fine if there is room to grow, but as others have mentioned there is absolutely zero room for growth (unless managers quit...which may not be an issue since the company is losing employees left and right). Most individuals only work here for a year or two before leaving to pursue higher education or another job...no one stays beyond that much except for the 'lifers.' 

As others indicated, no matching 401K or sick days. If you want to take time off, you need to do so 2 weeks in advance, which is difficult to do for a doctor's appointment, etc. 

Unless you're a family friend, seek employment elsewhere. The lack of benefits and opportunity for growth really make taking calls and being cursed at by customers for eight hours a day not worth it at all."
75,Provident Funding,"Five Years with an Ethical, Growing Employer",2015-07-05,4.0,Mortgage Consultant,"Directly out of college, I genuinely lucked out in finding an employer within my preferred field firmly committed to ethics (rare) during an unprecedented time for the industry and a period of aggressive growth for the business.  This allowed me to receive accelerated, diverse exposure of the company as well as the industry and positioned me for future success.

To provide some chronological guidance, the application/interviewing process is fluid, not rigid, with the goal being to find passion, past achievement, attention to detail and an entrepreneurial spirit. Once welcomed to the team, the training material can be dull and overwhelming, though that is expected in a mature, ever-changing and bureaucratic industry. Once on the job, your industry understanding will develop rapidly through repetition and on-site support.  Even once the material is ""mastered"", constant change within the industry, the personalities of those you interact with and an individual's commitment to continuous self and company improvement will keep you challenged.  As you grow with the firm, your effort, ethics, intelligence and initiative will be rewarded via increased responsibilities and monetary incentives.  

No matter the position, Provident employees will quickly and continuously receive broad exposure to a variety of services within the real estate industry (customers,  coworkers, third party brokers, real estate agents, title companies, county/state governments, auditors, investors, etc.) positioning oneself for future success by increasing options if the position they find with Provident is not desirable.  Fortunately, the company is open to a dedicated, proven employee's request for positional change, so that future success absolutely can be found within (nationwide, locational change can also be made available).  The company's culture is defined by its commitment to ethics and prompt customer service, while the office culture varies from office to office, and division to division.  Of course you are encouraged to show your personality and brighten up the office environment as well as the occasional decentralized, web-based meeting, ultimately developing lifelong relationships with your coworkers. 

Coming from someone who has interviewed, trained and managed many employees and personally worked on both the origination and servicing sides of the business in ~5-7 offices nationwide, I have been exposed to executive management's commitment to changing the mortgage industry time and time again.  Our reason for being in business extends beyond profit to minimizing mortgage default via hands-on hiring, conservative, disciplined underwriting guidelines as well as proprietary technology (designed to automate regulation compliance and build scalability) built and improved upon by the initiative of employees.  This stance allows the company to offer the best price and service to the ""best"" customers and all employees play an integral part in achieving this.","The initial training can be dull, as explained, but I am confident of Provident's commitment to continually improve upon its thorough foundation.  The company's benefits leave something to be desired but may be up to par with the industry - specifically a slow accrual of paid-time off, no sick days and no guaranteed 401k match. Even so, Provident's progressive base pay and commission/bonuses exceed expectations and continuously reward the type of employee explained above, fostering a meritocratic culture.   The only other knock that I can honestly share is regarding the career progression, which is not structured - but again this differs from division to division and is being improved upon."

87,Provident Funding,Experience of a Provident Funding Closer/Funder,2015-01-06,1.0,Mortgage Closer,"It was my first experience in the corporate world. I learned first-hand the inefficiencies of the corporate hierarchy. The company forces all parties in the mortgage process to bend to their strict guidelines. This reputation is well known amongst closing agents and brokers alike. Expect opposition from all parties should you become an employee here. I did learn how to mediate angry closing agents and quickly memorized the line “I know we do things differently than other lenders”. 

Working for Provident also taught me to endure hardship and maintain professional relationships despite personal views. I did create life-long friendships with those who suffered alongside me in the Provident trenches. I salute you brother in arms, the war has been won.","ENVIRONMENT/PHILOSOPHY
The branches are small so it really is luck of the draw who you end up working with. You realize quickly there are two types of people, the lifers and those that took the job because of the economy and the need to payoff student debt. I was lucky to join a branch with some great people but while I was there 5 people left the branch in less than a year and a half. I was the sixth. The company has an extremely high turnover rate but don’t seem to care because the system continues to MOVE FORWARD.  At the same time, I can’t fault upper management. They got into the company at the right time and solidified their positions. There is no room for advancement unless your aspiration is to underwrite mortgage loans. You will be told to accept “diagonal advancement” which entails no change in position with minimally higher pay. You do have to royally screw up to not get the 10% raise every year unless upper management has a grudge against you (which happens!).  Complete gap between day to day operations within branches and upper management. Headphones were taken away to “increase communication” within the branch even though all communication is done through the company messaging system (even cubicle to cubicle). Get used to “anti-logic”.

WORK
You do not need a college degree to do this job. They recruit college grads that need to pay off debt with promises of extensive training, which includes two weeks in California at the corporate office (I did have an awesome time in San Francisco though, so thanks for that).  As a closer/funder every aspect of the position is reviewed.  Expect to have arguments about signatures and whether or not dates look like they are completed correctly. Be prepared to discuss if an 8 is “loopy enough” (actual terminology).

The term “buyback” is used as a scare tactic to ensure all documents are perfectly completed, which only increases when volume slows. They do not tell you, however, your work as a closer has no bearing on whether or not a loan will be “bought back” in the secondary market. Any issues worthy of a “buy back” occurs in underwriting (mysterious magical processes most never have the pleasure of learning).  As a closer you get really good at stacking pieces of paper in a certain order, scanning said papers, and printing shipping labels. Other than that, don’t expect to learn any transferrable skills outside of the mortgage industry."

· Resume builder: If you go out of your way to take on extra work, you can develop a skill set that will allow you to exit Provident with favorable prospects.","· Poor benefits: No 401k matching, PTO accrual is slow and must be used for any type of time off (with the exception of bereavement & holidays, etc.), working on the eves of major holidays is common.

· Inexperienced management: A lot of pointless meetings, conference calls, and silly initiatives that are never seen through to completion. Organizational decisions aren't made based on data or strategic thinking but rather because they're passed down the chain of command (i.e., a member of executive management's family). Excessive micromanaging across the board because middle managers don't have anything else to do since the markets have slowed down.

· Culture & morale: The paychecks and job security are the two main reasons employees stay. After a year or two, most people realize that professional development simply isn't a priority at this company.

· Mind-numbing & repetitive work: If you are the analytical type and looking for quantitative/technical work, you will be very bored."

The same manager who offered you a 'promotion' from one role to another will, with a straight face, ask you to view a move back to the first position as something other than a demotion, despite it also reducing your salary. The only chance of making substantial upward movement within the company is to be located in one of the large hubs (San Bruno, Santa Rosa, and Pittsburgh) and gain the favor of one of the departmental managers - bonus points if they are a Pica, are related to a Pica, or are trying to become related to a Pica, which they usually are. 

On top of all of this, the mortgage industry is in a severe decline that is erasing the few decent opportunities that remain. The only positions available at this company are for the 'Servicing Analyst' role, which is actually a glorified collections position that does not require analysis skills, just regurgitating company policies to angry borrowers.

Good opportunity to learn some corporate culture.  Sometimes you have great co-workers and awesome branch leads. I was fortunate to have both. Good out of college job.","Here is where the cons really stack up.  Provident Funding being my first job, in which they only target college graduates, I guess you could say I was naive.  Having been at my employer for a few months, I can honestly say Provident Funding was one of the worst companies I have worked for. 

1) No freedom over your time.  Be in at 8am, take one hour lunch during a specified time because you will be answering phone calls all day and you need someone to pick up the phone.  Leave at 5pm.  I guess this is just an hourly thing, however, you were definitely not in charge of your time.  
2) Benefits are very lean.  Little PTO, no sick which is fine but then you need to provide more PTO.  Health plan is very lean and you pay a lot for it.  
3) Work is not creative at all.  You look at the exact same thing day in day out.  Sure you get opportunities to look at other things but the company is run like a factory.
4) CEO states it's great to switch roles and be put into different roles.  Most professionals would laugh and walk if they were told this, but being naive, I ate it up.  You were basically made to be a jack of all trades, but the work again is very monotonous, it wasn't like being able to do some creative work.  

I'm very happy to be where I am.  For those that need a couple years to make some money and pay off student loans, this isn't a bad job, but this shouldn't be your ""career""."
120,Provident Funding,Worst Job I've Ever Had,2013-07-28,1.0,Audit Department,"Probably the only thing that this company has going for it, in terms of employment, is that it's a job.

They have absolutely NO idea about hanging onto good employees and the place is run exactly like a factory.  Come into work at 8 am, work work work until 5 pm, go home and repeat the next day.  Sometimes they expect you to come in on weekends.  I worked in the Audit department and when I was there they told me to do one thing before the audits went out and then another thing when the audits were disputed.  Almost all major audits were disputed and removed so what's the point of even having an audit department?  They expected you to literally do the work of two people and to be happy doing it.  They'd have company-wide conference calls every once in a while and talk the talk about how much they value their employees and unless things have radically changed since I left in 2010, don't believe a word of it.  If you quit, don't even bother asking for any recommendations, they do the bare minimum in terms of verifying your job with your new employer - it's like they're vindictive but in a childish way.  The mid-levels have a huge chip on their shoulder because they're given a little responsibility.  Five holidays per year, you work the day after thanksgiving.  The day before thanksgiving and Christmas Eve, expect to stay until 5 pm, they won't let you out early.  I ended up quitting and going back to school to do something different - completely soured my outlook on working in Finance."

If you aren't in the inner circle, your salary will suck and you will not be happy."
122,Provident Funding,So So,2013-07-06,2.0,"Funder, Underwriter, Trainer","-The company has a good CEO Craig and Lori Pica; they are both very understanding and is willing to listen to suggestions if they ever get to them. Majority of the time however the immediate supervisor will take credit for the work or is unwilling to pass on ideas. 
-decent training program and support for small company","-although the CEOs are great themselves the fact that they are a private company that can not control the simplest aspects of promoting correctly--they should be named as the first negative aspect of this company. 

-promotion is based on whether you are willing to stay over time, but management fail to check whether the overtime was warranted. Many employees do honest work and do not require overtime is punished b/c they are viewed as dedicated. Especially people who are new typically sit on their phones playing with Facebook or twitter, then spend extra time at the end of the day so they can earn overtime. Those are the people that get notice at this company bc they simply stay after.
-lower management is often a year into the job and have no experience dealing with people. They are very power hungry, incompetent, and non-knowledgeable.
-while I was employed here, there were two specific example that just blew my mind. Case 1: an employee was at the branch for about 1 year and he threaten to quit, the head of the department gave him a raise and promoted him to branch manager simply he does an insane amount of overtime. After about 6 months as branch manager the employee left for another company anyways. Case 2: the wholesale  division manager promoted an employee who has been with the company for about 1 year over an experienced underwriter who had trained me I funding and underwriting--after a year this new branch manager was fired for incompetency. These are just two very specific case of mismanagement which causes confusion and chaos in the branch.
-some branches have remote managers so new employees take advantage of this. They arrive late and have someone log onto the system for them so they are shown as being on time. Remote managers are too incompetent to know that they should call a branch meeting each day or once in a while to make sure everyone is on time! 


I was with provident for roughly 4.5 years. I worked as a funder for 2 years, then worked as an underwriter for 1 years then became a trainer for about a year and a half and left for PACCAR mainly bc I was sick of seeing discrimination and lack of values in promotion practices. Currently I manage roughly 6-7 folks. 
My advice for new graduates is that if you are looking for a job in this track then prepare yourself---this is not the best company to work for. Your ""manager"" will likely be fairly incompetent, your training will be decent, your hours will be long, and you will be frustrated."
123,Provident Funding,OK place to start out entry-level in mortgage industry...if you have no other options,2013-06-27,2.0,Mortgage Underwriter,"A good comprehensive introduction to the mortgage industry. Solid training-although it is mindnumbingly boring at the time you are going through it, after about a year you realized how much you learned.  

You can take your training and experience here and become a broker/LO and easily make 2-3X what you were making here.  Mortgage is a difficult industry to get started in from scratch and PF does a good job of getting you started with an incredibly detail-oriented training and comprehensive overview of the industry.  

Also, whether you are a closer or an underwriter, you will get exposure to all parts of the mortgage origination process.  That's because of the limited staffing--no account reps/AE's, no setup/processing staff.  So by the time you've been there a year plus, you have exposure to lots of different scenarios, questions, things going wrong, etc. - after the fact, I've found this broad exposure to be very useful. 

Sometimes I think I've seen more scenarios, questions, etc. than people who have been in the industry 10-20 years due to the tremendous volume that runs through PF's doors and the fact that everyone in the branch kind of collectively takes on the role of the AE.

Another pro is that in terms of mortgage lending, Provident is one of the least shady companies, and I like that. They have integrity in their lending guidelines and programs. They are very good at what they do. It's a good learning environment just to witness that firsthand.","Unfortunately, the working environment leaves a lot to be desired from an employee's perspective.  I understand why they do what they do but it sucks to be the employee at the other end of their policies which all emphasize consistency, efficiency, production at all costs. 

Incredibly strict, rigid environment.  You have to submit a formal PTO request at least 2 weeks in advance even if you just want to leave half an hour early to go to the doctor.  They don't allow any unpaid time off or any schedule modifications (e.g. take a shorter lunch and leave a half hour early for the doctor).  Because of the limited amount of PTO and slow accrual, I ended up budgeting my PTO more rigorously than I budgeted my actual earnings.  It's stressful when one sick day can set you back an entire month in terms of ""saving up"" to take a real vacation.

Branch managers are micro-managers.  That helps the branch as a lot gets done.  But it can be stressful at times.  Employees lack opportunities for flexibility/creativity/critical thinking - you are basically a cog in a factory assembly line, all they care about is getting more ""production"" out of you.

Not only do they send out a daily company-wide report listing all employees and their production percentages from the previous day...depending on the branch, they might also write everyone's names (in the branch) and percentages on a giant whiteboard.  Just in case people weren't paying attention to the PDFs being sent out.  This can be incredibly stressful.

Tasks are very repetitive. Expect to spend all day scrolling through hundreds of pages of PDF documents on one monitor and clicking some checkboxes on the other monitor screen. The only break you get from that is answering ""cases"" and emails from brokers etc., and if you're lucky, after about 6 months they'll start ""letting"" you answer the phone calls.  Which means getting yelled at a majority of the time by angry mortgage brokers and escrow agents and people you have never met.  And it's not uncommon for others in your branch to slack off, be intentionally vague in their conditions and communications to the brokers, and then let you and others take the brunt of it by having to answer the phone calls when these brokers call in confused and frustrated by the lack of clear communication.  Meanwhile you have no knowledge of the file and just have to listen to them talk your ear off until you are able to get them off the phone.

To somebody who said ""what did you expect to do with that finance or accounting degree?"" - definitely not this.  The actual work duties require very little if any brainpower at all.  If I had stayed here longer than 2 years I would have felt I was wasting my brainpower and education on mindless repetitive tasks that can also be incredibly hard on the body due to their repetitiveness.

HR is also a little bit shady...and it definitely doesn't help that the only HR contact is the COO of the company, who is also the CEO's wife.  That means you really don't have anyone to ""talk to"" about any HR issues that come up....and good luck if you decide to report any issues. Expect to be marginalized. They will likely not outright violate your employment rights, but they will do as much as they can get away with on the right side of the law to squeeze as much out of you as an employee and save as much money for the company. 

There is no focus on advancement, career development, personal development, or building any skills except those directly related to the job (underwriting/closing).  When I took the classes to get my LO's license, I had to do so secretly outside of work, because this kind of aspiration for advancing my career would certainly not have been supported by management.

Also, there is a lot of pressure to work overtime and come in on the weekends (except in the rare times when volume is slower).  Expect to be asked every Friday, often in aggressive and manipulative ways, if you can come in this weekend.  They don't outright force it but will ask it in such a way that you basically can't say no."

You accumulate less than 1 day per month until the 2 year mark then you earn a fraction more per month. You don't get most holidays off, you can count on 4 - 6 paid holidays per year depending on if days like Christmas and New years fall on the weekend or weekdays. There's also serious pressure to work overtime during the busy times (which is the majority of the time considering the company is wildly understaffed). You are bothered all day long by brokers, title agents, managers and fellow co workers telling you you're doing things wrong. There's pressure to have perfect work and not get audits so staff will turn on eachother and try to pass the blame to whoever they can to avoid an audit exception in their employee file. 

This company is also obsessed with reports. Every task you complete has a point value assigned to it. Every day production reports are emailed out to every employee. These reports list every single person by name and shows exactly what they did the day before and if they hit their 100 points or not. They even go as far as to put little red and blue lines in the report to highlight who didn't hit their points that day. Then every monday, we get a weekly production summary. Month end, we get a monthly summary etc etc. These reports don't take into account days you were training, or assigned to a non point producing task such as calling on pipeline to get conditions in. The reports also don't account for holidays or PTO days. So you can hit over 100% every day you are at work and still have a below average production rating if you dared to take a day off of work. They also send out audit reports listing everyone's name and any mistake they've made. 

There is no work life balance. When interviewing, if you talk about your aspirations to pursue an MBA or other degree program, you probably won't be hired. They want workers straight out of college with no families who are need to pay student loans and gain work experience. They do not value their employees at all."
132,Provident Funding,MC,2012-11-29,3.0,Mortgage Consultant,"It's a relatively young company composed of new and recent graduates, they are easy to talk to since you will be within their age group.
The people there are nice unless it's your manager. Those are different groups of animals.
There are bright people within the company who can do well. 
For goal oriented people this place offer a little nice reward if you get to a MC position.","You need to know what you are getting your self into. Career growth is almost none if you are not a type A person who would constantly market yourself and get your manager to notice you. 

There is no middle management. Once you get to know the management you notice their last names are awfully familiar. 

Respect is secondary.

The work is repetitive and machine like.

Benefits are rudimentary, you get basic health package and no contribution to retirement/401k."

They don't expect you to know everything when you arrive and will fly you to Pittsburgh or San Fran for training.  
Decent starting pay for recent college grads.  
They provide a solid base of knowledge and experience for eventually moving up in the mortgage industry.","The benefits are somewhat of a joke.  No sick days, no 401k matching... the health plans could be better.  
Ridiculous rules... basically no flexibility in scheduling.  Have a doctors appointment? Arrive 15 minutes late? You get to take time from one of your 12 yearly days off.  
Holidays are minimal compared to the rest of the financial services industry (no MLK day, no Presidents day, no black Friday). 
Given Provident's limited range of financial products, once you're trained, opportunities to learn new skills/ move up are limited.  
The upper management structure is essentially based on nepotism.  The whole company is owned/managed by one family and their friends/cronies."

-Fellow employees are friendly and easy to get along with
-Good pay and great increases 
-Upper management is easily accessible and willing to listen to ideas
-Promotions are earned and not given for tenure


Employees need to understand the basis of the company and be on board with the overall goal.  Provident creates a very concrete product and expects its employees to do this efficiently.  If you are not found of working hard and actually earning what you make, I suggest you steer clear.  Great company to work for with solid ideals and morals in a less than par industry.  Helps to build great communication and multitasking skills as well as a solid work ethic.

For the reviewers who stated the job consists of looking at a computer screen for 8+ hours, I ask, what did you expect to do with that finance or accounting degree?",-Structure for advancement could be clearer

They promoted me because I top the chart in exceeding the 90+ call requirement and administrative tasks the first week on my job. Good indication that if you work hard, you will get promoted!

2. Stayed at my 2nd position for another 8 months (make a huge sum of money in commission) and top the chart again.  I came up with some ideads and proposed a new business plan to help the company grow. The manager and the executives loved it and promoted me to lead a brand new department. They spport talent!

3. Very good salary for me so far, average at 25% annual increase. I'm not even 25, making about 80k/yr gross.","1. Some management issues as some managers are a little out of touch with the employees

2. Some offices don't have good infrastructure (but they are spending more money in improving them, so I guess it's getting better.)

3. Production employees, underwriters, closers, loan processors etc., are definitely overworked! They are also piling up cash from overtime though."

138,Provident Funding,"No communication from Management, dishonest business practices",2012-08-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Unlikely that the Company will go under so employment outlook is fairly stable compared to the rest of the lending industry.,"The workloads are not evenly distributed.  It is common to see some employees running out the door at 5:00pm everyday while others are frequently working into the night and on weekends.  Management disavows all knowledge of problems being reported to them.  Employees ask for additional help or training repeatedly, their requests go unanswered and then Management likes to issue write ups when the problems come to light later in the form of bad press, lawsuits or scrutiny from regulatory oversight.  They act as if is were the very first time they have been made aware despite a mile long chain of emails proving they were informed months prior, the Employee is usually blamed despite asking for help or attempting to have issues corrected.  During annual audits they cherry pick the information they choose to give to the Auditors.  If something is perceived to negatively affect their statistics they simply omit the information altogether.  They are now offing their services to private label clients but have greatly overstated their ability to service loans outside their niche of conventional loan products.  Employees have no experience dealing with many of the loan programs/types that Management is representing themselves to be ""Experts"" of.  Employees that choose to give 2 weeks notice are often dismissed on the spot despite no past performance issues. Employees that leave are often later painted as being ungrateful or under achievers though they never had any performance issues while employed. The tone of emails from Management are often very hostile and threatening.  Advancement is unlikely unless you are related to the Owners. Female employees have it even worse as there are extremely few women in any position of authority.  The low number of paid holidays, poor raises, unreasonable workload and scant benefits package all further demonstrate that they view their employees as expendable rather than the Men and Woman who are making their lifestyle and success possible."

142,Provident Funding,Only Work at Corporate!,2012-03-23,4.0,,"I started as a college grad like people in all the reviews, but I was luck to work in corporate instead of being in a branch or servicing department.  Pros about the company is don't need to worry about company going down.  I was paid very well (average 20% paid raise every year.) Don't need to work a lot of OT, don't need to travel.  You will move up fast if you have a special analytical skill or know when to say what.",Normal channel will not get people to move up the corporate ladder.  Only 3% of the emplooyee working in a branch or servicing department get promoted.  Need to ask for annual review else no pay raise.  Bad employee benefits.
143,Provident Funding,BEWARE -- Working at McDonalds may provide more satisfaction than here.,2012-03-08,1.0,Mortgage Underwriter and Closer,This job is one that pays -- if you have student loans and are absolutely desperate...although I highly caution you to look else ware beforehand.,"Provident Funding Associates L.P. is split into two large divisions: Retail and Wholesale.

Retail Department consists of Servicing, Correspondent Lending, Secondary Market, Customer Retention whereas Wholesale Department is solely Underwriting and Funding for 3rd Party Brokers.

If you come from a Top 25 University I strongly urge you to look elsewhere...you may be fooled by the job description initially (ie. Mortgage Consultant, Servicing Analyst, Servicing Specialist, IT Analyst, or any other buzzwords).  Here's the scoop -- if you work in the Retail department...you start off as a Customer Support Specialist.  Imagine being heavily micromanaged and taking over 90+ calls in one day to be considered ""on par.""  If you work for Wholesale department...you will be crosstrained as an Underwriter and Funder (eventually) and expect to take 50+ calls while working from brokers who demand to have their loans processed.

Company morale is at an all time low, the average age group is 21-30.  The reason being is that the compensation and benefits are laughable at best.  The people who stay are usually unmotivated and have nowhere else to go.

Management is ridiculous -- I highly doubt they even train their employees on management.  Imagine a kid watching Boiler Room or any other typical Wall Street movie -- now s/he is your boss!

Compensation is as follows:

$20.19/hour (was much lower when I started), $41,995.00 Annual first year (provided that you work the standard 40 hours)
4 Paid Holidays per year -- expect to work Christmas Eve folks!
12 PTO (Paid Time Off -- consider this your vacation/sick days) -- accrued 8 hours per month.


Enjoy and good luck!  Don't say I didn't warn you."

146,Provident Funding,A job with no personal development or satisfaction,2012-01-23,1.0,Servicing Representative,"Really easy to get hired
It's a job that pays money
Not expected to work overtime, you work exactly what you are paid for","Training:
Although the web site promises extensive training, in reality the training lasts only a week. Of that week only a day is spent on the actual phone. This is a very insufficient amount of training especially since the customers are mostly dissatisfied and call up with complicated questions that were not part of the training. This is a huge problem for the company, because customers that call in are usually in a lot of trouble with their mortgage and don't have the patience to hold while a new rep is talking to a supervisor over an online chat to get the answers.

Office:
A gray building where I was given a broken chair, a 50 year old metal desk and a cracked computer screen. There are no office perks, the company provides the bare minimum for the employees. 

Management:
Unfriendly from day one. No introductions or first day lunches, you are put in your seat and expected to start working from the minute you walk in.

Work:
Very depressing line of work as mainly dealing with people who are on the verge of losing their house and are seeking helpful answers that Provident doesn't provide. Expected to be exactly on time, get in trouble for being a minute late. Constantly pressured to rush through phone calls and not give customers complete help.

Overall this is not a career, it's just a job that pays money. There is no personal development or satisfaction or career. You are just a barrier between the angry customer and the management."

No room for company advancement into senior management unless you are a personal or previous friend with the CEO, his wife (COO), or her daughter (Manager of Retail department), or her college friend (Manager of Customer Service department)
No incentives or bonuses other than a holiday bonus so no reason to work harder if you are in the servicing division. 
You pay for all aspects of your health insurance and earn little benefits such as PTO.
Very few paid holidays off and even those are only Federal laws, would not give those if they did not have to.
No loyalty to employees, every person outside of senior management is expendable and treated as such."
