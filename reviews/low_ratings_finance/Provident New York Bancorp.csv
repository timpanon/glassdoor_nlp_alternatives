2,Provident New York Bancorp,Be cautious,2013-08-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Expanding footprint; Pending merger appears to complement both bank's businesses.,"Unfair treatment, employees motivated by fear and not by a positive environment.  Upper management tries to improve morale by having pizza and ice cream days but everyone knows it is a smokescreen and more of a token than real effort to make things better."

5,Provident New York Bancorp,Awesome Place To Work,2012-08-12,5.0,Manager,Provident has been transforming itself in the past year or so to take a more agressive stance towards sales and customer service.  Teamwork is encouraged and everyone is friendly.  Results are coming thorugh and the Street is recognizing this by being able to raise capital easily as well as getting positive ratings from analysts.  I believe we are in more bigger and better things from the bank.  Customer products and services are top notch and the bank which inlcudes management is very customer centric.,Could look into expanding ATM network by joining an ATM network like Allpoint.
