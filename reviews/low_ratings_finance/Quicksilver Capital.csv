0,Quicksilver Capital,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,2021-06-04,1.0,Underwriter,Just something to add to resume,Where to begin. Most toxic enviroment ive ever worked in where everyone is looking to throw dirt on someone else. The manager has his whole family working there so if you dont suck up to him the entire office treats you horribly. They exist to do nothing but rip off merchants and take their money from them while exploiting college grads for free labor. Salaries horrible. Time off horrible. Enviroment horrible. HR will never pay attention to your concerns. The CEO sees you as a pawn. Dont work here if you have morals.
1,Quicksilver Capital,I miss working here!,2020-12-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- There's an opportunity to make a lot of money working here! they made a lot of improvements to technology, systems and staff that made everyone's lives easier. There was a sick game room & frequent company lunches. People are generally happy working here & there's definitely a family vibe",- there was a heavy workload but given the industry type its actually a good thing
2,Quicksilver Capital,Poor management skills and worst environment to work in,2019-09-10,1.0,Senior Underwriter,"This place is just a stepping stone, something to add to a resume.","Everyone is literally miserable but stick through it because they are young, fresh out of college and have student debt they need to pay off. The conversations I been apart of shows no one is looking to grow within the company. Benefits are practically non-existent, and the hours they make you work are unreasonable. Work load is intense because they are too cheap to hire qualified people OR too lazy to properly train."
3,Quicksilver Capital,worst job ever,2019-06-24,1.0,Associate Underwriter,weekly lunches and thirsty thursdays,"revolving door, underpaid, conmen business, over worked"
4,Quicksilver Capital,Don't work here,2018-12-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There is nothing positive to say,"The problem with this company is there is no HR department, real benefits, but most importantly no boundaries. There is a high turn over rate at this place and that alone is a red flag. For the only 2 positive reviews, they are from the company who 1. believe that PC incorrectness is appropriate on the company floor, and 2. they are looking for employees desperately. This place is completely unprofessional and either need to start listening to the moans and groan of their employees, clean house or shut down."

6,Quicksilver Capital,Underwriter,2018-11-14,1.0,Underwriter,....still thinking of a few,Everything. Don’t work here unless you’re desperate for a job !
