One is there is NO management at all. There are managers but they don't manage. The Melville branch is basically run by outside loan officers. They are very argumentative. So they call you screaming what they want done and they want it done now. You go to your manager and they tell you to do what the LO says whether it's right or wrong, legal or illegal. There are no procedures everyone does everything different. Basic things that should have a set answer you will get 4 completely different answers. There is also a lot of favoritism. There is about 20 of them that keep joint from place to place together and if your not in that click you are treated unfairly. You could come in 5 minutes late and get in trouble but there's one girl in the ""click"" who gets phone calls to wake her around 10:30. They give you unrealistic goals. Then they tell you that you can't get paid for overtime but you have to stay and work! It's a basic free for all. Worst place I ever worked.

We have been cutting back the amount of people working at our branch but the same amount of customers still come in which causes more hassle for the employees and the waiting customers. 

(Senior) Management encourages employees to speak up about issues but there is never a resolution to those issues, which gives the illusion that they care. Everything is based around making the customer happy while it seems completely irrelevant to make the employees happy as well. 

The career opportunities are a joke -- You can't rise to any position, no matter how qualified you are for that position, if it is more than 2 pay grades above what you make, but CFG is happier with hiring people from outside the company, training them on policies and procedures, and having them take the position instead? That seems pretty backwards to me.

Hours can be long and very manipulative if you don't speak up. Plan on selling selling selling if you want to work here -- Goals go up consistently and the amount of products you can sell and get credit for keep going down. Also, plan on a manipulative run-around when you are promised you will get something (i.e. a team bonus) and when you do, it doesn't happen."
