2,RSI Bank,A Company that is Behind the Times,2019-09-08,2.0,Marketing Assistant,Many of the people are nice and I enjoyed an outing with co-workers to a painting class once.,"Low starting salary for someone with a MA
Weird office rules - like you can't eat at your desk, and you HAVE to take your 2 weeks vacation together - thus not allowing for people who have more than one trip a year.
Very old-fashioned attitudes and very suspicious corporate culture. They do background checks before hire but still seem to be watching to make sure you do not steal.
Very boring environment, minimal holiday celebrations, most people are not very sociable."
