0,Recovco Mortgage Management,"No work, no pay",2022-03-20,1.0,Compliance Analyst,No micromanaging and fully remote with decent benefits.,"No work, no pay. No proper training and inconsistent, outdated procedures. Why they continue to hire while there arenâ€™t any projects is beyond me. During the interview process, upper management had confirmed that there should be consistent work available. At this point, we have gone several weeks without work - a majority of us have clocked in ~8-15 hours in the span of a week. This is not a sustainable job."

7,Recovco Mortgage Management,Confusing,2018-08-15,1.0,,Nothing at this point. Haven't worked yet to find out if there's anything positive.,How do you hire someone then tell them there's no work and give no reason why?

You will be hired full time, but at misrepresentation- do not quit a job to work at sprout or recovco nor give up unemployment benefits to work here- you are better off on unemployment. W2 worker- with no PTO, benefits- do not believe any of the employers comments- they are false misrepresentations made by the recruiter. Believe the NEGATIVE reviews only - as they are from true employees anything else is made by the corporate recruiter. The fact that they say No Sprout underwriters are employed inNYS is FALSE- they work in East Meadow Long Island.  Former owner of AMERICAN HOME MORTGAGE."
12,Recovco Mortgage Management,Loan Processor,2017-11-06,3.0,,You work in the Texas office while your manager works in the Florida office. No one is over you monitoring your every move,There is no relationship between employee manager or human resources. You are all alone in the office.

When I hired on last year I had an employment letter outlining my pay rate. Got furloughed for a few weeks and got called back to the same position. However, two weeks in they reduced by pay rate significantly with no discussion.   Really don't think they can legally do this but that doesn't seem to bother them.

You have to know your stuff and adapt quickly.  This is not a place for underwriter ""show ponies"" that like to be stroked because they can nit pick, gossip, and take 10 cigarette and coffee breaks a day.  You have to work all day every day.","Project based if no project then no work.

30,Recovco Mortgage Management,Good Luck !!,2015-12-24,1.0,,"I have been an Underwriter/ Forensic Underwriter/ Due Diligence and in the mortgage business since 2002 and am currently Still in the Mtg Business- Conventional, FHA-VA-A paper - Jumbo- Streamline- Wholesale - Correspondence-therefore pre screening was done. this is not Front end underwriting. Front-end Underwriting is Origination not buy backs disputes.","We received 4 days of training, which was a conference call. Then when asked, how often an ""A"" rating or 45.00 per file is paid out, we were informed- Random far and few between. This is not Front end Underwriting, the assignment is ""rebuttals"" on old sub prime loans. Prepare for a lot of duplicate entering, copy pasting and reviewing old loans that are deemed put back or buy backs from the banks. Although it is challenging and a great supplement income, I would not base a career on this assignment. A file can be dinged 10.00 for minor typos- which is disclosed - after hiring. Good for getting your extra cash, not for the long term."
31,Recovco Mortgage Management,Not even if you are desperate.,2015-12-20,1.0,Underwriter,"My manager was amazing and patient. Trained well, defended us and was very macro-management. He made our lives easier by creating spreadsheets that did the basics for us.","The company itself is a sham. I'd rather leave them off my resume and just claim I was unemployed. They lied to the Colorado unemployment office and told them they never paid me. Fortunately, I provided a pay stub but that doesn't help me now, maybe in 90 days when they complete their investigation. No benefits. No paid time off. Recruiter has the used car salesman feel. I honestly don't know how they sleep at night. Sleezy."
