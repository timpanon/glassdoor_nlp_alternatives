0,Regal Financial Group,High Anxiety Work Environment,2021-11-26,1.0,Recptionist/Administrative Assistant,The Kentwood building is nice,"Upper management sets the anxious atmosphere, never know if he will come in happy about something and will be good day, or come in with a foul mood and cussing. Rapid Fire demands with little instructions, outcome must be perfect, no excuses. Made for a revolving door of support staff."
1,Regal Financial Group,Awesome Experience Developing Background for a Future Career in Finance,2021-01-04,5.0,Intern,The support throughout the company is incredible. Regal embodies hard work that produces quality and efficiency every day. I learned what it takes to be a successful employee and teammate to coworkers in the future.,"It is tough! Not that it is a bad thing, but it forces you to become a good worker and dedicated to your work. Although it can be busy and frustrating, you are rewarded and treated appropriately in the long run."
2,Regal Financial Group,Growing company with lots of opportunity,2020-10-08,4.0,Operations,The company is growing tremendously and learning from past mistakes. Great culture and good team to work with. Very understanding of each person that works there.,Sometimes there are so many things going on it's hard to prioritize but that is whey the management team is there to help.
3,Regal Financial Group,DO NOT WORK HERE,2020-06-25,1.0,Executive Assistant,"Good benefits, competitive salary. Great place to waste your time at.","Everything. There's no professionalism as everything is based on how much you brown nose your superior . Management talks to you like you are worthless, doesn't care for your opinion, and instructions are unclear. They're funneling their own money in their company and lying about it. Everyone I've talked to (in my time working there and outside of it) hates their boss, regardless of who it is. It's a place to work at when you've given up on your life and happiness."
4,Regal Financial Group,Toxic,2019-02-23,2.0,Customer Service,"Management wants to do well in the business and wants to believe in their employees. Lunch is occasionally provided. Great values and when they want to have fun, they know how to do it.",Toxic work environment. No real HR. Upper management micro-manages to the point of hostility. I worried for one employee in particular that he would run himself into an early grave because he was so stressed out. He was pulling his hair out. This place was honestly nuts. Some people had 5 different jobs because they kept letting people go.
5,Regal Financial Group,Run.,2018-02-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,It's better than being homeless.,"Leadership micromanages, hostile work environment, horrible communication, unclear direction and expectations, inappropriate workplace conversations."
6,Regal Financial Group,OK place to work,2017-12-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Loved my coworkers and some of the management. The company has potential.,"Low pay, definitely not competitive. They make positions sound easy and entry level, then not pay much. I left for much higher pay at another company.

There is one individual in upper management that causes an extreme amount of anxiety in the office. Employee turnover is extremely high for this. An article from Business Insider, ""25 signs you have a terrible boss"" sums this individual up precisely. He definitely leads by fear.

Believe me when I say you will fantasize about quitting. If there was a shakeup in upper management, more specific to one individual, this place would be a wonderful place to work!"
7,Regal Financial Group,Director of First Impressions,2017-06-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I don't know why there are such negative reviews on here...some people must have been butthurt lol. I only chose to leave Regal because I wanted to get out of the GR area. The expectations here are high, but you are rewarded for your efforts.",The only downside is that the HQ is in Kentwood instead of somewhere without winter
8,Regal Financial Group,Passion for the Employee Experience,2017-06-04,5.0,Anonymous Intern,"Regal is an amazing work place. The owners are passionate about creating an environment in which employees can thrive and learn. The salary is incredibly competitive, and the coworkers are supportive. It is a performance  based culture and you are given tools to assist in your success. I am very thankful for my time spent here.",I do not have any negatives about this company
9,Regal Financial Group,Don't Do It,2017-03-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The other staff members were young, but all wanted to leave so no one felt motivated.","Low pay, benefits are offered but aren't great, management speaks to employees in a condescending manner, bonuses are constantly brought up as a perk but are never available to achieve, work life balance is extremely low. Management has no problem calling/emailing late, well beyond working hours, and expect an immediate response."
