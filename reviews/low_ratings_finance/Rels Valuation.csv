0,Rels Valuation,"Fast Paced, High Turnover Rate",2018-02-13,3.0,Vendor Relations,Gain entry level experience in customer service,"Lack of job security, some managers treat you like you're expendable."
1,Rels Valuation,Pretty awful place to work,2017-07-30,1.0,Appraisal Processor,"Easy commute, having a hard time of thinking of anything else","Disrespectful, pay very low, meaningful advancement not easy"
2,Rels Valuation,Follow up,2016-09-03,2.0,,Decent place if you're looking to a dead end job.  And hate moving.,Atmosphere will make you wanna commit suicide. Managers view you as another body on the battlefield that will and can be easily replaced. You may not have an outside life.  You will be fired with no warnings everyone there is all hush hush we will stab you in the back when you're not expecting it.
3,Rels Valuation,Average,2016-04-14,4.0,,Nice work hours and shift. Laid back environment. Easy work.,People who have worked here for 5 years+ are really comfortable and don't try as much as the temps who are on and off here.
4,Rels Valuation,Customer Care,2016-01-25,4.0,Customer Care Representative,Great company with advancement internally.,"Hire a lot of temps with high rotation. But like I said, you do the job well or excel you are able to get promoted or hired permanently."
5,Rels Valuation,"Run, don't walk",2016-01-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great co-workers, convenient location, decent benefits","Pay, management, ethics, employee and vendor treatment, and seeming gender and racial bias regarding anyone at the management level. Staff appraisers are not given the support they need (continuing education, career development, etc)"
6,Rels Valuation,Good place to get stuck in a rut. I'd take a different road.,2016-01-14,1.0,Utility Appraiser,"Good health insurance. You always make at least $2,000 a month.","1/2 price appraisals and unrealistic production quotas. You pay most of the expenses, do all the work, and they make as much as you. No raises. No vacations."
7,Rels Valuation,Okay but not great,2016-01-12,3.0,Vendor Relations Representative,Fun work environment and had a good manager. Ability for overtime was nice too.,Lack of leadership or growth as an employee
8,Rels Valuation,Field Appraiser,2016-01-11,1.0,Field Appraiser,"Some company paid benefits, steady stream of work (albeit, at extremely low pay), get to work out of house.","Incessant micro managing, very low pay, you cannot choose which appraisals you want to accept unlike other slave-shop AMCs, constant repetitive training, management isn't the smartest (probably manage based on who they know rather than what they know), no bonus system, no chance of advancement (you probably have a better chance winning the Powerball Lottery), no paid vacation, no company aid to maintain license, work every day to maintain quota.  NOT A GOOD PLACE TO WORK."
9,Rels Valuation,Last Resort,2016-01-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,You will love your co-workers and the appraisers you interact with as well as immediate management.,Don't expect to make much per hour or receive competitive benefits or raises.
10,Rels Valuation,Staff Appraiser,2015-11-30,2.0,Staff Appraiser,Steady stream of work - consistent,No chance for advancement and you have to get used to being treated like an outsider
11,Rels Valuation,Same ole appraisal industry stuff,2015-11-02,2.0,Anonymous Employee,The only real Pro's are the benefits,Commission fee split and revenue requirements
12,Rels Valuation,Good group to work with,2015-10-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The people are nice to work with,Smaller company so big projects can be tough to get off the ground.
13,Rels Valuation,The Worst Job in my Many Years,2015-08-19,1.0,Staff Appraiser,Paycheck was deposited on time.,"Horible leadership from top down to regional managers.  If you are an appraiser, I strongly advise changing your career before wasting valuable time with this company."
14,Rels Valuation,Ok,2015-06-24,3.0,,Smart people at the company,Too much corporate red tape
15,Rels Valuation,I'd rather dig ditches - similar wages but at least I would be in good shape.,2015-04-07,1.0,Staff Appraisr,"Pros: standard healthcare any company would give you.
Rels pays for one MLS, Realquest, $60 internet, $75 phone.  Yippeee! (note the sarcasm).  See below what they wont pay for - the things you really need, desire and deserve for doing appraisals for 40 cents on the dollar.","1. CEO ( Dan Hackman ) is so disrespected by the employees (and he knows it) that you rarely hear from him.
2. Appraisers must waste time engaging in training webinars from people who should be the trainees, not the trainers.
3. Extremely low pay: Appraisers earn $10 per hour on first $2,700 billing or approx. your first five appraisals for the pay period. Can you say exploitation? Worst in the industry that I've heard of .  After that, you you earn 40% of the appraisal fee or about $180 per full.  At the end of the month, you'll make $4 to $5K.  Super depressing!
4. Appraiser must pay for his own licensing, continuing education, most office supplies, new tools, additional MLSs, etc. Rels always takes the cheap way out and says ""no, that doesn't qualify for a reimbursable expense.""
5.  Managers are constantly giving you the classic straw man argument (""We need to keep wells fargo happy or they may use other AMC's).  Whaaa!  That may suck for the Rels brass who have no other skills but to leech, but appraisers have other options to get that work - quit and work independent or for the competition.
6. Rels pays the appraiser a minuscule 40% of the appraisal fee, but will not pay for an appraisr to take an two-week expense paid vacation. Everyone else gets a paid vacation but not the employees with the license and expertise that earns the company its only revenue.
7. Rels Valuation expects appraisers to do full 1004 appraisals as low as $135 (PMI removals and equity loans).  Can you say exploitation, again?
8.  Incessant micro-managing from supervisor.  Yes, constant meetings and hearing ""We need a appraisals delivered on time to our client (Wells Fargo, one of the Rels Valuation fractional owners).  Yes, the client is the owner.  LOL!  Conflict of interest? You betcha!   
9. The say they want quality but at the end of the day, they really want you to meet their short turn-times.  Again - scared out of their mind Wells Fargo will lose business to backup AMCs.  
10.  No holiday celebrations
11. Rels Valuation never splurges a little on employees, company never has production contests or performance bonuses.
12.  Rels sets monthly production requirements to a level that assures you that you won't be spending time doing anything fun.  Nope, you'll be working while Dan Hackman plays golf on your backs."
16,Rels Valuation,Good place to work.,2015-03-24,4.0,Anonymous Employee,I enjoyed the people that I worked with at Rels.  The family health insurance was very good in my opinion for Full Time Employees.,"The mortgage industry fluctuates so much and that drastically changes the production of this company.  They'll hire more and more people,  only to lay off hundreds of people at a time because the business is slow."
17,Rels Valuation,Work Life Balance,2015-01-02,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Benefits are good consistent work flow.,"Their expectations can be excessive.  Time off policy non existent you are allowed a total of 5 days a year with no consideration for holidays, professional development, etc."
18,Rels Valuation,Staff Appraiser hired by RELS,2014-08-28,2.0,Staff Appraiser,"Not Much.  Able to work out of my home office and make my own hours.  Decent benefits, and reimbursment for mileage","Worked for Rels for about 18 months and was recenlty ""let go"" due to working for outside appraisal companies on my own time and equipment.  Why, because the pay here is horrible and I needed to supplement my income somehow.  They take a fixed amount out of  billings every two weeks amounting to $5600 off the top, then they pay you 40% of whats left over. Plus a bare minimum hourly wage.  I have had busy weeks and my 2 week Net was not even half of my billings.  Someone is racking it in, and it is not the appraiser. They only care about on time reports, not quality reports.  They have a team of reviewers and managers that micro manage everything, and  try to ""persuade"" you.  Reported someone on apprasiser independence, 1 month later I am gone.  No warnings, no discussions, no exit interview, very unprofessional atmosphere.  Manager never returned calls or emails for imprortant issues.   No vaction, no sick time, no holiday pay.  Not allowed to decline reports.  Basically a slave to the company 24/7."
19,Rels Valuation,Not cohesive company,2014-08-17,2.0,,"Co-workers and colleagues were nice and friendly. But most people are not there long term, just a stopping ground until something better comes along.",The different divisions are very divided and did not work together. Most managers are professionals but a small few are very immature and treated employees poorly with no respect.
20,Rels Valuation,American greed is alive! Top managers are smiling and real estate appraisers have been pushed to the limit.,2014-08-13,1.0,Staff Appraiser,"Overall good benefits: health, vision & dental plan, 401k, paid expenses for travel, software, office supplies, and hardware. Corporate discounts. There is not much to list here....","Rels Valuation  does not care about the very people (appraisers) that carry the company. Appraisers are not treated as professionals and are micro managed. The pay does not reflect the high level of liability an appraisers takes on with each report. No PTO, no sick leave, no genuine concern for appraisers. Plan to work 24/7. Rels does not appear to be truthful about how much the borrower pays for the appraisal report. Homestead in 2014."
21,Rels Valuation,"Low pay, low morale, micro managed",2014-06-11,1.0,Staff Appraiser,"health insurance, nice immediate manager","Pay is half of what it was at this company 10 years ago for the same amount of work. $10 hourly plus 40% of billing after they take out a huge cut off the top first. Billed every two weeks so it's difficult to take even a day off if you are sick or if its a holiday much less a week off or you can't bill your minimum and are working for $10 an hour. No paid vacation, sick leave,  or holidays"
22,Rels Valuation,Good People to work with,2014-05-08,3.0,Vendor Relations Representative,Liked the work and communication with appraisers and how collaborative and friendly my co-workers were,"Didn't seem like a place to advance a career, managers were being let go along with other co-workers"
23,Rels Valuation,"Was once a great place to work, then they stiffed the appraisers big time",2014-03-26,1.0,Staff Appraiser,"Computer, printer, camera and software were provided","Worthless management from top to bottom. Staff appraisers used to earn a decent fee split, then they pulled the rug out and turned them into minimum wagers in 2011. Appraisers don't know what they will be paid on any file until each two week pay period is over. If you're considering Rels as an appraiser, remember, any time off affects your bottom line, so plan on working 365 days per year."
24,Rels Valuation,Low pay long hours,2014-03-17,1.0,Staff Appraiser,No pros. Not a healthy company.,They do not pay for any continuing education. Short turn times. Low pay. Long hours. No help from supervisors.
25,Rels Valuation,Negative work environment,2014-03-16,1.0,,There are some good people who work here but they are few and far between.,Do not value their employees and any type of a work/life balance
26,Rels Valuation,Great place to work,2014-02-20,5.0,Customer Care Representative,Help borrowers and learn about the home buying process,Industry slow down causing uncertainty
27,Rels Valuation,Employee retention via Stockholm Syndrome,2014-02-19,1.0,Customer Care Representative,"You can decently pad a resume if you are able to stick around long enough.  That, unfortunately, is unlikely for many as there is a very strong culture of ""Operations is expendable.""","Extremely toxic operations management culture, low pay, industry problems due to mortgage volatility.  Due to high volume of revolving door temps, many staff members stay because of the ""at least I have a job"" attitude."
28,Rels Valuation,No respect for their staff appraiser.,2014-02-08,1.0,Staff Appraiser,Medical and dental is about all that is good about this company.,Must meet quota or you'll work for just over a minimum wage.  No a good way to keep employees in my opinion.  Outside appraiser have negative views of RELS.
29,Rels Valuation,Field Appraiser,2013-11-22,3.0,Field Appraiser,"Good health insurance, steady work","Low pay, long hours, dated equipment"
