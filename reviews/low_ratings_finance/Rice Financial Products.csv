0,Rice Financial Products,Corporate Slavery,2021-03-29,1.0,Administrative,Some of your colleagues will be nice. Christmas parties sometimes if you like that type of thing.,"I’ve experienced racism here. Shocking, for a company that claims diversity and is run by a POC. They will run you to the ground and pay you next to nothing. Management has a power complex and loves to micromanage. Don’t make mistakes or they’ll belittle and bully you. No HR to file complaints. They’re incredibly cheap, so don’t expect raises or bonuses. If they promise you either, they’re lying. Do your mental health and finances a favor and do NOT EVER work here."

Great location.  Lots of travel and client interface, so allows for deeper understanding of client needs.","Lots of travel, great for clients, but is a bit disruptive to personal life.  Pretty narrow focus in terms of product and industry vertical, limits ability to innovate and create the runway to explore missing markets."
