25,Royal Business Bank,Stay away unless you're very desperate and need a job,2021-07-17,1.0,Loan Operations,"- Management takes you to lunch once in a while
- You learn to grow a thick skin from the toxic culture
- You'll motivate yourself to learn a new skill(outside the job/classes) to get out
- Couple cool people around the floor","I'm going to be real. You can take it any way you want but this was just purely my experience from my many years here.

Career Aspect-

The technical skills you learn here will almost be non-transferable and unrecognized by most American financial institution(Bank of America, JPM, GS). Once you're accumulated and assimilated career wise, your only real limited option to move will be Bank of Hope, Pacific Bay, Hanmi Bank, Asian Pacific. Don't believe me? If you have a new experienced employee joining, look at his/her resume and tell me they didn't work at any of the asian banks in Los Angeles in the past. If your coworker's leaving, ask them where they're leaving and I'll guarantee you there's a good chance it'll be one of those. If you really want to leave and go to an American culture/company, you'll either need a really good referral from a friend, get certifications, or take classes. Experience from here will not be enough for you to get out.

Pay-

It's terrible. If you're not at least a manager level, expect to be about 20-30% below market value. Overtime is looked very down on. If you ask for some, you will be criticized and management will question your work productivity as they are not sure why you couldn’t complete the tasks in a 9-6 window.

Culture-

If you're not Asian, you'll mostly feel like you're left out on inside jokes, achievements, and just the team in general. Don't expect any respect if you're a new grad as in the asian working culture, you're literally viewed as the bottom of the bottom and they will treat you as such. Tons of gossiping from upper level to low-level employees and once you're in their cross hair, they'll make your life a living hell.

Growth-

You see, you've probably heard ""keep working hard and we'll give you chance to see what you got and there will be lot of opportunity opening up to move from position A to position B"" Overall it's good advice but it's bs because let me tell you how this will go down. First, the person in position B HAS TO LIKE YOU, to actually want to teach you. Second, in order for you to go to position A to position B, you'll need to learn the daily functions of position B. But what they don't tell you is that they want you to keep up your work in position A while also doing parts of position B's work. But here's the catch. Position A and the work the position B person gives you will BE VERY TIME CONSUMING. Often times, you’re very consumed with position A’s work that you won’t retain anything from position B or be able to keep up. Also, depending on the person, they’ll criticize you for mistake and tell it to upper management that can make them change their mind to keeping you doing just position A work.

Toxic Upper Management-

When you’re together in meetings, they talk about team work and how we should help each other. But once in a full moon, one of them will call you into their office for what I’ll call “motivational speech” to kind of check up on how you’re doing. During this “motivational speech” you’ll get a mixed message of how you’ll need to outwork and be selfish around everybody to succeed, other people’s opinion of you(wtf?), and a brief history of how that person made it to the top after working 20 years…"

almost everything need CEO approval, which decrease the efficiency. 
During covid, they provided 1 bottle sanitizer near each door & few masks. to save money, they have employees to do the kitchen cleaning rather than pay outside professional to do that. 
HD monitoring camaras everywhere, managers have access to watch that, we believe its not for security only. and if you wanna go restroom? only 1 key for a door, otherwire we need to walk all the way to the front door to get in. 
For covid, they have us go back to office when all other still work from home, untill 2 of us tested positive or maybe some of us reported them to the health dept, then they have us routine every 2 weeks. how do they monitoring you when wfh? some departments need to do the half-hour working log, need them to write detail what they do every half hour. 
Now its not safe to go out, but the top-management asked some managers to fly to NY. is there anything that have to talk in face? 
Now, from LA to NY, people keep leaving, even experienced manager or EVP. 

for top management: dunt waste time to figure out who wrote the true here, use your value time to think about your employees who making money for you but not think about making money from your employees! hire some experiened manager."

Let's first point out the CEO and top managements are imbecilles. Their main objective is to grow the bank by acquiring more banks. To achieve that, they pay all the employees way beneath market value. As a result, you will never get the salary you deserve. Secondly, they make you believe you can transition to other positions within the bank if your not satisfied with what you do is BS. The department I worked for had an increase in workload due to staff leaving. Branches are total idiots by sending increase in work for us. I wouldn't advise anyone to stay."

Do not pay of overtime but expect you to continue work. The company have bad management who do not know how to manage. Will fire you for little mistakes and they will judge you. Managers try to take over different department with no experience. Its a mess right now. I dont know how they will fix. They hire consultant, never work in bank. Consultant hire her tenant to work in bank no experience. Maybe scare wont pay rent. Everyone leave bank. CEO no lun good, hire wrong people as managers. Very messy company."
43,Royal Business Bank,Not your typical bank,2020-08-18,3.0,Anonymous Employee,A good place to learn different functions of banking.,A very robotic place to work at.
44,Royal Business Bank,"Don’t waste your time, worst company ever",2020-08-10,1.0,Loan Servicing,I can never think of something positive,"Let me start out by saying that the company does not care about your well-being. During a global pandemic the CEO decided to push employees back to the office as soon as it is allowed by the state to re-open. Employees returned to office at FULL capacity with no safety measures planned. Eventually most employees got sick and contracted COVID-19. As employees are getting sick one by one, the office remain opened and employees were still expected to report to the office for work UNTIL a full week later when someone tested positive for COVID-19 and that’s when they decided to close the office. This is a prime example of a company that does not care about your health but worries that employees are not “doing their duties” working from home. The CEO is too involved in each departments but does not have a clue how to run it. Instead of the value of employees, CEO values petty non-sense like a daily activity log that employees are required to complete at the end of the day to reflect on what work was done at each hour of the day, every day. Also, you are required to cc the CEO on every single email. If Alan Thian have time to read every single emails from all employees then he is not doing his job correctly. All the upper management cannot make decisions and will have to ask CEO for approval. Management is not management but just messengers for the CEO. The company is fully dysfunctional and the structure is non existence. The company does not allow overtime pay and employees are required to clock out first and then continue to complete their task before leaving the office. I don’t know how many labor laws this bank breaks and still never got investigated. A company’s HR dept is supposed to protect the employees but in this company the HR does whatever the CEO tells them to do. Turnover rate is super high and management will terminate you for personal reasons. Totally not professional. They allow someone (a so-called consultant) to run basically the Whole New York operations and making recommendations to CEO with NO EXPERIENCE in banking or commercial/residential lending. Just based off of referring clients to the bank. Unfortunately, CEO is too blind to see that this is hurting the bank and its employees. The “consultant” walks around the bank like a communist leader. They run the company like employees are like slaves. Very cheap when it comes to essential items that keeps the office clean and sanitary. They need about 5 signature approvals just to order simple things like toilet paper and cleaning supplies. They just simply dont care about their employees, period."

I never see a place that always takes other people's work credits and claims the works are completed by themself. There is no help from the manager at all. Everyone is suffering to get advice/feedback on their works. The manager does not care and why do we care? Oh…. If you are really good at flattering your boss, this is the right place!!!   For people who work very hard are not recognized by senior managers and for those who simply don't do their job are being recognized. We are all humans and we make mistakes..but a tiny issue?? Managers start harassing & penalizing  people for their little tiny mistake. Are you kidding me???? .  To all my dear friends, please stay away from this company unless you are good at flattering. Managers only care about their favored employee and the ones who can help to complete their assigned tasks/projects."

Leaving the daily nonsenses on the side, during the stage of state emergency for health issues, the company has no reaction nor any plans. There are no updates from the management or HR. Employees feel unsecured. 

The company does not provide any sort of hygiene products on normal basis, which means tissues, hand sanitizer, sanitizing wipes and any other related kind are all removed from the order list by the management. Even during the current stage with coronavirus, non of the hygiene products are available to employees. The office is always short of paper towel, and currently has been out of stock for weeks. The process of ordering office supplies is difficult and most  of the time was delay and cut. As of current, employees are unable to find non-overpriced products for themselves to be used in the office."
49,Royal Business Bank,Conservative,2020-03-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Many young people looking to excel and grow,"Extremely conservative work culture creates a stifling and uptight work environment.  Talking/communication with others is discouraged. Executives want employees who can keep their heads down, be quiet, and stay in their lane. There's generally somebody watching your every move who will report to the higher ups at any given moment. Opposite of a performance based culture, working hard is rarely rewarded whereas the smallest mistakes are heavily penalized. Turnover is high because employees aren't valued by upper management."
50,Royal Business Bank,"A ""Not my problem"" kind of place, toxic environment",2019-12-08,1.0,Manager,"Some of the people I work with are truly diligent and hardworking people, except they work with a few people who couldn't find their way out of cardboard box.. Then they are forced to cover the incompetent","Use it as a learning experience. The upper management is the type you want to avoid. They are prime examples of how NOT to treat people. While they are bank, the office politics are ridiculous. There is a reason why the turnover rate is so high. People literally went out of their way to belittle employees over the most minuscule things in unprofessional emails, thus bringing down morale overall. The environment is just so toxic. Those who do the right things are hardly recognized and excuses are made for others who simply don't do their jobs. The division between the East and West coast side is plainly obvious. 

-Who is the CEO? Who cares, the guy has never even written an email for the holidays.  

-The compensation is below average compared to other competitors, but the bank has money rolling in since they are Asian market focused institution. 

-Oh by the way, adjusting time clocks to avoid paying your employees overtime is illegal under FLSA and DOL, that's how little they care about the lower level employees. 

-The health insurance is bad and overpriced, terrible benefits. The cost is ridiculous even for single no dependents. If you have a family, you'll being paying plenty out of pocket."

So for anyone who wants to work hard and do absolute everything they demanded, you won’t be appreciated and noticed, besides, you won’t get paid for ot. Absolutly not helpful for your career development since the work is too broad . Taking on too many responsibilities will ruin your career.

There is a feeling of teamwork here, and for the most part everyone helps each other. Senior management is knowledgeable and talented. The executive team are experts in their field and supportive. The CEO is progressive, has an open door policy but most of all, recognizes commitment and hard work. So for those who just come to work to earn a pay check and do the absolute minimum....that is noticed also. 
Yes, there are areas that the bank can improve in....but what place of business doesn't?

-Randomly hire and fire people for no reason. thank god I quitted before getting fired. When it was run by FAIB, all the coworkers were treated like family and they have been working at this bank for over a decade. Now you get a new face every month which slows everything down, due to them leaving before even fully training them.

-Force you to volunteer (community service are demanded against your will)

-You are treated worst than  Dollar Tree's employees. (they are extremely cheap they even control  the temperature setting and how long your monitor stays awake) 

- We are required to closed customer's accounts for no reason at all.

- The amount of accounts opened decrease significantly  due to various paperwork and asking customers retarded questions. I used to average opening 7-8 accounts a day. Now i will get lucky if i can open one, before quitting I actually average closing more than 10 accounts a day both from customer's request and from their California headquarter asking me to close customer's accounts for no reason at all. It would be nice if you can tell us why our customer's accounts were closed so I can redirect their anger towards you instead of my face.

The bank's reputation been ruined by the ""upper"" (dumber) management from CA. (be honesty, they feel they are specious, NY market is trouble to them). Can you think about when RE attorneys, agents heard about their clients dealing with RBB, they refused to do the business?

67,Royal Business Bank,Horrible just plain horrible,2018-06-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are none unfortunately ...,"Thank goodness other people feel the same way. First of all this company does not have HR, so good luck getting to management about work related issues/personal problems. 

This place truly deserves a 1 star. They are racist, and only like Chinese speaking employees (Mandarin) If you don't speak, you will not get around here well. The turn over rate is very very high here. They also do not train people, or have the sufficient assistance to give to new hires. Everyone seems lost and not helpful.

People here keep to themselves and to get to managements you have to brown nose!!!! 
The executives are also very snooty, all they do is talk about themselves."
