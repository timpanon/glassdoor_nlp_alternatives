Extremely safely orientated
Will work with any issues you have
Very caring
Solid steady work for loyal workers","The pay rates. The pay rates are are nearly impossible to live on. I was told that Schütz want nothing more then loyal workers but as heartbreaking it is to say because I love to work for Schutz, there feels like there's no loyalty in return. Alot of us ""loyal"" casual workers won't get offered full time for almost two years when the work is clearly there. To work 38hours at 25ph a week for a company that speaks of wanting loyalty while alot of the workers there can only just afford to get by. Your workers are never going to progress in life and that must show with how many workers you go through. Help us out, we need to be able to live and not just survive to be able to the best workers we can. We don't have enough time to find another job doing full time hours. Thank you fornreading"

Fontana, CA.",2017-06-08,1.0,Maintenance,"If you're planning on wasting your time waiting for empty promises, this is the place for you.","Poor leadership all the way around. No support from the corporate level. Temporary employee workforce. Underpaid, understaffed, poor working conditions. There was no HR dept. at the plant level so everything had to go through NJ corporate offices. No advancement opportunities, no room for growth, no training program. I was literally expected to be on call even though no prior agreement had been made regarding this issue. I was denied overtime pay on a regular basis. I had to become my own bookkeeper just so I wasn't screwed out of overtime pay. I worked there 2 years and I left on my own terms once I had a new job offer, I wasn't fired and now I'm a disgruntled employee, I just hope this helps someone think about working for this company before they accept a job offer from Schutz Containers in Fontana, CA."
