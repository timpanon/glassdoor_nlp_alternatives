The Management team knows how to do business but needs to improve their reputation in the capital and equity markets.",Eat what you kill and only eat what you kill.  Eliminates any reward for synergies or referred clients. Long the Market is not a bad place to be especially with someone so short on capital.
1,SJLS,Don't work here unless you don't have other alternatives,2010-09-08,1.0,,Flexible work from home arrangement,"The company is barely breaking even and has no future.
Management treats people very poorly. Company provides ""free"" lunch, but you get a personal conversation with the CFO if you order 2 mini sandwiches, and company president/owner would send emails requesting that nobody can order soups.
Very bad pay, and they pay your bonus in worthless ""membership"" points.
Minimum benefits.
High turnover ratio, and good people leave very quickly once they figure out what's going on."
