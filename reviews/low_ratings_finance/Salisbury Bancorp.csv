0,Salisbury Bancorp,Toxic workplace,2021-08-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"None, none, none, none, none",Very unprofessional working environment. Poor performance is tolerated by management if you are related to someone or “know” someone which results in a toxic workplace. There is not an onboarding or training program which is horrible since the turn over is so high which causes stress on those involved.

7,Salisbury Bancorp,Retail Banker,2015-10-20,1.0,Retail Banker,Generous employee 401(k) match - if you can work there long enough to get the match. Working conditions vary widely depending on the department you work for. Some of the people who work there are very nice.,"Poor compensation, generally negative work culture/environment - especially in retail banking, and out of date technology. If you are a staff-level employee, it feels like you are an annoyance that gets in the way of the bank making more profit. Middle management is full of incompetent people who seem to be trying to do as little work as possible, delegating as much work as they can get away with to their subordinates. 

Employees are generally treated like naughty children. Internet use is restricted to bank websites only - you can't even look up a lunch menu.  It seems that it is assumed that all employees are trying to rip the bank off in some way. 

Toxic work environment if you work in retail and customer support.  Very catty, immature employees who gossip about other employees. Some branches are better than others, but there is generally a very high rate of turnover on teller lines due to poor pay and heavy work load."
