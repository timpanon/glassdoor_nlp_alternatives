1,Samuel Klein and Company,SK&Co.,2021-08-05,5.0,Senior Accountant,Stable job. Good for learning Governmental and Public School Auditing. Down to Earth upper management.,"Salary is based in the early 1990’s. They don’t like to pay people. Or invest in anything for that matter. When I worked there, they were still using green 14 column paper and red rope folders. But that’s how they keep large clients. Current billing for the Managing Partner is still only $150 an hour. I was billed at $225 when I was a Staff II at a larger firm."
