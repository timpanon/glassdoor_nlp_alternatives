No good work for back-end developers
QA team is worst ever I have seen
Project Management is very bad, they don't follow any SDLC process, they are just communicator between client and developers.
No documentations, no technical hld, lld documents, or wcr docs.
Quality of product is very bad , lots of clients have left in last 2-3 years. They expect sales people to sell substandard product to companies like goldman sachs, morgan stanley and other big banks."

20,Scivantage,"New management, better direction, high pressure",2016-03-26,3.0,Director,"Getting to work with a lot of dedicated, intelligent, hard working people. If you love being part of a great team then certain departments in this company will get you what you seek.  

The new management is steadily moving toward improving work/life balance for employees and generally improving employee benefits. You will find yourself working hard, there is no escaping that at this company. The new management is starting to recognize this and reward employees for their dedication. 

Transparency improved greatly since the new management took over. For the first time we are seeing our financial projections, goals, and generally where the company is headed and how the employees play into that. More and more strategic meetings are being opened up to all employees who want to listen to what different departments are working on. 

Low performers get weeded out and the concentration of high performing resources in certain teams has steadily been increasing.","As expected in a growing company, the pressure to deliver is high. Many delivery dates (with designated delivery criteria) are unachievable. You find yourself (and much of your and related teams) working nights and weekends repeatedly with no end in sight on many occasions to, more often than not, fail to deliver full scope within promised, unachievable deadlines. Improvements are slow so the cycle keeps repeating and those who care to succeed at their assignments are set up to fail. 

While some teams are improving greatly I see stagnation and/or unawareness of poor performance in others. This results in many employees needing to repeatedly pick up roles that are not part of their job function in order to achieve their goals. Many are experiencing burnout. 

The company has an overwhelming number of new hires whose roles are not well defined and communicated. There are also gaps in resourcing certain functions/departments, which gets in the way of delivering.

Management has not taken the time to get to know the existing workforce and their accomplishments/abilities. Their focus appears to be the new hires. Many of those who have been at the company for more than 1 year are being left behind without regard for their achievements for the success of the company over the years and what their potential is for helping with current objectives."
21,Scivantage,Test Review,2016-03-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Clients are many top tier financial services firms.,No cons I can think of.

23,Scivantage,Good company. Startup/Growth struggles,2015-12-07,4.0,,"Lots of good people, passionate about their jobs. Good products, good client base. New management team is making some changes, which some don't like, but overall, things that needed to be done. Things are trending up.",Growing pains have caused some problems. Needs more structure.
24,Scivantage,Operations,2015-09-01,2.0,New Jersey,smaller company allows more autonomy and control.  Some roles offer the flexibility to work remotely. The salary is average,Not a lot of room for upward growth promotions.  The majority of my co-workers have been in the same role for years.  The company made some management changes in 2015.
25,Scivantage,Boston office detached,2015-08-21,2.0,Business Analyst,"Excellent flexibility with work schedules/location, improving benefits, holiday parties were always well done, small size company with solid products","No 401k match, sales teams promise too much to clients and leave teams looking bad because they don't have enough resources to deliver, Boston office isn't fully included. Poor career development opportunities"
26,Scivantage,BEWARE - This company is NOT CLIENT FOCUS,2015-08-07,1.0,Management Information Systems Analyst,"This is a small company, flexible hours, However, management has no respect for hard working people.","This company used to be a good company, but the constance lies and promise to client, client started pulling their contract, Scivantage hired new management who laid off all the small people. Scivantage will lay you off  even if you are  on FMLA, Vacation, and during human sick time. 
This company has no respect for employees who has dedication many  years and long hours."
27,Scivantage,Small Startup Company Turning Medium,2015-07-01,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Startup atmosphere (not for everyone). I think that's the source for lots of negative reviews.
Yes, there's lots of work (sometimes hectic and unplanned), but there is also lots of flexibility. 
Scivantage allows work from home for extended time (even from other countries at times). 
Staff is friendly and there's lots of energy and friendliness. Lots of young talent and things to learn.
There's daily fruit, soft drinks, pool, table tennis, foosball.","Fast paced growth caused a lot of rash decisions to be made early on. This debt needs to be addressed and resolved to ensure the further growth can be supported.

There's a lot of restructure in upper management ranks recently as the company crosses from small to medium size. This brought on a lot of doubt, angst and fear in the lower ranks."
28,Scivantage,This company is in trouble!!! Stay away!!!,2015-06-24,1.0,,They are flexible with work hours.,"This company used to be great. Then they took on too much work, started losing money and began laying off their staff. While laying off staff that continued to hire execs that did nothing for the company. The employees that are left are being worked to death. The company does not hav a good balance of work and personal life. The company never contributes to 401k or pays out the bonuses that were promised to employees."
29,Scivantage,"The company is losing all its talents, and going downhill fast",2015-06-17,2.0,Software Developer,"small company feel, flexible schedule, used to have a lot more Pros.

30,Scivantage,Investment Data Analyst,2015-05-28,3.0,Investment Data Analyst,Small company feel.  Autonomy,Lack of management presence and support
31,Scivantage,Needs work,2015-05-21,2.0,Computer Engineer,"Benefits were decent
Interaction with management was minimal, pro and con... 
Annual meetings with employees","Interaction with management was minimal, pro and a con.
Company only offered reimbursement when traveling for the company. 
Salary was below market."
32,Scivantage,"Buyer Beware, their software quality goals are ""get it out the door.""",2015-03-28,2.0,,"They are growing and if you are only developing new products, it might be good.  There are some nice and talented people who work in the hardware and networking side.","Scivantage is beholden to one man's vision which is to build new products, get customers to sign ... and then probably retire with all the bonuses he has given himself.  He has a few talented IT people, especially his CTO in charge of hardware and networking; however, their coding goal is spin up products fast - if not with good software principles - and ""get it out the door.""   This means that the products are held together with duct tape rather than investing in best practices and re-factoring code.  I suspect that any firm that comes along and offers similar products written by more talented developers and a company that actually wants to build quality services will be able to steal clients simply because firms will grow weary of patchwork efforts to keep their products running.   If you are a software developer desperate for work, go ahead, but once you see their software architecture, you will understand why few senior developers stick around."
33,Scivantage,"Good company for people to start the career with, not a good place to grow with long term",2015-03-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"People are friendly

34,Scivantage,SciVantage passionate employees with mis managed domestic and offshore resources.,2015-02-01,2.0,Product,"Great location in Jersey City with a decent business model. SciVantage employees are a mix of seasoned Wall Street Business/Technical veterans, offshore workers and younger employees with limited Brokerage exposure. Management will allow  employees the ability to utilize new technology and develop skills. A good place for a recent grad to work for a few years.",The offshore model is most challenging and has changed several times recently. The domestic product teams is scattered in the North east and a challenge to deal with. Management is having a challenging time getting the correct management team with frequent Management and employee turnover. Many of the domestic employees tend to be younger and have limited command of the English language.  A firm of this size and age requires all levels of management to have direct and frequent communication with all levels of employees. The revenue stream is also questionable at Scivantage with the firm being run with venture capital. Pay scale is lower than more mature firms.
35,Scivantage,An overall unhealthy workplace!,2015-01-31,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Convenient office location. Gym discounts. Average salary.,"1.  Projects in the company are poorly run due to ruthless, talentless and delusional project managers. Project Managers never manage projects following the SDLC methodologies. Projects may not even have any system/business requirements, architecture documents, estimates, WBS, milestones, etc as project managers are too lazy/busy to write them. Because there is a lack of visibility of project milestones/due dates, project managers may harass technical staff to push project due dates whenever they feel like. When projects somehow succeed, project managers take all credits of work others contributed.

2.  Like everywhere else, office politics and bullying exists and it can get ugly. When more superior staff members did not get management support to get their ways, they deliberately dumped their responsibilities to new team members without cross-training them to pay management back. 

3.  Previous senior management used to allow staff to work from home due to overnight production callouts or legitimate causes. New management came in and revoked the work-from-home policy. 

4.  Offshore development teams do sloppy jobs and expect US teams to clean up their messes."

40,Scivantage,A chance to grow as a software engineer and delve into all areas of the SDLC,2014-04-11,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Scivantage has changed drastically in the last year:

- Yearly reviews for all employees (reviews linked to manager's review)
- An emphasis on Design, testing, performance
- Innovative market changing products to work on
- New capable CIO

Many a times, people will go above and beyond to help fellow workers.  Helping out when needed most.  Great team support culture.  Really makes one work harder for their follow worker

A lot of work to keep the day from being boring.  The work can be challenging.  Decent growth potential but not easy to come by 

The CEO is a great and pationate person, his vision is of providing the best service for the customer","Lack of vision and focus by management.  Management is less concerned about company direction and tragectory and more involved with personal positions and influence 

Conflicting visions between CEO and management, results in splintered and negative attitudes.  

There have been several rounds of reorganizations.  This breeds uncertanity

A lot of repetative work, putting out fires, leaving very little time for personal life"

Chaotic business/project plan. very bad communication between high/low level. treating people badly. Narrow profit model in an area where most clients are looking for lowering their cost. nothing to learn but basic ideas in accounting and taxation. not a financial company but an accounting firm. 

Bleak prospect in going public, looks like this company had given up IPO plan and would stay down for at least another 5-10 years."

45,Scivantage,Poor management and no work life balance,2012-12-30,1.0,Project Manager,"Many of the managers are flexable about your work schedule, but only because there's no work life balance. You will work A LOT.","1.The average employee works at least 50 + hours per week (if not much more). 
Management makes you feel guilty if you can not work overtime and puts a significant amount of pressure on the employees to perform. You will work morning , noon, night, and weekends. There is NO extra pay for this work. It is free labor. 
2.Do not expect a raise, a 401 k contribution, or a bonus. The company is behind 2 years on paying out promised bonuses even though they continue to meet their annual goals. 
3.There is no process, no training , and no real project management in the company. This is obvious on the Maxit side. Note: DO NOT work for the Maxit side of the company. It is completely client driven. You will lose all your free time! They work every weekend and even holidays with no overtime pay. 
4. You will hear the CEO scream at employees from time to time. He is known for tirades in which he humiliates employees in front of other employees or even in front of a client."

You are not formerly trained and rather thrown to the wolves after an introduction to the system.","At the time, the neccessary applications/tools were not provided (due to cost) in order to do our job.

It is E-verified and they are willing to support h1b, it is also possible they will sponsor your green card petition.","It is no technology oriented company, developer's status there is low, developers always do the same thing to fix same bug. Lack of efficient management leads to most meaningless work. And working overtime at night, weekend and holidays is a regular state."
49,Scivantage,Scivantage is a good place to gain well rounded experience,2012-06-03,4.0,Project Manager,It is easy to get your voice heard at this small firm. Management values the opinions of their employees and does their best to make you feel like you are contributing to the success of the the business. Management does not micromanage and give employees freedom to contribute their ideas and creativity to the product and process. You have the opportunity to gain a lot of experience at Scivantage.,Salaries are on the lower end of the average.
