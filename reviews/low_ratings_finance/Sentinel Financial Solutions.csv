0,Sentinel Financial Solutions,Terrible place No Moral Verbal Abuse,2016-11-17,1.0,,I wish there was a pro but unfortunately there isn't,"The owner is a horrible person to work for. He is better off working alone. He screams at all his employees, yells profanity, degrades people and makes them all feel worthless and incompetent. The manager is a micromanager watches everything everyone is doing. They look down on people if they take a lunch break they expect everyone to work long hours with minimal breaks. They discuss everyone's personal issues with everyone else in the office. They are not compliant and do not keep things about their employees confidential. They underpay everyone regardless of your experience. They do all their hiring through Lenox so people can get tricked into thinking that they will be interviewing for a large firm. The firm is only about 10-15 people. Everyone is underpaid and overworked. Run there are better places out there."
1,Sentinel Financial Solutions,Overworked verbally abused underpaid and degrading place to work at,2016-11-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are no pros working at this place,"The owner CS is terrible to work for. All he does is scream curse and degrade his employees. His lackey the manager knows nothing. Micro manages everyone. Screams and tried to have everyone scared of her. Tried to enforce dress code but walks around wearing sheer shirts and sneakers. The owner and the manager make it a terrible place to work. No one is allowed to talk to each other, everyone gets questioned what they are doing. Everyone is underpaid and overworked. They talk about everyone behind their backs and share employees personal information with everyone. They post their job listing through Lenox Advisors to trick people into thinking that they will be working in a Hige firm when it's actually a 10 person group. RUN!!!"
2,Sentinel Financial Solutions,Client Manager,2016-05-24,2.0,,"Working for this company, I learned how to work as hard as I can. I was challenged daily to always better myself. I came into the company not knowing much about the field, and came out knowing so much. It is a fast-paced environment so you have to learn how to get things done quickly and correctly. Some of the co-workers are extremely helpful and some of them truly turn into family. This job really helped me gain my great working habits.","Although I gained amazing working habits by working here, I also learned exactly where I do not want to work in my life. If you do something wrong or don't do something the way management wants you to, you will get yelled and screamed at as if you were management's child. Management will take advantage of you if you are a hard worker. You may stay late, come in early, not take lunch breaks, and work as hard as possible, but management will never show you appreciation. 
There is also no clear description of your job, so you are expected to do things that you were not aware was your responsibility - and if you don't do it, you will get in trouble."
