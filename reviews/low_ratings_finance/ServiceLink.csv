You will work there starting at a very low wage and a 2 % increase yearly ( if you are lucky) . You either work 60-80 hours a week or 40.

Employer would constantly shift focus to new goals or responsibilities with little to no training. The job was easy to do but there was always the constant fear of being laid off.

Lack of respect for employees, chaotic environment and lack of planning and organization from management. The workload is unreasonable and does not allow for any level of good customer service. The company takes on too much work at the expense of quality. Their lack of planning and hiring causes large amounts of overtime for front line employees. It is now the norm to be hundreds of files behind. Borrowers should avoid this company and use their local companies."
21,ServiceLink,Decent workplace,2021-09-28,4.0,Invoice Verification Auditor,No micromanaging and you can work independently.,The job spends on foreclosures. The housing industry can change at any minute. The pandemic wiped the high volume out
22,ServiceLink,Worst Managed Company Imaginable,2021-09-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are no pros for this job. It's a temporary work from home position that will run you into the ground.,"- No work life balance, always pushing for overtime during the week and on weekends
- Extremely poor upper management 
- Focused way too much on productivity standards instead of actual quality of work
- Other departments were dissolved or broken down a bit and those responsibilities all went to one department, so it is impossible to focus on your sole purpose for working
- HR is extremely hands off and it is very difficult to get any of them to respond, even to urgent matters
- Benefits are terrible
- PTO is offered, but you are not allowed to take off the same day as someone else, so if you are new and haven't been with the company for 15+ years, say goodbye to being able to plan vacations and seeing family for the holidays
- Lay offs happen every winter season without warning
- The pay is insultingly low for the workload and responsibility you take on, especially for other departments pushing their sole role onto you
- They do not care about personal matters and do not value their employees
- Workplace harassment is constant and will not be resolved, as HR does not take anything seriously or value employee comfort. They will do anything to avoid having to lift a finger and truly discipline anyone. 
- Toxic coworkers with very little drive to do anything. If you are good at your job, they will walk all over you and take full advantage of that. They will burn you out quicker than you can blink.
- Already stated, but management is AWFUL. I strongly urge everyone to keep a strong distance from this place. This is not a job you want. It may sound simple and convenient with a lot of freedom and independence, but it is not. Micromanaging is a true problem here and this job will seriously raise your blood pressure and anxiety levels."

76,ServiceLink,Be careful of the positive reviews.,2020-01-13,1.0,Financial Analyst,"There are some very good employees that give their best.  Unfortunately, if you give your best, this company wants more out of you.","Where do I start.  
First off, if you are hoping to meet the CEO, it won't happen.  I saw him one day and told my boss I would like to meet him someday.  He told me that was absolutely out of the question.  The CEO does not talk to anybody lower than his direct reports.  So, if you see a review about meeting senior managers, it is not true.  
Second.  You will see reviews about the many team building events.  That is also a fabrication.  They USED to have team building events.  Then the senior managers would walk around the offices and see who was NOT at their desks.  So, this was stopped abruptly.  
Does management care about it's employees?  Not a chance.  They only care about what they look like in front of the upper managers.  You will see people leaving, but nobody new is hired.  They take the current work load, and distribute it to who ever is left.  
Hourly versus Salary people are treated just the same.  Yes, you may see salary people taking a longer lunch, but that just means they have to stay longer to make up the time.  Hourly workers are stuck at their desks with only a 30 minute lunch at two 15 minute breaks a day.  And my manager told me that salary workers do not get breaks.  If I took two 15 minutes breaks, then I had to work an extra half hour each day to make up for it.  And, as a salary worker, if I took longer than 30 minutes for lunch, I had to make up the time.  
In past jobs, your salary was based upon what your ""brought to the table"" such as education, experience, etc.  At Servicelink, I was told they pay your more to offset the extra hours you will be required to work.  
You may get a laptop for the cases where you have meetings and need to take it with you.  But, you are also required to take it home and work during the evening.  You are also obligated to take it with you on vacation and monitor emails while you are gone.  
And, by the way, if they do let you go.  Please account for all your personal items.  People have to buy their own office supplies and when you are let go, the vultures pounce on every thing they can get their hands on.  Also, if you have any personal computer peripherals like a cordless mouse and keyboard.  Make sure you get those back.  I have seen personal gear like laptop bags, dongles, mouse and keyboards magically disappear when cleaning out somebody's desk.  Including mine.  
I have also seen reviews where somebody has complained to HR for racism, bullying, or just poor management techniques.  Sorry, HR cannot help you.  One thing WILL happen.  You will be placed on a performance improvement plan and every move you make will be documented and a case file will be created for your dismissal.  The second thing that will happen is you will be interrogated and made to look like you made the entire scenario up.  HR is only there to make sure the company does not get sued.  If there is cause for being sued, they will discredit all you say.  If there is no cause for a law suit, such as office bullying, they will not do anything.  
If you see a job opening for Servicelink.  Ignore it.  If you are not the CEO or his direct reports, you do not matter.  
So, all of these positive reviews about management caring, team building events, CEO town hall meetings...   truthfully, they are all a complete fabrication and nothing more than an attempt to artificially inflate the Glassdoor rating of Servicelink"

Bad working conditions, ABUSE OF VISA HOLDERS. They hire majority of outsiders/non-citizens so they can abuse them. They will make you work after hours and on weekends, They pay you salary instead of per hour to make you work 50 hours or even 70 hours a week. 

Super bad management - Most annoying thing is improper estimation and unrealistic expectation. WHEN RELEASE OF A MAJOR PROJECT GETS SHIFTED BY 6 MONTHS, there is something really really wrong with the approach, but they don't learn anything and continue the same way. Unclear requirements for many tasks, they keep shifting and changing tasks like its a joke. 

No onboarding process, anti-social workplace. ITS LIKE A MILITARY experience. 

In case of downsizing they layoff everyone except upper management. A coworker was layed off just weeks after staring.  

Trust me after you join you will want to leave after 1st month. Its so bad. That's why they hire VISA holders because they are stuck due to their visa situation.

I WOULD SUGGEST NEVER WORK HERE."
85,ServiceLink,Review,2019-09-24,3.0,QC Analyst,"Structured, good benefits, and decent pay",Constantly revolving door of managers and unrealistic production goals
86,ServiceLink,Hmmm,2019-09-12,2.0,Operations,They were flexible with my hours and have decent benefits.,Unprofessional leaders. They don’t give pay raises. Negative culture in the ops teams due to poor leadership.
87,ServiceLink,Absolute Disaster,2019-08-24,1.0,Data Entry,"Casual dress code (which is ignored almost every other day, because they demand you dress up for the visitors that you never see), and sometimes they provide you some free food trucks. Usually once a month.","The hours of ServiceLink are *miserable.* I took this job thinking it couldn't possibly be that bad. But it was. It was truly one of those places where you dread going to sleep at night, because you know the next morning you'll be back at ServiceLink. It was a place where I literally cried in my car in the parking lot before coming in to work.

So lets start with the hours and work. It's boring, and I mean *dreadfully* boring. And the supervisors are incredibly anal about you getting 8 hours every single day too. I once worked 7.98 hours and was reprimanded via email. That is 1 minute and 12 seconds too long that I was on my lunch break for their liking, and I was reprimanded. If it's that much of an issue, don't pay me for that minute and a half? I don't *expect* you to pay me for that minute and a half.

While we're on the subject of hours, lets talk about overtime. Because you *will* be working it. Every single month, for example, you'll be expected to pull 12 hours one day, 13 hours the next, and 12 the day after that. It's despicable, and you don't get additional breaks. You still get your two fifteens and a half hour meal break. For a thirteen hour shift. And when asked, fellow employees would say ""Oh that's not even bad. I've worked 17 hours straight before."" like it's something to be proud of. That's not a good thing, but ServiceLink convinces their employees who stick around that it is.

And on the subject of the work, I won't speak to other departments, but mine was dreadfully boring. And if you have any kind of anxiety that prevents you from making phone calls to people who don't want anything to do with you, have fun at this job. Because that's all you'll be doing. Oh, and of course you will barely see any training on any of this.

Seriously, I was in training for almost a month, and when I went out onto the floor, I knew almost nothing about actually paying off the mortgages, or collecting information. I just knew a few buzz terms that meant nothing in execution.

But if you're considering working here, and you're looking at the Glassdoor reviews and getting that sinking feeling in your stomach, listen to it. Avoid this place."

92,ServiceLink,Worst Places to Work,2019-06-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There really aren't many pros.  I do thank them for an opportunity to get an experience I wouldn't have received anywhere else.,"ServiceLink is truly one of the worst places to work.  Work life balance does not exist. They do not care about their employees.  What these reviews say about turnover and employee morale are all true.  People are expected to work a crazy amount of hours when they have the volume and then get laid off and their belongings shipped to them when the volume slows down.  They have offered people jobs and after the candidate has given notice to their current employer told them the Friday before they were supposed to start that their job was no longer available.  They would hire large amounts of people.  Half of them would be told they weren't starting and the other half would be laid off by Wednesday of that same week. 

They try to fix employee morale by having lunches and games outside.  However, teammates are not allowed to leave their desks to participate.  The executives and management are so disengaged they have to practically be begged to participate in activities to help with morale.  After working for almost 4 years in the same building as the CEO, I only saw him two times in passing.   

ServiceLink also has a terrible hierarchical structure.  They believe in titles.  Executives all have their own assigned front row parking spots.  I actually thanked a security guard for holding the door open for me the one day.  Just to realize it was because a certain SVP was walking in behind me.  They would get up everyday when they saw the SVP's car pull in and open the door and if it was raining they would run out with an umbrella.  I have heard executives yell at their assistants for coffee.  

People are also in management roles that shouldn't be.  They do play favoritism and  give people management titles just because they laid everyone else off on the team.  Managers also mirco manage to the extreme here so nothing can really get done. 

Being part of the shared services team gave me a very unique and behind the scene look as to how ServiceLink operates.  They do not care about their employees and yes you are replaceable.  I spent so many hours working late at night and on weekends.  I gave them my blood, sweat and tears for several years just to be treated poorly and not have support of my manager.  Moving to a company that cares for its teammates has been enlightening because I now realize it is not normal."

110,ServiceLink,"ServiceLink, you can't hide your true colors.",2019-01-08,1.0,Shared Services,There are really good people who work at ServiceLink. It's a shame they aren't treated well.,"ServiceLink has a toxic culture, despite what you read on their website and on Glassdoor.  I think one can use their intuition to figure out that when you see such polarizing reviews like ServiceLink has, someone is being deceitful.  Simply put, a company which has such an enormous amount of turnover wouldn’t be receiving rave reviews from current and past employees.  Knowing how this organization functions, I believe the five star reviews are reviews written by those who have a vested interest in the image of the company (or written by employees who were told to write a review by those individuals).  Since those high-ranking individuals seem to be obsessed with countering every negative review with a positive, I hope they also took the time to read Glassdoor’s terms of use regarding coercion and incentives regarding reviews. On second thought, I imagine they probably didn't read the terms of use but will make the legal department clean up their mess if necessary. 

Below are other points that I feel are helpful for those thinking about taking a position at ServiceLink:

-I saw numerous employees at all levels get fired for not 'following the leader'.  In other words, if you challenge the leadership at SL, you will be let go.  You must have a submissive mentality to succeed at ServiceLink.  I spent my first year and a half banging my head against the wall to try to create change at ServiceLink, and then realized I was wasting my time and it wasn’t worth the effort.   I ended up resigning when I came to the conclusion that change won’t happen unless the c-suite changes.

-There is zero communication from the top.  The CEO never hosts ‘town hall’ meetings therefore employees are left in the dark about the state of the organization.  Sure, you will hear about the positive happenings through company emails:  company events, acquisitions, new tech products, etc.  However, just when you think all is well with the organization, they will start laying people off.  After all, eating up small companies and developing new products come at a cost, right?   Regardless, employees need to hear from their CEO.  Most people would appreciate a transparent communication rather than no communication at all. 

-ServiceLink can spend all the money in the world on employee engagement, but because they don’t value their employees, they might as well flush the money down the toilet.  Many activities had low attendance because management would not let employees leave their desk to participate in the event. Employees would have to leave the lines at company-sponsored events because they were fearful that they were away from their desk for too long.  

-Perpetual layoffs cause a constant level of anxiety among the employees.  Layoffs also seem to be ill-timed as well, like before the holidays or shortly before Employee Appreciation Day….which they still celebrated.

-HR and Recruiting cannot function as they should due to  upper management.  Management is overly involved in the day-to-day practices of HR and Recruiting.   Often HR is left to clean up the mess that the various business units create; usually at the expense of the employees. 

-The businesses view Shared Services as a 24 hour emergency hotline.  If a manager needs you and you aren't available at that very minute, you are likely to receive missed calls, emails, and even a post-it on your desk within a thirty minute span.  I saw this happen to myself and many of my colleagues; and 99.9% of the time the issue was by no means ‘business critical’."
111,ServiceLink,"Trust your gut... and the real reviews.  ServiceLink is exactly ""as advertised""",2019-01-07,1.0,Shared Services,Most employees were very cordial despite the terrible  work environment and toxic culture.,"When I was interviewing at ServiceLink, I checked out reviews on Glassdoor.  My gut was telling me to stay away.  Unfortunately for me, I ignored my intuition and accepted the offer.  For the record, I resigned from my position and was not one of the many who are laid off.

While I have no proof that the five start reviews are fake, I can confirm that the leadership has explored writing fake reviews in the past.  It is suspicious that the recent outpouring of amazing reviews came within days of an article coming out naming ServiceLink as the 3rd worst company to work for in 2019 based on information collected from Glassdoor.  The ongoing issue at this organization is that management refuses to change and HR is too powerless to have a positive impact.  The leadership team is well aware of what the Glassdoor reviews say and feel it is better to write fake reviews that to actively try to change the culture.  

Other issues are as follows:

- True production culture; employees are overworked and compensated poorly

- Management promotes employees who won't challenge their superiors or question the ""status quo"".

- Micromanaging is an epidemic at ServiceLink.  Employees receive minimal training and managers have zero trust or tolerance for their staff.

- ""Tail ways the dog"" culture.  The business controls HR, therefore HR does not impact business decisions as it should.

- HR is viewed as an obstacle and not a resource; HR cannot be strategic

- On multiple occasions, the business demands Recruiting to rescind offers within 24 business hours of a new hire's start date.  Rescinding offers is a common practice at ServiceLink; it is beyond cruel to those individuals (who may have left other jobs) who have been on the receiving end of this horrible action.  

- ServiceLink does have employee engagement activities.  However, the business has often discouraged and/or forbid employee involvement in activities and events.  These events are often used as a photo opportunity to show the ""great culture"" that exists.  The reality of the situation is that 90% of those that show up to these events take their food and go back to their desks for fear of being reprimanded for being away from their desks.

- Nearly everyone I interacted with at ServiceLink was looking to leave ServiceLink.

- The CEO has zero visibility.  While he has been informed by several high-ranking business leaders about the importance of communication and transparency, he refuses to make any effort to engage employees."

Friendships and relationships are formed through shared misery and frustration.
They gave us a latte machine in a trial basis and called it a reward.
They’ll eventually lay you off so you can finally be freed of the borderline sweatshop like work conditions.","Let’s start with the absolute obvious here. MANAGEMENT! Mid level management employees are brain washed into treating entry level employees like a herd of cattle. None of us have any freedom to do anything. Including going to the bathroom or getting a drink of water. It’s not entirely their fault though, because if they fall out of line they are smacked down with threat of a demotion or termination. Now let’s get to the real stuff. SENIOR MANAGEMENT IS A JOKE! I honestly can’t even find a better word to describe this. These people have the audacity of screwing up everything they touch then proceed to blame the little guys or their panel of providers. They preach accountability but have none for themselves. They get to talk about taking flights on the company’s dollar, golf outings, using the corporate card for bar hopping on client visits, etc. yet, I haven’t seen a raise in 5+ years! Explain that to me, please. They are out of touch and cold. They don’t greet you with a smile unless they want something from you. They go off on 4+ hour smoke breaks with their little clique while the rest of us are stuck trying to put out the dumpster fire they call Exos. They’re invisible unless they’re stalking the aisles trying to micromanage you. They are less than intelligent when it actually comes to executing their job. They hold these “prestigious” job titles they are so proud of but have ZERO clue on what is actually going on. When a client is unhappy, low level employees lose their jobs. Certainly can’t be at the fault of management to whom feel as though they shouldn’t have to get their hands dirty ...ever! Therefore, wont listen or learn when the people in the trenches day in and day out try and explain any problem to them. They use fear and manipulation to get what they want. People are chained to their desks for 8+ hours a day with very limited, if any, breaks while anyone with a title is seen sneaking out sometime between 4 and 5 every day.  They once told an employee who spoke up about morale that if they didn’t like it to just leave. Heaven forbid you have a family emergency or anything of that nature because you still can’t leave. It’s a prison. It is hell on earth. When clients come around they force us into these stuffy clothes for appearance sake when clearly the clients read every word we all write anyway. So it’s pretty pointless. FYI any client of ServiceLink reading this please know that every 5 star review on here is fake. Much like the reviews on any app or website (Exos). They are manufactured by employees who are forced to leave behind any code of ethics and write fake reviews or suffer the consequences. Now, finally let’s get into the best part. HUMAN RESOURCES THIS IS FOR YOU! Employees have nicknamed HR whenever they’re seen because that means layoffs are coming. They aren’t trusted and then sit back in their offices and wonder why everyone is always so negative when they come around. It doesn’t take a genius to figure that out. In addition they are helpful. If you have a complaint about someone, especially management, they will run to the next building, rat that person out and 2 weeks after, that person is fired. They don’t have your back. They are snakes, like everyone else in that place. Please tell me how you managed to lose several employees of 10+ years in ONE MONTH bc they had enough of your abuse. Your exit interviews are a waste of time. It’s all a waste of time. 

We don’t want picnic tables or latte machines. We want compensation for our hard work. We want management and human recourses to take mandatory sensitivity training so they can hopefully come back into contact with their human side. We don’t want to work 7 days a week. We don’t want disgusting food in an empty warehouse that we aren’t even allowed to go to. We want morale back. We want to come to work and be happy and not dread even getting out of bed. We want a CLEAN (cockroach free), safe environment to work in. We don’t want marketing to manufacture false reviews. We want our equipment and tools to work as promised so you stop blaming production on us when we are all only human. We don’t want to be degraded and talked down to. We want to be treated with respect and treated equal. You’d be surprised to find what happens when you start doing the right thing and start listening to us instead of stifling us and locking us down."

I’ve been watching these reviews for YEARS with little to no positivity. You have the nerve to have people you know write fake reviews instead of fixing the problems. Now THAT is an ethics issue on top of the many others.  I tried to give real answers and constructive criticism but the HR girl was so rude there is no reason to hold back.  If you complain  about the workload you are told to work more instead of helping. No raises. They took away incentive bonuses. The technology used in the floor is not user friendly; lags or even stops working. Quantity over quality... ALWAYS. This must be your world. Even if you are “slow” enough to work only 8 hours it is not out of the norm to get calls on your personal time and personal phone if someone doesn’t know how to do something.

They fixed some bugs, but still a terrible system compared to the old System we used.  Rather than acknowledging AssetShield was a mistake, they lie to the employees and tell us clients love it.  Yet they keep dropping us?  Property Preservation doesn’t hire anymore, and if they did, I wouldn’t count on having that job for long due to non-stop layoffs.

The recent influx of positive reviews on here are from HR, and Upper Management trying to save face after the article came out ranking this place as number 3 of worst places to work that a client found and forwarded to us. Instead of actually trying to fix any problems they just decided to have their goons post fake good reviews on here because the article used Glassdoor in showing why it's number 3 on the list. They do not care about us regular workers here. In fact as I type this it is Christmas Eve. We've been told by management that we do not get off early today. It's very much a slap on the face for two reasons. One: We can't actually do our jobs to the full extent because other offices like attorneys offices or tax offices are all closed today. Two: All of management isn't in the office today. They're all at home getting to enjoy their families while we're forced to sit here all day. Every negative review posted on here is the truth and it's always followed up by HR posting fake good reviews trying to save face. Do yourself favor and stay far FAR away from this place. Compared to every other company in the industry you are massively underpaid here and they force you to sign a non-compete so they have you trapped. I made the mistake of working here. Don't do the same. Every other title company pays and treats their employees better. Here they'll act like they like you even when they decide to fire you by letting you know Friday at 4pm to get a full work week out of you even though they decided the layoffs on Monday."

In general, management do not care about employees.

Most importantly, the high turnover rate across all departments is very telling of the culture."
118,ServiceLink,The World's Third Worst Company to Work for in 2019 (Google it.),2018-12-21,1.0,Anonymous,"- Ability to quickly find people willing to write ridiculously positive – sometimes fake – reviews as a weak attempt at crisis management following a negative article on the culture.
- Executives are so humble that they got rid of Reserved Parking spaces in the front row of the building to try and make themselves interact with the hourly employees – such martyrs. 
- Once per year, Executives are forced to begrudgingly serve employees sausages in a dirty, dark warehouse next door. Sure, our managers make us immediately return to our desks, but what a nice break. And there’s nothing more genuine than forced leadership engagement.
- Speaking of leadership, there’s always a fresh new leader in one business/department or another – because the turnover is nothing like you’ve ever seen.
- If they lay you off (or more like when) they will probably need to refill your position again before you can find another job, so they may call you to come back within a few months or even weeks. But only because “the industry is cyclical” – even though other companies in the industry seem to have figured it out. 
- On the other hand, if you choose to leave on your own for a new experience or opportunity, they will just shame you by implying that you are leaving because you “don’t like to work hard.” Which, is a great way to send off an employee who has worked tirelessly for you for years and an equally great way to keep up the morale of the employees you have left.

Well, when I first started it was such a struggle. They pile so much on you at once and expect you to know it ASAP. Training is poor. You ask questions for help and they act like your a burden for asking. So that made it difficult. Once you finally catch on, they begin pressuring you. There are constant emails about what your team is doing wrong and how you can improve. Always having meetings and sending horrible emails downgrading you and your performance. They threaten constantly. Pretty much throwing in your face that if our ""numbers don't improve"", be prepared to get laid off. Management never gives good feedback. Never tells you what you're doing right or if you're doing well. Its only negative and how we can improve constantly. They like to push you down and make you feel like dirt. Not only that, but you never have stability. You're always afraid you won't have a job the next day. They do major lay offs every other month. (Even though towards the end of my journey there, felt like it became more often) And if you've worked there for 10+ years? Forget it! They don't care about loyalty. No matter how long you've been there, they will still get rid of you. Oh, and also forget about getting comfortable at your desk. They had me move my desk 5 times in less than a year. They lay off large amounts of people, and then expect all the employees who are left to take over everyone else's work. I was once told that I was doing the work of 2 people after they laid off 6 of my team members. Was I rewarded or complimented? Nope. They just come at you telling you to work harder. You can never get comfortable. They constantly watch you. You're always tense not knowing what could happen next. Experienced a handful of my coworkers being let go from their desks while they were eating lunch and get laid off. Then you would watch them get escorted out by security for doing nothing wrong. It was disgusting to watch. It was constant. Such a stressful work environment. Constant drama, it never stops. And I won't even get into the many times I had been lied to and promised things which were never provided to me. They change managers, teams, and positions every other week. You can't ever adjust or get used to anything, because the moment you get comfortable, they switch you to something completely new without even a warning. The list literally goes on and on and on... Take my advice... Do not work here. Save yourself the anxiety, stress, and worry. There are many other BETTER places out there... TRUST me."

Very obnoxious, rude executive. He doesn't speak to staff like they are beneath him. Management is a joke. Current two managers are a primary reason so many people have quit and the staff they do have are seeking other jobs.

There is one manager in Dallas who does not know anything and is paid to send emails and basically be a secretary. Both managers are clueless and not the most professional.

Also, the apparently excludes you from raises if you are more efficient than most. For example: I recently found out that I am [frighteningly] underpaid in comparison to other people in the position i am in (over 6k/year excluding overtime). So I, like any red blooded person, was upset and asked to be compensated fairly, or at least give me some reason why i am not valued the same. the response I received was ""because you exceed your incentive so much, you are already getting paid about as much as your counterparts in the same position, so we cannot give you a raise at this time."" basically telling me that if i did less work, i would qualify for a raise.

This place will tell you as long as you get in your 40 hours thats all they want well thats a joke in itself since I was told that I did not make 40 hours hardly ever yet every single pay check I had consistently had overtime on it so that was a lie.  They tell you basically that no matter what if they need overtime and they can't get people to do it that you will be forced to do it.

They constantly ask you to work overtime, which you should do if you want to keep your job, because when they start to fire people, they look at that as well as productivity. They are so concerned with how productive an employee is (they recently put in more systems to track how much is done in a day/how long you are idle for), that they fail to realize that in-depth tracking of productivity makes even the most productive employees dissatisfied (per psych research). It's also ironic that some of the ways to track productivity actually cuts into how productive one can be if they have to log every order manually. They need CEO approval for a more than 5% raise, so for most employees that is less than a dollar. They are constantly looking for ways to ""restructure"" or consolidate the company. There love mass lay offs. When I was promoted, I was told that I would receive monthly bonuses instead of a raise, which never happened. One person I know that has been working for the compmay for five years has only received one bonus of 5%, and the person was also promoted with no pay increase. The pay is horrible, which makes you feel like they don't value your work/are replaceable. There is limited upward mobility.

Upper Management's overall strategy is not great and they did not seem to value their employees or help grow employee potential.

The corporate culture was that of favoritism, not because you did your job well, but that you went out drinking with the bosses 2 to 3 times a week, and you also went out to smoke cigarettes with them too, all day long. Honestly, the place felt like an insane asylum, backstabbing and spying on others was encouraged and if you didnt, you were gaslighted, big time.  Those who didnt work, did so with impunity.  They were on FB or at a 3 hour lunch, or asleep at their desks for a good amount of the day.  Coming in drunk, sleeping all day at your desk, not doing one lick of work for months on end was perfectly fine to management in this looney bin. Glad I ran for the hills and got out of here."

This is SO typical of executive leadership, they only care about the month to month profit margins. If we are to miss our margin even slightly we are instructed to fire people immediately.

Lender Processing Services Inc. (LPS), a publicly traded mortgage servicing company based in Jacksonville, Fla., has agreed to pay $35 million in criminal penalties and forfeiture to address its participation in a six-year scheme to prepare and file more than 1 million fraudulently signed and notarized mortgage-related documents with property recorders’ offices throughout the United States. The settlement, which follows a felony guilty plea from the chief executive officer of wholly owned LPS subsidiary DocX LLC, was announced today by Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida Robert E. O’Neil

Now after reading that, do you really think that they care about their employees? 

My personal opinion is solely based off of what I experienced at the Westminster, CO site and is from that experience alone. I have to start by saying it is honestly the worst place I have ever worked. I am a very optimistic person too. I remained there for 4 years before resigning all the time thinking (being told) that things would change but they never did. They actually got worse. Over the years, we lost a lot of good people as a result. The management team is still in place however and they are still likely having meetings about having another meeting. I could literally write pages about how dysfunctional that place is but don’t have time nor want to give LPS / ServiceLink that much recognition. Instead, I will give you 5 red flags to consider before you join their ranks: 

1. Lays offs: Lay off a number of people due to LPS's financial disposition. I can remember at least 4 in my 4 years.

2. Technology: Use and work in a application / system that was originally created for a different purpose meaning that it does not fully accommodate for many of LPS's current services. They also scraped a multi-million dollar / multi-year project to create a new system that would work.

3. Management: The managers / supervisors are chaotic at best. I won't even talk about personalities and traits (some quite scary) but will say that I don’t think that I ever had a manager / sup for more than 6-7 months before they were suddenly moved to another department. It was impossible to create good rapport or get any good feedback.

4. Opportunity: There is none. 3 of the 4 years that I worked there, the company was on a hiring freeze (external / internal) and a pay freeze. I had 1 face to face review in 4 years??? A 9 year veteran co-worker told me before I left that every move this person has made has been lateral with the exception of one position.

5. Training: The training is either ineffective or inadequate. A lot of the temps and newbies I talked with stated close to the same thing after getting out on the floor… ""I got a week and a half or two of training, once I hit the floor, it was apparent that the training received had nothing to do with what I am actually doing and now I'm getting yelled at by the supervisor for it and it's not my fault."" Personally, I can say for me, that most things I learned were due to trial and error not training.

What does this all equate to: stress, stress, and more stress."

I assume to help with morale.","Lack of communication from upper management down the line to employees. Not a lot of opportunity for personal growth. A lot of mandatory Overtime.

Layoffs, pay freezes, hiring freezes, (including inter-departmental hiring, so no upward movement). No consistency regarding pay (and therefore lack of fairness). Your pay is strictly based on what you tell them you currently make/made at the job you are looking to leave. I was honest about my at-the-time pay when I applied here and I got the lowest amount possible within the pay range of that department. People started after me who told them they made $3-$4/hr more than I did at their current jobs and they were offered almost $5/hr higher than I did with the same experience and to do the exact same type of work. (This type of position doesn't really have translatable experience that you can bring).  (So this could be considered a pro. Just make sure you negotiate upon hire.) Especially since they have been on a pay freeze for almost three years, and there is no approximate end date. 
Also, they have layoffs all of the time. There are constantly rumors swirling about the job closing. By the time I had left this company, almost every single one of my coworkers were scrambling to find new jobs elsewhere."

Very sexist move, too, as 4 of the 5 people being laid off were women, while the 4 who got to keep their jobs were men.

However we had no idea that when we began offering incentive for participating in the solution, a short sale, that the bank had no intentions of honoring their “solution” which was in place to ""help"" people.  Some could argue with me that these people deserve what’s coming to them as they are the ones who defaulted on their loans, but when the bank is offering a solution that there is no intention of honoring that’s where I get upset.  Do not offer a solution that you do not really plan to honor.  Where is the integrity?  And the company I work for, Servicelink, has no balls.  Since My employment I have worked for this one corporate bank, but the other clients servicelink processed default loans on have all left servicelink, leaving only one entity supplying all of the remaining employees’ salaries.

Poor pay for the amount of work.  I was told $11 per hour and then it changed to $9 an hour when the job offer was made.  

Too much work because management gives clients unrealistic turn around times.  This makes it extremely hard for abstractors, state reps, clerical and order assignors.

Vision crashes all the time and management will make employees stay 1-2 hours late to make up for lost time.  They do not care that you have a family and other obligations outside work, and they go home at their normal time.

Promotions are based on politics rather than talent and the company does not provide adequate training for new management.  This leads to a lot of mistakes, finger pointing, and resentment in the company.

When policy changes are made don't expect anyone to know what's going on.  On manager will tell you to keep doing it the old way, another will yell at you for not doing it the new way.

Expect more work then you can handle, but you better get it done. The new people don't make coffee. Training is extremely general and it generally doesn't help much if you already know how to use a computer and open basic programs and type which leads a lot of the actual training to be done on the floor and takes precious hours away from doing other peoples work and makes you have to explain routine procedures to someone multiple times while not showing that you are stressed or that you have a lot to do. The bank or client that you work for are the boss and you better treat them like it. If they ever mess up and it's clearly their fault, you better still take the blame or you'll have management ringing you out. Some of the management are very helpful, but they are not in the positions that they deserve to be in. The notaries do not know how to follow instructions, even after being counseled repeated times and it creates problems for you that you now have to fix. If you're a closer, expect to work on ay issue with any file and not get any credit for it, there even used to be a sign hanging in the entryway that said something like, ""There is no limit to what a man can achieve, if he doesn't mind who gets the credit for it."" That's motivational, and to top it off, on top of the low base pay, and the low annual raises, they removed all annual bonuses for hourly paid employees and they clearly stated, hourly paid employees. Management still gets a nice bonus at our expense.

462,ServiceLink,Waste of time to work here and stay away!!!,2012-01-18,1.0,Appraisal Reviewer,"The only pro of working here is a paycheck, a non-matching 401(k) program, decent benefits and standard holiday time off.","This place will work you to the bone and expect you to work overtime as soon as you are hired because everyone else is burned out.  Everybody who works here smokes cigarettes non-stop and they have no lives because all they do is work.  Management is incompetent and they do is have daily meetings about team structures, support staff and schedules.  Also, this place is extremely political and expect no pay raise, no holiday bonus and zero promotion opportunities.  They are always hiring because all they all do is lay people off because they think they can find cheaper labor out there.  I always here this company advertising on the radio about job opportunities.  Rule of thumb, anytime you here a company advertising for positions on the radio, stay away.  

I am much happier that I left that place.  I am now in a career oriented company that respects their employees.  Do yourself the favor and spend the extra time to find a real job with a real company.  You have been warned and I am just trying to save you time and aggravation."
463,ServiceLink,Not my worst job but close,2011-12-03,2.0,Senior Developer,Its a fairly stable job.  There is minimal risk of getting fired as long as you do a decent job.   The pay is pretty good and the benefits are OK.  Most of the employees are easy to work worth.,"Horrible management decisions and leadership.  The leaders are either know it all bullies or terrified to make a decision and would rather hang somebody they make do it for them.  They are determined to follow through on a system that doesn't work because of egos.  In a tough market, everyone is leaving at first chance and it is very difficult to get replacements.  Management is oblivious to all of this.  Half the company is from India and Pakistan making communication difficult and creates some cultural issues."

The training is excellent","I started working for National Link, a sister company of ServiceLink based in Coraopolis, PA. The initial job description seemed straightforward and interesting to me. However, my first bad impression (and I should have listened to my gut) was the job interview. I walked in and the person I was supposed to interview with (who was soon promoted to VP of the company) had forgotten to schedule my interview, was double booked, and could not meet with me. So I had an impromptu interview with a gentleman who later turned out to be my boss. He would ask me a question but at no point did he make eye contact or act like he was listening to what I was saying. The interview was short. A few days later, I received a formal acceptance e-mail, but the pay was almost $2 less than the industry average, so I had to negotiate a higher hourly rate, which took another 3 days. 

The training weeks were fairly informative (training was done with ServiceLink). However, once I started in the NationalLink building, I was literally thrown into the center of everything and received very little training of the computer systems and company-specific way of doing things. 

Employees worked 10-12 hour days, just to get the work done. Often, management would inform us of mandatory over time for Saturday the day before.  Management expected us to respond to every e-mail (averaging 150-200 a day) from our client and every phone call (averaging 10-20 an hour) or else it's considered ""bad customer service"" and you can get fired. The turnover rate is outrageous. In one month, I watched 2 team leads and 5 employees come and go in my department, either because they got sick and tired of being yelled at day in and day out or they were fired for ""poor customer service"". The policies ad procedures changed daily and the way management informed us was through a meeting or an e-mail. The actual job requirements far exceeded what was disclosed in the initial job description. 

There is no respect for life outside the work place and you have to fight for time off. There is always a game of favorites and no job security since they can fire you for ""poor customer service"" at any time, regardless of your tenure. They win their unemployment cases by having a broadly-worded handbook which you sign that you read and received at training."
467,ServiceLink,Great place to learn however it is a sink or swim training program,2011-06-23,3.0,,"Very casual attire, flexible work hours and good team members/peers. Fun atmosphere at times. Autonomy. Passion to do a great job.","It is difficult to grow your career. That would involve someone actually noticing whether you do your job well or not. Even if you do your job there is no guarantee there. You never quite know what's coming around the bend-good or bad. Constant state of staffing up's and down's, hiring and laying off. No clear plan to win at times- only the passion to win which unfortunately isn't enough."
468,ServiceLink,Good Learning Ground - Not long term career,2011-06-16,2.0,Information Technology,"Knowledgabe people that you can learn a lot from.  Casual dress code.  (IE Jeans are the norm on all days.)

It's a good place to start out your career and learn fundamentals.","Benefits are subpar for your average IT professional, the office upkeep is poor, parking is difficult and often you are walking from an adjacent building, and turnover is the highest that I've ever heard of at any IT organization.  

Most don't stay past 1 year if they hope to ever increase their salary to within the market range."
469,ServiceLink,An easy place to burn out...,2011-06-11,2.0,Project Manager,"The pay is great, and if you like a job with a lot of change and a continuous flow of work it can be a great place. There are some very good managers that are there that you can learn from and have the ability to interact with. It is a very diverse culture, so you have the opportunity to learn more about someone outside of your normal circle.","Very HIGH industry turnover! While having a continuous flow of work is a pro, the con is that the timeline to complete the work isn't always reasonable. The expectation seems to be to consistently work 50+ hours in a week. The work/life balance doesn't seem to be much more than an afterthought. Senior Management doesn't always lead properly. The executive staff is knowledgeable, but there is too much I, I, me, me and not enough team work. So finger pointing and anger between business units is very common. While change is inevitable, the way that change is handled isn't done very well. So you seem to do a lot of things to do, in the end, nothing."
