There was very little recourse for treating customers poorly and if you hit your incentive there was even less recourse for your bad behavior or just down right negligence.

 I do believe if people aren't happy, they are responsible for looking for another job or choosing their attitude. That said, some do feel stuck with no options, and that decision still doesn't change the fact that it's not a healthy culture where people can thrive.

They long for the glory days when the company was Merrill Lynch.,"This company is in complete disarray starting from the top down to the security personnel. I spent 5 years with Seterus and I have never worked with a company that has such blatant  disregard to their FTEs. They would rather bring in a new contractor and pay them 10K-20K more in salary than reward their long time FTEs who do the same job. Ironically, they even have the underpaid FTEs train the new contractors. Talk about disgruntle employees!   This practice is commonly know within all Seterus departments. FTEs and managers were wanting to resign or quite so they could be hired as a contractor. There has been a massive turnover starting with the President, Managing Directors, AVPs , Team Leads and general staff. 

There was a resource action in 2014 that resulted in 160+ FTE and contractor positions being eliminated. The employee morale and culture was so bad that vendors were not wanting to source for any open positions.  

Human Resources, Change Management and Learning & Development  would boast about career opportunities but make no mistake there was no real program in place for career development let alone the opportunity to job shadow within another department. These departments experienced constant turnover with no consistent direction to the employees. 

HR is suppose to be the source of truth with ethics and integrity, but this is not the case. If you ever have a problem, you'll get passed around so much do to the fact that no one wants to take any responsibility or ownership.

No room for advancwment without sacrificing your home/ personal life. None to minimal pay increases. Expect to make less then the new person that they hire (that does your exact same job) and you get to train them. All seasoned employees have the saying the longer you stay here, the less you make in your band. The executives (AVP and VP's) drive this behavior and implement processes in departments that set employees and team leads up for failure. Executives ( AVP's and up) blame team leads for all department issues, use the team leads as escape goats for issues that the executives know about, but yet the executives do nothing! Money making is more important then being compliant. Employees are volunteered and have to support other departments work loads. This is done in order to supplement the lack of employee to work ratios. Full time employees are easily replaceable with contractors. This is the culture that IBM, HR and the VP's have spread down to the employees. Due to the AVP and VP's leading by fear, this provides the average Seterus employee with an unstable outlook on their job security, poor morale and a toxic work environment. Seterus employees are told to take breaks and lunches, but this is impossible with unattainable goals and tasks they can't accomplish in the normal eight hour day.   Team leads are over worked and employees do not have a work life balance. Employees and middle management ( team leads) are getting burned out.

128,Seterus,Never really found a balance between Client Expectations and Customer Expectations,2014-06-30,3.0,,"I started with Seterus in  2008 in Beaverton OR when Seterus was still owned by Merrill Lynch and operating under Wilshire Credit Coporation. I stayed with the company through the transition to Bank of America, and ultimately IBM under the Lender Business Process Services (LBPS) moniker.  My time with the company ended in early 2014 as a result of a resource action no longer requiring the need of my teams job role.

The Company is not a bad company per se.  The company at one time was a great place to work, the people were friendly, we genuinely wanted to help the borrowers and actually were able to, and we were compensated well.  The downfall, to me, started with the IBM acquisition.  IBM purchased Wilshire from Bank of America with Fannie Mae providing the loans to IBM for servicing.  IBM took Wilshire and rapidly expanded it, more than it could handle it felt like.  We almost doubled the staffing in the Beaverton location, increased the size of the Salem office, and even opened an entire new office located in between Durham and Raleigh North Carolina at IBM's facilities in Research Triangle Park.  

My Role at Seterus/Wilshire started in Processing Paperwork, I would work with attendees at the numerous outreach events across the country.  I would process the paperwork provided and review it to determine how their loan could be restructured, ultimately I moved into more of a collectors position, working with newly delinquent accounts to avoid Foreclosure.  The belief that the company wants loans to foreclose is simply not true.  There's more money for the client, Fannie Mae, in having borrowers current and performing on their loans than there is in foreclosing on a property after spending 1000's of dollars to do so and selling the home at a loss compared to the original loan given.  Seterus, along with other Fannie Mae loan servicers, is graded upon numerous metrics, one of those being keep loans current and rolling them back from past due to current.  At the end of my career with Seterus I was assisting homeowners who had exhausted all options sell the property or turn the home back over to the investor and be released from their loan, again to avoid Foreclosure.  

To go back however to the downturn of Seterus, it would have to be when the RTP location was opened, I was sent to the RTP location for a month to train new hires on the collection role and the different options that are offered.  It was obvious being at that location that the emphasis on training was lacking and the goal was to pay people as little as possible, get them on the phones collecting as soon as possible, and fit as many people as possible into the classes.  When the site went live it was horrible, the stories of the blunders RTP was having as well as customers noticing it as well and simply asking at the start of a call, are you in North Carolina or are you in Oregon?  

As a result of this there then grew a rift within the company itself, pitting the employees in Oregon against the North Carolina employees, each viewing the others as not competent, or creating a bigger burden on the other.  This then began to seep into the locations themselves, with departments and groups isolating themselves, viewing contact with the other departments or groups as problematic or burdensome.  It resulted in morale going down,   On top of this the higher ups were growing more and more distant with their direct reports and management above them started imposing archaic guidelines on the employees that made it a cesspool of dissatisfaction.  Leaving paper on your desk, not locking a drawer, not locking your desktop if you stepped away could all be grounds for termination.  Ultimately at the end of my employment there it was burdensome to come into work, the anxiety experienced was devastating.  People were on medical leave because of the stress from the workplace.  This didn't go by unnoticed with our customers, numerous times you'd hear the frustration in the voices of the employees, the customers responding with their own anger and frustration only bringing us down further.  You could cut the negativity with a knife in the air it was so thick and vile.

I don't know ultimately where this company will end up, as far as Fannie Mae is concerned Seterus is normally always within the top 5 of their ""STAR"" rating of Fannie Mae servicers and the client is happy.  However the working conditions are poor and the compensation isn't good any longer.  If you're hired through a staffing agency you can almost expect to never be converted to a full time employee as it's easier to pay a staffing agency than it is to pay you vacation, insurance, holidays.  The motto of the place is get the most done as cheap as possible and they take it to extremes.

Also I never even touched on this, even though Seterus is owned by IBM, and you have IBM benefits and and such, do not expect any involvement with IBM.  The 2 are separated as far as they could possibly be, Seterus is the child who ran away from home at 15 and hasn't called home in 20 years and IBM is the dieing Dad wondering where it all went wrong.","The negativity within the company is mind blowingly horrific, the stress you'll go through is a true test of character."

155,Seterus,Would not recommend at all.,2013-08-02,1.0,Delinquency Management Early Stage,I have met some good people & IBM can be used to look good.,"There are so many.  I have been working for Seterus for almost 4 years. I started with them when it was still Wilshire.  When they were Wilshire they cared about the employee as well as the borrower but now it is all about getting the payment and reability to pay by the Borrower.  We are required to ask questions of the Borrower that no other collection agency would ask because frankly it isn't our business. No regular raises, constant mandatory overtime, IBM doesn't really care about the employees, new employees being hired at almost 1.50$-2.00$ more an hour then tenured agents.  Systems are really bad they are constantly going down.  Basically the company only cares about meeting their bottom line and does not care about the stress or emotional distress they put on their employees.  I have seen a lot of good, loyal, tenured agents let go over the littlest thing even though they were good enough a few months ago."
156,Seterus,"It's a job, nothing more.",2013-07-31,3.0,Loss Mitigation Agent,"There are some genuine good people working here willing to help, It pays the bills but don't stop looking elsewhere","Depressing cubicle farm, lazy/inept management, We'll deal with it later attitude."
157,Seterus,A Depressing Collection Agency,2013-07-26,1.0,Middle Manager,"You can leverage IBM brand, that's about it.","Don't get fooled, you're not going to work at IBM. If you happen to encounter a real IBM employee, they will go to great lengths to remind you that you are a seterus team member, not an IBMer. Instead, you work in an IBM delivery center - which is a euphamism for collection agency.

But getting there is half the fun! Unless you arrive at the facility before dawn, you will enjoy walking 2 and 1/2 miles from overflow parking. And since you're in Oregon, your walk will be enhanced by the constant driving rain.

The organization is run by a team whose accomplishments are little more remarkable than having once managed a call center.  

And then there's the pay, for financial services (possibly the lowest paying industry in so-called professional services) it's decent, I guess. If you have your bona fides, a degree or are a professional of any calliber then you SHOULD do better. A JD/MBA/PMP/BSA can expect to make 40-70% more elsewhere. 

Compensation increases (""raises"") happen about once every three years and average 1.7 - 3.4%. So spreading this out, you can expect an annual raise in the amount of 0.6 - 1.2% - sweet. Bonuses for exempt staff are not terrible, at or around 10% for the highest rated. 

Seterus offers the Miata of benefit plans, poor performing and overpriced. A family of four can expect to pay $600 - $800 out of their pre-tax income. Unless you have a giant growth on your forehead you can probably do better buying your own insurance directly.

Bottom line: seterus is a collection agency. It's probably not a bad place to start out if you're desperate, but for established professional it's definitely the right place to take your career if you want to watch it slowly die."
158,Seterus,Top Down Change is Desperately Needed,2013-07-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,IBM brand and benefits.  Large work station.  Two  monitors.,"I worked for Seterus for almost two years and most of the time mandatory overtime was required.  Went in at 9:00 am and got off at 9:00 pm with a 30 minute lunch and 3 breaks.  This is great if you have no family or outside life and need to make extra cash.  However, the way overtime is paid you will lose half of your overtime pay in taxes.  There was a mandatory training requirement, however, you almost had to beg for time to complete the training.  Some managers suggested that you come in on your day off to complete the mandatory training.  Employee suggestions went unheard.  Management does not care about high turn-over.  The place is overrun with managers who do not know how to manage -- at all  I sit in a meeting with managers who grouped together a team of employees to generate ideas for staff incentives.  We worked hard and came up with ideas that management agreed were good, low cost incentives that would benefit the workplace.  NONE - ZERO were implemented.  This place needs a top down change.  However, I sincerely doubt that will happen.  Take a job here if you have no other options.  Otherwise run for your life...."

Moreover, people will seem to be nice and friendly but beware - the size of their nice smiles are directly proportional to the knives they can stab you with in the back.  This is probably because of the undercurrent of fear, insecurity and stress that permeates the workplace that people cover up with their smiles and nice talk."

Broken furniture. Very few office supplies supplied to workers. Understaffed and clumsy IT delivery to users. Poor parking situation (car was dinged after driving there twice). Thievery. Disorganized projects. Leveraging worst business practices as the standard for the whole organization. Threats of termination used to squelch innovation. Official adoption of new processes and technology was very slow. You cannot take pride in the product. Owned by IBM but not an IBM company.

179,Seterus,It's a job; it's not much help for a career but it will keep the bills paid better than unemployment.,2012-04-03,2.0,,"There are some good people here, as there are most places.  The benefits are fair, nothing great but comparable to most other employers.  Getting hired on full time means quite a bit of PTO. (although I've heard recent hires get quite a bit less than the 21 days which used to be the standard offer... it may be down to 10-14 days)

Expectations and performance are a bit low.  Very little effort is required & 95% of the time you'll exceed expectations without much exertion... like I said in the summary, it's a job and not a career.","Expectations and performance are low.

Accept a job here if you need one but don't stop looking; things are picking up and if you have any kind of decent education and/or experience, you can find better.  You can tread water here for a while but unless you know exactly what you're in for, there's no reason to expect things will get better.  Do not accept a sub-par offer you can't live with long-term with the expectation that your hard work will improve your situation because you'll be disappointed.  Oh, they'll readily promote you & dump the responsibility on you if you're competent but the compensation will (severely) lag.  I suppose if you desperately need the experience, this will be the price to pay.

Parking is pretty bad but you eventually get used to it.  Arrive before 7am and you get on-site parking, after 7 and you have a bit of a walk but to be honest, I've come to enjoy it. (1/4 to 1/3 mile walk from the overflow lots)  Unless you really, really hate walking, this isn't as bad as some people might have you think.

No more company provided coffee!  But considering the quality of the coffee that was provided, this also isn't nearly as much a loss as some might think. :)

You'll be working for a mortgage servicer.  :)  If you've never had a mortgage, just know that NOBODY likes their mortgage servicer, you won't be proud to work here... go check the facebook and note how NOBODY claims to work for Seterus... 1 person ""liked"" it and it looks like they subsequently deleted their account, lol.  Most employees I know claim ""IBM"" as their employer.  I'm not sure how much this matters, but its interesting."

183,Seterus,Absolutely Horrible!!,2012-01-14,1.0,Delinquency Management Specialist (Collections Representative ),Your peers are very supportive and we try to encourage one another in order to improve the overall office moral.,"The lack of respect, appreciation and communication from upper managment is horrible. Regardless of the employees efforts to meet the unreasonable goals promised to the clients by management, it is never good enough. The schedules and mandatory overtime forced upon the employees at the last minute (literally) is unacceptable. There are process and policy changes every week, most of which took effect a week prior to the employees receiving notice. So far, in the past three months, the company has lost 1 VP, 3 team leads, and over 25 employees and due to lose more. The employees are verbally abused by the customers (due to the unethical acts of the company) and ""bull-whipped"" by management. The employees are over worked, exhausted, frustrated and fed up with the lack of appreciation. Majority of the employees were told they were being hired for inbound customer service postions, but once they completed ""training"" it turned out to be a straight collections position. More than half of the representatives are contractors who were told after 90 days they will be considered for conversion to regular IBM employees - this is not the case! 75% of the reps have been employed here for over a year and are still contracted! Management turns a blind eye and deaf ear to the complaints of their staff and respond with a simple ""get over it"" attitude!"

Would rather fire someone than fix a problem -- seemed to think he had a problem finding good employees when in fact it was an issue with the manager. The quality of their codebase was also terrible. Sparsely populated matrixes all over the database. Poorly tested code. Deployments via one-off batch files. The list goes on.
