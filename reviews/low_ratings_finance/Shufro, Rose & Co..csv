0,"Shufro, Rose & Co.","Welcome to the ""New Shufro""",2018-08-31,1.0,Administrative Assistant,Nice offices and friendly building staff.,"Where does one begin?  Its' a nightmare, toxic office environment promoted by Partner/Management who see each other and office staff as threats. The Partners have chastised staff because they ordered the ""wrong"" envelopes for a mailing. The ""Great Envelope Meeting of 2017"" is now Shufro legend and when I tell others about this they don't believe me. What idiots, no wonder their assets are dwindling faster then their integrity.  Not very nice people who take pleasure in seeing others suffer."
1,"Shufro, Rose & Co.",RUN A-W-A-Y,2018-08-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,It is located in NYC where transportation to their offices is accessible.,"They are a bunch of clowns who can not work together as a team and agree on 1 decision without spending meetings upon meetings on nonsense.  
Their client retention is dropping like dead flies. 
They hire girls who have zero experience in the industry, yet pretend to be a ""know it all"" type. 
They treat certain employees with major favoritism, which is disgusting. You either treat all the same, or do not treat at all (you would think stuff happen behind closed doors with all that special treatment that is received).
There is NO career movement in the company, you will stay in your hired position until you either quit, get let go, or retire. 
Within such a small company you would think that teamwork would be of an importance. The only important aspect for them is how to screw each other. 
One of the partners, who shall remain nameless, is one of the biggest a-holes you will ever meet in your life, sweet as honey when you first meet, yet will make sure to blame you for anything if something were to go sideways."
2,"Shufro, Rose & Co.",Thoughts From a Current Employee,2018-05-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Shufro Rose has a very strong legacy as a firm.  In fact, the firm is celebrating its 80th year anniversary this year.  There are not many firms that have been in business as long.  The firm has a family feel that is a result of its long history and intimate working environment.  Shufro Rose takes a relationship driven approach to serving its clients in all aspects of their financial life.  As a result, there is a deep understanding of the families that we serve and a connection to multiple generations (in some cases 4th & 5th generation).

This year, Shufro Rose built out and moved to a brand new office in midtown Manhattan, which is very easily accessible from all modes of transportation.  The new office is equipped with the latest technology, modern décor and collaborative workspaces.

The firm has begun to develop a very entrepreneurial culture, empowering all employees to take ownership of and drive important projects and activities.  The firm is beginning to focus much more on career development and training opportunities for employees.","Most of the partners have come up through the ranks within the firm, spanning a period of multiple decades and having performed all kinds of responsibilities during their tenure.  Therefore, it’s somewhat natural to have difficulty in relinquishing control of day to day tasks and letting the employees take ownership.  All major decisions are made via a consensus driven approach, which ultimately results in decisions being made that are in the best interest of the firm, but this approach does take a little more time to come to fruition..  While no one can realistically expect a utopian workplace, as disagreements and personality conflicts do occur in almost every workplace, these can be sometimes more noticeable in a smaller workplace like ours (20 employees) as opposed to within the context of a larger organization."
