5,Sidoti & Company,ANALYST,2018-10-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The firm provides professional development for those inexperienced in equity research .,"Wow...what not to say. As a former employee who has moved on to greener pastures (where companies actually understand the concept of equity research) this firm is a laughingstock across Wall St. ""Management "" is a joke, captained by the company's feckless leader Peter Sidoti. Peter  is an insecure, emotionally unstable, out of touch, loudmouth,  blowhard bully (and this is being kind). His petulant and random outbursts and tantrums severely damage team morale and undermine a constructive working atmosphere, which is a shame because the firm does have some talent.

President Marie Conway is a do nothing sycophant who is basically a glorified editor  making $1mn+ a year (check the figures on the co's FAILED IPO filing). She provides absolutely no positive guidance to new employees and is on her way out the door at 4:05 to catch her pilates clsss.

Base pay is an absolute joke compared to reputable  firms and  bonuses are promised but never fully paid, as there is always some excuse about ""business conditions "" or caveats on performance. 

Net/net this place is a junkshow that should be avoided at all costs.  Newbies would be better served studying and paying personally for CFA exam to get foot in door than entering these depths of hell."

New revenue streams (CSR and conferences) are helping.",Sell-side equity research is admittedly a tough business.
7,Sidoti & Company,A great opportunity,2018-10-08,5.0,Institutional Sales,"I started at Sidoti when I was 24. Our Founder and CEO Peter Sidoti has given me a tremendous amount of opportunity. Sidoti & Co provides research and valuable insight on profitable public equities that for one reason or another, are ignored by the rest of the sell-side community. We run a solid, niche business. Peter created the firm in 1999 and along with our President Marie Conway, has built a brand that is unrivaled in the micro and small-cap world. Our core analysts do a great job finding and covering underfollowed growth companies which our sales force utilizes to generate value with our institutional clients across the US. I am lucky to be a part of an organization that I feel provides a differentiated product in an area of the equity research market where few other firms will go. Peter has continued to emphasize our focus on what we do best: small-cap. We have many smart and talented employees who make my life easier on a daily basis. As an institutional sales rep, I have the opportunity to work with two groups of very bright and accomplished individuals. I interact daily with the portfolio managers, analysts and other employees of our mutual fund, hedge fund and pension fund client base. I also travel regularly with the C-level executives of our companies under coverage. All of these people are much smarter than I am. I try to remind myself often how much knowledge surrounds the business we run. I place a great deal of value on the opportunity to be around and learn from professional investors, company executives, our equity research analysts and our senior management.","Change in the world of finance is perpetual and unfortunately, we are in a period of headwinds. There are a number of secular topics facing equity research - MiFID, the rise of low cost index funds/ ETFs, and continued consolidation in many industries which has led to a reduction in the number of public companies. Sidoti is focused on winning profitably in our core business and also changing and growing in new areas to provide stability. But we need to move faster and truly align incentives with this transition. During this period of change we must do all that we can to incentivize our best people to not only stay, but also improve. We all need to do more and expand our reach because that is how we will take share now and when things turn. And one day, when we least expect it, they will."

12,Sidoti & Company,A Great Experience,2016-09-16,4.0,,I have been at Sidoti for 11 years.  The amount I have learned and the relationships I have built over that span are invaluable.  The biggest pro for Sidoti is the exposure you get to the equity research industry.  The industry is in a transitional period and thus times have been difficult but I expect Sidoti will manage the downturn and emerge better at the other end.,The biggest con would be the structural change in the equity research business.
13,Sidoti & Company,What a shame,2016-08-09,1.0,,"There are still some very experienced, talented analysts left at Sidoti. I hope they eventually find a decent home. They helped to build a firm that was once one to be proud of.","Unfortunately, the fine employees of this company have to labor mightily under the toxic yoke of an unstable tyrant. Unreasonable dictates, constant threats and a steady drumbeat of psychological abuse reign in lieu of even-keeled leadership and adult communication. Childish emotional outbursts create a volatile and anxiety-ridden workplace environment that undermine the staff's ability to function professionally and enjoy a healthy human existence. Management wields the weak job market like a cudgel to bludgeon the staff into a malleable mash of poor collective self-esteem. These crude, Stalinesque tactics may keep the workflow moving but at the great expense of many employees becoming clinically depressed, in my view. Given management's ham-handed and psychologically grotesque labor practices, this company is badly in need of a Union!"

You have the opportunity to assume a lot of responsibility immediately and the small size of the firm allows for much interaction and learning with management, senior analysts, salespeople, and traders. The compensation is performance based and everyone gets a fair shot at being paid a bonus. The CEO, Peter Sidoti, is very driven and passionate about the company and his employees. He wants everyone to be successful and his door is always open. Management has done a great job weathering the difficult market environment and the company is still very much in a growth mode.",Management is sometimes not aggressive enough in terminating under-performing employees.
15,Sidoti & Company,A fair review (equity research analyst),2016-05-22,2.0,Equity Research Analyst,"A lot of people have reviewed sidoti. Most of it is true, but you should know this going in. First and foremost, this is a place that will give you a shot when no one else will (that was my scenario as an equity analyst- every potential employer wanted experience and I needed an in.) I was hired late 2015, and let go may 2016 along with 15 other analysts. Most of them in their first years as well. Yea the firm is unstable, yes peter is crazy with no business sense and no control of his temper. He is trying to save his company by switching to paid research, something that was approved by finra the day they let go 15 analysts even though they told us it was because revenue was down. It wasn't personal. I think the changes might be good for the future of the company as no one was paying for our research before. The company was built around non deal road shows. Quality of research means absolutely nothing at sidoti, all about quantity and non deal road shows. There is also no guidance, you are on your own team, and most supervisory analysts and definitely the editors are not there to help you improve your research abilities. This is not somewhere you go to learn from someone else, you learn it yourself and you are thrown in the water. Sink or swim. This place is what it is. You should be well aware of the aspects I mentioned. Sidoti was a great place for me because i needed the experience to advance my career. Nothing wrong with that, but you should understand this isn't a place to learn from someone, it's somewhere that will let you get on the job experience, for better or worse. You also have good work life balance/freedom. I read someone said benefits aren't good but the healthcare was very good coverage, but nothing else, no 401k match. Not even coffee or drinks in the fridge... Not even tissues!","Quantity over quality. Peter is volatile. Also the sales department is not run well at all, the database they keep for clients might as well be a random number generator, sorry but if I wrote a note and someone said they were very interested, then we publish a note later, I should be calling that client who was interested!! This is not a good place if you want structure, apprenticeship, stability, money. Oh yea, they don't pay well at all. Other employees told me bonuses are rarely paid at all."
16,Sidoti & Company,Honest review without the BS,2016-05-17,1.0,Equity Research Analyst,"Location is probably the only pro as its in the Chanin building with underground access to the trains and GCS. Other than that, there are some good folks working at Sidoti.","Peter is exactly what his reputation is: toxic, deceitful, and inept. Sidoti hires and hires and then fires the next day. Peter will bad mouth employees who leave but lacks the courage to face the employees he fires. Peter has this notion that putting on really poorly managed and executed conferences with micro cap stocks is the way to make money. He doesn't realize pushing analysts to bring companies to these horrible Sidoti conferences hurts relationships. The pay is below average, WAY BELOW. You would make more as an associate at a boutique shop than at Sidoti. There is no matching 401K, benefits cost too much and the fact that you have to deal with Peter should definitely be considered. I have never in my life met someone so dishonest, no wonder clients make fun of him behind his back and also refuse to pay. No one on the street likes Peter, which is fine, this isn't a business to make friends. But the fact that no one respects Peter or his firm makes a huge difference. Every analyst, trader, salesman who are any good, leave Sidoti like the wind."

2. You have a fair amount of autonomy to choose your universe, subject to which stocks are available and worth covering.
3. You will learn how to be an equity analyst by doing, without having to toil in anonymity under a marquee analyst. 
4. You will be able to build buy side and corporate management relationships.","1. Management is inept, out of touch with the realities of the business,  and abusive.
2. You will receive minimal training, little guidance, and 95% of the feedback you get will be negative. 
3. Management moves the goalposts to avoid paying bonuses.
4. President and head of research Marie Conway's demeanor and management style are less reminiscent of a wall st research head than that snippy English teacher we all had.
5. Peter Sidoti is manic depressive, has anger management issues, and is unrealistic / delusional about the state of the equity business and his firm's competitive position in it. He routinely cuts off top clients because he feels they aren't paying enough, and he simultaneously touts his firm's product as superior while trashing his analysts, all the while not really giving his analysts the tools to develop an edge in the business."

25,Sidoti & Company,A lunatic asylum with a broker-dealer registration,2015-08-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great sitcom material. Titles, anybody?","Most of the reviews below focus on Peter Sidoti, the CEO, and the working environment. However, if you are joining the company as an analyst you will be reporting to the company’s President, not Peter, so I thought it would be appropriate to say a few words on working with her. 

First, do not expect much in terms of training. Most of the guidance you will receive from her as a supervisory analyst will be “linguistic” such as making sure that you put double spacing between the sentences, do not use the word “believe” (offensive to God?) and do use the word “rich” (appealing to Wall Street?). On the positive side, you can get away with horrendous modeling, logical or valuation blunders. 

As a boss, she is a pedantic, bitter, and insecure control freak, who can not accept her failures and has made a career out of blaming her subordinates for sabotaging the company and her selfless efforts to create a successful research product. She likes to keep people under her thumb and fearful, presumably because she does not want you to question her authority, competence and methods or to figure out that the only reason she is in a managerial position is because of her personal friendship with Peter. Lamentably, she does that by constantly bombarding her employees with professionally inappropriate, derogatory remarks. That seems to be the only way she knows how to motivate “lazy and stupid” people (i.e. you, potential or current Sidoti employee) to produce."

27,Sidoti & Company,Peter's ego has gotten too big...we're taking on water...bail out! bail out!,2015-03-29,1.0,Analyst,"The pure comedy that is Peter Sidoti. 

That is the great thing about working at Sidoti. Watching him scream at some poor soul for no reason whatsoever. Watching him get on the podium and throw a tantrum at how great he and his firm is and that nobody is paying for his ""product"". Watching him taking accounts away from his best sales guys who've been with him for 10 years because he decided they were doing to well for themselves. Watching the new guy who doesn't cover any stocks get a bonus double the size of yours. Watching Peter and Marie (CEO) just completely lie to your face or go back on their word time and time again. Hearing everyone's misery in the bathroom and kitchen. Hearing Peter declare his firm the small cap ""axe on the street"". Watching food fall out of Peter's mouth in a lunch meeting. Hearing managers tell you to get the hell out as fast as you can. Hearing Peter already lost a lot of that ""hedge fund"" money he was handling. Hearing the company failed its audit. Hearing bonuses were going to be smaller after Peter took money out of the firm to pay for Hurricane Sandy damage at his Fire Island home. Peter then telling everyone that he doesn't take a nickel out of the firm because he does this as a hobby (Uh huh). The manager who would rather step in front of a cab then you ask him a question about your company/report/model (Keep counting the miserable days to retiremen palt!). Hearing Peter was going to China to hear later he was having lap band surgery. Counting the amount of times Peter says ""okay"" or ""in terms of where it is"" in a meeting. Watching Peter's shirt grow increasingly patchy with sweat stains on a mild Spring day. 

It is literally hilarious to work at this firm the few and far between moments when you're not getting your balls broken. You have got to find the humor in the small, everyday things or else you'll want to blow your brains out.","Sell-side equity research is a dead business if you have no other service to offer. Any firm, no matter the size, that only specializes in equity research will soon suffer the same fate that Sidoti is suffering now. It is a useless and obsolete business. Peter often blames those of us who have left as to why the firm is collapsing but it's really his own fault. He's never evolved. He's continued to run the business like it's the 80's and the internet doesn't exit on a widespread basis."
28,Sidoti & Company,"A ""How To"" Guide For Maximizing Your Exit Opportunities (And Staying Employed While You Look)",2015-03-26,1.0,Equity Research Analyst,"Since other posts on this site have painted a pretty accurate picture of the corporate culture at Sidoti (and why everyone has left or is trying to leave), I will attempt to aid those looking to better their exit opportunities. Since I was an analyst at Sidoti, this post will be analyst centric.

As other reviews have noted, working at Sidoti puts you in a position to meet and/or speak with CEO's, CFO's, buy-side analysts and money managers. It should be your primary goal to develop these relationships. Analysts, play nice with your corporate contacts. If you are a BUY, ask leading questions on the earnings calls that reinforce your thesis and then privately follow up for the accounting questions and other points of clarification. If you are a NEUTRAL, lay out in your note (and even better, in person) the steps  the company needs to make that gets them to a BUY. Not only will this help you out when you need a reference for your next gig, but playing nice gives you a better shot at a putting marketing days on the calendar, which is the ultimate ""yah, I really want to be here and am working so hard"" smokescreen. When you do get marketing days, tell the sales rep he is staying home. Take advantage of every opportunity to build those relationships. Strong relationships with corporate contacts yielded me excellent references and even a few discussions about working for them. 

Save your enthusiasm for your highest conviction calls. Make your buy-side clients look good enough, and they suddenly know about that seat at hedge fund X that just opened up. If your next job is on the sell-side, YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO WRITE. If you are just getting your feet wet in this category, seek out help from your team leader. Lead with the conclusion, put the ""what we are paying attention to/focusing on"" details in the bullets. Yes the structure of the notes can be rigid, but if there is one thing the editors are uniformly correct on is you must NAIL THE BULLETS. This is how I got my next job.","How to deal with Peter: 
If you encounter him walking the halls, in the kitchen area or at your desk, make small talk with him. Tell him you ""just handed in a report and have two more coming soon"", ask ""where did the other half of Peter go?"", etc. One of the saddest facts about the place is that the big man runs the ship and because his emotion and temper can change direction as quickly as the wind, so too can your employment status. If you can either lay low (which can be difficult with the shrinking headcount) or get him to like you  which may necessitate a heavy dose of puckering up to backside (even after surgery, you can't miss it), you can push back the day day he tells you to walk the plank. 

Dealing with Marie: Light up the stat sheet. Its as simple as that. Be on the call (yes, even with previews). Put days on the calendar. Try (I know, its a pain) to get your 3 reports in by month 5 of the half; sacrifice some quality if you have to, but just get the reports in as you can always tune them up in editing. You don't even need to get in early or stay late, just hit the metrics and you keep Marie at bay. Also, come bonus/review time, padded stats are your best friend. 

Finally, the biggest mistake you can make is letting anyone sniff out that you are actually interviewing. It is an open secret that most everyone would like to work somewhere else, and some will be more vocal than others. DO NOT let Peter or Marie catch wind that you are looking. If they even suspect you are looking, they will start building the case against you. That case is the justification they need to fire you for cause. Peter is a very emotional guy. He takes it personally that you would rather work for someone else ESPECIALLY if you take a non-senior position at another sell-side firm. He will take pleasure in marking up your U-5 and attempting to impair your ability to work in the industry. Again, this is why it is so important that you build strong client and corporate relationships (and lighting up the stat sheet gives them less ammo to build a case)."
29,Sidoti & Company,Unfortunate culture destroying a possible success story.,2015-03-10,1.0,Anonymous,"Sidoti has good scale in research with a lot of names under coverage, which is great if you're are trying to sell equity research. For an unlicensed/inexperienced analyst, you can get licensed and some experience writing research.","Let me say that I had more access to management than most. I can't say more without making it obvious. The culture here is about fear and intimidation. Employees are paid fairly well, but they hate their jobs, hate coming to work, and wish they could leave but money keeps them there and that's about it. In my opinion, all recent reviews from current or recently former employees show you what happens when you have a negative culture. People here are miserable and it shows in their work and how they interact with fellow employees. This is a very dictatorially managed organization. Everyone just hopes not to get yelled at on any given day. It's bad. There is no input from employees: they don't care about what you have to say. Employees are considered disposable. Marie Conway is overworked and bitter, but that's because she designs the process to work that way. I feel sorry for the employees remaining."

He realized this a bit late though and is trying to cash out via a very lofty IPO attempt. His plan as he stated to the entire firm: 1. Cut heads 2. Go public 3. Head to Texas to start a ""hedge fund"" with $3 million dollars. Unfortunately for him, he's driven this company too far into the ground. Equity research is a stagnant industry these days. It doesn't help when your CEO is a man who is more focused on his ego than evolving his business.

Nobody got a bonus because the company is doing so poorly yet here's how the top did:
​
2013                   Salary      Bonus        Other        Total

Head trader         $250k      $550k                         $800k

President does nothing. She's paid to create havoc by attempting to scare analysts by berating them. The trading desk is carrying five traders....for NO VOLUME. Peter has said he can't cut any during the layoffs because they will all quit. Gutless.

From the firm's S-1: ""Our ability to retain our professionals and recruit additional professionals is critical to the success of our business, and our failure to do so, the likelihood of which may be higher than for our competitors, may adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.""

Every. Single. Senior. Analyst. Has. Left.

Again from the S-1: ""We depend on Mr. Sidoti and the loss of his services would have a material adverse effect on us.""

CEO is in poor health.

We should've seen the writing on the wall when the company stopped providing drinks and then coffee cups to save pennies. He also moved the company into a new office space and signed a month-to-month lease, showing that even he doesn't have confidence in the business."

Sidoti will welcome you with open arms.  I thought it was funny that one of the main qualifying questions was ""do you have a driver's license.""","The firm has turned over 80% in the past year and a half.  The remaining 20% is not the top 20% of the firm.   

ANALYSTS:  of the top 20 analysts at the firm (as of just 1 year ago), 17 have already left.  At that time, Sidoti had 500+ names under coverage.   That list has shrunk to 300.  The remaining 3 are seeking to leave.  

SALES:  Just 6 months ago, there were 6 regional sales managers.  5 of 6 have left the firm for higher quality shops and making considerably higher pay.  The remaining 1 will not be able to get a job anywhere else.   

CEO:  All of the reviews that you have read on this site are pretty right on.  Instead of re-emphasizing those points, I will give you an anecdote that will provide deep insight.  On the 3rd Friday in June of this year, Peter Sidoti stands up in front of the firm after the morning call.   I will paraphrase this (and it is pretty close).  ""Guys, I am pretty pissed of for four reasons this morning.  One, yesterday's volume on the desk was nothing to be proud of.  Two, I found out this week that a salesman, a person that I treated very well, did his best to delete all of his files before leaving.  Three, I went out of my way to keep a micro caps sales guy in a job (salesguy  was saved from being layed off when Micro cap was being shut down) and he resigned this morning.  And lastly, a female analyst decided to quit and I am really pissed off that I could not fire her first.""    This is a true story.  Here is the best part.  The female analyst, who was considered to be a good analyst by research and sales left the firm to be with her mother in South Korea who is dying.  What kind of sick person would even say something like this?  Nobody respects him.  He tries to motivate out of fear only.  He is not a leader."
34,Sidoti & Company,"1 star, at best",2014-11-05,1.0,Equity Research Analyst,Access to c-level mgmt teams and the opportunity to build relationships with PMs (which could hopefully lead to job opportunities),"The CEO is an irrational, stubborn person who cares more about quantity (stocks under coverage) and puffing out his chest to clients than he does about the employees he verbally chides on a weekly basis.  Turnover is extremely high and 90% of all the talent has already left; almost solely a result of the CEO's behavior and abuse.  Upcoming IPO leaves much to be desired; a veiled attempt of the CEO trying to cash out of a dying business that he single-handedly imploded."
35,Sidoti & Company,Caveat Emptor,2014-10-28,1.0,Equity Research Analyst,"Sidoti & Company used to be a good place to work, where analysts could get a start in the business and see their compensation increase as they ramped up coverage...","...however, over the past few years the industry has been plagued by lower trading volumes and deflationary trading prices...and in Sidoti's case, incompetent management. 

Employees have been faced with lower bonuses as a direct result of the CEO's ego, longing to be the largest provider of small cap research, despite market conditions and firm profitability. The compensation destruction was accelerated by the CEO's decision to expand into micro cap research without any due diligence done to see how many analysts micro cap commissions could support. 

While the firm has always experienced a high level of turnover, Sidoti was unable to pay a bonus in 1H:14 and now it's SENIOR analysts and sales people are leaving.  Although this may reduce costs near-term, the key factor will be the revenue fallout from the departures as clients realize the situation.

Hard to imagine, but moral has hit a new low following the company's recently filed S-1 (available to the public on the SEC's EDGAR site). While the firm's failures have meaningfully weighed on employee pay, it appears the three listed executives (CEO, Director of Editing and Director of Trading) continue to enjoy high six/low seven figure compensation. 

According to the S-1, Sidoti is looking to raise $35 million of capital for a portion of the company. Brokerage firms tend to trade based on book value ($6 million book for Sidoti), with strong franchises enjoying a premium multiple and weaker firms a discount.  Hard to argue for any premium (especially 6x book, which implies 100% of the business for $35 million) given management's track record and a business plan that calls for expansion into the micro cap asset management business without a track record.

Analysis of the income statement begs the question of whether this firm can even afford to be a public company. The firm netted roughly $800k the past few years, while enjoying a 6% tax rate.  Adjusting for a normalized tax rate, a $35 million price tag for 100% of the business yields an 80x P/E multiple based on annualized 1H:14 earnings.  Then consider the cost of being a public company, paying board members, etc. Is there any profit left for shareholders???  Doesn't seem like a rosy scenario for you, the prospective employee.  Caveat Emptor!"
36,Sidoti & Company,"Barely Wall Street firm, terrible owner/CEO",2014-10-18,1.0,Institutional Sales,"You get to travel a lot and being out of the office and in front of clients is the best thing for your career. 

If you are inexperienced, it is a good way to get exposure to buy-side firms and company CEO's/CFO's.","Lowest pay in the industry for both sales and research. Sidoti loyalists will play mind games to convince you every other sell-side firm is similar in commissions and bonuses (theyr're not).

The research product is a joke, mostly company earnings release and preview notes. Most of the day to day work as an analyst is just checking the box to stay in the good graces of management (Peter). All of the good analysts except 1 have left in the past two years as the bonus pool continues to get cut. 

Sales people are paid a draw and the lowest commission rate on the street. Sidoti also plays this game where you only really get paid on an account if it is brand new money to the firm, or the account is up year over year. If an account pays one dollar less than the year before, the commission to the sales person is cut in half. If you have an account for more than 1yr and it continues to grow, theres a slight reduction in commission amount also, as Peter views the success being due to the firm and not the sales person. Every regional sales manager has quit in the last 6 months. 

Mangagement consists solely of the CEO/owner Peter. He has a couple deputies who carry out his wishes. His behavior is erratic and irrational. He has been known to go on tirades over non-issues and deny employees permission to expense regular business related items. 

Also, if you are in sales and travel a lot, you will be using your own credit card. Expenses will often run into the thousands of dollars, and as it takes time to get reimbursed, Peter Sidoti is effectively using your personal balance sheet to finance his roadshow expenses."
37,Sidoti & Company,Avoid at all costs. Lousy pay. Lousy benefits. Lousy company.,2014-08-22,1.0,Equity Research Analyst,"The only positive of working here is that you make your own schedule. Once you're settled in, and if you have half of a brain, you don't even have to show up most days. God forbid one of your companies makes an acquisition, you take a quick cab ride to the office.","This is glorified investor relations work. Other shops don't have all of this nonsense maintenance work. The work here provides no value. Peter will tell you what you need to do to get x amount for bonus. Once you meet all of the requirements, he'll make something up out of the blue to explain why you're only getting half of x. The people here are miserable. People ask you if you're any closer to getting out every time you step foot in the kitchen or bathroom. On top of the mind-numbing busy work and miserable atmosphere, this place is going down the tubes. The company just went through big layoffs and will probably cut more. Many people are jumping ship as well.

Stay away from a sales position here, too. The firm has the lowest commission on the Street and all they do is log fake calls all day when they are in the office. When out of the office, they are glorified chauffeurs, just driving management to meetings. 

Any positive review of this company was probably scripted from Peter himself and handed to someone to enter."

39,Sidoti & Company,"Talented employees, great place to build a career",2014-08-10,5.0,Equity Research Analyst,"This is a great firm to build a career. As an analyst, you have freedom to build your own coverage universe; the director of research allows analysts to choose their own stocks to cover.  You are encouraged to travel around the country to meet with CEO's / CFO's / tour the facilities of companies under coverage- which is an excellent opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge of companies and build relationships.  The employees are talented and experienced; the firm only hires analysts with extensive wall street experience.  Many of wall streets top funds ($1B-$300B+ AUM) are clients of Sidoti and ALL small-cap focused funds on the street recognize the firm as the industry leader in sell-side small-cap stock research.  Analysts have unparalleled exposure to buy-side portfolio managers at an early stage of their careers and are welcomed to travel on roadshows / marketing days with management teams and meet with institutional investors at will.  Analysts are also encouraged to regularly attend analyst days for stocks under coverage and are sponsored by the firm to take the series 7, 63, 86 and 87 exams.  Management is very hands-off which means that analysts control their own schedule, coverage universe and work schedule.  Considering the great work / life balance, salaries are considerably high for those employees who work hard and run a successful coverage universe compared to other research shops and investment banks on the street.  On a typical day, you may be tracking earnings results, researching new investment ideas, or briefing fund managers on breaking news.  Analysts have opportunities to present investment ideas to the sales force and interact with institutional investors on a daily basis.  Sidoti is the perfect firm for anyone who is ambitious, hard-working, hungry, motivated, driven and loves to be in the middle of wall-street action.",Management team is ineffective at tapping into the tremendous talent and experience of employees at the firm.
