Niche player with industry veterans as leaders who are well connected in the industry.,Poor management.  Having been a good broker back in the day does not equate with knowing how to run a business properly.  No team environment. It's eat what you kill.

3,Soleil Securities,"God People, Bad Mgmt",2012-02-10,4.0,,"Solid Product, decent corporate access for such a young firm. Built a pretty good reputation.","Very political for such a small firm, side deals and management secrecy early on made it a tough place to feel fairly treated. Too many petty and negative people allowed to continue haunting the place. Bad cash management and/or MIS-management led to the desperate funding situation."
