1,Sparta Commercial Services,Worst Job I've Ever Had,2018-06-15,1.0,Executive Assistant,Absolutely none. This was an awful toxic environment.,"-The CEO is outright abusive to the staff. During my time there, he would call me nights and weekends to yell at me about perceived mistakes I had made. He also threw at spoon at me because I had made the aggresses mistake of giving him a soup spoon instead of a tablespoon with his soup. 
-The expectations were unstated and unrealistic.
-Overall a degrading demoralizing environment."
2,Sparta Commercial Services,Intern,2017-11-01,2.0,,Given freedom to work on projects.,Terrible and disengaged management. Doesn't listen to new ideas.
3,Sparta Commercial Services,Worst place in NYC to work,2016-05-01,1.0,Sales Executive,None that I can think of. I work there for less than a year it was probably the most unprofessional place that I've ever worked,When I started working there the VP of sales left and so did the manager of sales. We were left leaderless and on our own the CEO is nuts he doesn't know what he's doing or what direction he's going this is why sparta has been losing money for years they need to replace the CEO ASAP. This place is a sinking ship with a freaking guy (CEO) who's ready to drive the ship into an iceberg. They are cheap and the commission is bs.
4,Sparta Commercial Services,An impossible situation,2016-04-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Monday-Friday hours, easy commute.","Absolutely no company culture to speak of. 
CEO is very difficult-very picky about how he likes things done, yet doesn't give instructions (or gives vague ones at best when he does give them). He expects his staff to somehow automatically know some of the unusual ways in which he wants things done, but then he quickly gets angry when someone doesn't know. CEO also seems to go out of his way to find mistakes, even when none were made, and the perceived problem was caused by his own lack of communication.
This continued lack of communication is horribly frustrating. CEO also becomes quickly irritated when asked questions, even when the questions are meant to ensure that things will be done the way he wants. Overall, the lack of management and direction makes for a frustrating, no-win situation. 
The bottom line is that you can never be right, and he can never be wrong. This makes for a situation in which an employee is guaranteed to fail, despite all best efforts."

6,Sparta Commercial Services,Worst working experience I have ever had,2014-03-05,1.0,Administrative Assistant,"Paid well, but it wasn't worth it.",So many. A psychotic CEO who has no respect for employees or probably anyone. Poor management. No direction. Very stressful environment.
