4,Sperry Credit Union,Exteremely stressful with little or no support from upper management,2011-09-17,1.0,,The members and other coworkers are what have held this Credit Union together. If it were not for a loyal member and staff Sperry would have been gone a long time ago.,"Upper management has no idea of the low morale and stressful work enviroment that goes on day today. As weary staff continues to thin out it seems that only more and more management is hired, only to come manage NO staff. After the new management was appointed operations began to go downhill at a rapid pace. I would be extremely surprised to see this Credit Union last another two years. ...if that. BEWARE.... do not be lured in by this company things are not always what they seem."
