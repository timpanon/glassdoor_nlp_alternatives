13,State Street IMS,Avoid at all cost,2019-01-06,1.0,IT Professional,"Great coworkers, vacation benefits, paid maternity, and decent pay","Management does not care. Work life balance is a joke despite being touted by the parent company. Constantly have to watch your back against some managers. For such a huge company, this division is shockingly super cheap and penny pinching (I kid you not!) VERY high turnover rate. Nonexistent bonus and salary increase (if you get one). Irvine division is a sinking ship and truly, truly the worst company I had ever worked for!"
14,State Street IMS,Opportunities,2018-12-27,4.0,Associate,Relaxed work environment here in Irvine.,Need a better coffee machine.
15,State Street IMS,Just a job,2018-12-22,2.0,Associate II,"3 weeks PTO, 10 or so holiday pays, 2 personal days, 2 volunteer days.

Flextime, but this varies on who your manager is.

Managers who take credit for workers’ work, will either get fired or laid off. See cons section.","Managers are useless and clueless. 

Like the one who proclaims being respectable after “12 years working at the firm since college,” who instead of helping the worker resolve an issue, just degrades them to figure it out themself since he is “asking the question to you, and expects you to solve the problem like a miracle worker with no training or guidance from him, whatsoever."
16,State Street IMS,Avoid the sinking ship,2018-12-01,1.0,Back Office,Funny coworker interactions. People shot  on each other here and it’s the only work place I’ve worked at that allowed this kinda talk,"Managers bullying new members if they don’t fit into the same mold.

Some managers are incompetent

19,State Street IMS,"Large institutional investment opportunity in the city of Irvine, CA",2017-09-20,3.0,Officer,"State Street IMS' clients in addition to the bank as a whole's client base allows an employee to experience a diverse set of trades, strategies and cultures.  The primary client for IMS is PIMCO and the majority of employees work to service only this one client.  Within the PIMCO support team responsibilities are focused by product and allow an employee to learn a lot about whatever product they are assigned to, teams servicing other clients might have more opportunity to explore a more broad set of investment types.",Product focused teams typically go through cyclical work flows of volume making days or weeks without much to do.  The culture is very reactive to the client and somewhat afraid resulting in frequent 'busy work' assignments to appease the client or prepare for how they might react.  The distribution of responsibility between product teams or management and associates causes some groups to be regularly overworked without a facility to distribute the workload.  Management leads regular initiatives to improve moral and collaboration however they are more of an exercise to satisfy management than a tool to really trigger change.
20,State Street IMS,"Assistant Vice-President, IT Infrastructure, Active Directory Architect",2016-09-02,5.0,Active Directory Architect,"Great work environment.
Work with latest technology",Company does not provide much ongoing training.

25,State Street IMS,"Work Hard, reap benefits",2015-10-10,4.0,Vice President,Hard work is rewarded and appreciated by management.  Great place to gain experience in the financial services field. Work life balance is supported by management team.,Bonuses for lower level employees are not that great.
26,State Street IMS,Analyst,2015-09-15,2.0,,"401k match. Tele-commute opportunities. Glassdoor asks that i have 5 words under ""pros"" so that is the reason for this sentence.",environment. Ever-changing mid-level management. Poor communication. Brutal base & even worse bonus.
27,State Street IMS,State Street HCL Services,2015-07-21,2.0,Senior Associate,You will learn a lot and might get some chance to travel for training.,"Very low compensation package for rank and file employees ( Analyst to specialist ), you can bring any food (even biscuit ) and your cellphone ( with camera ) to the production floor. Poor reward and recognition system, manager's from other companies brought their political culture and favoritism."
28,State Street IMS,Former Employee,2015-06-24,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Great place to start and learn about the industry when you have little to no experience.  People here are great and that's their greatest asset.,This used to be a great place to work in terms of what the company used to offer to promote growth and it's culture of unity.

31,State Street IMS,Good place to gain experience,2015-04-28,3.0,Officer,"Gain good experience. Promoted if you work for it. Your manager will influence your path more than they should, there are some good ones and bad ones.","Pay is low to the industry. To get a real raise or promotion find another job, and take it."
32,State Street IMS,Times are changing for the better,2015-04-11,4.0,,"Seems to be on an upswing after getting rid of Conway and Taggert coming into command.  Irvine has a solid management team and great people with a environment that is hectic at times due to client demands and poor support from Boston parent.  Good place to start and get solid experience in this industry.   
Good benefits and very flexible work arrangements","Been overly outsourced to India which caused morale and client issues but rumors are that it may change.  Fast paced environment, possibly too fast at time."
33,State Street IMS,Work here if you want bosses with high expectations and a horrible work life balance for peanuts,2015-03-25,1.0,Front Line Manager,Maternity leave benefits and potential for camaraderie with coworkers. That's it.,"SSIMS apparently prides itself for low pay, long hours, grueling client and upper management demands, disconnected upper management, few and far in between promotions, and even fewer and farther pay increases. Let's not forget shipping most of the jobs off to India and the Philippines. The company saved tons of money by outsourcing the jobs but none of the surviving employees benefited from that. Instead the remaining employees were expected to manage the people overseas (while minimizing overtime) and make sure the end-clients weren't affected or experienced a decline in service. The morale there continues to decline for all of these reasons and more."
34,State Street IMS,This place has become a joke. 10 years ago you use to get a fair living wage increase in Pay each year.,2015-02-25,1.0,,I am not sure I can come up with anything regarding this anymore.,Upper Management is a joke. You are lucky if you get a 1% increase in pay each year. They don't think about their employees when it comes down to your year end reviews. Management does not fight for pay increases or promotions.
35,State Street IMS,Good entry level position,2014-12-12,3.0,Senior Bank Loan Administrator II,"My experience was that State Street would hire ANYONE with a pulse and was a great way to get entry-level experience.  Good workers with strong networking skills could move on to external clients or more prestigious internal groups.

Benefits, especially vacation time, were pretty good for the area/industry.","Very stratified system - associates didn't really interact with senior management.

Mid and senior management were generally ""lifers"" without experience in other roles or firms and were mostly just filling time.

Not a lot of opportunity for diversification of skills.

Pay was low although colleagues who are still there mostly got significant pay increases over the past few years - I think the firm realized they were losing talent due to the low compensation."
36,State Street IMS,They do not care about their employees,2014-12-02,1.0,Ladenbauleiter / Immobilienmanager in der erweiterten Geschäftsleitung,None None None None None,"Very Political, Terrible Pay, No work/life balance, Terrible Management"

38,State Street IMS,Little mobility and no value placed on education makes this a good place to start (and get out quickly!),2014-09-23,2.0,Senior Associate,"Work-life balance is the single greatest thing about SSB IMS.  You can also add that while pure growth may not be great, SSB has a robust platform and onboards a lot of operations from other financial institutions so there will always be work (until the majority of each company is automated/outsourced).  Perks & benefits are below average, salary is below average.","Absolutely no value in education.  No promotions after gaining a certification, no tuition reimbursement... nothing invested in the workers!  Upward mobility is very difficult, and those who are promoted only seem to get more work rather than different responsibilities.  Training is terrible as the culture feels a bit like a government job (no motivation/initiative)."
39,State Street IMS,"Good work/life balance, but leaves a lot to be desired",2014-09-05,3.0,,"Good work/life balance, good way to get foot in the door to finance industry and learn a lot about operations. Opportunity for lateral movement exists allowing employees to get experience from a variety of positions.",There is very little room for growth outside of lateral moves to different departments and salary is lower compared to other places in the industry. Benefits are mediocre and the raises minimal (1% increase).
40,State Street IMS,Great company to get started at. Not a whole lot of upward movement available.,2014-07-04,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Laid back atmosphere and you learn a lot at an entry level position,Very few upward movement opportunities and lower pay than other companies
41,State Street IMS,sweat shop millionaires,2014-03-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"health insurance
building relationships with coworkers","-Extremely long hours during the financial fiasco 
-Basically really dumb complacent senior management who do nothing to add value
-Senior management walk around like big shots, which is ironic because they are the back office. 
-Treated like cattle
-Model for bureaucracy 
-Clients are nicer than own management
-Management just milk it what ever way they can
-lack of mobility"
42,State Street IMS,Great place if you like outsourcing,2014-03-05,2.0,Vice President PFS,Pay is competitive and the equity incentives were compelling,"Jobs outsourced to India in great numbers. Employees constantly at risk of being laid off if they held ""commodity"" positions. Management challenges managing offshore resources."
43,State Street IMS,"Great company for IT, not for non-IT",2013-09-27,4.0,Software Developer,"If you work in IT, they pay about average for average skilled workers, and way above average for unskilled IT workers.  

If you need a job, and don't know anything about IT, apply for a Network Operations Center position, these people don't know anything about computers, and get paid over $45k/year.","If you are non-IT, there isn't much of a future here.  They have outsourced all non-IT work overseas, and for those that remain, the pay to horrible.
If you are a highly skilled IT worker, the pay is way below competitive  rates."

46,State Street IMS,Trade Processing Associate 2,2013-05-08,1.0,Ladenbauleiter / Immobilienmanager in der erweiterten Geschäftsleitung,like-minded colleague. You will work with nice people around the company. Good starting position for either fresh undergrad graduates or anyone wants a job. Low entry barrier.,"No advancement opportunity. You do not learn things beyond your product and it's straight up data entry. Because PIMCO is the major client, IMS does things 100% PIMCO's way, regardless it might hurt existing operation. In addition, processing is only what you learn. You have to teach yourself about the product and market. The job does not provide that. 
Turnover rate is high depend on which team. If it's low in a certain team, motivation of the team is very low. No one sees a career. Pay is on the lowest end within industry."
47,State Street IMS,My manager is the best thing about it,2013-02-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flexible hours and work assignments. Team works well together. My particular manager is the reason I took the job and the reason I remain there. If he leaves someday, I am not sure I have much of a future there.","Completely disjointed and disorganized middle and upper management. No group knows what another is doing, and often we are working in opposite directions. Oh, and the stock price is at a 5-year high, yet NO raises this year for anyone. And almost no bonus whatsoever, even though I was a high-performing team member according to my review. Bonus isn't ""performance"" based obviously, it is divided among the group to make up for failed compensation policies, where long-time employees make much less than the newer ones."
48,State Street IMS,Executive Management is truly awful,2013-01-19,2.0,Vice President,"VPs and below are genuinely hard-working and knowledgeable people.
The business model has promise but the supporting systems are antiquated.","Executive management is inept and uncaring.
Senior VPs are abused and micromanaged from above.
Employees are routinely mislead in briefings.
Excessive offshoring in both business and IT functions.
Constantly living in fear of losing your job to offshoring."
49,State Street IMS,Strictly Status Quo,2012-12-20,2.0,,Working at this company allows one to gain experience with their high profile client base of financial big boys.,"Your soul will die right before your eyes.  Next your physical and mental health will reach an all time low.  Now you are ready to become a SS zombie or you might go running as fast as you can out the door.  If you do happen to survive, you maybe just a really big brown nosier.  The cubicle spacing is sooo close you can feel your neighbor breathing, this is all part of the  intimidation training.  If you can turn-off most of your 5-senses you might be able to survive."
