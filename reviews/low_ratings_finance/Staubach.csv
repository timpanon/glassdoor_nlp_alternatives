1,Staubach,Response to employment resume,2019-10-08,1.0,Anonymous Freelancer,none for  a biased company such as this one,"Rude response:  I can’t say that I ever heard a recruiting organization put a rejection letter that way.
So you were looking for somebody who’s been in a position a long time 
upward mobility and had no  issues related to the economy in their work life. 
Those standards are very high good luck in getting your candidates.
I will make sure those qualifications are shared with those of us who have been 
affected by the economy and are looking for another position."
2,Staubach,Management does not care about their employees.  Only the power to direct them without listening,2019-08-20,1.0,Human Resources Generalist,"I do not believe that they have any pro values.  When asking what they want of you, they do not response in an interactive manner.",Management only wants to control the employee without input.  It is the same time of one-way street treatment described in the Pros sections
3,Staubach,HORRIBLE STAFFING AGENCY!! STAY AWAY!,2018-12-06,1.0,,"none whatsoever, this is a horrible staffing company","they claim to be a staffing agency, but when you send your resume to them in regards to a job that they post, this place will tell you ""based on the industries and positions that we specialize in, we will not be able to assist you in your job placement"". Keep in mind that I match every requirement and duty that they have posted. To all out there use a legitimate and hard working staffing company for employment not this place, its a joke"

7,Staubach,"Horrible Co-workers, Unrealistic Expectations",2014-05-23,1.0,Receptionist,"Nice office, great upper management.","What made this job unbearable was the nasty, catty administrative assistants.  They expected me to answer all phone calls while simultaneously cleaning the conference room, bathrooms, kitchen; restock fridge, water plants, make coffee, prepare food/drinks/snacks/lunch for coworkers/clients, make copies, file, etc..  I was to ask these difficult admin. assistants to fill in for me to watch the phones whenever I had to leave the desk to do do all these other tasks, but they would give me dirty looks and would find excuses not to watch the phones.  These difficult coworkers made my job very difficult and unpleasant.  They also made frequent rude, inappropriate remarks to me, which was appallingly unprofessional.  Yet they had seniority over me, so I was afraid to say anything."
