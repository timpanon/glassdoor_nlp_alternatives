The emails that came from managers were rude, unprofessional, and demands on file quality and turn times unrealistic.  They said that overtime was an option, but refused to pay it if you could not clear all your conditions (sometimes there were close to twenty conditions that would come in) AND submit your 3 new daily files.

Hardworking and committed even when there is little to no direction from the top.,Corporate.  Their corporate culture is not supportive. They believe micromanagement is the answer. If management in the independent centers makes recommendations on anything they are ignored unless it falls in line with exactly what corporate has already arbitrarily decided.  The corporate office also makes decisions in a vacuum. They are so out of touch with what it is to work in the front lines of a mortgage production unit that it makes it impossible for the local centers to do their jobs effectively.  The production units are being give direction by people who have not touched a loan file from start to finish in at least 10 years.

There are managers/ supervisors in positions that they know nothing about. This part of the job is challenging and frustrating. The company does not focus on training and developing their employees.

If the whole company ran like that dept I would still be there,"Most unorganized, chaotic underwriting position ever. Rushes every day, on top of your workload.  Questions asked every 2 minutes..there is no stop gate to help filter questions.  You are expected to work your pipe, rushes for the day, re work loans from closings, answer questions all day.  This was not a work/family balance.  Stay far away
 Revolving door.. upper mgmt does not care.  They are always understaffed.  Work elsewhere."

37,Stonegate Mortgage,Talent Acquisition Specialist,2016-11-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I liked the location of the office.  Additionally the company did a good job with the orientation...although most of the information was untrue.  I also like that once the board got rid of the previous owner, they got rid of bad managers.",This company had many unfair practices.  Perhaps the most frustrating is the fact that poor performing managers were not addressed and instead reprimanded employees.
38,Stonegate Mortgage,Love it here!,2016-09-20,5.0,Mortgage Advisor,"Leadership is always challenging and coaching their teams, they want us to fund loans and be top tier producers. Culture is 100% on point and a caring fun atmosphere. Managers aren't afraid to talk to clients, they also speak to them respectfully and seek to understand before being understood.  Management has an immediate response time to any questions myself, or my clients may have that I am unable to answer. We have amazing transaction coordinators who also stay on top of our docs we need in order to submit loans to underwriting. There isn't a sales/ops split, the leadership and employees in both areas work as a cohesive unit. I can speak to my underwriters if necessary, they want to help and aren't ""unavailable"" all the time!  I have learned more in my time at Stonegate than my time spent at one of the largest financial institutions in the world. Dakota, Kyle, and Brian at the Scottsdale office are an incredible leadership team.",Not enough hours in the day to write all the loans!
39,Stonegate Mortgage,AE's Beware!,2016-09-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Sell all channels.  Beyond that NOTHING GOOD!,Compensation is among the lowest in the industry.  Ops runs all over the AE.

40,Stonegate Mortgage,Great Company!!,2016-09-15,5.0,Mortgage Advisor,"fast turn times on closings, very competitive pay, great leadership.

If you're looking to make 6 figures+ this is a great opportunity that I highly recommend.

And did I mention I only work 40 hours per week? Because I do.","I can't complain, great opportunity!!!"
41,Stonegate Mortgage,Stonegate,2016-09-15,5.0,Mortgage Advisor,"Stonegate is great a company all around. The systems they use are easy to learn, the process from locking a rate to closing is streamline an easy. It is by far the best mortgage company i have worked for with work/life balance. That doesn't mean you can slack but you get OT, PTO and a flexible work schedule.",The only con I see is the compensation is ever so slightly lower than some other companies. The work/life balance and work atmosphere more than make up for the few dollars that could possibly be lost working at another company.
42,Stonegate Mortgage,Think Twice before taking the job.,2016-09-09,2.0,Mortgage Underwriter III,Decent Salary for a non government underwriter $88K,"System is by far the worst I have ever worked on in the business. (E3 a proprietary system) Production expectations are not realistic with technology restrains and no overtime
(depending on how well business is doing). Although they are working on a better system, they are not proactive, more so reactive to losing so many good employees. 

 Benefits for a family of 3+ are exceptionally high.  I pay $345 per pay period. They will promise government sponsorship, but it never happens. 

Management does not value it's underwriter, high turn over rate from management on down to underwriters and processors.  A manager once told me, "" If employees didn't like the Stonegate way, they could look for another job""."
43,Stonegate Mortgage,Robotic Underwriting dont want you to think or give concerns,2016-08-22,1.0,,remote position loved that aspect only.,Seasoned underwriter hired to learn FHA started when mass walk out of FHA/VA underwriters so never got opportunity to learn govies within region..stayed until no longer needed then the simple games begin where they nick pick everything and say they are concerned.  Well Im concerned that the Robotic Underwriting and Simpletonness the job turned into a nightmare as it began a nightmare as I entered I should of left with the seasoned underwriters that were leaving that was the signed.  Good Luck to anyone who goes there it was the worst mortgage experience I encountered reporting to managers that have no underwriting backgrounds etc.

46,Stonegate Mortgage,All of the analysts arent wrong and the CEO isn't right,2016-07-15,1.0,,Its a place to go each day.,"Commuter CEO (and a lot of the leadership team) who isn't part of the Indianapolis community or goes out to meet clients/customers or employees, no community involvement/philanthropic contribution,  disconnected leadership team, not collaborative, inability to innovate, doesn't walk to the talk, leadership hides behind closed doors (afraid someone actually may ask them a question), slow to act/make a decision, technology isn't up to speed and wont be, poor implementation/execution of new technology...A lot of deafness. High leadership has a history of selling not building. 

Turnover is astronomical and theres no solution."

54,Stonegate Mortgage,The positives and the negatives,2016-03-24,3.0,Operations,"Pros are that as long as my manager was in the same office as me,  it was okay.   Office location to where I lived was perfect, even though we were across the street from the 49th Street Hotel (aka the Pinellas County Jail and Courthouse).   Received a pay raise every year, although the last one I received was horribly small.   Overtime would come and go and it helped that management provided dinner for those who stayed late","Cons.   If your manager is in Indianapolis and you are working in Clearwater,  there is a massive disconnect.   The medical benefits are disappointingly bad.   I could never afford to have health insurance.   401k was not a true match.  It started out with a full match and then it went to a confusing, sliding scale (IE,  if you contributed 6% of your pay,  the company would match at 4%).   PTO was not great.  13 days off a year is pretty rough."
55,Stonegate Mortgage,The truth about banking in 2016,2016-03-09,5.0,Mortgage Advisor,"An overwhelming amount of extremely hi-end aggregator leads. All are pre-screen by a CSR with a live transfer & a warm hand off.

Very high BPS's than any other call center I've seen.

Comp plan is weighted to those that are actually willing to work, this is not a place where you can fund 4 loans a month & make good money. So if you're merely looking for a place to slack off & collect a large base this is not the place for you.

You're able to chose the processors you work with, and have a very open line of communication with management & operations.","Smaller base makes initial ramp period for pipeline challenging, so make sure you have money set aside in the mean time.

No free food, I can't believe they don't order Mastro's for us daily, what kind of sweat shop is this? - And if you don't get sarcasm this isn't a good fit for you -"

Plus they have a huge portfolio of loans they service and we get those calls too.  The comp is one of the best in the industry for an inbound with high caliber leads.  The ppl on the phone actually want to talk to you.  I left a place that had $2 trigger leads and would get hung up on all the time.  No micro management.  The rates are good and processing is closing loans typically under 30 days.  I worked for a few large lenders, Paramount Equity, loanDepot,, and Chase and this place is the best for making money and overall piece of mind to know that you are not always looking over your shoulder worrying about losing your job over nonsense.","I would say the only con is the loan officer does not see the CD before it goes out.  Also the lockdesk is backed up and takes 24 hours to get a pricing exception approved, but at least we can get pricing exceptions to earn business when needed."

Ability to move up within the company early when growth was something associated to the company name.,"No bonuses after working long hours to get regulatory changes in from Dodd Frank,  changes in leadership led to downfall of company.  Good people constantly left creating a revolving door atmosphere.  Buddy system deployed throughout the ranks.  Money thrown at all the wrong places which did not create any value for customers in business,  borrower experience etc.  People from other failing mortgage companies at the reigns which led to downsizing.  Purchased companies that ended up being very bad decisions and led to dramatic losses for company. CEO got kicked out...you name it."

With new CEO and/or change in Branch management thinking, this pro is no longer valid.","Leadership is not experienced enough to know that all states are not created equal.  If you have multiple state licenses, you will be punished.  At any time they can claim you do not deserve leads based on your close ratio (even if you have states with low loan amounts, high LTVs and high fees) and take away your income.  While people with few licenses receive more leads in better qualified states

Comp plan is the worst I have seen, bonus is quarterly with a 45 day delay after each quarter!"
67,Stonegate Mortgage,Working at stonegate,2015-12-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Easy to move up to another position if you express your desire.,Not a stable company. Getting ready to lay dallas office off.
68,Stonegate Mortgage,Correspondent Reviewer,2015-12-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Managers are generally friendly and easy to work with. Pay is decent and the benefits are acceptable. Overtime is usually available if you want to work.,The management of different departments don't seem to communicate with each other. The company grew faster than they were willing to improve their infrastructure. The systems they use are old and slow so you have to work more to do less.

They sell their retail branches on the West and East Coasts leaving just a handful of branches..

You never hear about the good that you do . You never get a thank you for the sacrifices  you make to work the long hours and weekends..

The systems we used were always down, the Mortgage Advisors were ignorant and rude, the customer base was sketchy, there was vague communication from upper-management and my direct manager - when she actually decided to show up to the office - was completely clueless.

Right before I left, the writing was on the wall. Sure enough, I have come to find out that basically all management left (I honestly have no idea if the doors are still open in STL).

When our little operation started, we were fooled into believing we had joined a tight-knit group that would be led by those who no longer bought into the ""bureaucratic"" nonsense larger corporations instilled.

All I have to say is...just look where management fled back to. Actions speak louder than words."

They will exponentially increase work load and job description, when you ask for the corresponding increase in compensation, the answer is they will get back to you, 6 months to a year later, the answer is still held up by ""HR"".

HR's only true function is to plan yearly party for all legacy and sr management that flies out of the country for their all expense paid beach vacation. If you are unlucky enough to work outside of the corporate offices in Indy, you will not only not be acknowledged, not ever receive an increase , you will not be included in this either, no matter how many times you go above and beyond, no matter how much you sacrifice, or how much money you save the company. You will be required to be available by cell phone after hours, on vacation days, evenings, weekends, birthdays, holidays, etc. You will be verbally and emotionally abused by sales, and you will not be allowed to defend yourself. You should not try to take any of the above to HR, they will be upset with you, tell you that you have invited the above behavior, or instigated it, and try to coach you on your poor attitude.

119,Stonegate Mortgage,Mortgage Advisor,2015-04-16,5.0,Mortgage Advisor,"I was reviewing many reviews here at Glassdoor prior to choosing Stonegate as my employer and I had to write a review that really hit the points whether positive or negative.  First, I'm listing as many Pros as possible. Stonegate is first class when it comes to providing the support for their new employees. I worked with other major national lenders and SGM really spares no expense in their on boarding process. 

The licensing department is fast and does everything for you to get your licenses updated. IT department moves quickly and gets you set up fast with your user Ids and software installations. Your direct manager is really helpful to get you going and the co-workers make you feel welcome.

Other most noticeable Pros are the leads. There are tons of leads and you'll never have a nothing to do or no one to call. The CSR department is pure excellence given the short amount of time they have. You get many live lead transfers daily to the point where you even have to log off just to catch up on your work. Lead quality is excellent and most are lay downs. This is the perfect environment if you are new in this industry or you don't have too many selling skills because at Stonegate the customers close themselves. 

On the technology side, Stonegate has many tools to facilitate your daily work. Their servers run fast and you will never experience any down time. If you have any issues the IT department is right there ready to assist by the call of an email. The facility is clean and set up for a good work environment. No parking shortages here. There is even a gym in the same building. Pay schedule is awesome and deals you close at the end of the month you get pay 10 days later.","I've been here long enough to figure out the issues that are present in this growing company. It's not enough to lower my 5 star rating because I know other lenders have the same problems in worst degrees. Let's start with the liquid environment issue. One week you are told to do something one way and the next week it's something different. I'm ok with that except when it starts to hit your income. 

Originating a loan is easy at Stonegate Mortgage with the hardest part coming at the later stages. The disclosure task is handle by a different person in your given team. This is both good and bad. Good because you don't have to do it but bad because when you rely on someone else the other person usually takes their time and doesn't care to send them out correctly. After you put up with this disclosure fiasco it gets worse. YES, worse! 

Your loan will now sit in a holding queue waiting for the Transaction coordinator to submit it to processing. The office politics start getting involve and before you know it even though you have all your documents in the file and you already emailed your manager and the TC to submit your loan your loan does not get submitted to processing. The main reason is not because you are a horrible Mortgage advisor but because you are not one of the TCs prefer Mortgage Advisors. Preference is given to those mortgage advisors that have been there a long time and I'm ok with that but not when it becomes to the point when you originate so many loans and at the end only 10% of those actually make it to processing in a timely manner. I don't think +30 days to submission is reasonable. This doesn't go well for new MAs that are attempting to build up their pipeline and start generating income. This is common practice in all the teams and this is why you have 2 or 3 MAS on each team doing 80% of the volume. There is no chance for a new MA to do well since your loans never see the processing side until the borrower is so upset they threatened to cancel or request to speak to a manager. And when you attempt to talk to your manager about it then next thing you know you are getting reprimanded for a small mistake you did. 

The two problems listed above are the major cons and I strongly believe that if Stonegate can get it together on these two it will help the rest. Processing and Underwriting timelines have improve over the last two months and I only see that getting better. Compensation plans have good intentions but the processing has to catch up with the target goals. I could overlook the smaller concerns since I know that other places are worse and are not doing anything to fix it."

Lots of OPTIONAL OT which allowed me to pay for a lot of upgrades to my home. 

Laptops are issued in my department  so if your kids are sick or a repair man needs to stop by or you just need a break from the office you can work from home.

You get 14 paid days off a year to start.  Citi you get 12 and bofa you get 15 so its comparable.

Insurance  is high but whose insurance isn't now? 

They let us go home early on holiday weekends with pay. 

Relaxed attire because we dont see clients face to face. 

My base salary is the highest is ever been but i cane to the company with 13 years experience. 

Keep in mind most people who are happy with their employer dont jump on here to say so.  People who have bad experiences are usually the ones who make time to come on here because they want to try and ruin the reputation  of a company.

At one point, we had a stand in manager who told our department not to apply for a team lead position because we will not get it.  Who says that and why are they allowed to do that.  It is all about, whether they like you or not-  u don't know that because Upper mgmt. only comes out to see if anyone has a lunch menu.  Never any meetings w/staff-  a ton of great knowledge is over it.  The only way to keep up w/ your work is working off the clock- some mgr makes u take lunch stating it is the law- I personally spoke to HR and it is up the manager, it is not the law- plus that rule did not apply to all, just the ones not liked. I was made to take these lunched  even tho she knew we couldn't afford to take a half hour lunch- so several of us had to work off clock-  everyone has done it and u r told not to work off the clock in one breath, but in order to get the quota met, u cannot spare 30 minutes and it had to be done,  There were many many days that we joked about not being able to drink water throughout the day because u cannot afford to keep going to the bathroom--u do not have the time.  These loans are so bad-  they allow the brokers to run them and in the long run, it really hurts their exp w/ us.  The Brokers are not happy with us.

Some of our servicing jobs were outsourced to companies that were also not setup to handle our fast growth. The rest of our servicing jobs went to a new office in Dallas and handled by people that may have had four year college degrees but had no mortgage background.if we wanted to keep a job in our office we had to sign a new job description as a call center representative.. We spent our days being yelled at by customers whose payments were not posted correctly or whose taxes were not being paid correctly or insurance is not being paid on time if at all......
or my personal favorite - loan packages that we have purchased where customers are angry because they were told by their mortgage advisor that their mortgage insurance premium would drop from their escrow payment after they made half a dozen payments in good faith.
I personally had instances where loan packages we had purchased were not closed correctly and legal descriptions are incorrect. the industry as a whole is just doing things too quickly yet again..... loan closings are not being done correctly and borrowers need to be asking more questions before they close and find out what they are really getting as far as the loan product."
144,Stonegate Mortgage,Prospective Employees Beware,2014-08-10,1.0,Executive Assistant,There is nothing positive to say.,"What you need to know: In April of this year they fired numerous employees and closed an Illinois office without warning.  In late June, they then went to Arizona and shut them down - again firing numerous employees who had no clue it was coming.  The Scottsdale office was one of their major hubs - no more.  This past March there was a press conference with Governor about them opening up 400 new jobs in their main office; however, as it turns out they are sending more than 100 jobs from two of their HQ departments to India!  In June of this year, the CEO - Dan B. resigned - reportedly to pursue other interests.  In truth, he saw the writing on the wall and wanted to distance himself from SGM as much as possible.   The list goes on and on.  Despite its latest quarterly earnings statement (which appear grossly overblown), this company clearly has major problems. The culture is hostile and their future uncertain.  Not to mention their shady business practices.  If you're looking for a positive culture, a stable company and a place to make a career for the long term - I do NOT recommend this turbulent, unstable company that does not value its employees and is working its way to expulsion from the NYSE for shady practices and ultimately extinction. They are gearing up for a major external audit and the SEC is watching them very closely."

They think that micro-managing and the totalitarian way of managing a department gets the job done and earn them the respect of the team. They could not be more wrong! The focus is more on the scorecard - damn the quality of work. They don't foster team collaboration or allow personal development.  Not only are they incompetent, they are also short-sighted and lack care of their team's motivation and drive. They do not foster team collaboration. Instead, they stump the ""outside of the box"" thinking. They don't tap into their team's expertise and soft skills. Instead, they select the few that don't have the knowledge nor the expertise which makes it unproductive because it was never done right. If you go against the popular opinion, you are treated as someone who doesn't fit the mold."

The pay structure could use a thorough look through.   I don't know about the pay levels in Indianapolis,  but in Tampa Bay, it is not cheap to live here.   I have no intentions of leaving the company in the foreseeable future,  but when I compare what I do to other companies with similar positions, the pay can fall short.  Benefits are okay,  but needs some attention.   Attrition is not too high in the office I work at,  until the last 2 months.

150,Stonegate Mortgage,I was very disappointed with the company and management.,2014-06-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I do not see any pros working for this company consider other places when searching for employment.,"I feel that management needs to take a better look at the departments heads.  The turn over should say enough about the issues at hand, it's not always the employees that are the problem.  I also agree with other review if you hire the person then trust them to do the job that you hired them for.  It seems that management does not care about giving employees a chance to improve or maybe even consider moving them to another position that might be better for them.  I personally was hired into a bad situation and basically set up for failure by upper management.  This company has lost many good employees due to head of department, but they seem to make it look like the employees fault to the upper management level.  This person has bipolar issues and has yelled at employees, never not once did I ever get ""good job"" or ""thank you"" even when they put me in this situation to fail.  My advise to all of you is to not work for this company, they do not care about their employees.  Even though I'm a former employee please trust me on what I'm saying...this company puts way to much on employees and then expects perfection when you are given to much work.  Management does not want t hear what employees have to say about anything."

I was told by long-time employees it use to be very different before they went public, but reading other reviews that doesn't seem to be the case either.  The owners and executive staff really have no idea what is going on in their organization, nor do they truly care.  The Cutillo's are only concerned with lining their pockets and off-shore accounts.  Turnover is extremely high  in all areas.  I have never seen anything like it!  Gov. Pence recently gave a news conference about 400 jobs Stonegate is going to provide, but they are so busy backfilling from the turnover I don't see how they can make this happen.  Employee's from all over the country are generally unhappy with the culture and how things are run, but are afraid for their jobs because they know if they voice their opinion too loudly they will be gone.  Many people in all areas of this organization are looking to get out and move on to happier climates."

GREAT atmosphere , good benefits , the hiring process was very organized and impressive , everything was automated and paperless , the orientation was very well organized as well , I was surprised to learn that the CEO takes time of his day to introduce himself to the new employees and answer their questions , they also make sure to make you familiar with everything within the company starting with HR and pays and benefits and ending with IT and how to use all of their systems that they're using. They always have social events for their employees , and they're very generous.  I feel so fortunate to be part of Stonegate and I see myself going somewhere in this company and I can definitely feel that I have the opportunity to grow and learn in Stonegate.","The only thing I didn't like was the health benefits , they are too pricy and not that good , however they did mention that they are going to change them soon and get better plans. so I guess I can't complain !"
