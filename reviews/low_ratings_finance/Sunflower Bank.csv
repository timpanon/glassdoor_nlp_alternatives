3,Sunflower Bank,Toxic,2022-02-08,1.0,Manager,I had the most amazing team of people who worked for me. Leadership generally likes passionate people and there is a lot of opportunity for people who like to build/fix things.,"Leadership is lacking. The vision is to make money. They are very persuasive at recruiting people who will bring a book of business or will help them enter a new market that they see as lucrative. But once the individual falls out of favor, they will treat you like a dog until you leave. This did not happen to me, but I saw it over and over. They are not making the technology investments needed. They are not interested in what's best for customers in the long term. Retail goals are 100% based on the number of checking accounts opened, but the attrition rate is through the roof. While you're there you know it's toxic, but you don't realize exactly how bad it is until you leave."

Constantly going through new people. Can’t keep anyone works the ones that they can keep like a dog. Definitely needs to add more staff but to to tight to do so.

If you're looking for an incredible opportunity to grow, develop and work with exceptional leaders then this is the place for you.",All cons that are typical for a business are being appropriately addressed.
53,Sunflower Bank,Run from this place!!,2018-07-29,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Their health insurance and 401K are pretty stellar. I’m guessing to make up for the disgusting way they treat their employees?,"The absolute worst company I have ever worked for. We were grossly understaffed to the point we’d be staying 1-2 hours late every single day - a couple times we were there 3 hours late! Ridiculous for a simple banking job. I was told before even accepting an offer of employment that we’d never be held over more than 30 minutes. 

We lost employees in mere months at times because of the toxic atmosphere, and even when they were interviewing, they’d get dozens of applications that they’d turn down because “there’s something about them”. Employees were always picked because of the manager’s feelings, not because of their work history, moral compass or talents.  

I was constantly bombarded by abuse from coworkers: cussing, name calling, bullying, refusing to help when I got overloaded with customers because they hid in the back on their phones. I brought this up to management numorous times and literally had a hand put up to my face and told to not talk about it. I ended up having to go to the director of HR to have someone let me even make a complaint because of my horrid manager refusing to let me. 

Employees cussing about customers after they left, in front of other customers, chewing out the supervisor again in front of customers, falsifying documents, releasing confidential information unnecessarily, I could go on. 

So, long story short, I’d NEVER suggest this crap show to a friend. I highly suggest staying as far away from this place as you can."
54,Sunflower Bank,Run don't just walk away from them.,2018-07-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The benefits are some of the best I've seen. (Maybe there way of feeling better about the way they treat you.),"Sunflower has one goal which is to keep the books looking as good as possible regardless of the cost to employees. We were dramatically understaffed compared to the tasks and time frames we were given. Upper management had no desire to understand the REASONS (not excuses) mistakes were made or tasks were not completed in the time frame they deemed acceptable. The amount of turnover and the amount of time it took to get an employee ""trained"" resulted in one of two employees having to pick up the slack of an entire branch for months on end, along with salaried employees have to work 50 - 55 hours a week easily. The expectations of the branches were not changed however which resulted in the loyal employees who had stuck it out being disciplined for mistakes made while trying to do the work of three of four people.   

The bank is so focused on growing that any infrastructure issues are given quick ""TEMPORARY"" fixes that have gone for four and five years without true permanent fixes. The issue is the permanent fixes cost money which is something the ownership group isn't interested in doing. The lack of interest in spending money results in Sunflower having a dramatic lack of competitiveness compared to most other retail operations.  This, however, does not hinder upper management from setting totally unrealistic sales goals and expecting you to make them. Training in anything beyond simple retail positions like a teller or banker is a joke to nonexistent but the standards they hold you to would suggest a minimum of six months of training. 

In summation since the bank has started its dramatic attempt to scale up quickly things have gone from high but healthy pressure to unbearable working conditions. The merger and switch up in senior leadership has resulted in upper management fearing for there jobs which has lead to an unhealthy downward push that has caused the company to lose many long-time employees. The new standard is that those who produce are given unchecked power regardless of there worthiness to manage people or not. I have heard members of HR telling potential applicants that many of the negative reviews they have seen are a result of disgruntled former employees of acquired banks, but in reading through most of these I can tell you that isn't the case."
55,Sunflower Bank,The Negatives Outweigh The Positives,2018-06-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Health insurance is solid, and the 6% 401(k) match with immediate vesting is top-notch.","It's abundantly clear that there was no thought given to organizational issues and shortcomings before the merger, and the current leadership is trying to give a makeover to a sickly runt of a pig in a race to an IPO. The infrastructure simply can't support the growth that upper management is reaching for, and because of the headlong push to go public, customers and employees suffer."
56,Sunflower Bank,Manager,2018-06-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Focused on growth and improvement. There is a serious environment of accountability. Hard work, ideas and results are rewarded.

58,Sunflower Bank,Vision Quest,2018-04-26,1.0,,"Overall, benefits are solid.  The bank's 6% match on 401K contributions is very generous.  Organization has some good people footprint wide that do everything possible to help customers and co-workers excell.","Most of the negative comments I see posted are generally accurate.  Culture is fear based.  Employees are not valued.  Turnover is extremely high.  Employees are very much treated like the hired help.  

This makes perfect sense if you understand that the bank is ran by a former consultant and big bank banker  for the primary purpose of taking the bank public.  All decisions are made to position the bank to appear strong and present a story palatable enough for the market to buy it.  

If you take a look at Sunflower Bank's recent  financial statements you can determine if this strategy is working well or not...."
59,Sunflower Bank,Compliance & Risk,2018-04-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Co-workers try to stay positive even though they are all miserable working at Sunflower Bank,"You are a number, not a person.  The company will never value the work you do or the person you are.   HR and upper administration will paint a pretty from the outside, but once hired, it goes downhill quickly.  Their turnover rate is MORE THAN 50%.  The company's hiring/firing of employee's is a revolving door.  Just look at all the ads for positions available all the time.  The only reason most employees stay at SBNA is because they might pay just a little better than other banks, but they slightly elevated pay is NOT worth your sanity.  If you enjoy being miserable, treated like dirt, over-worked and viewed as a ""sucker"" that got roped into applying for this worthless company....have at it!  Trust me, you might go for it and test the waters, but it won't take long before you realize you made the worst decision every and hit the door running.

I hope they can work out the issues that have been constant since “merger of equals”.,Sunflower took First National back to the 60’s where the idea is to just throw more people at something to make it work rather than automate.  Upper management is all about secrecy and doesn’t share much regarding what is happening.  You better keep your mouth shut if you don’t like they way things are run as well.  They don’t look kindly on ruffling feathers.  Clients are ignored because 1- the service people are overwhelmed with work 2- half the staff hasn’t been trained on HOW to help 3- there doesn’t seem to be any fix in place for what is broken.  They fired many staff members that had built the bank for years and didn’t listen to anyone who had a different opinion from the Kansas DWI overlord who knows zilch about banking and customer service.

Tunnel vision at its finest, zero attention to customer retention because all the numbers are based on customer acquisition. It's just not fun, or healthy. The people working in Salina work there because there isn't other options in Salina, and turnover in their new markets is high because salaries aren't competitive. If you're desperate for a job, go for it. But if you want to have fun and enjoy your job without stress or a ridiculous amount of politics, look elsewhere. The failed merger with First Western in Denver left a huge black eye and a ton of angst among employees. They have some grand plan on having headquarters in Denver or Overland Park, with no method to their madness (at least nine was communicated)."
81,Sunflower Bank,My first job after high school and it was a good starting position for me.,2015-02-16,4.0,Bank Teller,I liked the company as a whole,"Compensation, promotions, and management all need work. It's a smaller bank so not much room to grow."
82,Sunflower Bank,Like it,2015-02-09,3.0,Teller,"community bank, you get to know your customers on a more personal level","selfishness is everywhere, own your life"
83,Sunflower Bank,Positive experience - great team,2014-11-30,4.0,Finance,"Supervisor was very helpful and took time to explain culture, expectations and challenges.",Needed more time to build a referral network and to implement my marketing plans.
84,Sunflower Bank,"Training is a joke, call center is run by a communists dictator",2014-10-20,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Some of the coworkers are nice and supportive,"Extremely stressful because training is completely lacking. You are expected to take calls not knowing what you're doing & simply ask a coworker or supervisor when it comes up. Problem is it's busy and nobody has time to answer questions & there very often isn't a supervisor available, but you are also expected to never make any mistakes. Management is a huge ""B"" for lack of other words. Nothing is ever good enough, only scolds, no nice words. Everyone is constantly on edge because of this, hoping they are doing what they want. Management tells different people different instructions & and rules. Customers are extremely rude & will scream and curse at you. Management had the nerve to tell me this was my fault! They suggested I change the tone of my voice. They actually told me to sound more like an adult phone actress! There is no shift bid. You work the hours they give you, or you dont work. If there is any rearrangement (which is rare,) it's based on seniority only. The health benefits are extremely expensive for what you get. It's a 50/50 plan, meaning that you have to pay 50 of the bill until you get to an outrageously high deductible."
85,Sunflower Bank,Low value of employees...,2014-09-17,3.0,Corporate Services,"Decent benefits, vacation and sick pay were well appreciated. Especially being able to bank sick days over years.","Occasional system errors meant LATE hours, as in 1:00 am, instead of my 5:30 shift. Management was condescending and overbearing. It always felt like I was walking on eggshells and afraid to make any kind of error, however small, for fear of being demoted or terminated. Also, I was presented with growth opportunities, just to have nothing followed through or given to someone else."
86,Sunflower Bank,Ok First Job,2014-01-08,3.0,Teller/Customer Service Representative,"Community Bank, Incentives, Nice employees, Nice customers, Gave back to community","Poor Staffing, Catered to specific employees, Lazy Supervisor, Very Low Pay, No Bonuses,"
87,Sunflower Bank,Fantastic.,2013-07-02,3.0,Customer Service Representative,Sunflower is great small bank to work for.,Low pay compared to other banks.
88,Sunflower Bank,Vice President,2013-05-29,3.0,Vice President,Company has a pro business mentality.  Customer service is high priority to the front line staff. Flexible work schedule and business casual work attire year round!,The company has older staff from top to bottom. Culture change is non-existent. Communication of directives is poor. Pay is on the bottom of the scale but they do have an incentive program that could make up the difference.
89,Sunflower Bank,Just okay,2013-01-02,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"An okay place to work. It hasn't been the worst job I've ever had, but it hasn't been the best either. All federal holidays off is nice, and they occasionally  have employee appreciation functions.","Pay is not very competitive, sometimes it feels like management plays favorites, they hire externally for positions that can be filled by more than qualified internal candidates. Certain areas or departments have a very high turnover rate, and there is little to no room for growth."
