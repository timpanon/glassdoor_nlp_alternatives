1,TAG Associates,Unprofessional Working Environement,2018-07-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Most co workers are friendly.,"CEO curses in the office. Managers yell at their employees, employees yell at eachother, this place is a circus! The portfolio department has always been short staffed and underpaid. Theres no where to move up and the staff here  usually leave in about a year. 
The tax department has always been short staffed as well and underpaid. They usually shuffle work around to compensate for the person who left. Tax accountants usually stay on an average of 4 years.  This department is always fighting. You constantly hear people yelling at eachother and management belittles their staff.
The bookeepeing department is also understaffed. They wont promote within and expect you to work as much overtime as needed to get the work done.  
This is not a place you want to work, salaries are below average, bonus and raises are a joke, most management are disrepectful and not helpful. Management discusses personal employee info with other employees. The contoller gives out personal information. They ration cups, utensils, plates, napkins milk and coffee."

4,TAG Associates,Portfolio Accountant,2017-02-16,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"To be fair, this is a good entry-level job, if you are looking for a job and couldn't get one when you just graduate from your college.  Most staffs here are fun and nice.",There is really no so much to learn in this job.  It is basically reconciliation and data entry.  The salary is below market average.  The senior managers do not even pay attention to this department.  Health care insurance is not good.

6,TAG Associates,Great benefits but not a good place to learn and stay.,2015-02-10,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Most people are friendly.
Great benefits.
Nice office.
Good hours.
Good place as your last job before retirement.","Old/outdated technologies. M.S. Excel 2000, old CRT monitor which is not only small (19"") but also very blurry, old chair, etc.
Cutting back due to acquisition by a private equity company.
Young employees use this as a stepping stone."
7,TAG Associates,Run...this is a bad career move.,2014-12-05,1.0,Tax Accountant,"They will hire anyone, standards are very lax. However they just started to do credit/background checks about a month ago.","Hours are much longer than agreed upon, you will work on the weekends and holidays resulting in a paycheck that is less than minimum wage. As a measure to maintain cost company retention is 2 to 3 years, after that employees are pushed out.  No room for growth. 

Extreme micromanagement: No eating at  your desk, and there is also an attendance-late list (grade school style).
Managers always wants to know what you are doing at all times even when not at work. In fact you are constantly asked about your activities away from work....example-outside employment, business, political contributions...and the list goes on.

Very hostile environment: Managers take on bully approach, in the level of control and influence over the members of the Tax Group. As a result, it is very loud (screaming & yelling).

Medical Coverage deduction from pay check is extremely high, as well as co-pay. 
Compensation is low, negotiate before getting into company because raises and bonuses are very small.

Managers also bad mouth employees after they leave the company."
