0,Taconic Capital Advisors,Disorganized wonder,2021-09-21,1.0,Director,None that come to mind.,"Toxic culture. The different groups work at cross purposes undermining each other‚Äôs goals. The technology is outdated and the technology group is run links an oligarchy with skill-less, territorial minded personnel. I wonder what the technology team does in their 4hr meetings on Tuesdays and Fridays!!! May be watching a couple of movies a week. üòÅ"
1,Taconic Capital Advisors,"Decent Comp, Toxic Culture",2020-12-27,1.0,Financial Analyst,Founder is very committed and involved. Comp is in line with street.,"Fraternity-like, little to no management other than the founder. Conflicting views between PM's creates a toxic environment on the investment team. Basic modeling skills lacked by some senior analysts. Can't keep junior talent. Not a great place to grow."
2,Taconic Capital Advisors,Poor Management,2018-10-07,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Intelligent people and Addtnl Benefits - Free meals & snacks, onsite gym",Extremely poor managers.  Their mission statements claims they are a meritocracy but they couldn't be further from it.  It is a clique mentality from the very top and all the way down.  Not all actions are above board.  Worrisome in an SEC registered advisor.
3,Taconic Capital Advisors,Director,2018-04-24,1.0,Director,"Good perks, food and gym on site, benefits and compensation are solid","Horrible structure and office politics, people are constantly strategizing on how to stab team members and others in the back to get closer to the founder, a handful (three or four) people run the firm without thoughts to others specifically the legal function, no growth or development, no movement up, out of touch with how run a firm. All of the new people leave within 1-2 years."
4,Taconic Capital Advisors,Great place but demanding and competitive,2017-09-14,3.0,Senior Executive Assistant,"Terrific compensation, perks (free lunch and breakfast), unlimited PTO","Some ridiculous micromanaging, ego-laden status worship and uneven work distribution (some worked very hard, others didn't work at all and were given a free ride for some random reason).  Alot of male manager/female assistant dynamics that I wouldn't want to deal with again."
5,Taconic Capital Advisors,Assessment,2016-04-18,4.0,Specialist,"Founding partners are wonderful, know and care for the business intimately, and project a genuine warm feeling to everyone they deal with.
Skilled teams and individuals and tight relationships with colleagues.","Some office politics, especially after recent structural changes, but not a big issue."
6,Taconic Capital Advisors,Dysfunctional from top to bottom,2015-04-22,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Lots of perks, breakfast/lunch, sporting tickets, company outings.","Employee's aren't valued, most are treated and viewed as replaceable."
7,Taconic Capital Advisors,Director,2015-04-07,4.0,Director,"Great Culture, very aggressive investors with adequate risk management.","Compensation is politically driven disguised behind a ""team approach"""
8,Taconic Capital Advisors,Very challenging and pressurized place but money and benefits are tops,2014-06-18,4.0,Support Staff,"They are at the higher end of hedge fund compensation and benefits are great.  Depending on who you support/work with, you'll either get exceptional mentorship or nothing at all - nothing in the middle.  They have high expectations and watch you like hawks.  Very smart crowd and they know it.",Macho male frat sensibility pervades the working environment and there is a fair amount of turnover.  Assistants are well-paid but treated like servants and I don't think any of the colleagues trust either other.  Pretty cutthroat.
