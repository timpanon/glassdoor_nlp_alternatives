1,Telsey Advisory Group,The Worst,2019-12-09,1.0,Director,Not many Pros about a place where mismanagement virtually drove the firm  out of business,Worst managers in an industry known for bad managers. They fiddled as the place burned down around them and blamed the employees on the front lines for their failure.  Would not recommend the place to anybody.
2,Telsey Advisory Group,"Go Home, Nothing to See Here...",2019-03-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Snacks, birthday deserts...  But get there before it's picked over. The ""environment' can be unsanitary at times.","Unprofessional, depressing, no loyalty, unrealistic, wasteful,   Desperate need of an HR Dept.  Release the crypt keeper, he's no  ""Rock Star""."
3,Telsey Advisory Group,Senior Accountant and Operations Associate,2018-08-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great place to gain experience and work with intelligent people. They have a family like culture, stocked kitchen, and prestigious location.   Management is very accessible and it's a wonderful place to work.",Bonuses are dependent on company performance more than individual effort.
4,Telsey Advisory Group,Do not work here,2018-02-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Nice people, snacks for birthdays","No career growth
Depressing office space
Lack of structure
Constant turnover"
5,Telsey Advisory Group,"If there was a ZERO, I would give it.",2017-01-04,1.0,,Candy in the kitchen and that's it!,Chews and spits people out. CEO has no regard for anyone. Research is completely overrated. Look at the ratings. Most people can walk a mall on their own!
6,Telsey Advisory Group,Simply Pathetic,2016-08-05,1.0,Institutional Sales,"Nice midtown office location  (downsizing soon due to financial troubles).
After thinking hard I cannot come up with any more positives.  Unfortunately it really is this bad.","A management team stuck on growing the firm in 1990's fashion in the 2016 environment.
Management has very little understanding how basic business works.  
Management does not trust employees whatsoever.  Instead of viewing employees as teammates they are viewed as competitors.  They actually hate most employees.
When business is slow it's always because the sales team is not doing their job.  The real problem is stock calls and research in general are horrific.  
The research at this firm is similar to using a pencil to go to war.  It's inferior.
Upper management admits often the research is poor, but remains too afraid to address the issue with CEO.
CEO's batting average on stock picks is among the worst in the industry.
Overall mood of the staff is bitter and angry due to management mistreatment. It's the most sour group of employees I have ever experienced.  Most employees are looking for new jobs while at work."
7,Telsey Advisory Group,Depressing stay away!!!!!!,2016-05-11,1.0,Research Associate,"Fruits, snacks, water, candy & pretzels","The fact that Arnold keeps saying Dana is on CNN makes me laugh.  I've worked with the real deal contributors to money matters, the real big shots! 

Dark office, dark atmosphere, no work life balance, sweat shop, unprofessional, classless, unorganized, poor management, research is inadequate. 
No 401 k match
2 weeks vacation - not worth it for all the time you work. 
Benefits are inadequate 
Just a mess"
8,Telsey Advisory Group,Sales,2016-05-04,1.0,Institutional Sales,"Constant entertainment from all the drama and clueless behavior management displays.  It's really sad, yet, at the same time one cannot help but laugh at consistent amateur hour decisions management makes.","Normally reviews on the Internet are extreme.  When I stumbled upon the previous 19 reviews I could not believe how accurate they were.  As a matter of fact, many of the reviews are actually being kind.  Yes, this firm really is this bad.  Do not work here.  It's career and mentally damaging.  Leaving this firm is like getting out of the hole of solitary confinement."
9,Telsey Advisory Group,"like the sitcom the office, only depressing",2015-12-18,1.0,Research Associate,"free m&ms, feldman never dislikes a stock, dana always wears black, oh also free snapple.  Good place to get your licenses and then upgrade to a decent firm","no future, high turnover, low salary, management is terrible, nobody cares"
10,Telsey Advisory Group,Ruined a Good Firm,2015-09-28,1.0,Sales,Honestly there really are none!  If there was a negative rating this firm would receive it.,"Inexperienced management team with limited understanding how Wall St operates.
CEO is more concerned about how she is perceived by companies instead of doing value add research.  The entire SR management team tries to control CEO with little success.  Behind the scenes SR management expresses frustration over CEO to all employees.  To CEO's face SR management bow down and kiss her feet and tell her how great she is. It really is sickening!  CEO also serves as head of research which creates a major conflict of interest.  The entire SR management team tries to control CEO by forcing stock calls when it's CEO's nature to report news and go on TV to promote self image.  CEO is in the wrong business.
No credible HR department to offer a sounding board.
The firm lost 95% of its quality analysts, sales and trading department over the last few years.
Sinking fast."
11,Telsey Advisory Group,Missed the Boat,2015-08-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I can't honestly think of any.  If I could give less than one star I would.,"This company had an opportunity to really start out with a bang both for their product and their company culture.  Unfortunately they missed the boat on both fronts.  The product is unsellable; management won't go out on a limb to make a call worth getting behind.  There's absolutely no value-add to a sophisticated fund, especially given the price they are trying to charge. 

The culture at this company is just ridiculous and it all stems from the top.  There is no trust between management and everyone else.  Even the people in management positions are constantly backstabbing and manipulating each other.  Employees mimic this by continuing the backstabbing or donâ€™t last long.  Everyone here is completely miserable."
12,Telsey Advisory Group,STAY AWAY,2015-08-21,1.0,Analyst,"Management lacks industry sophistication which provides analysts with more freedom.
Ideal office location.","Persistent micromanagement with little to no understanding of how the business works.  Key management members often display odd childish behavior.  This creates a serious uphill battle when attempting to alter the current atrocious company culture.  
Benefits and pay packages are very stingy.  Not a good combination when you factor in having to tolerate the poor behavior of management."
13,Telsey Advisory Group,No Longevity,2015-08-20,2.0,,There are some pleasant people scattered about that are nice to work with. Stocked kitchen with snacks and beverages.,"High turn over rate. The average people stay is 1 year or less, sometimes a little over. Sub par pay. Poor management. No HR department. They make up their own rules outside of common practices from other firms in the industry. They don't value employees."
14,Telsey Advisory Group,Look Elsewhere,2015-07-08,1.0,Sales,Sometimes there's free cookies on Fridays,"Incompetent management
Nonexistent HR department
Unhappy, disgruntled employees
Disorganized work structure
Excessive micromanagement
Lack of training
Complete lack of work/life balance
Toxic, unfriendly work environment

Good name in the space.","Inept, impatient and stingy management
Disgruntle employees.
Lack of resources and quality of information from research.
Unstructured work environment.

16,Telsey Advisory Group,Sales,2015-04-13,1.0,Sales,"Ideal location
Nice office
Generally friendly people in sales","Inexperienced management
Limited long term growth plan
Declining research product
Disgruntled employees"
17,Telsey Advisory Group,Frustrating Experience,2015-02-25,1.0,Sales,"Friendly sales, analyst and trading teams.","Management expectations for a sales person are not realistic.  All good accounts are given to a few core sales women who management are afraid will leave the firm.  New sales people receive accounts which do not care for the firm's product and have already declined service.  Management does not make this known.  They pretend that they are being given huge accounts which present significant opportunity.  New sales people do not last because they are set up to fail from the get go.
The sales team is very hard working.  The main issue is they are forced to sell a weak product.  Most of the research is reviewing earnings reports and reacting to news that already happened.  The analyst team has very little original outside the box content.  They are followers, not leaders.  Starting with the CEO who sets the worst example of poor quality research.  CEO is more busy looking at expense reports than making research calls which will make clients money.
Management is the problem with this firm.  The only manager with Wall St experience is the CEO.  Her experience is as an analyst, not a manager.  Almost everyone who works under the CEO turns over because of very poor communication and social skills.  Emails go unanswered throughout the entire management team.  The main owners of the firm are the most money hungry people you will ever meet, yet they have no realistic plan to grow the firm.
The second largest issue is the CEO also serves as head of research.  There is no sounding board for issues with product.  She is never wrong and doesn't take negative feedback well.  Endless clients has discounted service, yet the CEO continues to pretend this is not happening."

Room for employees be creative.","Not a structured environment.

Upward mobility is limited."
19,Telsey Advisory Group,Lots of freedom but little guidance and support,2013-02-02,3.0,Intern,"The firm is small and entrepreneurial minded with opportunity to take on responsibility.
Company wide events give a sense of community and you get to know most of the firm. 
Good research product and extensive models 
Generally friendly work environment","not a very profitable company yet and management is stingy with pay and resources. 
management seems a bit ""amateurish"""
