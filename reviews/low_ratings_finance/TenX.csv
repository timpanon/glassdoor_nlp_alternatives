1,TenX,Good opportunity,2021-08-09,4.0,Contract Specialist,Good Working Environment. Good office.,Pay not comparable to market
2,TenX,Unappreciated,2021-04-16,1.0,Rubbish Collector,"Good perks, great benefits, a lot of freehand","Many vile and evil people, management is headless"
3,TenX,Won't recommend,2021-03-24,1.0,Operations,"Perks. Food, events, benefits. Great colleagues before everyone left.",Management. Poor executive team. Poor choices made by leaders. Incompetency.
4,TenX,An absolute catastrophe of a company,2021-01-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"There USED TO be many pros, right now it's probably only the generous health insurance.","They will say this was written by a disgruntled employee but so many reviews here stating the same facts cant lie.

The company I loved working for doesn't existe anymore and was killed May 2020 when it was taken over by the Telcoin people with zero track record of previous successes and no qualifications to be holding managerial or exec positions. They ran Telcoin to the ground and jumped ships to suck TenX dry next. 

What happened at TenX and is still happening until now is the following:
- trusted & qualified employees were fired or left 
- trusted & qualified TenX employees who were fired or left were replaced by more Telcoin ppl
- whole teams were fired to be quietly replaced with Telcoin ppl
- there was little to no communication by the new managers with their new team. After they joined, it was announced the company will be restructured and everyone on the team have been living in constant fear they will get fired, as no additional communication followed for weeks. The morale was and still is extremely low and no-one from the execs seem to care. People started searching for new jobs. Trust was broken.
- TenX started working on a new product, Mimo Capital or Mimo Limited, still not sure what the name is but no app or real tangible product is available now, almost 9 months later
- 90% of people from the TenX team left or were fired, company now hires only a bunch of people working remotely across the globe, so no team spirit and u don't know your co-workers anymore but maybe that's the plan
- absolutely zero communication
- zero team management skills from the new managers
- zero trust and it goes both ways, employees don't trust their bosses and the other way around
- decisions are made quickly w/o thinking about the consequences
- looks like they will be moving out of SG
- TenX values that we were all so proud of have gone out of the window...
- Nobody cares about the employees and what they have to say or feel

I could go on for hours. I don't expect the new product Mimo to be successful if it's based on such a wreck as this."
5,TenX,Good place to work,2021-01-20,5.0,Associate Software Engineer,great people to work with,can't think of any cons
6,TenX,"Skeleton staff remains, company is dead in the water",2021-01-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The health insurance is comprehensive.,"Everything else. 

- poor management 
- literally zero communication 
- unskilled executives
- dead product with no customers
- majority of staff have quit, the rest are being fired enmasse
- an irrational and incompetent board that makes decisions without weighing the consequences
- no culture or feeling of teamwork to speak of remaining

The company is completely different to how it was when it was at the peak - making headlines in an exciting space which is what made me want to join. Besides the founders themselves, none of the original team remains that built the product when it was good and functional.

Staff quit on a weekly basis due to how poor the conditions are. Those remaining are simply doing so to have income until they can find almost anything else."
7,TenX,Zombie company with incompetent management,2021-01-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,No longer any pros unfortunately as the new executive team members who lack the skill or track record to manage and lead have truly made this place difficult to work in.,Incompetent leadership with zero empathy or care for employees.
8,TenX,Wouldn't recommend,2020-10-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Great flexibility and trust on employees with lack of micromanagement.,"Total lack of vision from the executives, lack of people approach, lack of communication and lies to the employees, using people like tools in some cases, and absolute lack of transparency. Doesn't feel like a company but rather like working for a bunch of friends who're just doing things for their benefit and will use you for their goal without any consideration to you.

Jobs are also seriously underpaid."
9,TenX,Heavy Politics and Bad Management,2020-09-17,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- 5 Star Staff Benefits (especially the health insurance)
- Flexible working hours","Despite all the good stuff, management does not appreciate our work and the nasty politics causes a lot of turnovers."
10,TenX,An absolute train-wreck of a company,2020-08-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"* There (was) a good office.
* There (were) nice people.
* There (was) a good product.
* There (was) a good vision.","As with any train-wrecks, they're coming unexpectedly and they're disastrous. 

And by the way, the company will make sure to rob you out of any single penny that you would've had when you leave to make sure you left with nothing."
11,TenX,Money burning enterprise - money taken from ICO investors,2020-05-18,1.0,Software Engineer,"Some good people, amazing lavish office and crazy expensive perks","No management
No direction
Money wasted on the office
Money wasted on the team
CEO ineffective as a CEO"
12,TenX,"Young, young glum and croak place",2019-12-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"I joined TenX when it was a small team of not more than 12-15 employees and I’d seen the company throughout different stages, struggles, challenges, and accomplishments. After over two years we’d grown by 5 fold. We were trying to figure out things together as we go and I’m glad I was able to contribute to different areas i.e. branding, product management, project management, quality assurance, company key values and principles (aka culture), hiring, processes, HR, etc.

- An overall friendly environment with quite a few really bright minds to learn from and to work with.
- Relatively open to dialogue and changes work ethics. Although, there’s some getting people on-board and some holding hands into it.
- Resilient in nature, TenX went through a lot of challenges and rough patches and strived through.
- Well-funded startup with a big fan base. Which can be both exciting and stressful due to responsibility for their expectations.
- You can contribute to the company in different ways, not necessarily directly related to your job scope if you choose to.
- Beautiful office with all imaginable perks and full package with insurance and all.","TenX is a young company that is on the verge of figuring out things so it might feel a bit chaotic. It has both worlds of freedom (and flexibility) and policies. The two can clash at times but if you find a way to balance those and manage expectations you can enjoy the benefits of freedom and can feel the impact.

- Clashes of product, startup, corporate, and engineering mindsets.
- Many changes, not all of which are well thought or for a good cause.
- Incompetent management, leadership, and no direction.
- Juggling between corporate policy ethics and flexible results-oriented ethics.
- Lack of experience in product development.
- Some individuals are overtly protective and can get political.
- Poor hiring, stay, exit process. Hiring wrong people, letting go the right ones.
- Poor people and product skills."
13,TenX,CEO is incompetent & toxic culture,2019-09-15,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,employee benefits are very good / they pay lots of money / you don't have to work much.,CEO is incompetent & toxic culture
14,TenX,Company continues to look after us,2019-09-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I wanted to write a review after a few other posts , we are all guessing it’s by the same negative toxic ex-employee. Brother , go find something else to do.

TenX has faced it’s share of troubles over the past two years. When we lost cards in 2018 it was devastating , especially after the success we had! A founder departed earlier this year but it was the right call to remove him. he made it chaotic. It’s now calm and slowly getting more structured. we have cards back and are launching in new countries nearly every month. It’s cool to see our vibe on the upswing again. 

Smart people who work hard 
99% positive people and vibe in the company
Nicest office I’ve ever worked in
Fun Fridays and other events
Catered lunch where we all really do like to eat together
Benefits that cover anything you would possibly need
CEO is really smart , friendly and eats lunch with us everyday
Passion for crypto in most people
Company events 2 times a year for workshops and training
New industry and so many learning opportunities
Flexable hours and remote work is allowed
unlimited annual leave","Engineering & Product teams need help and leadership
1% of the toxic people remain , intent to destroy a good company
Crypto industry is a tough space , hard to get used to the trolls inside and out
Smart people but should share more and teach others"

16,TenX,"Psychotic and dangerous management, fraudulent",2019-08-26,1.0,Developer,"Provides lunch. Flexible work hours.

Total lack of product adoption results in a laid back work atmosphere","Company internals are ravaged by politics, intimidation, threats, employees fired, disappeared,   leaving, and forced out... there is no business strategy or product development

Management and C-level is totally incompetent and only cares about their personal enrichment. Completely corrupt. 

Internal censorship is commonplace and employee communications are monitored and controlled

total lack of accountability can be a plus because employees enjoy free food and income for no work for months or years."
17,TenX,Good company to join,2019-08-22,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Cool, young and well funded.",Too many followers and no true leaders
18,TenX,Great company - very trustworthy CEO,2019-07-05,5.0,Senior Programmer Analyst,"Company is very modern, they are not sparing funds on progress. Management is very honourable and trustworthy. CEO is the most honest person I ever knows. Prosper for future looks extremally well, considering new features are about to be launched in EU and USA after EU","People following company so called community is very demanding, expecting company to give them hard earned cash for nothing. This is a bit depressing."
