3,The Gores Group,Absolutely a brutal place to work,2017-08-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Experience with a turn around of a private equity owned company.,"The group has no real connectivity to their businesses.  They are so short sighted on how to truly turn a business to profitability.  They treat their employees like slaves that should be always focused on what is best for Gores.  Not taking into consideration that the layers of a company work for something different than the short sale.  They lose expertise and the ability to turn and company and maintain it because people get so burned out without raises, bonus, etc.  But the attitude of those interacting with the company is so unprofessional."

8,The Gores Group,The busy life of a Harris Broadcast FE,2015-12-03,4.0,Field Engineer,"Depending on the project and manager, family needs are considered when travel schedules are created.
Good knowledgeable team of FE counterparts to provide one another with support while on the road.
Good in-house travel agency provides logistical support when last-minute travel plans/changes need to be made.

11,The Gores Group,Company,2014-10-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"This is a very exciting industry and the people that you meet are very dynamic.

Money is good as well depending on how well the year goes.","Half the job is work, the other half is navigating your colleagues desire to see someone burned alive.

14,The Gores Group,Watch out,2014-07-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,huge potential great products excellent market,"no imagination at this employer.  if you dare think outside the box or offer a service or solution that you are not directly assigned to do, you are in trouble.  you can not do anything other than what management expects you to do which stifles your creativity and pride to work for this company.  there is no room for people who like to go above and beyond and take pride in their work.  show up, do your job, leave."
15,The Gores Group,Lack of leadership and poor culture makes this a tough place to work,2014-07-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Fund opportunity - Gores is sitting on a lot of dry powder. It has the right model to get deals done, if it could get / keep the right talent and execute.","Culture - Gores leadership has checked out and lacks the drive and energy to do the hard work. They talk a lot about being hard driving, but all the work is done at a junior level. There is no accountability at the top for poor performance.
Leadership - Complete lack of leadership. 
Reputation - Based on prior behavior, Gores has gotten a bad rap in PE. It is rare that seller would want to ever work with Gores again.
Compensation - Bottom decile.
Promotions / growth - Only happens when absolutely necessary. Not based on performance."
16,The Gores Group,Not much good to report with my experience there.,2014-06-25,1.0,Analyst,"Before the company was acquired by Harris, working for the company was on a positive upswing and despite some lack of clear strategic direction in product marketing (domestic vs international) there were some positives... by the time I was laid off, it was pretty miserable overall.","Give the company years and years of your intelligence; dedication; travel; - basically make heaps of sacrifices for the company, and they will lay you off.

17,The Gores Group,Dilbert has entered the building,2014-04-04,1.0,Working Stiff,"This company has so much potential. The company's industry is ever evolving, cutting edge. Until recently, there has been a long history of funding R&D and some decent reward both professionally and financially for the average worker.","A new management culture of DIlbert has taken over. The new pointy hair bosses are spending money on their appearances and taking it away from the people who make them look good - the workers. The Dilbert speak is straight out of the comic pages. The new push for an ""entrepreneurial"" spirit means everyone works longer hours and gets less rewards. The continuing cut in benefits is described as ""industry standard"". The new employee reward strategy is described as ""pay for performance"". Still no raises and fight your fellow employees for the bonuses the top management trickles down."
18,The Gores Group,Baffling lack of focus and direction,2014-03-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Personally my job role was excellent and challenging but only after it was changed several times to suit.,Salary is low. Benefits are low. Morale is rock bottom. Career progression is not possible
19,The Gores Group,Full of Hypocrisy and Enormous Egos,2014-03-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Not much left in the way of Pros.  There is a lot of churn in the organization right now so if you like uncertainty in terms of job security, no work/life balance, and never accepting responsibility for your own work, then this is the place for you.","This place is now full of hypocrisy and lies.  It's really sad because it doesn't need to be this way.  There was so much excitement and hope when The Gores Group first bought Harris Broadcast.  Since then, the new management team has managed to completely kill the morale of the employees.

Some examples of the hypocrisy include:
1.  Saying we're developing a ""start up"" culture then implementing policies that don't apply across the board like a three-tier travel and expense policy based on your reporting distance from the CEO.  Last time I checked, people in start-ups were all about doing whatever it takes to get things done without anyone getting special treatment.

2.  Saying the people in the company are the most important resource then treating them like crap with no salary increases, no merit pay, lower benefits, layoffs, working weekends, berating in public forums, etc.

3.  Saying that everyone should focus on cost savings then throwing extravagant sales events and traveling on first class fares and in limos (see #1).

The work environment has become toxic.  So many people with rich background and experience are gone that the new management team is left with many gaps in knowledge.  It's only a matter of time before everything implodes."
20,The Gores Group,Churn of employees is very damaging,2014-02-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The downward spiral of falling Orders/Revenue seems to have leveled off.
Decent pay if you are a new or recent hire.","Employee morale is at an all time low.
No raises for the majority of existing employees.
Management does not seem to care how many bodies are trampled on so long as the job gets done.
Lack of systems investment. Financial systems are on releases so old that they are no longer supported by the vendor.
Employee churn means many people have no knowledge of how to do the job they are asked to do.
Little to no documentation of processes and procedures.
Career advancement is negligible."
21,The Gores Group,Toxic Working Environment,2014-01-26,1.0,,"Working with some really, good, smart people (although you can count one one hand the number of them left).ree

Since there are so many layoffs and constant churn, your job responsibilities usually increase three fold and your job duties change constantly to pick up the slack.  I guess you can look at this as career opportunities, even though you are working 50+ hours a week just to keep up with the workload.","I wasn't going to post here until I saw the BS post by some HR flak (Right time, Right Place....really??).  
This place was once a really dynamic place to work.  It started going downhill when Harris Corp. sold them off for pennies of what it's worth.  Ever since, Gores - and especially the new Genband management - have created an environment of toxicity, fear, 24/7 work mentality and lack of caring toward it's employees (unless you came from Genband).

-Environment: Don't take the job unless you want to commute to downtown Denver.  Management is moving out of the Tech Center office to a lot smaller space.  This is due to reduction in staff due to layoffs, firings, attrition and corporate position moving to the Genbander's home of Frisco.  

-IT: No capital spend on new equipment.  The laptop I was given got the blue screen of death a year into its use.  Was told they aren't spending on new equipment so you get to roll the dice on antiquated, refurbished hardware to do your job.

-Culture:  The new management team has thrown the line of ""creating a new culture.""  What this really means is you are at management's beckon call 24/7.  If you don't embrace the 24/7 work style set forth by the new CEO, in his words ""I don't have a position or need for you here.""  Culture is management by fear.  I remember an email chain one day telling the new CEO something is being worked on to get completed.  His response ""will work faster.""  This type of management doesn't work anymore Charlie.
Culture is also planning extravagant retreats to the tune of $1.5million - only a select few (including the Genband team) get to attend.  This is in spite of no salary increases or spend related to invest in employees.

Pay - That culture consists of no raises in salary, any salary increase is ""pay based on performance"" but no one has explained what that means or how to meet the criteria.  No raises -even cost of living increases- in three plus years.  This is exacerbated by the fact that the benefits, including health coverage, have deteriorated since Gores took over the company.

Staff - They let go a lot of really good, knowledgeable people in the industry.  Competitors have reaped the rewards because the number of people who were laid off, fired or left on their own have jumped to competing companies.  What's left are a bunch of people from telecom who don't realize the huge learning curve in terms of knowledge and culture needed to succeed in this industry."
22,The Gores Group,Helped shape my professional career,2014-01-23,3.0,Anonymous Employee,I was in R&D and had the pleasure of working with a lot of great people.  Harris Broadcast is at the forefront of broadcast media technology.  They have some of the best and the brightest minds in the business.,"Since separating from Harris Corporation and overhauling management, the company doesn't seem to care as much about it's employee's unless you are in Sales.  I was there for 10+ years and we only got raises about half of the years I was there."

Employees with no leadership.",2014-01-15,1.0,Marketing,Salary and benefits were on par for the industry.  There was a decent work-life balance.,Management does not actively participate or organize (or seem to care) about employee satisfaction or lead effectively or knowledgeably.  Wide employee dissatisfaction and sense of hopelessness about the company's direction.
24,The Gores Group,"Right Time, Right Place",2014-01-15,5.0,Manager,Harris Broadcast is investing in the next generation of technology.  Increases to R&D budget and acquiring new companies that line up with vision for next wave of emerging products.  This company is very sound financially and is making all the investments to continue leading in its industry.,This is a time of transition and transition means change.  We have let employees with negative outlooks go so that we can truly focus on building careers for the go-getters that want to be part of our success.
25,The Gores Group,Management by fear culture driven by new CEO that has transplanted half his old company (Genband) into various positions,2013-12-28,1.0,Engineering,"Some of the ""old regime"" still remaining.  Those are very good people

-Layoffs a routine occurrence 
-No salary increases or performance incentives (at least in the past 3+ years); instead money is spent on lavish ""retreats""
-Seat of your pants decisions being made without much thinking behind them"

Time off was reduced.  Healthcare costs increased.  401ks reduced.  If you don't have Genband (new CEOs former company) on your resume, you're treated like an outcast.  You're expected to be at new management's beckon call 24-7.  If not, you're ""let go.""  Corporate headquarters moving to Frisco - right next door to the CEO's old office (ego war).  Constant change, instability, and wonder as to ""what's next.""  No salary increases, yet the company can spend $1.5 million on a ""retreat."""

The markets are global, and there is a strong team.","Senior management changes on a regular basis. My experience is that the new CEO makes decisions rapidly and without really gathering the data. He is very successful however, so this may move from being a highly unsettling place to work to being a dynamic place."

Clearly, they intend to remake the organization, but have no value for existing team's industry relationships and domain knowledge."
31,The Gores Group,It slices!  It Dices!,2013-10-18,2.0,Engineer,Interesting work with cutting edge technology.,Management doesn't talk to each other.  Restructuring for its own sake is not the same as progress.

Ability to travel for work depending on the position.,"Salary compensation is a joke. At times Engineering will hire someone with zero broadcast experience and pay them the same amount of money as someone with 7 years or more.

Benefits are marginal

This company does not encourage personal growth. Engineers, support techs, marketing guys get passed over for Management positions in favor of bringing in people from the outside who don't know any better.

No direction or vision.

Over promising and under delivering.

Money wasting. This company simply care for sales numbers. When it comes to margins, it looks the other way. Either way, we're discounting the products heavily and giving away support, Field Engineering services for pennies."

Compensation seems pretty good, at least under Harris Corporation.",Harris Broadcast (formerly Harris Broadcast Communications Division) has experienced sliding revenue for the past 3 years.  This has meant multiple lay-offs and eventually a disastrous company sale process which lead to more lay-offs.  Most of the senior team has been replaced.
38,The Gores Group,"It has so much potential, that will never be realized with the current management team",2013-05-21,2.0,Senior Hardware Design Engineer,Products good. Engineers very good. The diverse group of employees makes the company interesting to work for.,"Management
