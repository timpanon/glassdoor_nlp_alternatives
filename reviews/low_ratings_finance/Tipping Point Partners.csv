0,Tipping Point Partners,Great culture but lacked a cohesive business model,2015-10-17,2.0,,"TPP was comprised of a smart and talented team of software engineers, project managers and business development professionals. There was a great sense of camaraderie, especially among the junior staff members. Benefits, including unlimited vacation days, were generous, but the pay was slightly below average. The shared office space was great for natural networking with other startup companies.","The executive teamed lacked a cohesive vision of how the company would achieve revenue growth. There was high turnover within the executive team, which reflected lack of careful consideration before hiring an expensive team of seasoned executives to ""right the ship."" For a lot of talk about high profile prospective clients and potential wins from the executive team, there was very little actual deals closed."
