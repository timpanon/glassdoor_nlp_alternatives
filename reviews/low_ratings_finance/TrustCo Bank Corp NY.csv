0,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,AWFUL,2022-03-31,1.0,Teller,the people you work with,"Everything. The pay was bad, upper management was rude and disrespectful. Trustco can barely keep employees because they treat them bad. Little to no training and constantly being short staff. It's a great place to start since they would hire anybody."
1,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,horrible internal team Great Branch staff,2022-03-29,2.0,Senior Associate Banker,Branch staff is usually great and a pretty easy job,"lowest paying bank
internal department will make life a nightmare
job security is low and always moving employees to different locations witout notice"
2,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,Terrible company,2022-03-25,1.0,Universal Banker,"Compensation, effective training, nice customers","Management, travel, hours, everything else"
3,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,2022-03-18,1.0,Assistant Manager,"The ONLY pros are the coworkers- because most people share the same negative view working for this company, and most of my coworkers were very pleasant to work with.","Where do I even start...

When I interviewed for this position, I was lied to about the travel by the hiring manager. They are so desperate to get people because the turnover rate is so high, that they will literally lie to your face to get you to work here.

Upper management does not care at all, there are certain managers that should have been fired a long time ago but are somehow still there, and you get paid .35 a mile for all the traveling - often up to an hour away, this company makes you do.

The organization and communication between employees and upper management is non - existent."
4,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,Decent job for people just starting their career,2022-02-25,1.0,Business Banker,"Promotional opportunities, no degree required.","They treat their employees terribly. Long hours, no extra compensation. Very old school technology and systems, makes it a very slow paced turn around time on anything and everything."
5,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,Lots of stuff left out,2022-02-16,1.0,Teller,none that I could think of,"A lot gets left out during the hiring and training process. The position was M-F from 9 am to 3 pm. Told during training that staff has to work at other branches on Saturdays and other days when needed to fill in due to staff shortages. no say in where one gets sent to work.

Pre-employment consists of being grilled about using Trustco and ONLY Trustco for all your banking. One of the biggest red flags was that you are forced to open a savings account as an employee in order to get paid. It's not allowed to simply get a paper check or direct deposit into your existing bank account with another bank.

Training is a joke. Just reading out of a binder. The training was 5 days long. At the end of the training, there is an ""exam"" of over 60 questions and passing is 80% or better.  failing the exam is common because the material was not taught, just recited. 

At the branches, new workers are left alone to handle things. It was an unmitigated disaster. Not common for staff to be sent to a branch up to 55 miles away due to staff shortages.

The technology being used by Trustco is very outdated. Still paper-based and they just now introduced an online banking system, which is completely broken. 

Pay is 15/hr. I guess that's not horrible for a college student but it won't work for adults with bills, especially when other banks are paying much more. The turnover here is extremely high.

Trustco seems like it would be a good and stable fit but it is very outdated and workers are at the mercy of the company despite what the job description states. 

Not recommending anyone work here."

24,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,Worth a try,2021-08-26,3.0,Assistant Branch Manager,Corporate leadership truly wants to connect with the employees running their branches and many internal employees claimed they were promoted from within.,This position was boring but the pay did not match the level of responsibility for this position. Although there were not enough daily tasks to fill your day and help the time pass any mistakes made on the teller line we’re directly traced back to you. The internal departments are out of touch with the idea of customer service and do not prioritize based on the customer need. This meant I took all of the slack for transactional wait time with no urgency from the teams able to process the transactions.

Large turnover because you are just a body in a chair. upper management is so out of touch with branches.

Pay is low, raises are few, and employee turnover is high. The job is high-stress. There are employee shortages due to burnout and poor management. Some are lucky to have a good manager (I was)--but nearly all of upper management will cut your throat for advancement or to save the bank a few dollars. Rumors and gossip are the backbone of the company. The physical/mental health of their employees are of no consequence to Trustco. Voicing concerns may cause retaliation from human resources. 

If you still decide to work for Trustco Bank, I recommend you read the handbook carefully --specifically PTO. After I put in &and  completed my two weeks notice, I had 8 days of PTO saved. Due to the poor wording of the handbook, I was blindsided when I only received 2 hours pay. I also recommend you continue your job search and find something better as quickly as possible.

They are supposed to manage the branches but fail tremendously. They lack people skills, they take things personally if you question them. They will single you out and if you are smart and call them out on their BS they will make sure either resign or get fired.  They have different rules for different people. They will even tell you to lie to the higher-ups in order to show everything at the branch level is okay. You will always be short-staffed, ill-equipped and stressed out. If you love your sanity please be aware, they have no loyalty you can make every goal and customers could love you but if for any reason branch admin doesn't like you, you will become a target. This company has old technology in every aspect, not even 3rd world county banks use the software these guys use. Its all about saving money and making the company rich, they will do the bare minimum for the customers. NO ONE will ever admit their mistakes, they will shift blame like no other. There are too many politics & power-hungry people who let that power get to their heads. Thank God I'm out of that place, I feel like a burden has been lifted from my chest."
98,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,Frustrating,2019-09-22,3.0,Branch Manager,Tuesday hours are till 3,Most managers are to young for position.

99,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,absolutely NOT,2019-09-12,1.0,Assistant Branch Manager,"my co workers, the customers","where do i even start??? this company is a MESS. i cannot emphasize ENOUGH on how unorganized, unfair, rude and ignorant a lot of people in upper management are. They treat you like you are nothing. They make you travel anywhere and everywhere and do not CARE if you can make it or not. I have seen people get fired for absolutely NO reason. I have witness people quit, walk out, submit their resignation ALL because of upper management. Trustco is a small bank, ran by 12 people TOPS in upper management. The FEMALES love to gossip and bring drama into the work place. They constantly treat you like you are nothing. They talk to you like you are nothing. The pay ??? TRASH. You do not get paid enough for HALF the stuff you have to do. I seen customers close all their accounts because of TRUSTCO. There have been so many complaints about upper management and nothing has been done. They have interferred with people's personal lives and thats NOT okay.

It's and old bank in a lot of ways, they need to update on many levels. Working at the customer service department you realize how bad some things are done in the branches, mostly because of unexperienced employees who don't know what to do and don't ask before acting. There's so many ways they can improve and get better but i don't see that happening anytime soon."
117,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,Unhappy.,2018-03-30,1.0,Teller,The other tellers I work with are the best. Very hardworking and caring people. I love the customers that come into our branch.,Everything else. My branch manager was hired outside of the company (previously worked for keybank) and has been here for 5 months and still doesn’t know what she’s doing. There is always a branch that is robbed at least once every other month. The pay isn’t worth the stress that head tellers and tellers go through. Branch Admin and higher ups do not care about their employees unless they are a branch manager or higher. Tellers are the ones that deal with customers the most and are treated the worst. They are an extremely conservative bank and very judgmental. We are the only bank that still use outdated equipment from the 80s. I’m just simply unhappy and hope to leave this place soon.
118,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,I expected better!,2018-03-20,1.0,Former Manager,"The pros of the company are how quickly people are in and out of the company, you have the opportunity for advancement.","The structure of the company in how they operate. Some higher ups make their employees feel uncomfortable. You don’t have to like who you work with  but you should respect each other because you need each other to work as a team.  

It’s understood that the bank is founded out of Schenectady and the corporate offices are far away from many branches. But there has to be accommodations for communication and training other than making employees drive 1 1/2 away! Nobody wants to get home after 6pm! There is too much technology now available to us to have a meeting about the number people that used an ATM at each branch! That’s irrelevant."
119,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,Worst job I have ever had,2018-03-13,1.0,Teller,"Branches are clean. The branch managers were nice, administration is horrible though.","Teller pay is bad and there’s no negotiating. They favor Hispanics. They will fire you if you sneeze wrong. The training is a joke and you will be unprepared if you don’t have a good lead teller. You pretty much have to teach yourself everything and as soon as you finally get it all, then BOOM, they fire you and won’t tell you why."
120,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,The worst experience so far in banking. PROFESSIONALS STAY AWAY FROM THIS BANK.,2018-03-08,1.0,Assistant Branch Manager,"Quick promotions.

If you are not academically prepare if you dont speak any English if you are lazz, if you dont care about learning and being a professional, if you wanted to have people treating you as peace of garbage, if you like to be very underpaid with a lot of responsibilities, This is the right bank for you, you must apply today. THEY ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE OF THE TURNOVER. The good employees leave, the unprofessional scumbags stay for the minimum salary with no comision, only one day off.with no tranning deal they offer... the 250 to get hire, you will get that after 2 months to on sing in ad they said. They offer that to get stupid people to apply, they do not offer anything competitive.","Promotions due to lack of employees so there are to many positions to cover they promote stupid people with no preparation. THEIR MANAGERS NON OF THEN HOLD BA AT LEAST. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT? Lowest salary in FL banks, Worst technology, worst management, worst support, worst operational procedures, worst trainning, worst human resources, rude and unproffesiobal people in main office in NY and Branch Administration In Florida.  The bank is so old that cash deposit after closing day goes in the acc next day. Managers are unprofessional not academically prepared, they are lazzy, rude, not loyal to the bank or the employees, Branch administration is just trash. Only one day off, work 6 days,no over time ever, no comissiions except for the managers, managers comissions are to low,  no coverage in the branches for 30 minutes break if you dont take brak the break will be deducted anyways and you will have issues with branch admin.  They mess with employees for stupid things and not for important issues. You can be in 2 branches one day they dont care about distances, never will be working close.to your home they do not allow that, bank procedures to old, no security  no professionalism  no compliance, FDIC should sheck on this bank.

If you resign, vacation time is owed to you (but you’ll need to read the employee handbook to know exactly how much you qualify for upon your resignation). 6 paid sick days annually, which roll over every year if they don’t get used. Great stepping stone to learn from if interested in joining the banking industry. Excellent healthcare benefits and 401k match program. Genuine opportunity for growth in the FL and Capital Region, NY Branches, not necessarily the Downstate, NY branches. Working in the branches with other staff members was very positive. Other branches are always willing to help each other out with scheduling and questions about how to do things. Branch staff becomes a bit like an extension of your family. TrustCo really does hire friendly people, for the most part.","Wouldn’t recommend staying beyond 3 years. Stay to learn what you can and move on to a better financial institution. Upper management always had issues with high employee turn over. Scheduling in the branches was extremely dysfunctional. Upper management didn’t seem to truly value employees, unless those employees were at the top of the sales charts. Coverage requests were rarely granted and if they were, often coverage would be pulled due to scheduling issues in other branches. Especially if your branch is slow, a busier branch will always take priority. The slow branches are painful to work in, not enough work to keep your mind busy. Unfortunately, coverage is always taken from you to go to busier branches. Which makes it harder to get out of the branches and generate new business, making it impossible to meet the sales goals required for each branch.  It’s a little catch-22. Pay isn’t as competitive as it needs to be in the downstate area. Slow response time with customer issues."

182,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,A great place to learn and gain valuable experience.,2015-04-02,3.0,,"They will fully train you in the ways of old fashioned banking. The customers, once warmed up to you will turn into the best part of your day. They are a true community bank.",You will go a few hours a day without any customers and when you do finally get someone through the door the other two tellers in the line are doing what they can as well to service them. This is not out of competition but sheer boredom. Be careful of who you are working with and the conversations you have. Everything you say can and will be used against you.

187,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,Unappreciative of employees hard work and efforts,2015-02-02,2.0,Management,It is a great place to learn how to be a teller or manager. Being a teller at this company is very easy and perfect for a college student looking for a job. The customers are always a pleasure to talk to and service. The company does pride itself in its customer service towards its customers.,Trustco does not pay the tellers and the managers what they are worth. The hours are long and there always seems to be a shortage in the staff. It has a very high turn around rate. They just can't seem to keep their employees. The managers are required to do more than managers that are at other banks. Other banks have several experts to do certain positions at the branch level. The salary for a manager at Trustco is very low for the amount of workload and requirements that is expected of them.
188,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,I have had an enjoyable time at Trustco.,2015-01-20,5.0,Manager,"It's a good job, friendly staff with pretty decent room for upward mobility.","Not too many cons, some times lack of staff."
189,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,Perfect college job,2015-01-07,4.0,Head Teller,"This job is perfect for anyone while they're in college. It pays better than minimum wage, you get vacation and sick time and paid holidays off. It's pretty basic, if you can run a cash register than you can be a teller.",Sometimes the company is a little too focused on things that are unobtainable. Technology is very outdated. While the pay is better than minimum wage other banks are paying 2-4 dollars more an hour to do the same job.
190,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,Run away quick,2014-12-23,1.0,,Customers are great! This is pretty much all that is a plus about this customer.,"Machines that employees are expected to use are literally from the Stone Age! The only use of an actual computer that is used is to update a customers passbook savings account and to hold a check. Cash is not immediately posted to a customers account UNLESS they ask for it to be. If they don't, it will post on the next business day! So DO NOT DEPOSIT CASH AFTER 2 pm on Friday because it will not post until Monday night."
191,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,"If you have banking experience, don't waste your time and energy with Trustco",2014-12-18,1.0,Assistant Manager,Small bank atmosphere and loving customers,"Let's begin. The pay is outrageously low!! They pay you $0.35 per miles, when the state of Florida by the IRS should be $0.56.  They still $0.21 from each mile that the employee drove as per their request.  This has to be illegal somehow. Then you get categorize as “not a team player”, because you don’t want to drive around for hours and cover other branches.  The ""technology"" consists of machines that haven't been used since the Flingstone’s era. I'm honestly amaze that people are still satisfied banking with this place, of course their main client base is made up of people who probably are not up with the 2000 technology.  Some clients are ok that when they deposit cash, it will be posted the next day.  CASH!!! It should be available the same day! The entire operation is run very shoddily.  When an employee gives a recommendation or their opinion, they will take it as a negative input.  This company DON’T WORK PRO-ACTIVE, THEY WORK REACTIVE.  They react depending on the situation.  Their answer to everything is; call the next branch.  The BOM manual that is on line is ridiculous, have of the procedures are under construction, the information is incomplete.  The physical book at the branches, are from the 2004.  For a banking prospective, the rules, procedures and regulations change constantly.  The management recommendation is to contact other branches and get your answer.  

The training is very poor, awful or a joke.  The teller training, you are suppose to go to another site, however, don’t expect for them to pay for a hotel.  Their expectation is for you to drive from point A to B daily, regardless of the distance.  I was supposed to be train at the branch for the teller training.  WHAT A JOKE, you received a manual after two week of been there. The only training that I got was a huge binder and the trainer went thru each page and discusses each item, once a week.  However, not everything is in that manual.  Their management skills are horrible. Sometimes, not even a good morning.  Where do they get some of these managers, from under a rock?  They don’t want to help, since the majority doesn’t hold college degrees and are very insecure.  However, little that they know, you can be a very successful person with out a degree. A good manager, will train the person under them, to be able to grow, learn and take over a new journey. 

Supply, if you want something that will help you ease your production, please purchase the item yourself.  If you ask for two rims of paper, you will receive one, The supply is always cut in half.  I have seen branches ran out of paper, and the manager in charge has to run to the nearest supermarket and purchase some.  If you ask for steers for the coffee, they will sent you a hand full of maybe 25 in plastic bag for the branch.  Why having coffee machines, when half of the time, the branches run out of coffee for the customers."
192,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,resume builder,2014-09-03,3.0,Branch Manager,it's a good learning experience. builds your resume. try to move people around from within the company.,unless you work in new york or orlando there is no much opportunity to get promoted. huge communication gaps

I interviewed for a part time teller by phone and was then contacted to interview for a branch manager position.","After interviewing for two positions, I was offered a different position.  The job offer for an assistant branch manager, which requires travel to different locations, paid $28,000 a year.  Average salary for assistant branch manager in this area is $38,000 a year.  They were unwilling to get closer to decent salary. Job offer was not accepted."

201,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,"Low pay, even lower appreciation.",2013-03-10,1.0,Teller,"The only pros I can come up with are the people I work with. Honestly, they are the reason I haven't gone out of my mind working for this company.","Ha! Well, let's begin. The pay is outrageously low, especially when newer hires are just starting who make more than the people who have been there for a time do. This has to be illegal somehow. There is something seriously wrong when someone who is just starting makes even a dollar more than someone who has more experience, how can they justify this logically!?. The ""technology"" consists of machines that haven't been used since the caveman era. I'm honestly shocked that people are still satisfied banking with this place, of course their main client base is made up of people who probably knew God personally so this is understandable because these people are so set in their ways they refuse to change anything. The hours are ridiculous, there is no need to stay open until 6 four nights out of five, maybe they could keep the hours on Friday but even that is a stretch, and opening the drivethru at 8 is completely unnecessary as my branch does not get any customers at the window until eithr 8:30 or even closer to 9. The entire operation is run very shoddily with little to no appreciation for the ""lower end"" employees, it's no wonder the place has so much turnover."
202,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,Not worth it,2013-01-09,1.0,Branch Manager,Manager - Looks good on a resume,"Where do I begin

Hours - This is a joke and I would love to know how they even get away with it. We work 8 to 9 hours a day with no break. How can you take a break when there are only 2 employees at a time in the branch? Sometimes there are 3 employees, however it is usually 2 Tellers and 1 Platform. The Tellers can not relieve the Platform for lunch due to not being cross trained. So Platform can not take a lunch but yet is docked for it. Thursday and Fridays we work until 10 hour days and again for Platform, i.e. Managaer or Assistnat Manager we work the full 10 with no break. How can you allow this? You rotate your assistant managers between 2 or more branches in any given week and if the assistant goes over on time the Manager gets written up for allowing over time. I mean are they serious. 

Security - You put my life and other employees life in danger. If a robber wanted to rob a bank, this would be the place. Again - the staffing is a concern and not to mention the locations of some of these branches are a concern as well. For instance your Sweetwater branch, its at the back of a plaza located off a side road with poor lighting. Can we talk about fearing for ones life. 

Pay - This is equally a joke. As a manager you expect us to handle the branch staff, make business calls, realtor calls, work long hours with no breaks and write up and process all loans, including MORTGAGES.... and only pay base of $32k minimum. REALLY????

Shops - Trustco Bank does its own shops on their employees. These shops consist of sending another employee from New York to Florida. The employee then goes into each branch in Florida makes a deposit and then speaks briefly to the Manager or Assistant Manager. Then compiles a report to the ""Area Manager"" and based on that report and rating determines if that Manager is going to receive incentive pay. 8 out of 10 times the New York employee doesn't give good reports. Managers get chewed if the report states that the Manager did not stand up to greet them. However, I will state I stood every time and still was told I did not stand. Are you kidding me - we knew it was a shop one because the other nraches called ahead and gave a description of the person and 2 the moment they made a deposit into their own Trustco account and we seen it was a NY account we knew. So who are they fooling and bottom line this is just a way to not pay incentives to your employees."
203,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,"Irregular schedules, little consistancy.",2013-01-06,2.0,Assistant Manager,"-Some of the managers will truly take you under their wing and give you ""on your feet"" training.  That will serve you well in the future. 
-You will gain experience that will transfer well to another bank when you leave after 6 months.","-The schedules are constantly changing 
-Low pay
-Very Very little recognition for Assistant Managers and Tellers
-Extremely poor management training
-Extensive travel (sometimes being told at 8am that you have to go to a branch AN HOUR away)
-Terrible bank software and systems
-Terrible hours (8 - 6 is a little insane when NO ONE comes in past 5)
-No commission for the Assistant Managers who do all the traveling and write ups."
204,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,"We Lie, We Cheat, and we Steal...",2012-12-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,They teach you the best ways to con customers and cheat the system to add fees where other banks would not dare.,Banking system is way out of date.  I could have stole more of our customers money faster if they just update there network.
205,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,honestly dont care about their employees,2012-11-04,1.0,,Good place to work at if you have a good branch manager and head teller,Low pay will transfer you randomly even if you dont have  transportation
206,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,No go Trustco,2012-08-20,1.0,Assistant Manager,...... looks good on the resume,"1) Branch management training is very poor. After a week of going through teller training you are put into the branches as a teller for two weeks than put into their training program for 6 weeks once a week. Training is awful and is often left to the managers in the branches to help assist you. 

2) LOW LOW LOW PAY! - hourly pay is just not cutting it when you get 0 COMMISSION on writting up morgages/refi/ HECL's. 

3) Traveling!- Customers complain about not seeing the same manager every week. since this is a floating position, you are sometimes put into 2 different branches in one days time. 

4) Poor employee appreciation. Tellers and managers seem worn out, and often not to pleasant to new faces(employees) 

5) Higher up management is a joke. These people dont have college degrees and make their employees stressed with ""shopps"" and have little appreciation of what lengths managers and tellers go through day in and day out."

208,TrustCo Bank Corp NY,Lacking in recognition of employees at branch level,2011-02-17,2.0,,onw of the better reasons to work for trustco is that it is relativly an asy job as a teller. doing the same things day in and day out makes it easy to learn and knowwhat you are doing. also having interaction with some of the reat customers makes it worth it.,"trustco tends to pay their employees less then other banks would for doing the same amount of work.  the hours are poor, being that we are scheduled to be at he branch when there are NO customers. poor use of resorces"
