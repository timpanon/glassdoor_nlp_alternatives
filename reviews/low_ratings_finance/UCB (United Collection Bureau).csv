0,UCB (United Collection Bureau),10 Out Of 10 Don't Recommend!,2022-03-22,1.0,Collector,The only pro for me was the Trainer Ann. She is the light that holds the company together.,"I have several Cons that people should take into consideration before applying. 

There is no direct way to reach anyone for questions. The only way to reach anyone is by email and that normally never gets responded to or you get a rude response. The supervisors will send emails back and forth talking down about new hires or other employees. 

When patients want a call back from a supervisor they do not call them back and usually get sent to collections. Then you have to explain that you have no way to reach anyone except by email.

When your a new hire they will threaten to write you up instead of teaching you the right way to do things or tag higher ups in the emails to make it look like you was the one doing wrong.


Human Resources will mess up all of your payroll and insurance and will tell you to contact a professional to have it fixed and will not help you with anything.

The pay is a joke for all the mental stress you have to deal with and on top of that they have a way of making it a stressful job when they mess up patients payments and it makes it look like money is missing but it falls on the collector and the supervisor is the one at fault.

They show a lot of favoritism and if you have system issues and someone has to collect a payment for you even thought it is the companies system issue they will let the person whom took it get credit especially if its one of the favorites. They make sure you cant meet any monthly goals.

The hours dont really change unless you move to taking different types of calls but I didnt like the hours either.

If you have a prehire date plan to get wrote up unless you show detailed documentation on why you was not present even if you told them when hired and in advanced about the date. If your out for anything COVID related documentation don't matter its still a write up.

There is no option for advancement. The turnover rate is so unreal for the company as well."

6,UCB (United Collection Bureau),Revolving door with high turn over rates,2021-11-09,2.0,Collections Specialist,Relaxed work environment and relatively flexible work hours. The people were generally pleasant to work with.,Difficulty making a commission check. It was almost as if the company went out of their way to prevent you from being able to make a commission check. They claimed to be flexible with your schedule but truly weren't. Advancement was limited and they lacked uniformity in general collections processes. You basically had to guess if you were doing your job right everyday.

28,UCB (United Collection Bureau),This place is a joke.,2020-04-24,1.0,Customer Service Associate,It’s a job and pays.,"You are tied to a phone with only a lunch break. Half the time while you are on the phone you are hearing your supervisor yell “wrap it up we have calls in cue!”  Not very professional when you have customers on the phone that can hear that as if you are working in a sweat shop. You are expected to collect payments from patients to hit a monthly goal to get your monthly bonus. You are pretending to be an employee of a hospital in their billing office. I read the description of the job about it being a clean environment not even close. The bathrooms are filthy, so filthy that they have posting for you to clean up after yourself.  Which leads me to my final point they hire any and everyone. The management staff are not welcoming they act as if you are beneath them and look down their noses at you and barely speak back to you. Needless to say I felt really bad for the people that work there the turnover rate is really high and the employees are not treated very well and those that are, are in cliques almost like high school. 
Expectations on bonuses. You can only collect what customers are able to pay and when the call comes in you don’t know how much that payment is going to be."

They will find a way not to pay out commission. I don't think they realize that commissions are considered wages in the state of Florida. For those tenured collectors who took the job based on commission payout with the understanding that there is a multiplier you must meet, you get paid a percentage of the overage fee you collect reguardless of the account age, your oral agreement was broken."

Nothing easy in this life is good and nothing good in this life is easy.  If you work hard, you will be rewarded."
34,UCB (United Collection Bureau),Upper Management Are Horrible!,2019-02-03,1.0,Collections Specialist,Flexibility is this employees only positive!!,"HR will severally over exaggerated commission potential during hiring process. The company has strategically hindered any possibility of making a commission by re-calibrating payout rates, corruptly use QA  to disqualify you for a commission check. They preach a collection strategy of setting up post dated payment plans to ensure hitting your goal. But they have boldly implemented a policy in which they will take your accounts with negotiated payment plans if they extend beyond a certain term. This is a key strategy they have used that has stifled the entire staff from hitting their required goals & making commissions. They have a collection policy that encourages collectors to steal accounts from each other in order to get paid. As a Collector Manager UCB will also sabotage your ability of making a commission by with corrupt QA rules, bogging you down with ridiculous redundant metric reports & account reviews all while being understaffed.  Management also has no empathy for any family emergency, pregnancy, or dire health issue that will require taking a day off.  I along with at least 13 others have chosen to step down from being a manager because the corruption & abuse by upper management along with being severely underpaid  is unbearable. They recently lied to employees about job security during a job site location change & did a massive unexpected firing with more layoffs to come. When upper management was confronted by their commission hindering  policy's by every top collector on a floor meeting her ""Christy"" only response was ""We will check into it"". The following day some of the outspoken top collectors were passively threatened about their job security by the owner making a rare appearance walking the floor. Management has also reneged on their promise that specific portfolios of ours would not be worked by other offices which has further hindered the ability to get paid a commission. The company has received very large concessions from the state of Indiana to open a collection a competing collection facility as well as additional monies allocated to train & hire staff. This Indiana office has increasingly been taking on more of our workload & they have forced us to work their portfolio  which we are not allowed to get paid for. Bottom line is within the last 2 years UCB management has implemented policies to have us negotiated & collect massive amounts of money and not pay their collectors on it. With the financial incentives they have publicly been awarded by the state of Indiana. In my opinion their will soon be no reason to employ a south Florida location that has already been downsized. One last thing I have confirmed with over 11 former employees. UCB will fire you in a maliciously calculating way and deny your unemployment."
