0,US Postal Service FCU,What office you go to will make or break your choice to stay,2022-02-01,1.0,RCA (Rural Mail Carrier Sub),Delivering mail was great and I loved that part of the job the most. Had some amazing coworkers that I'll really miss.,"Only work with people take time off in smaller offices. You either are being worked to death or not at all. Forced to help other offices you've never been trained on. They say if you have issues, go to your union however, no one likes to call anyone back and you're left reaching out to anyone and everyone for answers that no one seems to know. Managers in some office are incredibly unprofessional. The overall stress of the unknown was just not worth the time."
