0,Uamc,Pros and cons,2020-06-10,3.0,Mortgage Loan Underwriter,People are friendly. Good team atmoaphere.,Hard to grow. Training is self taught on your own time.
1,Uamc,Great Company,2019-02-25,5.0,IT Support Technician,"Stability, Great Pay and benefits",Parking really difficult to park.
2,Uamc,SweatShop,2018-04-27,2.0,Loan Processor,They'll stuff you with local takeout till you develop Stockholm syndrome.,More competitive than team oriented and micromanaging.
3,Uamc,Great Company,2017-07-26,4.0,Senior Loan Processor,"Great environment and coworkers, love the people,  always busy, and job stability","you become overworked and overloaded sometimes, must  be knowledgeable when you start, little to no training"
4,Uamc,Lack of training,2017-05-16,3.0,Funder,"Gain experience in the mortgage field, Build your network, competitive pay for experienced individuals, learning TRID, FHA, VA, BONDS, and CONV.","Lack of communication, lack of training, lack of knowledge, lack of problem solving. Alot of repetitive issues get tossed around instead of resolved."
5,Uamc,Sweat Shop,2017-05-16,2.0,Loan Processor,"Decent pay, catered meals.  The very few people that had yet to drink the Kool-Aid were nice.","Upholds industry reputation for being a sweatshop. MICROMANAGING!! Mandatory Saturday's!! Lack of training! Mgmt was inconsistent across the floor. Some had enough free time to read Skypes, emails, and time restroom visits. Would lie about rules that did not exist (i.e. ""a minimum of 5 loans must be worked per day when using the calendar system."") Competitive instead of team-oriented. The builder was breathing down on LO's and operations to meet unnecessary goals and expectations (i.e. loan is closing in 9 months but it has to be ""approved pending the appraisal"" ASAP). Borrowers were difficult because the process was so frustrating for them. Processors were at the bottom of the totem pole, and weren't allowed direct communication with certain underwriters. We received companywide, passive-aggressive emails with photos of bad parking jobs, and messy bathroom reports. Attended a meeting where they scolded all females because a used tampon was left on a toilet seat. Serious gossip problem perpetuated by managers (unable to trust the person sitting next to you isn't spying on you). Thankless job with little to no advancement opportunities."
6,Uamc,"Great process and overall morale, but micro-managing at its absolute WORST!",2017-05-09,2.0,Mortgage Loan Processor,The process is smooth and if you get the right manager I'm sure it's a great place to work.,"The level of micro-managing is crippling! I'm sure if you get a decent manager your experience could be very different, but I think that goes for most jobs. If you're unlucky as I have been, then suffer through being told what to do all day and having orders barked at you or jump ship!"
7,Uamc,Changed drastically,2017-04-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Stability. Can honestly not come up with any other pro.,"Complete lack of leadership and organization, work/life balance is spoken but not practiced, lack of respect for managers and associates in other departments, little or no training, high turn over, seem to put bodies in chairs, little or no team spirit, stressful environment."
8,Uamc,Has become a miserable place to work,2017-04-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"This was once a wonderful company to work for, even when things were stressful. Now it has become a place to endure each day without suffering a mental breakdown. Other than what ""might"" be decent pay, there are really no actual pros.",Terrible management at all levels. No communication. Overwhelming workload. Systems that never work. No organization. Crap benefits. No support or training. Terrible turnover. No respect for employees. Absent of any consideration for work-life balance. No accountability for quality work. Toxic environment. The office is a dump.
9,Uamc,Mortgage  loan Closer,2017-03-02,1.0,Mortgage Loan Closer,"Good pay, decent beni's sometimes good at keeping moral up at month end","Poor management, they don't follow thru on their direction, some management act like children."
10,Uamc,Loan Processor,2017-02-28,1.0,Senior Loan Processor,"When I first started, it was a good place to work. Had great management & team work vibe. But that all changed","- They cannot keep any good managers... or managers period. Too much is put on the processing managers and they can go to any other mortgage company to be paid more and not have nearly the amount of stress---- so they all leave to go elsewhere
- SOOOO much Neopotism there. People will be let go who actually do their jobs while family friend/relatives of management don't do their jobs, and no one says anything.
- Processors were expected to take care of other departments jobs.
- Processors not paid enough, bonus structure is weak
- No encouragement from management for growth-- if a management position comes up or Underwriting position they do not encourage processors to go for the positions. Or even tell them that there are positions open.

I could keep going but you get the picture."
11,Uamc,"Crème de la Crème workplace, for the Crème de la Crème worker",2017-02-11,5.0,Database Developer,"1)  Independence
2)  Insistence on courtesy and professionalism between coworkers
3)  Opportunity of growth and advancement
4)  Fair salary compensation",Office location is a far drive from my house
12,Uamc,An ok company,2017-01-11,3.0,,"Decent pay for an entry level job, flexibility to work from home on occasion was nice... The company also had fairly good benefits, particularly the 401k match","I received minimal career path guidance from my boss and was often left guessing what I should do to improve myself and advance as a professional in this business. I'm not a fan of the games that some leaders play in an organization, especially when you're expected to learn from your coworkers and the leaders don't provide professional development"
13,Uamc,Regional Manager,2017-01-09,1.0,,There were no pros to speak of at this company.,Pay men more than women in same position. Provide impossible projections and goals with insufficient support. Nothing is ever as it seems. Culture of double standard and special treatment.
14,Uamc,Ok place to work,2016-11-01,4.0,Mortgage Loan Officer UNIVERSAL,Good lead coming from builder.,Getting dinged pay for every little thing.
15,Uamc,UNPROFESSIONAL,2016-09-28,1.0,,Good Benefits and lunches that's about it!,"No work/life balance.
unfriendly.
Poor management.
Unfair
Pettiness
dirty mold building.
Too much conflict within the departments
Your guilty before your innocent atmosphere
For your own health don't work here.  They do not care about you, nor appreciate what experience you can bring to the company.
Not a part of the gossip click then your a nobody."
16,Uamc,"Lots of work, low pay and poor workflow management.",2016-08-25,1.0,Senior Loan Processor,"Benefits are good, the company as a hole is stable but only because they support Lennar.  If they didn't have that there would be NO company.","Leadership doesn't have a clue on how to build a workflow process.  They pile everything on the processing team.  If another department does not do there job then it become the processors responsibility.  And unfortunately, most departments do not do there jobs.

They will not promote you unless you have been there 2 years, especially if you are the best at what you do.    

They have a HUGE retention problem simply because they do not value the people they have.  Doesn't matter how good you are or how long you have been there, if you walk in and tell them you are thinking of leaving they will let you you go.

You always here managers say that ""Lennar does not have to use UAMC so we need to do whatever we can to make them happy"".  This is not true  Lennar and UAMC are one in the same.  Your benefits say you are a Lennar employee.  If Lennar does not use UAMC they Lennar loses also.  I know you always want to have a good working relationship, but unfortunately Lennar does not do the same for UAMC.  Typically the builder has very poor customer service, just go look at their reviews.

If you want to learn you can forget about it.  They tried having an internal training program to bring up junior people with in the company and that was a total nightmare simply because management would never hold true to time frames for promotions and then they only have 1 trainer that you typically have to schedule 2 days in advance if you need help.  (So much for a quick close or emergency)

It's really too bad to be honest, because there are a lot of good people there and UAMC just keeps treating them poorly.  

Like most places, if you start there it will take you a couple of months to realize everything above."
17,Uamc,Great Money - Not Family Oriented,2016-08-03,3.0,Senior Loan Processor,"Good salary, get it done attitude, fun atmosphere.","Late hours, no work life balance and unprofessional upper management"
18,Uamc,Not a good place to work,2016-07-01,2.0,,"Salary and benefits were good. 401K with employer match; health, life, and dental insurance. Good processes in place.",Senior Management is very unfriendly. Company culture is to brow beat results from employees. Not unusual for employees to be yelled at and humiliated in front of other employees. No consideration for work life balance
19,Uamc,Horrible,2016-04-16,1.0,Senior Loan Processor,None as Human Resources and upper Managers are friends so you really don't have a non interested third party representing you if you have a real problem it will never be remedied.,Inexperienced Managers who are picked based on Favoritism. It's not what you know here but who you know. There are folks with real talent who don't stand a chance.
20,Uamc,Management,2016-04-13,1.0,,None that I can  think of,Micro management; redundancy in management; obvious favoritism in mgmt; no respect from management
21,Uamc,Manager,2016-04-05,4.0,Manager,Opportunities for growth if you are willing to earn it. Collaborative team environment.,Not the place for you if you are not willing to adapt to change or do not like be held accountable.
22,Uamc,Horrible Managment and lots of Favoritism,2016-03-27,1.0,Senior Loan Processor,Good Pay and Benefits,"Working here is like working in a sweat factory.  There is tons of Favoritism and it is very apparent.  This is a management company, where managers look out for each other and the processors are a far and distant 2nd class citizen from a third world country. UAMC Super Micromanages their workers.

You are called into statuses (meetings) all the time and the Ops Managers and Regional Sales Managers speak to you like you are beneath them.  Management Speaks down to the Processors.  High turnover."
23,Uamc,UAMC is so so,2016-03-07,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Steady work.  Standard (meaning just OK) Corporate Benefit package.  Occasionally food is given out.  Air conditioned cubicle,Sweat Shop. Terrible management with no training given to new hires.  Only negative feedback is given to employees.  Poor compensation with no incentive.  No Christmas bonus.  Everyone seems stressed out & overworked.  Did I mention they don't pay a competitive wage or give an incentive or a bonus?
24,Uamc,Sr Loan Processor,2016-02-25,4.0,Senior Loan Processor,"Very well structured process.  A large variety of loan types are serviced there, so you learn a lot",Nothing really stands out to me that I would consider a negative
25,Uamc,Great Company to Work For,2016-02-24,5.0,Senior Loan Processor,"Supportive but relaxed atmosphere, successful career, excellent base pay, Co-Workers are family, lots of potlucks and gatherings, quarterly happy hours with team","There is no covered parking, and AZ sun is killer in the summer.  Bonus pay is a little lacking.  Most companies have per file bonus and quarterly performance bonuses."
26,Uamc,Administrative Assistant,2016-01-19,3.0,Administrative Assistant/Home Valuation Assistant,"Good Company, nice benefits. Wonderful co-workers",Takes me 3 1/2 hours to get to work and pay several tolls and gas. My lunch and clothing to keep up are getting to be a salary all on it's own.
27,Uamc,Long hours,2016-01-18,4.0,Senior Loan Officer,Excellent income potential with constant flow of business as the preferred lender for 2nd largest builder in Nation.,16 hour days can become common when a new community opens and business is flourishing. Income is based off completing timelines or lose income and can create pressure to a consumer- apply within 5 days and to Underwriting ASAP.
28,Uamc,Growth Company,2015-12-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Started almost 3 years ago and have seen a lot of growth. I have had the opportunity to work with all levels of leadership, employees and customers. I love to come to work and I am very happy with the opportunities and future of this company. It bothers me to see fellow co-workers complain about a position such as UW or Processors when no matter where you work in these positions, there is a demand in putting the customer first! Month end, day after Thanksgiving and year end push (extra hours) happens at all mortgage companies. I challenge you to reach out to your ex-coworkers who have left and see what it's like in the world outside of UAMC; better yet, talk to several associates who have left and came back! If there is a problem with leadership, tell someone!","Besides winning the lottery.. so I don't have to work at all, no complaints!"
29,Uamc,Good company to work for. Always ahead of the game with changes to the mortgage industry.,2015-10-07,4.0,Senior Loan Processor,"Offers training in all aspects of mortgage processing, including changes to the industry. Management always available to help you meet your goals.",You work for several loan officers who think their files are the only ones you have to processes and want to be your priority.
30,Uamc,Underwriter,2015-08-01,2.0,,"Good pay, lots of overtime. Lots of food. Games and contests.  Could win 1/2 days off but never allowed to use them.",Sweat shop with food and prizes.  Micro management.  Mandatory weeknights and weekends in the office. No work life balance. Constantly being pushed and pushed. Not enough PTO to recoup
31,Uamc,Underwriter,2015-06-26,3.0,DE Underwriter,"Lots and lots and lots  of overtime, and great food. Lots of food. Other departments try to make the workday fun.","Too much overtime,mandatory weekends;day after thanksgiving is a workday; arrogant, condescending management; not helpful, or friendly; no feedback throughout the year. No worklife balance;insuffiecient time off to recuperate.  Sick days warrant a third degree & illegal questions. Micromanaged to death. No eating ice or carrots at your desk since it is too loud. No conversations with coworkers allowed. Can't take the alotted amount of breaks. Department mgr very inexperienced & does not know how to handle the staff. Promises made at time of hire are not kept. Company is making billions in profits, but not shared with the employees."
32,Uamc,"Lots of business, hectic work schedule",2015-06-22,3.0,Loan Officer,"-Plenty of business, so you're never starving
-Base salary plus commissions, rare for loan officers
-Company is large and growing, not struggling
-Some of the managers are very knowledgeable and helpful (Julie/Shaun/Seth/Lisa)
-New sales director in Tampa (Steve) seems to be making some great changes
-Excellent group of high quality LOs, very professional people
-Pricing flexibility, they do not lose deals
-Excellent promotions like special financing rates
-Amazing underwriting and management that will fight for your loans","-Communities are not in the city, often 1hr+ away which means a LOT of driving
-Nearly always working 7 days a week, weekends are the busiest
-Upper management makes it clear you do not matter
-Fear/intimidation are used more than motivation and leadership
-Need to close about 8 loans/month on average to make $100k
-Low compensation on self-generated business"
33,Uamc,I love this company great to work for if your not afraid to do your part! Lazy people need not apply!,2015-05-21,5.0,Senior Processor,"Family like environment, beautiful office environment, when I got hired I felt like royalty.    Every team has different feelings and expectations but I love my team, my manager is awesome, my teammates are awesome.    Lot of training, huge pipeline so your always busy which is good you learn a lot.  They have a lot of fun activities and lunches here and there and great coffee stations :)","Don't come to this job if you do not know how to process or think you will have an easy job this is only meant for someone who comes to work, no playing, no time to not pay attention our pipelines are huge I have over 50 loans I am working on now.  If you get behind it will swallow you.    Long hours but it isn't always.    I also feel accountability with LO's or LPAs not doing there part is not enough."
34,Uamc,Archaic management style,2015-01-07,2.0,,Only recommend if getting started in the industry or need something short term. Advancement opportunities are rare and work load will result in eventual burnout.,Very long hours with a huge pipeline to manage. Compensation is based on a metric designed to lower the LO's commission and boost corporate profits. This metric is often out your control depending on the HLA's and your territory. Typical day resulted in 10- 12 hours in office. Typically spent another 2-3 hours at home fielding phone calls and emails. Usually spent 4-6 hours a day working weekends. Compensation for this industry as a loan officer is very low considering the work load. Micro-management is typical. No praise is given for effort. If you are ever contacted by senior management it is to belittle your efforts and give a wrist slap. High turnover is typical. Company culture is focused on bottom line and profits with no regard to employee satisfaction.
35,Uamc,Customer service is the only priority,2013-11-18,3.0,Senior Loan Processor,Extensive training with the changes in the industry,Giving your all is often not good enough
36,Uamc,Underwriter,2013-10-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Family/Team Atmosphere
Management Support
Effective Communications of Changes",Long Hours - especially at month end
37,Uamc,Be Warned!!!!,2013-08-12,1.0,,"This is the mortgage company for the builder, Lennar; well established; been around for a long time; benefits are okay; competitive salary.","Managament needs to be re-vamped. Most likely, this will not happen due to long-working relationships between various members of management. Nepotism may also be rampant. Processors & Underwriters are over-worked due to unrealistic expectations. Operation Managers are rude & abrasive with no discipline for talking down to their co-workers. Management in underwriting is devisive, not confidential, unsupportive & constantly gossips to her friends & sets workers against each other. Working 24/7 to manage your pipleline is the norm; people work until past 9 pm daily & sometimes to the wee hours of the morning!!!!  A weekend off is rare. Recognition for doing a good job or working 16 hr work day or giving up you weekend is also rare & when it does occur, it's for close colleages of the VP or the other managers. Email communication always include Sr Management & are mostly to slap you on the wrist or embarrass you."
38,Uamc,Very hectic and lots of pressure.,2012-05-22,3.0,Mortgage Loan Processor,It all depends on if management likes you or not.  If they do you are treated decent.  If they don't your life is miserable,"Some of the upper management were good but the ones at the top were rude, non-caring and used a lot of foul language.  Could make you feel very small and inferior.  One very good manager at the top.  Overall, operated much like a sweat shop.  High turnover."
39,Uamc,Great experience to grow in position,2011-02-16,4.0,Home Loan Advisor,Given a lot of latitude to make own decisions. Very ethical company. Pay is very fair.,Required to be on call 24/7. Can lead to burnout. Very stressful work environment.
