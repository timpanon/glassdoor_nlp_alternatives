5,Unicapital,Invaluable experience but level of pay is not commensurate with responsibilities of role,2020-08-25,3.0,Corporate Finance Senior Associate,"You get to learn so much about the industry within a short amount of time. You gain valuable experience because you are involved in deal origination, execution, and closing.",Base compensation not commensurate with work output
6,Unicapital,Good for experience only,2017-02-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,First hand experience in all aspects of the transaction. You get to work on things from the beginning to the closing. That's pretty much it.,"Below industry compensation and benefits, unethical practices, hiring so so employees, too much slacking of employees, very poor HR services, very young and incapable managers, many legacy employees, just operating to survive (imagine, the company's ROE is only 3%!!!!! What on earth is that?!)"
7,Unicapital,Learned a lot,2016-09-29,3.0,Finance Analyst,You learn a lot. There's no way to get your job done but to be lost in the workplace first. Navigate to the culture.,Too much politics in the office. Even the HR is a source of politics. No commensurate recognition or rewards for employees job performance
8,Unicapital,Corp. Finance,2015-04-27,5.0,Corp Finance Associate,"It is an established company in the world of finance, they have an investment banking and they can provide IPO services for you. They have compensations like seminars, 13,14,15 and even 16th month pay! Seriously, where can you experience that? I like how the company is generous even for employees who are not yet regular. You can file an OT whenever as long as your immediate superior approves. Company outing, events here and there, special holidays parties and I'm pretty fortunate my department head is fair and easy to be with. My team mates are also cool with handling things, we are assigned in each side of work so there are no hassle. Competition is of course high as everyone is doing well, you are challenge to really give your best within the team. (our team, specifically)","They announce really late (hr). Whenever there is an outing, a seminar, people with concerns are required but if you include everyone it may cause conflict. Try to work out handling whats important and whats NOT! Time is precious."
9,Unicapital,Experience is your only benefit.,2013-01-12,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Its a small group of companies related to investing, financing and brokering. With this type of office, you will likely have a chance to explore different positions and interact closely with the management. Rotation is easy and since there are just about 2 analysts in a team, like in corporate finance, marketing, credit and equity research, you have the opportunity to do everything, though difficult it may be; your work is pretty much all around. You don't just do the analysis, you will be asked to talk to the client, call investor relations, and even do presentations even if its not part of your job description. You can explore and learn a lot of things because you are not confined to limited to your job description. You will be forced to go beyond what is asked from you.","The compensation and benefits are below standards. Since you are asked to do what is beyond your job description, it feels like you are not being compensated properly. The management isnt too generous enough and the annual increase can go below 10%. The culture is also difficult to bear. The management is valuing employees that are ""loyal"", not the competitive and hardworking ones. This is why turnover rate is very high. Two years is pretty long. Its sad that despite all the hardwork, many are too dependent on their workmates and there are a lot of credit-grabbers in the place. They are retaining people who have brought several damages to the company and wouldnt even dare give her the spanking she needs."
