18,United Merchant Services,credit administrative,2017-02-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,good location and co-workers,low salary and overtime works
19,United Merchant Services,Temporary job,2017-02-08,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good coworkers and the office culture is generally pretty relaxed. Like everyone else has said, free lunches on Friday.",Incredibly low pay and no real room for advancement. I don't think it's a place where you can build a career. It's a place you work at while you're desperately looking for something or somewhere better.
20,United Merchant Services,Progressing,2015-02-21,3.0,,"Friendly environment and everyone is concern and care for each other. 
One of the company that do know alot about this industry and able to make products that are following trends",news and announcement are still slow to pass down to employees.  Not a lot of empowering regarding how you going to do work.
21,United Merchant Services,Not the greatest company to work at.,2015-01-28,1.0,Merchant Help Desk,Friendly co workers & lunch on fridays and that's it.,"-----PAY-----
Pay is horrible... Employees talk about how disappointed about their current pay and wanting to leave. The starting pay or the pay raise is just way TOO LOW. Expect to see a raise to be in the range of 20 cents - $1 or you don't get any raise(company thinks $1 raise is actually a lot). 

-----OverTime Pay-----
Majority of the employees decides to work overtime because they want to take advantage of the 1.5X pay rate. Employees have no choice but to work those overtime because the base pay is just TOO Low to make a living. If you get promoted from Assistant Manger and up, dont expect to see that 1.5X rate. Why? company actually pays any overtime at the regular hour rate. Think wisely.. just cause you get the position name doesn't mean your all that. 

----Experience with the Upper Management-----
They can push you to complete a task as soon as possible or may go bersek on the employee like if the next day will be the end of the world. Very uncomfortable and make the employee like if this is some kind of a boot camp.

----Insurance-----
Will end up paying so much for little coverage.. it's just too expensive to have an insurance with the LOW Pay we get. I recommend people to go online or a broker to get your own insurance because you can save least 20%-40%."
22,United Merchant Services,OH HELL NO!,2015-01-09,1.0,,The only good thing I could say about this company is that the employees are nice. There's really nothing else I am able to say.,"The work environment is horrible! Its a 9-6  prison camp! People can't wait to clock out soon as it hits 6:00 pm, the floor actually rumbles and it seems like a mini earthquake. They pay is horrible and they will try to low ball you as much as possible. The upper management do not care about the employees at all. They expect you to work 40+ hours a week with little to no OVERTIME PAY.
HR dept has no clue what they're doing and is only in favor of sucking up the the CEO and COO. 
The upper management clearly has no idea what they are doing also, upper management are managing 2 or more depts at the same time. when they clearly have the slightest knowledge. All they want to do is work the employees to the max and pass the work on as their own. 
I know that a lot of companies have upper management pointing fingers at each other, but at this company everyone is determine to destroy each other. Instead of trying to figure a way to resolve the issues, they just start pointing fingers. This company will slowing go down to the ground due the upper managements."
23,United Merchant Services,horrible company ever I worked,2014-06-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Friendly co-workers,

24,United Merchant Services,Another company,2014-04-21,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Interesting people to work with.  Flexible hours.  Decent benefits.  Free lunch on Friday.,Not the greatest pay for amount of work.  Disorganized management.  High employee dissatisfaction & turnover.

27,United Merchant Services,Horrible,2013-03-08,1.0,Tech,Co-workers are friendly and nice.,"Company is very cheap with wages, and will not give you the proper salary/wage one deserves.
Impossible to go up in position despite how well one works, and will only receive a promotion if you play politics with upper management.
The turn over rate of this company is incredible, the amount of time and money spent on training new employees do not make sense. Should pay employees more so that the turn overrate is lowered.
Health and Dental insurance is way to expensive."
28,United Merchant Services,below average,2012-12-13,1.0,Tech,Nice and very friendly co-workers.,"Very cheap.  Like other reviewer said, you need to know how to play politics in order to advance.  Turnover rate is way too high. Only 8 days for vacation/sick days for new employees and pretty much no other benefits. Low morale among employees."
29,United Merchant Services,OK,2012-04-10,3.0,Merchant Help Desk,Co-workers are very fun to be around.,Known to be very cheap with employee pay and benefits.
