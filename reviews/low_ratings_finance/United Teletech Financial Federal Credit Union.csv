5,United Teletech Financial Federal Credit Union,Teller,2017-02-27,4.0,Part Time Teller,Great benefits I get 30 hours of vacation and sick time as a part-time employee. Love working with the members they are all very nice and the work is rewarding. All of the staff is personable and are great to work with. They also hold meetings about the companies growth which is usually something lower level employees don't get to be a part of.,A little lean on the staffing sometimes tasks don't get done as efficiently as they could. This usually angers the members and the front line gets the brunt of it. However these issues are always straightened out.

The staff in the branches and the back office are awesome.  They are well educated in financial counseling. Most of the employees are great people and want to do the right thing for members and the community.,The CEO runs the company as a dictator and there is limited foresight.  Planning and setting goals are not strong suits and this unfortunately is starting to catch up with them.
