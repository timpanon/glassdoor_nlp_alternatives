0,V Stock Transfer,Overworking/Unrealistic Expectations,2021-06-14,1.0,Account Representative,The coworkers are cool and the company gives you snacks. That's about it.,The company gives you so much work to do and the expectations for you to them done within a shot amount of time is ridiculous. The higher up's just expect you to do the work robotically. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here unless you like being stressed out everyday.
