Really pushing for some interesting things in auto lending tech and growth.","Lack of growth internally. Very few openings and mostly filled by favoritism. 

Main headquarters is out of the DC metro and filled with more politics than the White House. Be prepared for a lot of bureaucratic mess.

Benefits are pretty abysmal for a company (VW Group) this size. Insurance is expensive and covers very little. They lean too hard on the employee lease program as a benefit while the rest is gutted.

Company is reorganizing without real communication to the people working. A core value of the company is that they are open, but apparently they meant only in the boardroom and not with anyone else."

If you socialize then you talk too much. If you keep your head down and work you are penalized for being antisocial.  There's people there that non stop talk all day long becoming disruptive but nothing is done about them.  Management has been known to bring up gossip about other workers in your one on one's. Asking people their thoughts on certain people. The amount of bullying from a certain Supervisor is overwhelming. It's actually harassment. The only way to get hired on is if you participate in bullying others and you are constantly telling on people. The credit department rarely has enough work to keep busy so they become loud, unruly and disruptive. A lot of inappropriate conversations. It's impossible to just work and mind your own business because someone is always stalking you."
27,VW Credit,Horrible for mental health,2020-02-06,1.0,,Zero. I have to write 5 words so here they are. There are no pros.,Toxic office politics. This place doesn’t even deserve one star. Be prepared to be humiliated in front of the entire floor. Be prepared to be treated poorly by management. Stop taking every employee benefit away. Stop requiring people to do amounts of work that are humanly impossible then being upset when unattainable goals are not met. You are forcing out every single one of your good employees. You need to pay employees what they are worth. And make sure that your managers don’t publicly humiliate employees over and over. Your employees make suicide jokes on the floor daily.
28,VW Credit,More cons than pros,2019-10-03,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Employee/family lease program; Perks; the Herndon HQ office has the potential for high employee visibility due to smaller facilities/close proximity to C-level leaders.,"Highly political environment with heavy influence from Germany on operations and employee headcount.  There’s a strong emphasis on Digital- so that may be a safe space- but the culture overall is very bureaucratic without much room for growth. High employee turnover.

The company is also sorely lacking from a diversity perspective. As many companies have women/diverse leadership in the upper ranks, from an outsiders perspective it would seem VW Credit looks to meet targets vs hiring for diverse perspectives.

Additionally, HR is literally two people. For a company of this size, that’s inefficient—HR is highly bureaucratic and seems to have more say in day-to-day activities than HR at a typical organization. “Policies” or standards are not consistently applied through the company."

30,VW Credit,Been here for awhile..,2019-08-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"People seem nice
If you like cars, you get to rotate car leases","Don’t let the nice environment fool you. Car sales are down, management doesn’t know what the hell they need to do to move forward and try to defend their same processes, and no one seems to know how to implement technology. Correction, the company is trying to keep costs from getting higher and they don’t trust the IT staff to make things happen and that’s because they don’t know how to retain talent, aka paying the right salaries. That said, they expect the accountants to make the transitions and lead the conversations which doesn’t make any sense because a lot of these people don’t know anything about technology or data structures to understand the actual implementation. They just think oh I get the concept so this should equal this based off accounting standards, but you’re talking about converting system processes involving millions of accounts for a company so “leadership” thinks hey let’s just hire cheaper guys and have them take over some of the responsibilities. HA! Kind of shows the struggles of the company if you can’t pay the right resources, right? And this is coming from someone outside of IT. Over the years, no conversion or implementing new process was a success despite them saying they “completed” it in their objectives. It takes the company YEARS to actually fully finish a project because they do not let the IT ppl have the full control over the jobs they’re supposed to do. And the company argues that things are better than how processes were done before. That doesn’t mean much if the past was never efficient to begin with. Un-freaking-believable"

Management listens but they don't act."

91,VW Credit,Don't Waste Your Time,2014-02-11,1.0,Pricing Analyst,Met some lifetime friends who left the company,"Too many middle managers, a flat organization, no work life balance unless you are liked by your supervisor, very political, arrogant upper management especially if they are heavily degreed (PhD), a lot of inner fighting among management and no accountability, you take the heat for there lack of leadership.  Snobby little men in management. There are virtually no female executives, chauvinism at its best. I actually heard the ex-president make a comment about hiring a female due to ""her good looks"". A lot of turn over. They lose good employees because eventually those employees get tired of all the politics, lack of respect and quagmire of red tape to get things accomplished.  They run Corporate like a factory."
92,VW Credit,Not what I expected,2014-02-06,1.0,,Caring people all over. Great co workers. Some neat benefits with some perks.,Pay very little with no real incentive. Temp agency is horrible. Temp forever. No room for error or else

96,VW Credit,"Good company, but High Political landscape",2013-10-04,3.0,Enterprise Architect,Good people with good skill sets. Good benefits.,"I would agree with the others that this landscape is Highly Political. Technical departments are very, very Tribal. Extremely hard to get people to work together. Management does nothing to stop this and many times encourages it. Also, lack of any Documentation or want to document, i.e. everything is in peoples heads."
97,VW Credit,Politics and impossible performance metrics,2013-09-03,2.0,Sales & Service Representative,"Overall, a great group coworkers who are friendly and personable.",Performance metrics are impossible to achieve and turnover rate is high.

98,VW Credit,Good Company but...,2013-08-12,3.0,End of Lease,Great People. Always wanting help. Once you get hired in. Company is amazing from what I hear and see from full time employees.,Very political. You start being a temp making less than 28k.

If you get a good team lead they will actually try and help in whatever way they can.,The hours are typical of a call center....mandatory 11 hours on Monday and depending on how your numbers are you will always get mid shift which is 10am-8pm. It's a daily grind to meet the numbers that they want you to hit with the ancillary products. Realistically half of the team doesn't meet the numbers and turn over is high because when you start out you will be a contract worker.
103,VW Credit,It was a great place to work,2012-10-23,4.0,Customer Care Quality Assistant,"Great benefits with good people, they started me out with 3 weeks vacation and I stayed for just over ten years.
