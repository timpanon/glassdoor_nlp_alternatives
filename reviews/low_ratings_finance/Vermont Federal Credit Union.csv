0,Vermont Federal Credit Union,Racism + Homophonia Abounbs,2021-06-13,1.0,Call Center Representative,Upper management will listen to your ideas*.,* to implement them and give you no credit. The racism I experienced internally and with our clients will never be forgotten. Staff is not properly trained for the software they use and depend on the call center and the is team to teach them while they also have their own work to take care of. Any reports to HR are used against you when you need assistance. A member of upper management came to my home when I did not clock in for a remote work position.
1,Vermont Federal Credit Union,Lack of care,2021-03-04,2.0,Anonymous,"Great co-workers who made the job worth it, and a wonderful CEO!","Senior management doesn't know what is going on with their managers, nor do they want to listen. Some directors want you to do what they want, and won't hear you out. If you don't do what they say, you are putting a target on your back. Whatever you do isn't good enough for them.
HR is unapproachable, and doesn't do anything with feedback or is very slow to act on it. There were many instances where employees got away with things longer then they should of, because HR lacks necessary listening skills or overall care towards employees.
The credit union vibe of caring for people and feeling like family is gone, and is feeling more like a bank where they don't care about their employees, and think it's ok to not support/listen to feedback. 
Communication is also terrible, and always has been. It was a yearly focus that never improved."
2,Vermont Federal Credit Union,Moving forward or standing still?,2021-02-13,3.0,Anonymous Employee,My coworkers were amazing. Wonderful people to work with.,"Upper management and HR are slow to change, communication is lacking. 
Not much room for upward mobility.
Was never asked for feedback in the years I was there about anything, HR is basically invisible and somehow overloaded."

4,Vermont Federal Credit Union,Thrilled to join this team,2021-01-15,5.0,Mortgage Department Administrator,"Caring, flexible, welcoming, and thorough. I have recently on boarded at Vermont Federal and am “wowed” daily by the care they show all of their employees as well as how they go above and beyond to make me feel welcomed and a part of the team. This is by far the smoothest and most welcoming on boarding I have ever gone through and I am doing so remotely through covid to top it off. I already feel as if the Vermont Federal team are my friends and family.",I truly don’t have cons to list. I am on boarding remotely through zoom and I have been “wowed” by how well this is going and how available my coworkers have made themselves for my questions.
