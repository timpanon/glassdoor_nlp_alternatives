0,Volant Trading,Good place to work,2022-03-26,5.0,Trader,"Good fun, great colleagues, decent tech.","None really, was nice to work there."
1,Volant Trading,It's only about revenue,2021-04-09,1.0,Trader,"Interviews literally take 15 minutes, and you are hired on the spot. Nice Christmas party. But that is it.","There was a point where I highly recommend working there, but not now. I wanted all of my friends to work there. I believed that this company could really stand out in its industry, but unfortunately, it's not even about that anymore. It's only about revenue. Revenue revenue revenue. Efficiency. Revenue. It's a shame."
2,Volant Trading,Brian Donnelly doesn't warn about burnouts,2021-03-11,2.0,Trader,I liked the autonomy I was given,"The CEO, Brian Donnelly, will teell you all about the benefits of being a trader, but you won't know anything about the burnouts. People work a lot, and they often burn out sooner than expected. It must change"
3,Volant Trading,Run by an incapable CEO,2021-02-02,1.0,Trader,"Because of little support, you would be able to learn how to be resourceful and work independently","This place was run by an incapable CEO who wasn't able where areas of the company needed improvement and intervation. He was a big talker and would always brag about how the company was doing great when in fact, we had a lot of issues internally and he was just turning a blind eye"
4,Volant Trading,Brian Donnelly expects too much,2020-10-18,1.0,Trader,You get the autonomy you might have dreamed of having,"The CEO, Brian Donnelly, pushes people too hard and expects too much. He fools people by saying that you will attain expeptional career growth if you handle the workload of two or three people and people get trapped. You should just stick to a regular person's workload to avoid burning out too soon."

7,Volant Trading,Brian Gives False Hopes,2020-08-27,2.0,Trader,I learned never to trust the top management again!,"The CEO, Brian, lied to me and showed me dreams about how much I can earn. But then, I was laid off suddenly, and I never knew what the reasons were. Why give false hope to people if you are just going to let them down?"

10,Volant Trading,The CEO thinks burnouts are good,2020-06-07,1.0,Trader,I couldn't find any pros,"The CEO and his key minions think that asking one person to do the work of multiple people is good. They also think that burnouts are cool. Believe me, they are wrong and the money is not worth it. You'd do better elsewhere."
11,Volant Trading,Good firm with flat structure.,2020-05-27,5.0,Trader,"The autonomy is second to none.  I no longer work at the firm but there is clearly someone or something putting fake reviews up here because there are job titles I see in reviews that are completely made up, so I had to post something because my career was built here and I am doing well after I left.  I was not part of the layoffs, as most firms, the too performers were not let go.","You need to do the workload of 2-3 people relative to other firms with a risk of burning out, but using that to your advantage builds your career and your resume."
12,Volant Trading,An honest review,2020-05-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I was so frustrated with all the bad reviews that I felt the need to respond to their points. Here is my review of Volant, which gives my take on all of the issues people have been posting. 
Point: Turnover is high and the firm is failing. Response: For the first 7 or so years turnover was virtually non-existent. As the company got larger (as with all larger companies) there was more turnover. Almost all strong employees (dev, trader, quant, or network) who did decide to leave went to good firms (SIG, Citadel, etc.) or left the industry - this says a lot about the experience you get at Volant. Yes, we had a bad year in 2019 (like every other market maker) and unfortunately had to lay off some employees (some deserved it and some did not, but the cuts were necessary), but the Firm appears to be doing well in 2020 and people are staying.

Point: Brian (CEO) failed. Response: Sure, he could have done a better job (all CEOs can do better), and he's the first to admit his shortcomings, but many of you failed too. This is a flat organization (in my opinion a bit too flat) that empowers individuals. Why didn't you come up with new strategies or systems, or do better analysis in 2018 to prepare for 2019? It seems to me that you expected to get paid a lot of money, not work very hard, and not add value. From personal experience, I suggest you really think about whether you could have worked harder or done better at Volant. Once you consider these questions they will help you with future jobs.  

Point: No support, guidance, or formal training. Response: Volant is small and as a result we no longer have scheduled training for every new employee. So, if you are the type of person that likes easy work and wants to be spoon fed, I'll tell you straight up, don't work here. If you like to be challenged, you know how to work hard, you like to come up with your own ideas and implement them (as opposed to having every task fed to you), and you know how to seek out answers (everyone will take time to explain things to you if you ask), this is the place for you and the opportunities people received after Volant prove the best firms value what you learned here.

Point: There are communication gaps. Response: Can communication and planning be better on a larger scale, yes. But, you should take some responsibility. Brian is 100% open with people who ask him questions (too open if you ask me) so you should have (or anyone still working here should) asked your manager if you were unsure what was going on or asked Brian. Also, try working at a big company - no chance you know everything that is going on, including how they are doing on a quarterly basis or what every group is working on.       

Point: Management is terrible, they make dumb decisions. Response: This really doesn't make sense to me. The main money generator is the market making business. The focus has always been market making. What specifically did you want management to do differently and why didn't you bring up these issues when you were here? Not one review gives reasonable feedback or suggestions for change - they just badmouth management. Market volatility died in 2019 - no market makers made money - everyone had layoffs. Did you want Brian to play god and create market volatility? 

Point: There is no HR Department and the CEO does what he wants. Response: We did have an HR department, but with the current size we do not. At a firm Volant's size, of course the CEO will have a say in hiring and everyone's compensation. Perhaps a committee of some sort would be beneficial, but I know that if you prove your worth you will get paid when the firm does well.

Point: I liked a lot of the people I worked with. Response: OK, then stop trying to hurt the company that we still work at. If you were a team player or friend you'd move on and stop spamming Glassdoor with review after review. Those who are left would appreciate it. 

Point: Volant takes advantage of immigrants. Response: Again, not true. Employees on visas have historically been some of the best paid at Volant. Also, the Firm goes out of it's way spending tons of money to assist their visa process. You do a good job, you get paid. If you don't, you don't. It's simple.",See above response for pros and cons.
13,Volant Trading,Inadequate Training,2020-05-26,1.0,Trading Assistant,Nice office with great view plus some friendly colleagues.,I had a very inadequate training here when I was starting out that it was difficult to get adjusted. I also witness from new hires how they dread the learning adjustment. The tools and support were not enough to help them get immersed with their processes and responsibilities.
14,Volant Trading,Brian has failed,2020-05-19,1.0,Administrative Assistant,"Everyone knows how brian has failed, so most people are against him","Brian needs to knows his people, understand their problems and close communication gaps. Instead, what he does is hires people on a whim, provides no real training and let them handle multiple challenges alone. No support from him, ever!"
15,Volant Trading,bad place.  fake reviews by company,2020-05-14,1.0,Trader,after 3 years it was a relief to leave and no real pros.,management lies and is just dumb. they post fake reviews here to try to get people to join. bad performance had them go from 130 to 30 people. what a miracle that 3/30 posted five star review in same few days. do not fall for it. this place is not good.
16,Volant Trading,Communication Gaps and Avoidable Layoffs,2020-04-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The top management tried to do things right.,"There are wide, or let's say ultra-wide communication gaps here as many people of the same company are in differnet time zones. Getting a hold of them and communicating with them is a big task. Also, there have been avoidable layoffs due to some strategic failures. I think the management could have stopped it."
17,Volant Trading,"Honest, ethical",2020-04-05,5.0,Trader,"In all my years at Volant, the CEO had at every instance acted ethically and honestly.","It is an international firm, communication won't always come naturally across time zones."
18,Volant Trading,Solid Firm with Tremendous Upside,2020-03-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Sharp and hardworking staff, great benefits, lots of latitude to improve your skills, and a ton of upside.","Firm tried to grow too big and too fast in 2019.  This resulted in layoffs in the later part of the year, thus all the recent poor reviews.  And just so there is no confusion, Volant is  currently highly profitable and that trend is likely to continue given the state of the markets."
19,Volant Trading,Good place getting a bad rap from disgruntled leavers,2020-03-20,5.0,Software Engineer,"Tons of freedom to innovate, good management, a lot of potential to grow into something very big, and a great place for software engineers to expand their technical skill set.",Hiring practices could use some improvement as evident from the reviews.  A number of people were hired ended up not being a good fit and were either let go or left the firm as a result.
20,Volant Trading,Things are turning around,2020-03-19,5.0,Operations Manager,"small environment, smart people, transparent leadership","Office is far from the subway, but is beautiful. Great terrace."
21,Volant Trading,Not worth the time or energy,2020-03-18,1.0,Administrative,The place is great for exposure to global trade.,"Management is out of sync with the staff, lack of support, lack of communication and no formal training for new employees. This has lead to numbingly poor decisions, investments and trades. Not worth the time or energy."
22,Volant Trading,good,2020-03-04,5.0,Software Engineer,very good free friday lunch,no free lunch every day
23,Volant Trading,The future can be good only if you're lucky,2020-02-11,1.0,Trading Assistant,"There is a good future for you if you get the knack of the job. There are additional benefits aside from the mandatory ones, and perks like free food and snacks.","Product training is not enough for you to be able to do your job when you transition to the floor. You will be partnered with a mentor and that's where you will define your future. Not all mentors are good, but not all are bad either. You just have to be lucky to get a good tough mentor who will do his/her job to mentor you so you get to know the ropes of the trade, do good at it, or at least keep your job."
24,Volant Trading,What a place.....,2020-02-04,1.0,Trader,Everyone who's left is pretty smart and fun to work with,"Not many people left, those who are here are probably on their way out.  Everyday I hear about some magic bullet that's going to get us out of the hole and back to profitability. CEO's favourite phrase is ""there will be more of the pie to go around"". 

Completely abandoned algorithmic trading, just working on technology from a decade ago. Everyone who could have helped is gone."
25,Volant Trading,"No support, no guidance.",2020-01-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"You'll learn to work alone. Also, there's free Wi-Fi.",You'll be forced to work alone. Management does not provide support or guidance. The other employees won't be able to help you as well since they also don't receive any kind of support. Management seems to be inexperienced and incapable of handling people.
26,Volant Trading,Make a program for the employees that would promote healthy living,2019-12-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's a nice place to work at physically, and the job can be rewarding if you learn the ropes and be successful at it.","A very toxic culture and a demanding job. Working here takes a lot of your personal time, and work would extend to long hours, late nights, weekends, and even holidays."
27,Volant Trading,More good than bad but,2019-12-04,4.0,Partner,"Interesting work, open culture, opportunities to make a very involved across all aspects of the business",Recent downsizing due to poor trading revenues
28,Volant Trading,Pretty friendly environment,2019-12-03,4.0,Trader,Pretty friendly environment; head trader willing to teach.,complicated system; no transparent backtesting infra.
29,Volant Trading,Very poor management,2019-11-28,1.0,Team Member,"Good technology, friendly environment and nice office.","CEO is the biggest mess, who only trusts several yes men around him. Very poor business vision, bad planning and swing decision had wasted a lot of time and resources. It turned from the good situation in 2018 to very bad quickly. It had lost most of the key contributors."
30,Volant Trading,"Management should get off their seats, look around, do their job.",2019-11-10,1.0,Administrative,The office seems busy and dynamic which doesn't make the workplace boring.,"Bad management, makes decisions without knowing the real situation. They rely on hearsay, and whatever is presented in front of them by the people who they decided to trust, not knowing that these people are causing downfall of the company."
31,Volant Trading,Stay Away if You Can,2019-10-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There's free Wi-Fi in the office.,"Stay away from this company if you can. Management is clueless about what to do, so it almost always end up making bad decisions. This results in low employee morale and a lack of enthusiasm for most employees. Also, the pay isn't even good. In other words, management is trash."
32,Volant Trading,Don't Join Unless You Want to Go Down,2019-10-24,1.0,Anonymous,The environment is quite dynamic which feels nice for a few days.,"The company is going down, and it will take you with it if you join now. There's nothing good in this company anymore. All the good employees have left or are preparing to leave. Only a few ""good for nothing"" and money-hungry people work here now."
33,Volant Trading,Winter is Coming,2019-09-30,1.0,Developer,Free Wifi.  Knowledgable team members.,Very poor management. I have nothing else to add that others have not already stated.
34,Volant Trading,sad to see the fake positive posts,2019-09-25,1.0,Software Engineer,It  was the worst job I ever had.  period.,I had not planned on writing about my experience but after hearing about the fake positive reviews the past few months I had to.  I also would encourage people to ask around in the industry before joining since the reputation is very bad.  The management is just terrible and they continuously make terrible decisions on everything.  There was no plan or idea what to do- just a group of guys guessing and throwing darts.  The technology is always crashing and everyone is on maintenance and support.  The tech debt is very large and nobody cares.  They treat people terribly- like lying to them and brutally firing them with no compassion.  The environment is bad to work in and it caused much stress because it was so chaotic.  They make no money and blame the market.  They want to bet it all on a deadend customer business that has never made any money.
35,Volant Trading,Circus of Dysfunction and Cluelessness,2019-09-17,1.0,Snack Inspector,"Some smart, knowledgeable coworkers who will have no problem finding jobs after they're ruthlessly let go as management panics to preserve capital","Middle and senior management refuse to actually be managers. Firings are handled in the ugliest manner possible, but that doesn't really matter given that the firm's lifespan is measured in weeks.

CEO constantly finds his foot in his mouth as he promises everything will be ok while everything around him is on fire, if not already burned to ashes. Brought on a bunch of new guys, promised they wouldn't be fired, and then fired them after looking at the numbers."
36,Volant Trading,Don't Join the Tech Team,2019-09-07,1.0,Technician,No bats an eye if you drink beer here.,Working in the tech  team is not a good option. everyone has low morale here. and not one takes any initiative. You have to work alone most of the times and be on your own. This place sucks the happiness out of you.
37,Volant Trading,Disappointing tenure at what seemed to be a good firm,2019-08-23,1.0,,I learned what not to do by seeing what was done at Volant.,The pay was always underwhelming.  The culture was not flat at all.  And I got sick of management creating boxed roles to work in.  The quant team seemed useless.  The trading team seemed weak.  The tech team never seemed happy.
38,Volant Trading,"Volant collapse is imminent, we are just pawn in the game, don't fall into this trap!",2019-08-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"In Asia office after 4 PM, people can drink beer and playing poker; Free wifi which you could use to post bad reviews on Glassdoor, as well as search for a new job.","I can confirm all bad comments on Glassdoor about Volant are all true and I will not repeat similar comments; It is absolutely horrible working environment!! It's so toxic to a point which fingerpointing between developers and traders when the incident happens as day to day basis. All partners just close their eyes and hoping good things will happen. Volant never gives equity out for free, they just give you the rights of purchase which doesn't make sense. My comment for potential joiner: new graduates - all senior staff trying to make sure they could survive long enough to get another job and have no incentive to teach you anything, and they will find every way to make sure you will produce a bad performance, so you would not be able to replace them before their resignation, it's dog eat dog game; Experienced hires - This company is running low on human resources, you will require to handle a huge workload due to recent resignation and laid off, there are so many aging systems, software, and hardware, you will be running around as a firefighter all day long, and DO NOT trust whatever management promising you, they are all lying and they laid off a lot of senior staff without giving out warning. At least 20-30% of your bonus will go into company vesting pool, which is compulsory; if Volant collapse before 2020 which the others are predicting, vesting pool will be gone and most likely they will fire you and keep that money for themselves."
39,Volant Trading,"Good experience for young engineers, good mentorship",2019-07-11,4.0,Software Engineer,"I joined Volant right out of school, and although not everything has been perfect, I'm happy with my choice. The biggest thing for me is the opportunity. New grads get to work on interesting and important projects. (If you want to be a software dev at a trading company specifically, I would 100% recommend here, you will have the chance to work on a variety of projects, letting you get a bigger picture of the system/industry.) Even if you don't want to work at a trading company your entire career, you get to work on large projects with tough design requirements, and you have 3/4 senior engineers with lots of experience and education (some with PhD) guiding you. You learn from the senior guys both when they help you design your projects and then in extensive review (think 100+ comments in a big pull request if needed). I'll add that the senior engineers are by and large very friendly and approachable. 

It annoys me when I see some of the negative reviews here. The CEO is just a super nice guy. He's friendly and approachable to everyone imo. About 6 months into the job, he organized a one-on-one lunch with me to discuss any concerns I had, find out how I thought the company could be improved, and to just get to know me better. He does this with all new hires. Additionally, he explicitly asks for feedback and ideas on the regular. He even told the entire office that we'd be compensated if we went to him with helpful criticism/ideas. 

Smaller pros: office is super nice, large glass windows, standing desks, kitchen filled with good healthy snacks, a keg, a large private terrace where people can have drinks and eat lunch, etc... the terrace has good views of statue of liberty, the hudson, and lots of manhattan looking north 

Lastly, Volant has office in Chicago, NY, and Hong Kong; and is flexible about letting people work in the different offices, so if you want to work internationally they can make it happen","The drawbacks to Volant are the same drawbacks I'd see at any other job. I think the lack of openness and ""secrecy"" talked about in other reviews is misrepresentative. From my experience, senior management - including the CEO - proactively look for criticism and suggestions"
40,Volant Trading,Developer,2019-06-25,3.0,Developer,I can't think of what to write here. it was not a good experience,high turnover rate and bad culture
41,Volant Trading,bad management and bad culture,2019-04-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The hours aren't too long.,"Joining Volant was a terrible career move for me.  It was nothing like I expected and as previously mentioned by someone a toxic culture.  There is constant infighting, incompetent management,  old and fragile technology, and a revolving door of people leaving.  I expected to learn, grow and be exposed to ""cutting edge"" technology.  It is nothing like this.  

Recently there was a mass layoff which speaks to how things are going.  It is hard to see how volant can compete with all the firms that have better management, technology and plan."
42,Volant Trading,Great firm with a very good culture,2018-09-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Volant has a penchant for hiring talented people from the industry's top firms. This often leads to healthy debate about how best to evolve the firm, given a variety of different trading perspectives.
- The culture at Volant promotes idea-sharing, collaboration and cross-pollination of skill sets. If you are a motivated individual, you have every opportunity to work in a team environment, learn from a diverse group of professionals and truly broaden your own skill set.
- There is an entrepreneurial vibe at Volant and business units are afforded a great deal of autonomy to prototype, test and deploy strategies to the market.
- Comprehensive, formal classroom training for juniors offered on a wide range of topics. On-the-job training and mentoring is also a key part of professional development.
- Brian Donnelly is a very engaged owner; he genuinely cares about each and every employee, their development and their level of satisfaction with their work.","- Borne out of a desire to bring strategies to market expediently, the firm has been relaxed about implementing processes for technology deployment. This is changing, for better and worse: it will undoubtedly improve the quality of production code; it will also slow iteration cycles and create bottlenecks in QA. These pains are typical of businesses trying to make a leap in scale.
- Has been too timid to scale business model into new markets and/or has not thrown an adequate amount of resources at new businesses in order for them to have a legitimate chance at success.
- Work life balance could be improved; people who work here are expected to wear many hats."
43,Volant Trading,clueless management and dysfunctional organization,2018-09-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,kind of new office space,"Strong sense of paranoia and major power fights across the company.  Many senior people have quit this year and nobody really knows why and it is not allowed to be talked about.  

General distrust of the CEO and management (despite what the company planted reviews say).  Too many secret meetings leads to suspicion about what people are plotting.  They tell us not to write on Glassdoor and that things are going to be better but things have gotten worse and nothing changes.  Town hall meetings are demotivating and full of BS with nothing of substance or direction.

Software developers are basically sending most of their time doing support and fixing things.  The number of crashes and outages is frightening.  Yet there is no changes and the same people are making the same bad decisions.

Hard to use as a stepping stone since the reputation of the company is not very good in the industry.  I wish I had asked around more before I started.  I just don't see this as a good path to learn anything or make good money.  People I know at other places seem to be learning more and making more."
44,Volant Trading,"High Potential, Poor Execution",2018-03-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are some really smart people working here, with plenty of experience in options trading and quant research. There's also a healthy amount of mentoring from senior traders to juniors.","As mentioned in some of the previous negative reviews, one of the biggest blockers to this company realizing its full potential are the underperforming CTOs. While we do have access to some cutting-edge technology, there are frequent incidents and outages due to various bugs and operational errors, and this falls under the responsibility of the CTOs. In fact, just last week, one of the CTOs pushed out a change that caused headaches for traders the next morning. Also, the trade analysis projects are a mess due to lost data, running out of resources, crashes, etc, so I'm sure they'll need to be re-written sooner or later. Several key employees have recently walked out the door as a result of this already, and unless something drastic changes here, I expect this to continue."

In short, the CEO of Volant Trading is a caring boss. Brian Donnelly invests his time and effort in each and every employee . He built the company from scratch and he will also take reasonable effort to help build each employee.  Mr. Donnelly is also fortunate to have a fantastic leadership team, including his CCO/GC, CTOs, COO, CFO, and CIO. I had the pleasure of working under the CCO/GC, who provided every opportunity for growth available and invested in my success.","Although the company invests in their employees and values back office operations, there is definitely room for support and growth of the compliance and human relations departments."
48,Volant Trading,Mismanaged and Deceptive,2018-01-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Hours can be okay depending on the role.,"CEO over promises and under delivers constantly. Be wary of what is offered to you when being hired here. He is also extremely volatile and makes the working environment uncomfortable. Compensation is not based on meritocracy and purely on seniority in the firm. A lot of ""old dogs"" running the show and good talent from trading and development keep leaving."

51,Volant Trading,Happy I Ended Up Here,2017-04-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work/Life Balance: Great work/life balance. You are expected to work hard during the day, but management does not want employees to burn out so hours are very reasonable. 

Work: The work at Volant is cutting edge and interesting. I've found that management will give you as much responsibility as you prove you can handle. And, they are always interested in hearing your opinion and new ideas concerning how to improve the Firm.  

Management: Generally, management is great. They are intelligent and approachable. Most importantly, I know Brian Donnelly cares about the employees.

The Firm: Due to Volant's small size, management can make changes on the fly. The Firm is growing and is in a good position financially. 

Office Space: The Firm has a beautiful, new office overlooking the Hudson with a large outdoor space. On nice days, employees will eat lunch outside or have a drink and lounge on the deck at the end of the day.

Career Growth: Volant's positive reputation is growing on the Street. I'll often get contacted by other companies or recruiters offering legitimate roles at other Firms/Banks because they know Volant is staffed lean and employees have solid experience. 

Other Notable Perks: Awesome technology. Snacks/drinks in the kitchen. Bonuses are paid twice a year. Ability to invest in the Firm. Firm covers your insurance premiums for individuals and their families.","Typical growing pains of a young company. But, working through those issues as a team is a great learning experience and has helped me form close relationships with other employees."
52,Volant Trading,Toxic Firm - Beware,2017-03-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The employees in general are nice to talk to during the day.
High priority on speed game.","The firm has been struggling and the problem lies with upper management's inability to make good business, employment, and trading strategy decisions. They hire older traders with unprofitable strategies and give them authority in the direction of the company.

They offer ""competitive"" salary but the total compensation is nowhere near that of any respectable shop from entry to senior level. The revenue numbers compared to bonus compensation numbers never add up. If you are an entry level trader, you will not learn how to trade at this firm.
