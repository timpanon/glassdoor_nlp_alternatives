7,WBI Investments,Nepotism & Undervalued Employees,2017-12-02,1.0,Support,The majority of employees were hard workers.,"The employees are not valued or given an opportunity to grow unless they are family members or friends of management. 

I worked at this organization for a few years and the nepotism and favoritism was abundant. Long time employees were not valued and consistently passed over for opportunities in favor of family members and friends of management. 

The environment was extremely stifling. Educational opportunities that would be used to better oneself were not supported and opportunities for advancement were discouraged as well. 

On one particular occassion, I let my manager know that I was interested in advancing my career and had completed several classes to do so. I was told that the company was not looking to have someone in that role only to have them bring in someone a few months later that was a friend of management in that exact role.  Not Right!"
8,WBI Investments,Has seen better times,2017-10-25,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Excellent work staff where most people tend to get along. It's a generally professional work environment where most employees tend to take their work seriously.,"Tensions over the last two years have been building up with long term employees. What began as a pleasant environment with plenty of opportunity for growth has transformed into a toxic & stressful one. No longer offering sense of stability, or room for advancement. Tends to lean toward the compensation & hiring freeze method. In the state of NJ, this method is a recipe for disaster and unacceptable."
