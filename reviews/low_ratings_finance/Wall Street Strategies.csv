0,Wall Street Strategies,The firm has Great possibilities but must reinvest in the firm if it's going to survive!,2016-11-26,3.0,Sales,"The job is straight commission therefore the earnings are unlimited, most of the employees are experienced salesman and are very helpful.","Not a good or pleasant work environment, very tense, can be very stressful.

1,Wall Street Strategies,"Famous owner, but not famous service",2016-06-29,1.0,Equity Research Analyst,"There is a lot of work to be done over the course of the day, and if you love the stock market and understand how to do all of your own analysis then you will love the fast-paced nature of the job. If you have a passion for the stock market and already know what you're doing without training then you should fare just fine.","More than I should mention. Never expect to be able to take vacation or call in sick without being belittled first. Make sure to work a solid 50 hours each week with no meals or breaks in between. Be prepared to be micromanaged to the point where your managers will tell you every single action you took in an hour that was not doing work. Office environment is open, loud and not a great environment for those who need to read/think for a living. Company offers heathcare plans worse than Medicare (it is possible, they found a way). They claim there is a 401k plan, but it not one. You'd be better off saving for yourself."
2,Wall Street Strategies,"Good place to get your feet wet, but little opportunity for advancement",2010-08-11,3.0,,"Great place to really get your hands dirty. Doing all your own analysis after only a few weeks of training.  Learning the job is a must.  It is a small company, so one must become a jack of all trades.","No incentive to continue to grow industry coverage list. The job description changes depending on what is going on the market.  Sometimes you are a research analyst with a specific industry, and other times you are expected to be a stock picker."
