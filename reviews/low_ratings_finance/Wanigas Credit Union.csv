7,Wanigas Credit Union,Not a bad short term gig.,2015-07-10,2.0,Teller,"Definitely worse places you could work. Professional environment. 
Don't to take work home with you. Small learning curve.","No chance for advancement for most. Seniority is a big deal, even in terms of when you get to go to lunch and who makes the lunch schedule. 
Extremely close attention was paid on doing at least as much work as the rest of the teller line (by the other tellers). So doing 1 alternative task, or fixing a mistake and taking yourself off the line was very frowned upon by coworkers. Basically a lot of jealously because of the constant customer service. 

Will get fired if you accept $1,000 in bad checks no matter what. Your seniority does help you there. 

Working there for a year has made me avoid banks/CU's as much as possible."
