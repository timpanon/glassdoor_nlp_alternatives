You can put food on the table but you might be miserable every day.","Upper management is the worst I’ve ever seen. It’s impossible to keep good people because the pay is not competitive, and the culture is terrible. There’s very little investment in training, everyone is considered expendable (and they know it). No strategy, terrible communication. There is no accountability at the top, instead everything is blamed on bad employees or managers. The huge amount of turnover says it all. You will not feel appreciated here."

19,West Suburban Bank,Poor communication top down,2021-01-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Close to home, giving it 3 stars for work life balance. However, your work load doubles or triples if you are an exempt employee having to cover for underperforming employees.","- Low employee morale and insecurity on future of organization.  Hard to attract and retain quality employees with under market salary and comp plans with no bonus structure.  Heavy employee turnover of late, probably due to company wide salary freezes and no bonuses. For example, HR department lost 4 employees recently, its segment head, 2 managers, and specialist. 

- The fundamental problem with organization is poor communication from top down. It is a be seen but not heard culture here. President and senior management have no interest in your ideas or suggestions to improve organization. They do not listen to their employees as only they know what's best for company. Majority of below cons could be resolved with better communication. 

- No salary increases or bonuses for ALL employees for 2020 performances, which would have been implemented and paid in 2021. Bank made profit in 2020 while making massive expense cuts during year. What message does this say to your employees who put their lives on the line for company having to work face-to-face with customers and staff during COVID-19? Many exempt employees worked extreme long hours during COVID-19 in various departments and were not compensated at all for the excessive hours or even verbally thanked by President or senior management.

- Poor COVID-19 response and weak protection of its staff and customers.  The bank allows customers and staff to enter without masks.  President does not wear a mask and walks around all branches without wearing a mask.  When employees become infected bank does not provide a deep clean service at infected employees location or inform employees that a person whom they worked in branch, department, or floor tested positive for COVID-19. You only figure it out because infected employee either texts you or notice sick employee is off work for an extended period of time. Employees had to purchase their own PPE protection and masks. Company initially provided old bank shirts that were cut into make shift masks (basically rags) but they were not safe and not properly fitted.

- President has poor leadership and communication skill sets. He only focuses on negatives and does not provide positive reinforcement or constructive or any positive feedback to staff. This behavior is also mirrored by ""some"" other division heads. He is more focused on expenses than anything else.  

- No sales culture or incentives or annual bonuses in retail or commercial lending. Bank treats top performers equally to non-performers, which is extremely frustrating to producers to not be compensated for their hard work and sales productivity.

- New employees have to wait almost 2 years before WSB matches on their 401k. Additionally, employer matching is only done once annually in January.

- Compliance driven organization. Policy and procedures constantly contradict each other causing frustration for employees. There is less focus on sales and customer experience than checking boxes and passing an internal audit. Our compliance department stifles ingenuity, sales, marketing, and all aspects that are strong suits of being a community bank.

- We do not advertise retail and commercial deposit or loan products very well. Our marketing department is bare bones with a minimal budget.

- We have Core Values but its only window dressing. If President does not even embrace them, then why would anyone else at bank follow suit.

- Retail staff now has unrealistic and unattainable sales goals. Totally unproductive. Start small, set obtainable goals, build up your employees. You lose credibility with employees with these poorly thought out and unattainable sales goals."

37,West Suburban Bank,Students beware- Interactive Teller,2019-06-19,2.0,Interactive Teller,The only pro is the pay. And SOME of the coworkers,Hmmm. Where do I start? This job basically doesn’t support students at all. They will say that they’re super flexible with schedules when it’s a lie. If you’re full time and wanting to go to school they will tell you you can’t. If you’re part time and a student they will tell you that YOU have to work around their needs and not the other way around. You do have to work Sundays and extended hours that the branch does not have to work. Management is a joke and the company could careless about you. You’re just a body to them. Schedules are all over the place and lucky you if you’re part time you get 3 whole sick days for THE YEAR god forbid you need to call in more than 3 times or you’ll get docked. Also the customers are very old fashion and the company has babied them for decades and don’t like to hear that you listen to the rules.

50,West Suburban Bank,this company is a joke,2017-05-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,an hour lunch. nothing else,"where do i even start. management is a joke. constantly playing favoritism, can't turn to your direct supervisor, branch manager, or even your regional. if you bring up issues nothing gets solved. the turnover rate is insane. if anyone gets hired into here it will be like you stepped on a landmine. people are constantly leaving because the company doesn't value their employees.  their idea of a bonus for christmas is a $25 gift card to jewel. also, if you're looking to advance within the company, don't bother. they will get your hopes up for nothing. also, they will ask you bend over backwards, to do an open to close or finish up your shift at another branch but the one time you try to say no they will make you do it anyway."
51,West Suburban Bank,"Good Co-Workers, Terrible Business",2017-04-12,1.0,Teller,"All the locations I worked had great people to work with behind the teller line
You get to know some customers really well, and they give stuff to us.","Management stinks. They are adding a lot of new things that are making the bank worse and worse. Also they pick favorites and though they say ""everyone is getting equal schedules"" it isn't true. Finally, don't trust what they say. Scheduling isn't flexible, to not work a Saturday is almost impossible unless you are one of the ""Favorites""."
52,West Suburban Bank,Universal Banker,2017-03-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I really enjoyed the team of co-workers I worked with, but that is the only pro I can think of.","There is NO flexible work scheduling, despite what they may tell you in your interview. 
Saturday's are mandatory and if requesting a Saturday off they ask you to take vacation. 
No support from management at all as a new or existing employee. 
Pay is mediocre compared to competitors in the area.

I had a very poor experience working for WSB.
There was no support from management and when you report issues to regional managers they disregard them and no progress is made.
Training takes FOREVER to get enrolled into, don't be surprised if you do busy work for months before actually being trained and starting your role."
53,West Suburban Bank,Teller,2017-02-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,You get to keep some of the value you produce with your work.,"Everything else. very cheap Owner with minimal promotions, non existent raises."
54,West Suburban Bank,An honest review,2017-01-02,1.0,Personal Banker,The people you get to work with but that depends on the location you are at and even then sometimes good coworkers don't outweigh the really bad ones especially when the bad ones are the ones in charge.,"Not sure where to start since there is A LOT that is a con with this place. They are changing the structure of things currently making it so there are less people at branches but those people are able to do everything which they will sell you as a good thing but really when you think about it it's not. With less staff customers get aggravated and of course they take it out on the people they see. Won't even get started on the security issues there because they really could care less about anyone's well being. Be ready to work a good 10 minutes in the morning when you get there unpaid and don't bother complaining about it they don't care. Also be ready to have them dictate your schedule with little to no flexibility on their part, if you work for them you are their property essentially your time is theirs no questions asked. 
They are starting to really push the sales aspect of the job but there is no commission so I'm not sure how that makes any sense to them.  They talk about bringing incentives back but honestly they are so stingy with everything that I doubt incentives will ever be a thing there. 
Back office employees are the worst they will talk to you like you are an idiot. Upper management will treat you more like you are a peasant, there's little respect for branch employees there. This is true even for HR which is run by what I can only call an older version of a high school mean girls clique, they run the place and no you cannot sit with them. 
To wrap it up all I can say is that the job is pretty heavy and they are making it even heavier, the pay however does not reflect all the extra responsibilities they expect people to carry."
55,West Suburban Bank,Teller,2016-12-02,1.0,Teller,There were no pros other than that they will never fire you unless you steal something. The only other instance where this was not true was a teller supervisor that they fired because she cashed a check off of her own account. You could be late every day of your life working there but you will still have the job.,"Worst company to work for. The managers and supervisors do not know what they are doing. They never know what is going on. The starting pay is $8.75 per hour if anyone is interested in becoming a Teller. There is no room for promotions. The only people they promote are ""favorites."" Do not count on ever being able to use any vacation time or even getting your lunch. They make you go twelve hours without eating and they could not care less. Anyone who is considering working here should not do so. Go get a real job."

Everyone who works there agrees and they joke about it all the time. The older branches are practically falling apart. Drive through tubes consistently get stuck, speakers/mics to drive through customers are terrible, the inside of the bank looks like it's from the 80s, the banking software is from the 90s. They've cut back on everything. There's no commission incentive for opening new accounts, and it's just been recently (~past 2 years) that anyone's gotten a raise since the first time in 4-5 years.  They don't value employees and they have one of the highest if not highest turnover rate for lower level employees. Just look at how many recent teller openings there are compared with any other bank. People don't stay here long and those that do are the older folks that really have nowhere else to go."
