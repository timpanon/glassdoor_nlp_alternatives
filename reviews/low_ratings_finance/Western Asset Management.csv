8,Western Asset Management,Shame,2021-12-25,1.0,Portfolio Administrator,The offices are in a prime location with parking. It pays fairly well when you’ve been there a while.,"Something here is rotten. Look at the CEO approval rating - 28%! I have searched and cannot find another company in the industry with anything close to that. This used to be a fantastic place to work but non portfolio management have become disillusioned. A move to Texas without consultation, outsourcing, non flexible working, merger upside only for ‘professionals’. And so people are leaving at such a pace and cannot be replaced. And many simply won’t look at us because we don’t offer the flex needed to attract talent in todays workforce. This is particularly true of women, where we want to hire more but do not make it attractive."
9,Western Asset Management,Follow up on “The Fir”.,2021-11-22,3.0,Valued Employee,"Nothing really sticks out as a good solid pro. Salary and insurance, could be worse. There are some great people working at The Firm, although there are a number of not so great people.","Outsourcing is nothing to write home about. Very difficult for WAMCO employee to work. They say “You get what you pay for”. Actually, it’s those that have to work closely with then got what the Firm paid for. Management does not seem to care, as they aren’t the ones that deal with outsourcing on a regular basis, like the make it happeners do. 
I guess when you are making a very high salary, the impact of Covid on the economy has not hit those as much as those working on a much lower salary. Get a review and being told by your manager that there is a decrease in over all salary for the same position you have is a bit disturbing. I guess those don’t feel the affects of higher food, gas, energy, housing and other things that have skyrocketed since Covid began. I say hello, wake up. Is there no more cost of living adjustment to compensate for inflation?
And last but not least how is the continued work from home going. Gut feeling tells me it’s back to the office January 4th. 2022. No if and or buts. Good time for everyone to go back to the office. Right after the major holiday season. I’m thinking, we may see an increase starting around January 15th. 
One more thing, there is rumor that Mr. Hirschman may be retiring. How many people think that is a good thing. Based on his approval rate, I would say most. Mr. Hirschman, please enjoy your retirement. I’m pretty sure the soaring cost of living will have no direct impact on you."

Nothing has been done since March 2020 to ensure people’s well being and what their staff must be going through. Have they given any thought that their staff are being affected by this? Have they given any thought that staff may have lost loved ones or those close to them?

31,Western Asset Management,Thank you Western Asset!,2020-05-13,5.0,Client Services,"Western Asset is an incredible company to work for-- I feel lucky to have been able to advance my career here. Western Asset is genuinely focused on doing what's right for their clients and their employees. I felt inspired to post today based on the way that the company has supported its staff and their families during this global pandemic. 

Western's Executive Team has been decisive and generous throughout the crisis, swiftly moving teams into locations to protect our well-being while keeping client’s needs at the forefront of all decision making. They leveraged their cafeteria and custodial services to provide us with access to food, supplies and meal programs when grocery stores were empty. They procured masks for us to purchase. The Firm organized employee calls with leading health officials to provide us with the most up-to-date information on Covid-19 and protective measures. Western Asset also brought nurses on-site as a resource for employees and even provided voluntary antibody testing for those of us who wanted it. They have gone above and beyond to keep our team healthy, safe, nourished and engaged. During this time of incredible chaos and uncertainty, the Executive Team has been unflinchingly steady and focused, and I am grateful to be a part of this organization.","During normal times, Western does not have flex work policy. Perhaps post-crisis, this could be revisited."
32,Western Asset Management,"Good company, no growth",2020-02-24,3.0,Portfolio Administrator,"Normal hours, simple work, not too challenging","No Growth, low pay, low bonuses"
33,Western Asset Management,Heed the reviews regarding politics,2019-12-04,1.0,Information Technology,"On the outside, the culture seems polite and friendly. Once you go deeper, it's nothing but dirty back stabbing politics. The company's ethos and its HR insist on fake, ineffective polite niceties. Ability to play dirty while appearing polite with a smile is the number one valued asset far above all else. If you can do this, you're set. Full stop. 

Then ability to remain quiet, brown nose the dirtiest behinds and practice heavy handed CYA are helpful skill set. Somewhere towards the bottom is real talent with strong work ethics.

IT is one of the most chaotic and inefficient group where talent for dirty politics is the only essential. IT has an established history of ridding genuine, usually new, and effective talents in the most creative ways if they threaten lackadaisical veterans. Over the last couple years, have witnessed strong and proven effective performers who've managed meaningful contribution in their short time here be driven out for the most laughable and irrelevant reasons. I mentally checked out sometimes last year. It's a contagious cultural disease which often infect some incoming employees who may have had promise. IT has now gone through many restructures and gotten rid of some senior fats, yet much fatty veterans remain at the helm still and so the infection continues.

Sadly IT is not the only group needing serious reconstruction, however. Its COO came in promising to listen and make effective changes. It got people excited. Now 4+ years later, after an embarrassing amount spent on an army of consultants, one is forced to realize she only has ears for the same ole veteran politicians.

It would be a remiss to fail to recognize the existence of actual talents; its CIO, for one, carried the company despite being 90% fat. There are a few other genuinely strong and effective players. After all, these pillars are the reason the company is able to pay employees above market for doing so little.

One real upside: if you don't mind checking your soul at the front door, play a little politics and remain yourself 4x daily you're there to collect paychecks, your work life balance is guaranteed. The reality is, this is valuable and adequate for many. Being far from proud, it is for me.","See above. Covers both pros and cons. 
IT isn't the only problematic group. There are many. But it is one of the largest."

35,Western Asset Management,"Excellent reputation internally, externally. Possibly a firm to stay with long-term",2019-10-23,5.0,Client Service,"My impression is that Western is a solid name in the business. Western’s reputation is a huge asset for employee morale/productivity and client retention/growth - and one that cannot be taken for granted in such a competitive business. Staff generally perform work with a high degree of professionalism yet remain fairly approachable and patient particularly with new employees, junior staff and/or colleagues in other departments. Initiatives such as self-development workshops, internal interviews as well as opportunities for internal mobility/transfers are some sources of continued professional development, while employee-led clubs (Toastmasters, Women in Finance) and office events (like bowling night just a couple weeks ago) provide casual networking opportunities. As an external hire with no prior experience in my current role, I am not really surprised now why many have cited Western’s culture and friendly people as standout reasons to join (and stay) and why I am, 1 year on, recommending Western to friends seeking new challenges.",There are times when staffing resources are overstretched

Please search for:
""SEC Charges Legg Mason Affiliate With Defrauding Clients""  and you will find an example. This is public record.  

Why this is happening:

I've worked at western multiple times and it used to be a great place.  In the past it was a more of a meritocracy and a grittier environment.   People pushed for new ideas and ways to do things.  The information technology managers weren't  afraid to shake things up and support new ideas.  Those people are now gone and it's just complacent IT middle managers who have been there for far too long.  Their skills are old and they protect their jobs by keeping things the same.  The technology is aging and will increasingly become a liability rather than an asset.  This is mostly perpetuated by (IT) managers who don't want their two hour lunches threatened.   The number of people who do very little, if anything, is absurd.   

If you are thinking of taking a job here watch out!  They follow a last in first out approach to employees; this is why there is very little opportunity for growth and wages are generally stagnant.

It seems Western's best days are in the past."

With a very few exceptions, everyone at Western is a professional who is smart and knows how to treat people.  It's easy and encouraged to communicate with different parts of the company.","I worked in different groups within Investment Support, and some groups are run too tight.  For example, if one person takes a vacation, everybody gets that stressed-out, worried look on their faces because covering the absent person will make their workload too much to bear.  The same employees then feel guilty about taking vacations. This is what causes turnover -- you can't have happy employees when their mental health rests on such a sharp edge.

Don't be fooled by the smiles around you, Coworkers here are not your friends!  You get paid just about enough to tolerate the misery, and not a penny more.

Giant screen TVs in your face all day; there used to be yummy birthday cakes; those National Geographic $20 coffee table books that you get for Christmas and use as firewood; those 0.50 cent, plastic Rosebowl pins you get each year (thanks to a certain person’s board membership on the Rosebowl); the 0.25 cents breast cancer awareness pin!

This is a great place for football jocks.  Forget it, if you are a woman, belong to a minority group, or are not a member of WAMs upper class cronies.  Stay in the closet if you’re gay!   There are exceptions sometimes:  if you’re a rude, sarcastic, cut throat, twenty something you might one day get to become a “portfolio manager”.  That’s especially true if you get on the “A” list right away, then you might get invited to after hour cocktails where you have a chance to mingle with the big guns.  

Bonus Points:  Giving a certain person at the top the boot this year, and hopefully putting an end to regular email blasts to the workers boasting about “sitting in the first class cabin seated behind (fill in with famous celebrity or rock star name, followed by a snicker or two about that person's appearance) enjoying my second or third glass of wine”, ever reminding the serfs of their lowly station in life.","Wall St. has a bad reputation to begin with, but this place is truly a snake pit.  Backstabbing, Heartless Sociopaths from Top Down!

Unless you're really good with daggers, there is no upward mobility.  None.  The big dogs hope you quit or drop dead (far out of sight) so they can pocket more for themselves. 

Human Resources managed by treacherous monsters.  Any legitimate issue you bring to their attention will be blamed on You!   HRs job is to protect the narcissistic portfolio managers and fund officers from their own wrongdoing.   The little serfs mean nothing to the demons running this place.  You are monitored all day by cameras and electronic time cards on your computer that keep track of every minute you are or are not at your desk."
112,Western Asset Management,Overworked and under appreciated,2014-06-10,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The Bond Market café is fantastic!  The food is partially subsidized by WA making it extremely affordable.    The gourmet, organic, restaurant quality food at fast food prices can't be beat.  

WA offers GREAT benefits:  
When I was there all medical, dental, and vision premiums were paid for 100% for every employee AND their families. There was some talk of reducing this benefit before I left, but I have no idea if that happened.","Overworked:  You will be overworked.  WA likes to work their employees to the bone.  Rather than realizing that overworking and overwhelming people will only result in mistakes, they essentially allow the mistakes to happen and then hold said mistakes against the employees.  

Underpaid:  You will be underpaid.  Oh, there will be the promise of bonuses of up to 30% of your base pay, but if you ask around you will find that this is very much the exception rather than the rule.  

Immobility:  There is no room for growth at WA.  Upper management is highly compensated and coddled to the point where they never leave.  If you want career growth I suggest get a job at WA to build your resume  (people in the industry are always impressed when they see WA on my resume) and then leave as soon as you have the skills you need.  You will be paid better and have better opportunity for growth elsewhere.  

The Good Ole Boys Club:  There is a very distinct line drawn between staff and management and if you aren't management you basically don't matter.  Period.  If you get in the elevator with the CEO be prepared to be ignored."

What ends up happening is their most talented people end up leaving for better pay and opportunities elsewhere.

The firm is obsessed with bureaucracy which makes sense, because they have so many recent college grads they need to get them all in line some how. 

There is a definite good old boy culture in the firm. Though the firm has a strict rule against nepotism, the higher ups find ways around that rule.

This firm offers everythng you could want in terms of benefits.  Fully paid medical, dental, and vision. They have a generous FSA plan as well as 401k profit sharing contributions, etc.  When you are on the firms ""good side"" you are very well taken care of financially (ie. bonuses).

Subsidized Cafe!
The firm has a wonderful partially subsidized cafe.  The food is pretty good for cafe food and the prices are phenomenal.  The menu choices can get boring after a while though, so as great as it is, you'll still want to go out to eat sometimes.

Location location location!
The location in Pasadena is wonderful.  This location makes for an easy commute for many of the firls employees.  There are MANY great restaurants and even a few gyms that are within walking distance of the firm.","Politics
If you aren't ""someone"" (upper management) at this firm, then you are no one and the seperation between the two ""classes"" is painfully obvious at this firm.  It's unfortunate that this firm doesn't do more to make the staff feel truly appreciated.  They attempt to do so in the form of bonuses and benefits but sometimes a genuine thank you can be just as important as money.  

Hours
Be prepared to work long hours if you accept a position at this firm.  Though the management at this firm likes to think of themselves as family friendly, I was often made to feel as if I was inconveniencing them if I had to take a few hours off to take my son to the doctor.  After the many hours I dedicated to my position at this firm it was disappointing that the management wasn't more understanding about small things like that.  

Mobility
If you think you are going to get your foot in the door and work your way to upper management or to the trading floor, look elsewhere.  There is very little mobility, mentoring, of career developement at this firm.  Part of the reason for this is that they make their upper management so happy that they never want to leave (a plus for them but a big negative for anyone looking for career growth)."

The Bond cafe was great. The Pasadena location is very nice. Overtime was paid on top of the salary and bonus. It is a good place to work if you are looking to be with the company for a long time and do not mind corporate politics. They try and keep employees updated on what is going on in the Finance industry. Lower management is great. Great company for people very focused on their careers and also for those who have families. They give opportunities to people who aren't from top schools.,"The corporate culture is a bit weird. Everything seems to be laid back but you can't help that someone is watching over your shoulder all the time. Everyone seemed to come to work with a fake corporate smile. Overtime is  a must at this company, otherwise you will get ""talked"" to for being an efficient employee. If you are not looking to make Western your life its probably not the place for you. Upper management were highly praised throughout the company, but it was almost a idolized type of feeling. Mid-level management was very nice to lower-management but were very quick to find fault with them an issue arose. Lower-management was great, kind caring, and understanding of the employees and were amicable in dealing with employee performance issues. The non-management employees were very nice. Most come from USC or UCLA so you get a lot of talk about that rivalry. Some of my associates were working there for 3-5 years and despite their hard work, desire to move in the company, and post-graduate degrees and certifications in finance were still in the same spot. There was an excess of unnecessary training and meetings."

139,Western Asset Management,The most depressing experience of my life,2012-08-18,1.0,Risk Analyst,"WAMCO has very a good IT infrastructure, good systems, established processes, good health benefits, and very nice offices and resources. They have offices in NY, Europe, and Asia. There are a lot of die hard WAMCO-for-life kind of people, as its very common for people to work at WAMCO for over 10 years.",No career path and very limited opportunities for advancement or growth. People are poorly treated. Very poor corporate culture. Compensation (base+bonus) is by far the worst in the industry. Managers do not care about professional growth and development. A very prevalent culture of blame and bureaucracy.

Risk Management has historically been terrible. Continued outflow of funds. Morale is very poor and management is none existent. Steve Walsh running up and down corridors whooping like an idiot is hardly the inspiration people are looking for.
141,Western Asset Management,bad company to work for; portray themselves as swordfish but in reality they are nothing but sardines.,2012-06-21,1.0,,"decent salaries, decent bonus, decent working areas, other than that, not much more.","disloyal to employees, no career path, inhumane dismissal process, eliminated most perks available to employees, is now taking advantage of the bad job market and making employees' lives miserable by micro-managing, dictating, not allowing room for breathing, inflicting fear, terminating good, long time employees to replace with new ones for half the salary.  Awful, awful place to work, a lot of job instability and high employee turn over."

People are very nice.  Personal Chefs in the Bond Market cafeteria.  General job security.  Was kept very busy.,Not much inter-departmental movement.  Hard to move from one area to another.

I always dealt as though upward mobility was possible. My managers were always at the least fair, and most of the time advocates for myself and our group.","Typical issues with a mid-sized company... Management's left hand not talking to the right and associated inter-company wrangling when trying to get things done or launch new initiatives. Western unfortunately is not an ""innovator"" in their field."
