It's not like we won't be able to do our job properly, but it's more like the lack of the company to its employees"
1,Western Funding,A revert back to childhood,2022-03-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Can't really think of any except you are able to turn off the constant barrage of leadership request for a collective improvement to the salesforce.,Micromanagement is abundant. Salary guarantee eliminated after 1 yr employment. Gas reimbursement at .113 per mile. Terrible infrastructure. Sweat shop mentality. 2% capture rates lowest in the automotive finance industry.
2,Western Funding,Run as FAST as you can.  Do Not Apply.,2021-12-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,NONE nada ZILCH nothing ZERO,Management is a joke. A complete joke. President is a puppet with no backbone.
3,Western Funding,Growing and improving every day,2021-09-24,4.0,Director of Sales,"We're growing by over 50% year over year, and constantly looking to see how we can improve as a company. Jim Murray has been the President at Western for 4 years now, and the program and culture changes the company has made in that time have been huge. We'll continue to grow as quickly as we can, while making our customer and employee experience better every day. It's in our value and culture to listen to our employees and we make adjustments whenever possible to ensure continuous improvement. Looking forward to what we can accomplish in Jim's next 4 years!","Sales Rep's must follow the process we teach and work hard to quickly grow their business. New Rep's aren't handed producing accounts, but are rewarded well for growing their contract count with dealers we haven't done much business with in the past."

6,Western Funding,All Hype with no real production!,2021-07-12,1.0,AREA SALES MANAGER,"They give you a mobile phone, a laptop, and a mobile hotspot, that's all I can think of","- Company is owned by it's parent company Westlake Financial which is 20X bigger and eats off the meat before throwing this company the bones. 

- Revolving door of sales reps and regional managers because the program is poorly managed. 

- Promise a pay plan and guarantee only to change it 3 months after you've signed a 6 to 12 month pay plan

- The auto finance program is so difficult to understand, dealers are disengaged after you pitch them the program and take out the charts and talk about all these different ways they will get paid, only to never see the back end money. 

- internal office processing thinks they are the FBI and make up state requirements as they go along. They require licenses that are not even required by the dmw, therefore signing up a dealer is almost impossible even though they already are signed up with the parent company Westlake Financial. 

- Very slow growth in the company, but management will promise you the world.

- Most expensive benefits I've ever had with the worst coverages."

10,Western Funding,Growing company with real opportunity if you work hard.,2021-05-03,5.0,RSM,"Strong sales management. During my 4+ years at Western I was afforded the opportunity to learn and grow in a dynamic and changing environment. Managment listens and takes action to adjust when appropriate. Strong program that with hard work will allow you the chance to grow your market. The key is hard work. There is great support in the form of peer to peer sharing. Being part of the Westlake family gives Western the ability to attack the markets aggressively and grow. The key is effort! in the last 2 years there have been a lot of great changes such as improved program, reduced funding time and lots of automation. Can't say enough good things about my experience there in sales leadership.",As with any growing company there are processes that may create obstacles but with that said I know amd saw that they are committed to removing those obstacles and improving the processes to enable the sales team. The key is patience and hard work. keep pushing WFI!
11,Western Funding,Stay Far Away,2021-04-14,1.0,Sales Representative,Don't accept a sales position here,"Credit , MSR & underwriting look for ways to not do business. They treat Sales like garbage. The guy that does training is a failed sales rep. Management provides no support, just spends the day staring at reports"
12,Western Funding,Management has NO accountability ... Just finger pointing.,2021-03-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Mon-Fri 8-5 ... THAT'S IT.,"Management, if you are LIKED .... you will make it. If not, you WON'T. Period."

It won't be appreciated.",Management rarely gives you accolades or uplifting remarks. The one on one training really needs to be given to EVERYone.
16,Western Funding,Used to be a great place to work,2020-09-17,2.0,Internal Sales Representative,PTO policy is pretty relaxed,"management changes have brought on a negative and toxic work environment. what use to be an enjoyable job is now one that comes with negative side affects of stress, pay cuts. You will be over worked with meaningless tasks to try and push an objective even though what you will be doing all day is no guarantee you will be successful. Director level management never tells you when you're doing a good job and only focuses on the negative."

19,Western Funding,Bad work environment will cause you to leave,2020-01-05,1.0,Project Manager,None just get another job,"Part of the Hankey Group and just like WFS.  Treats employees poorly and pays them even worse.

Very Toxic work environment 

This company does not value its employees at all. I’ve seen multiple dealer account managers get let go from one bad month of sales even when they were crushing in consecutive months (not very stable jobs at this company). 

I’ve witnessed employees of various departments get harassed by managers and executive leadership. HR does not do their job to prevent this. 

Also they use illegal business practices against consumers.

If you would like to work in a high stress, unstable, unorganized environment then apply to Westlake otherwise RUN the other way!"

We have Amazing hours, location and work setting. I am where I am solely on the shoulders of my supervisor; Brilliant Sales managers who train until you have it down, and a light, non-micromanaged environment. Not to mention, the commission and benefits! It is not stuffy or snooty on the Sales team.
Management regularly adjusts seating to keep the veterans surrounding the newbies, so they may learn by listening and also not have to go far for answers. This action creates unexpected friendships, as well, as a bonus. It is hands down the Best place I have ever worked. I was able to get my friend hired, also and she feels the same. We love coming to work.","That this is the only branch in the country. Las Vegas.  If miracles happen and they open another on the East Coast, I will be the 1st with my hat in the ring."

24,Western Funding,Growing Company with lots of potential,2018-11-26,4.0,AREA SALES MANAGER,"Great company to work for, management welcomes ideas on growth, change, and improvements and actually listens.  They are beginning to promote from within which means you can actually have a long-term plan if you want to grow with the company.  Managers are more like coaches so the learning process is seamless.

Management is understanding, builds its employees up, doesn't micro-manage and overall they are very transparent.","No cons.  I have been with the company since 2011 and I've been fortunate to learn many different positions here and expand my knowledge of the sub-prime auto finance industry, as well as move up within the company.

28,Western Funding,Area Sales Managemwnt,2017-03-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Nothing! I can't think of one good thing.,This company is a joke! Unrealistic expectations from the area sales managers. Program sucks. Managers are a joke. They have no idea what they are doing. So much negative things to say.
29,Western Funding,Lack of leadership and disappointing results,2017-03-20,1.0,AREA SALES MANAGER,Free trip to Las Vegas. Co-workers are friendly in the beginning. Had fill twenty word minimum. Lowest compensation in industry.,"Where do I begin...first there are many management positions that are vacant since bankruptcy in 2014. When both a regional and VP leave in same month you have to ask questions. A lower level employee cannot realistically expect to make anywhere near the money they promise you. They only do a couple hundred loans during tax time smh. They can't honestly think there doing, but so great. Western has many Draconian processes and technology that greatly limits your effectiveness in the field. Sign-ups+low production=""sign-up mill"". They ineffectively price deals so callbacks are way below competition. Not to forget 2 month recourse...if you've worked this industry before you will realize how many banks do 2month recourse and how many are still around.  A lot of miscommunication between field and back of office. There is a LOT of micro management. With the amount of micro management you would expect leadership to be held accountable for results/production, but they're not. This a company we're you are intimated/punished for voicing ideas and opinions.Seriously think and ask questions before accept position with this company."
