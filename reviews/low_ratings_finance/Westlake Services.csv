quit and they couldnt find replacements.

98,Westlake Services,Bad Pay,2019-07-06,1.0,Software Engineer,People and other departments are nice to work with.,"1) Pay is terrible. Started at around 65K after a 6 month internship instead of 76k-80k which is glassDoor's and indeed's average for starting salary in the same area due to cost of living, and by the time i reached my 5-6th year i was only at 72k after reaching a senor based status with the company instead of the national average of a senor software engineer which is 90-100k. 
2) Management is unaware of how much you make after leaving i was notified that I should stay because i was making more than the rest my pay was 72k but they believed I was making 85K. 
2) Management will underpay you but request more work, and more time which already includes a 24 hour standby to emergency applications which you have never touched.

3) False promises of getting raises. In my time working here anytime a large number of people left or someone important left there was this whole dinner or meeting in which people were told they would get a raise we never did. 

4) Vacation time will not be honored. I reached a large amount of vacation time and when it came time to collect i was told i couldn't have it and the few times I could have it was called into work while I was away its a sweat shop for anyone in IT."

So you could end up working 6 days a week for 4 weeks straight if the days fall at the end and then beginning weeks of the month. (which I've had to do)  In addition, you must clock in exactly on time every time, otherwise that count negatively towards you. Also, they changed the pay structure that if you don't work certain hrs or if your not receiving  enough outbound calls through the autodialer (which you have no control over), then you could receive a lesser bonus according to their grading system.

The worst day here is easily better than probably the best day at many other similar companies. Most direct management have done my job, and done it at a high level so they understand our jobs, but more importantly, they understand what kind of management it takes to help us be successful. Also, it's fun to tell headhunters that 1. Whoever they are representing couldn't afford me, and 2. Even if offered stupid money, you can't buy the quality of life I have with Westlake. Highlights include:
-Uncapped earning potential
-Very little micro management
-State of the art technology
-Excellent work/life balance","Dealer Account Manager position is no joke. A lot is expected, but a lot can be gained. As much or as little support is there, but it is up to the hire to look for it. Westlake expects professionals and will not babysit you. Great for self starters, not so great tor people that need to be micromanaged. Full disclosure:
-You will be given enough rope to hang yourself if you're unmotivated
-New hire ""washout"" rate on new sales hires can be high
Personal bias:
-If one can't hack it, that person isn't Westlake material anyway."

221,Westlake Services,Westlake through the eyes of a future Key Player,2016-04-11,5.0,Assistant Supervisor (Lead),"People, purpose and passion are the companies core values. I feel like they do a fantastic job in actively following these values. 

Purpose even at an entry level positions they give you goals to meet. They ask for us to meet a certain metric or goal every day. For those that excel, growth within the company is available and sometimes prompted by our superiors.

Passion, whether it may be helping others, problem solving or teaching. If you haven't found your passion in life there's a great chance you will find it here. By offering a wide variety of positions. Westlake will help you find your passion for your purposein the professional field. Westlake will help you grow and it will help you build a or further your career. Once you've found your purpose it's with passion that the position will keep you going and growing. Once you're passionate of what you do work doesn't feel like work anymore.

People, by offering several services available to their employees and customers the company continues to thrive.  There's so many benefits for Westlake employees. Health care, on site gym, bike share, yoga classes, 401 K, company picnic, Holiday party etc. The list just goes on. When you have happy employees they provide better service and work harder to service the customers to the best of their abilities. 

The company is so large that I cannot name everyone that works here but it feels like a family. The company grows and grows every year, but it has the feel of a mom and pop business. I enjoy coming to work and knowing that I have a great group of people to leverage off of. The people make this company such a great place work at, from the CEO to our temps. Everyone comes in to work with a great attitude an drive to succeed. It's a hugely satisfying feeling to know that you're a part of something great.",The only con that I can think of is the cancellation of the shuttle service. I take the metro to work and the shuttles were so convenient.

One thing I really like is the companies focus on Health and Happiness.  The company supplies Apples, bananas and oranges every morning.  This is something my old employer would not do.  Also, the company has a work out room and you can take 1 of 6 bikes for an afternoon break.  This is really cool!

In my department, we have a ha[ppy hours with management and sr. management along with awards for the best in our group.  

Another recent change is that we are able to park across the street from the company.  In DTLA this is a big perk and it's free.

Also, I see people getting promoted all the time and the company seems to promote from within.  What I really enjoy is Westlake University where I can learn excel as well as other parts of the business.  The values are People / Purpose / Passion!

Always tracking your calls & visits, high pressure, weekly pressure meetings, inferior product that requires clients to pay a monthly software fee + per-look credit pull fee then still leaves clients less-than-happy most times. Dealers calling you at all hours to work the deal because that is the practice: Show them how to work the software, but call me when you have questions.

Yet the company's performance is stellar year after year, but that income doesn't trickle down to us peons. We have some pretty greedy owners.

The Senior Management has very poor communication skills. The President acts like a 4 year old one minute and a tyrannical cursing manic the next.  He was constantly in our area screaming about poor performance and completely negating everything our well meaning manager just told us.

Parking is horrible so expect to wait 15 minutes for a shuttle from the offsite parking lot to the office and hope your manager doesn't write you up.

And of course, turnover is VERY high at all levels of the company.  In my department I saw 1/2 of my coworkers, two supervisors, and the manager leave during my 2 years there.

Compensation is above the industry average but hold that against you.

The company has many flaws that need immediate attention. To begin,  the company is constantly facing lawsuits from varies angles including customers, employees, and perhaps even dealerships. Employee turnover is extremely high, especially for the sales department. There will be conflict with management and the objective of the company if you possess high morals and integrity as this environment involves making cold heart decisions.  The majority of management lacks a proper educational background to correspond with their position. The environment is very unprofessional as management is constantly talking about how they personally feel towards any individual in the company in front of other members. People with high morals and integrity, if you are physically attractive, stay away from company events as all boundaries are crossed. Finally the pay, for anonymous reasons I'll keep my title hidden. However lets just say that I was making about 20k less than the companies competitors. In addition to making 20k less, my pay was composed of about 33 percent bonus and 66 base pay (salary). The 66 percent pay was salary, meaning there was no way getting paid overtime. On top of a fix pay, you were required to work 2 Saturdays a month, which meant working overtime without the overtime pay. Now the 33 percent bonus was really your pay that you deserved every cent for (in a perfect world). However, since the world is not perfect, the 33 percent is based on how well you perform on with your responsibilities, but in reality it came down if the department did well and if not, lets make it up by taking the employees pay away (bonus). In essence, your bonus pay is a reserve for the company's loss. On top of that, their is a huge discrepancy in bonus pay among people who are ""liked"" and people who are not ""liked"". My advice to future staff: get your experience and find something greater."

Their product is not competitive, there are many other loan companies with better interest rates.  Their back end staff to manage the loan is filled with very lowly compensated people who are both not well trained and afraid to speak out about the mistakes they see, so sales staff suffer the consequences by losing the accounts they work so hard to secure.
