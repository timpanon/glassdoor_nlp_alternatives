3,Winthrop-University Hospital Employees Federal Credit Union,Loved it,2019-09-17,4.0,Member Service Representative,Great people to work with. Room for growth and learning specifically into loans department.,Small credit union most work is done by tellers. Could use better organization clear outline of things that should be done. There is no formal training for the position its learn as you go which is not very great considering you are going to be held responsible for you errors and that could potentially be held against you.
