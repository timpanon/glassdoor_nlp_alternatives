0,Woodforest National Bank,Good starter bank...that's it.,2022-04-04,2.0,Teller/Retail Banker,Great bank to start off at with no experience at a financial institution. It teaches a lot about how a bank operates and learning about what different types of services banks offer.,"Management is lazy and loves to micromanage. They love to push their goals but do not do anything themselves to try and reach it, they expect their tellers/retail bankers to do it all. Work-life balance is almost nonexistent, long working hours, working on holidays."
1,Woodforest National Bank,good job,2022-04-03,4.0,Assistant Branch Manager,"great 401k
vacation
ability to promote within","hours
back office not always helpful
issues with reaching depts"
2,Woodforest National Bank,They don’t care about your life outside of work,2022-04-02,1.0,Retail Banker II,There weren’t any pros for working here.,"Where do I start??? First off.. you’re not allowed to have your phone on you. When you get there you have to lock it up in a drawer for your whole shift unless you were on lunch break. Because of this I missed out on a lot of job opportunities when I was looking for new jobs! The branch that I worked at the hours were from 10am-7pm Monday through Friday and from 10am-6pm on Saturday’s. They also have you traveling from branch to branch covering shifts because they can’t find anyone to hire. Also, on your days off your harassed for keys. If you call off they want you to come in and bring your keys so they can open. They don’t even ask you if you want to work at another branch you’re just put on the schedule. The schedule always changes. You can come in Monday with one schedule and by 3pm that same day the schedule is revised at least twice. Higher ups talk to their employees disrespectful. If you’re not getting accounts to hit goal you’re the worst team. One time one of the higher ups sent out a mass text stating that if they weren’t at goal they had to open one hour early or stay one hour later to get your numbers. They reward their employees hard work with pizza parties. They don’t care about their employees. I didn’t receive an annual raise my first year. Which is when it started looking for a new job but because of the no cell phone policy it took me forever to get out of that toxic work environment. Also salary employees steal hours from the company. They leave early all the time, take long lunch breaks, and go shopping at Walmart on their shift. Meanwhile the hourly employees are stuck dealing with all the customers. There is so much more I could say but I’m going to leave it at that. DO NO WORK HERE!!!"
3,Woodforest National Bank,A Better Opportunity is Anywhere Else,2022-04-02,2.0,Retail Banker,The compensation was pretty fair,"Long hours filled with standing

* My managers in both positions (Retail Banker and Business System Analyst) are extraordinary human beings. They guided me in my training for each position and supported me in my professional growth. They were always empathic.
* The company is inclusive and human resources personnel take very seriously any situation where there is some kind of discrimination of any type. Respect and Inclusion are values ​​rooted in the company.","*Some members of upper management for Retail Banking have things to improve. They make decisions that impact the lives of employees without thoroughly investigating the root of the problem, without listening to other points of view. Their communication is poor and they do not encourage teamwork. In my opinion, they place unnecessary stress (mentally and physically) on Branch Managers"

Flexibility of having a weekday off with Sundays is good when staffed. There will always be an opportunity to advance into management,lack support from upper management. Some weeks you can work everyday because of the lack of support from upper mgmt and peers from being short staffed. I've worked the branch alone at times and being way understaffed and still was questioned about goals.

The man is socially awkward and he is basically by far the most abrasive and foul mouthed leader of a company I’ve ever had the misfortune to work with. 
Would call me and curse me out on my cell phone at the drop of a hat. Much more he is just a punk that caught a free ride on a really great man’s back. Egotistical, mean and lacked any thread of human decency."

You have to CALL (NO messaging to expedite and ease communication)around to get the ok to deposit or cash if the dollar amount is over you limit, sometimes this can take 30 minutes,making the customers impatient, creating long lines of waiting customers. Calls are declined if managment has received to many calls from 1 branch. Playing favorites by management is widely known and is acceptable by management."

Upper management such as the Market Manager and Regional Manager are terrible. Just outright miserable people. However, you can work around them by not letting them dictate your success. Do not get comfortable because they stay moving people out. Veteran employees leave or get terminated regularly. Managers are always first to go.

- You are expected to be a teller, banker, financial advisor, manager, janitor, trainer, and mentor, but get compensated like only a janitor.

- Exterior hires at the branch management level tend to flop.
- Company does not respect Retail Bankers and only acknowledges sales, not being talented or ambitious or a problem solver.
- Approval limits are laughable. The system is set up so you can turn to your in-store branch manager for an approval, but if they aren't in-store (happens ALOT), you will have to email and call other branches. The customer will think something is wrong with them or their account the whole time.

Sometimes you get sent to a training branch and sometimes you don't. That depends on how shorthanded they are at that branch at that time. It's about what is best for the branch.

If someone can't help from another location, you are stuck working 10 hours with no break. Needless to say, we were short staffed regularly.

You are asked to put Woodforest before your family. The training is horrible if you receive any at all. Employees are mistreated and disregarded. They will expect you to operate at just dual control which are unrealistic expectations. Voicing your concerns to upper management is a waste of time. Meeting the requirement to gain your monthly or annual incentive is not realistic. The only thing they care about is you opening new relationships and current customers are irrelevant. You won't get the experience that you would at a real bank, such as being loan trained and having an NMLS. Work hours are unfavorable."

216,Woodforest National Bank,Pretty Good,2021-03-30,3.0,Assistant Manager,"Hands-on experience; like other people have said, it's a full-service bank. You kind of do it all, and learn it all.
Closed on Sundays now, because of the pandemic. Been over a year of that, so hopefully it sticks.
Health insurance is pretty affordable, and I haven't had any problems being accepted any where. Also, for what it's worth, in terms of trans-related surgeries, they do cover top and bottom. Nothing deemed ""cosmetic"" though like FFS or breast implants.","Hours:
Most branches Mon-Fri are 10-6. Later start, but leave later as well. Most recently I was there until 7:30pm because everyone came in during the last hour with their stimulus checks. Being open later leaves a lot of opportunity to be delayed on closing the branch.
Short staffing:
I was there that late because it was just the two of us. Every few years Woodforest as a company goes through a tiring period of being short staffed. I started in 2017, and this is the second time this has happened. Twice in four years is a lot.
Clientele:
Most branches are inside Walmart, so, you get my drift. On average, people are just ruder.
Pandemic:
They gave the saddest excuses for masks at the beginning. Also hardly any PPE in terms of plexiglass dividers/shields. It took until June of 2020 to have the needed amount plexiglass at the branch to feel properly protected. A year into the pandemic and they're really trying to push us back to normal. This ain't over yet, I'm not doing a Walmart walk to go drum up accounts while too many people are mask-less. People are also just in general more terrible during all this. Even though I understand why, please don't place your attitude at my desk. Your situation is not my fault, and with a little bit of kindness I will do everything I can to ease your situation."

330,Woodforest National Bank,"Nepotism, Hight turnover, Upper management is not visible, not much racial diversification in management",2020-09-14,1.0,Senior Business Analyst,They are flexible with your work schedule and the benefits a decent.,"I worked at Woodforest Bank in the Information Technology (IT) department for about a year and a half and the following was my experience. If you are considering a position at Woodforest in their IT department, consider the advice below. Note: My intention is not to make Woodforest look bad but rather to 1) help potential employees get a good picture of what it’s like to work there and 2) help Woodforest management make changes to help improve their work environment. 
1)	The biggest thing to be aware of is nepotism. Woodforest is filled with families and friends which creates a good old boy/girl environment. If you are not a part of this group or do not find a way to become a part of that group, then your ability to grow is limited. In addition to this, I feel it creates a culture where some people in leadership roles feel like they are invincible and can treat people however they want without consequences. (I only experience a handful of people like this). 
2)	Hight turnover. The year and a half that I was there more than half of the people I worked with left the company. It also seemed like people were always leaving outside of my team as well. I am not surprised when you consider 1) poor internal customer service and 2) being spread too thin. 
3)	Upper management is not visible. The year and a half I worked at Woodforest I do not recall the CIO, CTO, CEO ever speaking to us and expressing their vision and goals. If they did communicate it was very little and not memorable (email). This gives the perception of poor leadership in my opinion. 
4)	I did not see much racial diversification in management and upper management roles. 
5)	My experience was that the IT management would spread their resources thin by assigning them to multiple business lines with multiple projects. For example, I was responsible for 3 different lines of business that had a total of 8 different projects going on at the same time. When I brought this up to management the answer was “this is what we have to do because we can’t hire more people.” In my opinion, if you spread people too thin it will affect the quality and focus of their work. The result that I saw was work not getting done and a lack of quality and this lead to high turnover.

Conclusion: 
The people that have worked at Woodforest the longest in general were either part of the nepotism network or people who found their niche and stayed to themselves. If you decide to work at Woodforest I recommend you either find a way to infiltrate the nepotism network or find your niche and stay out of the crosshairs of those few managers who lack people skills (if you get on their bad side they will make you time at Woodforest miserable)."

393,Woodforest National Bank,Foot in the door of the banking industry.  Get out once you can.,2020-02-16,2.0,Assistant Branch Manager,"The only really good thing about Woodforest is that it provides you with an opportunity to get your foot in the door of the banking industry to learn the basics of banking, develop your knowledge and skills, gain experience and build up your resume to the point that you can find a better job with a better bank.

The decent points of working here while you're still here is that you actually do get pretty good benefits and you can enroll in the insurance programs immediately after starting.  You get two weeks of paid vacation time right from the get go and sick leave accrues separately from vacation time.  After six months you can enroll in the 401k and the company provides a 50% match to your contributions up to 6%, though they are slow when it comes to vesting you in their contributions.  The company pays incentive bonuses when your branch hits 100% of its sales goals, there are usually opportunities to get overtime and holiday pay for working holidays (the bank only closes on Christmas, Easter and Thanksgiving in my region) and there are advancement opportunities as I was promoted to ABM after less than a year with the bank, and you can really learn a lot if you have a good branch manager.  You also get a free checking account with the bank, and since the bank is privately held the stock is consistent and usually increases in value each quarter.","The cons of working at Woodforest are abundant.  The bank is open 7 days a week as it is located within Walmart, which is nice for customers but awful for employees as you will be working most weekends for no extra pay and can sometimes go long periods without a day off.  There are no paid holidays off, even Christmas, which means that even if you close for a holiday that is just considered one of your days off and you still have to work 40 hours.  The bank also has a high turnover rate and most branches are short-staffed, so you can expect to be pressured to work overtime and travel to work at other branches.  I practically lived at Woodforest when I worked there and had very little personal time for myself, which is even harder on employees who have families.

The bank generally has low pay, with retail bankers being paid well below industry average, which combined with the poor work/life balance results in the high turnover rate I mentioned earlier as employees will often leave as soon as they can find a position with another bank.  Managers make decent money, but it is still less than employees in similar positions at other banks make, especially when you consider the sheer amount of work they make us do (even as an ABM I was still expected to work teller line every day, open and service accounts, prospect for leads and set the schedule and handle all branch issues.)  The bank generally treats employees who leave very poorly and managers who leave in particular can expect to be walked out the moment they submit their resignation and will not be paid for the time they put in their notice.  ABMs in general are not given the respect they deserve by upper management, frequently being made to shoulder the blame whenever performance dips, and are quickly written up for even the smallest issues, fair or not, while branch managers get a pass for almost anything they do.  Upper management generally treats branch personnel, especially the managers, with a ""What have you done for me lately?"" mentality, putting heavy pressure on us to hit very high production goals which makes our already stressful jobs even more so, which can sometimes even lead to negative health impacts, with many of us struggling with high blood pressure and anxiety despite not having these issues prior to taking the job.

The bank can be described as being cheap all around.  Every decision back office makes seems to revolve around cutting costs anywhere and everywhere they can, even if it means screwing over customers and employees.  I agree that companies should make an effort to avoid wasteful spending, but at Woodforest it's to the point that it's having a significant negative impact on service quality as well as quality of life for their employees.  Whenever concern about this or misconduct by branch or upper management is reported, it is ignored and the employees reporting it can find themselves blacklisted when seeking promotions later.

All in all, though I don't regret taking my job here due to the opportunities it gave me to find gainful employment elsewhere and I would recommend it to someone trying to get started in the banking industry, I would never want to go back."

You will have absolutely no work life balance, and they don’t care how sick you are. Even if you are running a fever they will make you sit there until you find coverage from another branch.  I once loved my job and this company, but through the years I have watched them change into a company that lacks complete compassion. I urge anyone reading this to be careful when applying here."

-the sales enviroment is awful. They don't train you nearly well enough to sell everything they offer, and don't offer nearly enough to engage customers who already have accounts. 

-even at one of the busiest stores in my state, my branch struggled to hit account goals. Because of short staffedness, I worked more on the teller side. We managed to hit branch goal, but at the end of the month I had less accounts then the rest of the team, so my boss ""offered me the chance"" (by saying they'd split my portion of the incentive  bonus with everyone else on the team if I didn't) to come in on my birthday, stand in the isle and try to cold sell the people of the store on opening accounts. I ended up in tears. 

-my sister had a car accident, and they wouldn't let me off to go to the hospital, both the branch manager and assistant left early that day. I had to work until close, and find offages for two of my coworkers. I left the branch at 9:30pm that night.

There's so many more I could use as an example, but all in all, I was over worked, our raises (branch wide) were 2.3% for non management staff. You get two weeks of vacation, but good luck getting time off. And they make you buy your own overpriced uniform."

And I guess you do get experience in the banking industry so it is a good stepping stone if you never worked at a bank before.","There are quite a lot.  Let's begin with the hours.  It's different than pretty much every bank with the days that they are open.  They are open every day and way past normal banking hours so be prepared to be there every weekend.  Also due to constantly being short-staffed due to a high turnover rate, you will be expected to come in on your time off and stay later or come in earlier at a moments notice.  And if you say you cannot you will be vilified there and made to feel like you are doing wrong just for following your schedule and not being available 24/7.  Now let's move on to goals that you need to get every month.  They are nearly impossible and you will have to stay way past close just to get new accounts in predatory ways.  I'm talking about tricking people into making a financial decision just to meet a monthly goal.  And when you do, you get a pay out but your manager reaps the reward a lot more even though they do nothing to really help you obtain these goals.  Another point is the uniform.  You have to wear a suit and make sure everything is dry cleaned and well maintained even though you make 12$ an hour and work there constantly, meaning you have no time and money to maintain a suit.  Now let's move on to management.  Whether its upper management or branch level management, I have one word for it: Awful.  They constantly talk down to you if you do not reach impossible goals.  They expect you to constantly do more and more work in a small timeframe.  They want you to handle all the customer issues that other departments should be handling, all while handling day to day customer transactions.  You'll be dealing with everything and I mean that literally.  I've never dealt with such rowdy customers before but this place caters to customers that never accept blame.  And woodforest encourages this behavior.  Also to touch more on how you do work for other departments, that is true.  You will have to deal with technology issues, customer disputes, marketing, and a laundry list of other topics, even though there are departments for that.  It's questionable what those departments even do sometimes.  One more topic to go on and it's breaks.  You are lucky to get a few minutes to eat something, but it's never guaranteed.  You will mostly work 10-12 hours a day, which usually nets you a one hour break.  But since this is woodforest, you usually will get a ten minute window to find something in walmart to eat, all while being expected to work during that time in case it gets busy again."

(Depending on your location)","From day to day your faced with the same task in how to cohort people into accounts. This is mainly due to the lack of marketing the company does. No one in the community knows who Woodforest is, nor do they have a reason to care. The bank doesn't offer anything special to stand out from the rest, making your job even harder. Being placed inside of Walmart seems like a great idea at first, until you realize the type of clientele you'll be encountering. If you enjoy standing all day marketing inside of Walmart, in hopes to acquire new account acquisitions, this may be the job for you. 

I can not stress how many times we had been laughed at by customers, for looking silly trying to gain peoples attention. As a bank that is not well known, this further chips away at its credibility.  Management expects you to overcome this and everything else under the sun with subpar pay and little to no recognition when you go above and beyond. Managements number one focus is numbers, which is understandable in business, but at least show your employees some sort of appreciation when its due."

By doing so you gain the knowledge of knowing exactly which roll you prefer to be when you apply for bigger financial institutions,"Woodforest is a start up banking job. The pay sucks for what your job entails. I was paid $14.50/hr for a job that at Wells Fargo and SunTrust are being paid $18.00/hr. 

The management at my location was very unprofessional. We as retail bankers would literally do her work for her but she would make it seem as if it was required that we do these “assignments” while she either leaves the location and pretends to be in a meeting or sits in the vault room/break room/storage closet all day & waves us off to leave out the room (which is where the vault is located) b/c she’s on a personal call. Not to mention she would gossip about everyone. & constantly share her personal problems. If you disagree with her you’re officially on her hit list and she would try to get you fired (speaking from personal experience).

HR gave branch managers too much room to make decisions that a branch manager should NEVER make . 

Let me not get started on “marketing”. As we are in Walmart we would have to stand out front and harass Walmart customers by passing out flyers and chasing them down aisles. If the manager or assistant manager didn’t see you doing just that, it would effect your incentives. 


Every time a young black person came in with a large check they would be profiled and accused of fraud. When we had the resources to figure out if it is fraudulent or not...

Let me not get started on the hours. Literally open 7 days a week 362 days a year Monday-Friday 10a-7p Saturday 10a-4p Sunday 12p-4p. You will be scheduled some days to work 11 hour shifts. I literally had no life and was underpaid.


TRUST ME THIS IS NOT EVERYTHING THAT WENT ON WORKING WITH THIS COMPANY I JUST CANT FIT IT ALL IN THIS BOX. 

Remember woodforest is a start up banking job . If you’re going to take the job with them get about 1 year out of them for experience purposes & then work for a much more branded and reputable company i promise it’ll pay off . I AM A WALKING COME UP. 

They fired me and the next day a major bank called offering me the job making almost double what i made at woodforest and the environment is actually professional."

-They pay competitively.
-Their benefits kick in quick.
-Compensated handsomely when traveling to other branches.","**In Ohio**
-They are extremely understaffed. While I was working one branch had employees, and many other branches only had one or two employees. That forces the employees to work open to close every day, which in some branches that is 12 hours a day, up to 7 days a week. While you do get overtime, you get burnt out very, very quickly.
- They can/ will force you to travel to other branches that are understaffed on your day off.
- The schedule at my branch was constantly changing weekly. Our branch had 4 employees, 3 of which wanted a set schedule, but our manager wouldn't do one because she wanted to do when she wanted to. Our schedule changed weekly.
-They are open everyday except for Christmas Day.
-They do not offer quality loan products.
-You are not allowed to speak anything financial about loan products. You are only allowed to hand a customer and application and send it to the correct department.
-My manager was not a receptive manager at all.  
-Impossible goals. You are given goals each month, when hired I was told the company had hit their goals every month in the last year. After I was hired I found out that was false, and that the new goal structure made it impossible for our store to hit any goals. 
-You work in Walmart. You're customers are of that quality for the most part.
-They allow customers to overdraft their accounts. Woodforest preys on lower income families so much that they are not allowed to do FDIC classes outside of lower income areas. For example you could not hold an FDIC class in New Albany, Ohio because that is a high income area.  There were a lot of days I felt terrible because you really can't help people who want help.
-The bank itself is just not convenient as it is only located inside of Walmart's, and there are no drive-thrus. There are no stand alone branches in the state of Ohio. If you want to use an ATM you have to go to Walmart, or pay a Woodforest fee, and the fee of any other financial institutes ATM. Customers pay $5+ at a non Woodforest ATM so you hear a lot of complaints about that."

Management became more and more absent throughout my five years of employment. Regionals proffered for managers to be seeking outside business contacts, and for assistants and retail bankers to run the branches. Not a problem if training was more thorough and expectations clearly set.  However, training consists of watching computer slides with no volume, and shadowing other employees who might or might not actually be doing their job correctly. The rest of it was trial and error along with researching a massive employee manual when in doubt of how to perform a task. 
Managers became more and more detached from their employees as well as the customers, and their presence was noticeable and questioned frequently. There became an environment of intense resentment and distrust. Employees often claimed to feel unappreciated. 
Honestly in five years the culture went from supportive, friendly, and encouraging, to one of the complete opposite. New employees that sucked up to the right people were rewarded and allowed to be lazy while others were left with extra workload and absolutely no recognition or support. 
Woodforest would value a new hire over a dedicated tenured and loyal employee. Eventually several exceptional and very knowlegable members of the Woodforest team started to leave the company. The decline happened quickly over a year and 1/2 period. Now there are other banks with really awesome employees because woodforest pushed them away by not appreciating them.

I worked really hard in an understaffed branch it was me and one other teller the whole time we only had time off when someone would come help our branch out.

We hit all sales goals and than at the end of the year we never received an employee review there was no branch manager just me and the teller, and the regional manager didn't have time to come he kept canceling, we are informed over the phone after we already see our paystubs that the company will only allow a 3% increase 36 cents. needles to say I was not impressed, not only did we still have to keep working hard and making these goals but we would not be compensated for the work, what we where promised would not happen.

This is a decent company to work for.  At about $13/hour, the pay seems low but I believe it's actually on par with some other Retail Bankers/Tellers I spoke with from other banks such as Compass.  

Health Benefits:
To the credit of Woodforest, they have not increased premiums for the Health Plans in a few years (like most companies).  Even with that said, the United Healthcare medical plans they offer are really expensive if you are married or have children.  All I could really afford was a 'catastrophic' plan with a bad Rx component.  

Co-workers:
You meet a lot of really good people/co-workers in this business. Perhaps it's because you work for long hours in very close quarters with other employee's, you really get to know one another.  It's a Pro if you like people.","Hours/Holidays:
Woodforest prides itself on being available for it's customers more so than the other banks.  With that said, especially if you work in a store location (Kroger or Walmart),  the bank is open for business late into each evening and on almost every holiday including Easter Sunday in 2016.

Technology/Equipment:
One walk through a Woodforest (behind the counters) and it is easily apparent that this is not a company that spends much money on updating technology/equipment.  They still use a lot of equipment and old machines on a daily basis.  I was constantly having to call technology and they would always offer a 'band aid' fix or get you a refurbished replacement.  Never did they buy new equipment.

Dress Code:
For several years Woodforest had a more relaxed dress code than other banks.  We wore slacks most of the time but we could purchase company Polo or Golf shirts with the WF logo on them.  Beginning in 2017 I believe, the company went more formal.  They changed their branding and colors from green to black, grey and white.  Really sharp I know lol.  Guys now have to dress fully formal in black suits.  Per dress code, you are unable to remove your blazer jacket during the day and I'm just fortunate I left the company before this summer because it must be miserable wearing that in this Texas heat."

I am ashamed to be an employee of this bank. This company finds any and every way to take from their customers and employees.  The Retail Bankers of this company are the life and breath of the business, yet the rate of pay does not match the responsibility that you will have placed on you compared to other instutions. This company is cheap, an example of this would be their lack of investment in proper training for their employees. There is no training facility, you will sit in front of a computer and read over information that you cannot interact with. There is no proper training for management either Mgmt constantly slacks and exercises poor judgement. Mgmt doesn't know how to communicate. Mgmt doesn't know how to develop employees because they themselves were never developed.  Nor does anyone seem to care. Across the board from every level of management to the HR department, no one cares about you. The terrible benefits package is also something worth noting, they must've found the plans that would cost the company the least and cost the employee the most in the long run. Red Flag: They do not care. There are no real leaders to set the example for you if you are looking for someone in a position to look forward to moving into in the future of your career.  Imagine having someone who is lost leading you. At best, this bank is run like a check cashing facility.

When you are told you need to get more accounts, you ask how, and NO ONE has an answer.  They just tell you to keep trying.  They get all over about account goals but no one has any ideas or gives any guidance on how to get more.  Some managers are responsible for three or more branches at once and have no idea of the day to day goings on at one or more of them.  Some managers don't need to be in a position of authority or leadership, or a customer service position.  Regional managers are basically useless, showing up only when something is wrong to ream the employees, and offering no guidance or assistance.  New employees sometimes had starting salaries higher than current employees, so that was pretty bad for morale.  You are constantly in fear of being fired or disciplined for not meeting unrealistic account goals.  If you do meet your account goal one month, the goal for the next month is substantially higher."

889,Woodforest National Bank,"Over worked, no work/life balance.",2016-05-06,3.0,Retail Banker,"Starting pay was a good pro, the people I work with are great. 401k and benefits are great.","First, the check approval process in this bank is ridiculous. As a starting employee your limit to approve cashing or depositing checks is $500. You get bigger limits as you progress in time with the company right now I'm upbto $2500. That's all well and good but here's the problem... A customer with a $3000 dollar check comes in and wants to deposit and take some out. Well, your manager isn't there and there's only two people with limits below that amount. So, here's the choices you have. You can try and call another branch and get a person with a limit high enough to approve that check to approve it but, there's 10 minutes the customer has waited and the line keeps building up. Next the manager who you found to approve it wants you to email them a copy of the check and you have to fill out a form that lists the details of that customers account. So you have to wait until that manager replys to your email. Hey another 10-30 minutes the customer is waiting and the line keeps building up. So usually that manager is too scared to approve that check because our bank has never seen it before and now you have to tell that customer we have to put it on a 7 business day hold. Now bybthe time you get there to tell them that they're already extremely upset at you and now your going to upset them even more. They'll scream and yell and threaten you and all you can do is say I'm sorry all I can do is put it on hold. So they close their account and leave or just storm out and find another ""actual bank"" to cash their check.

Next, all the equipment and the tech that your supposed to be using to help your customers barely works.

Next, they don't train you in anything! For example a customer wanted to close their cd. I ask for help and I'm told to ""look in the BEM"" that is the branch employee manual which is a 10,000 page long process manual. So the customer is waiting... You usually can't find what your looking for and if you ask for help the management gets annoyed or irate. So the customer usually leaves and says they'll come back when a more experienced person is available. Well usually no one knows how to do these things even the people who have been working there over 5 years.. We're all told to look in this out dated and usually wrong BEM.

Next, there is no accountability when it comes to the leadership. Our manager is never there and he leaves when he wants and makes us cover him even if we're supposed to be off mid day. So we end up opening and closing multiple days in a row.

There are many many many more cons to this place. It's a good job to get experience in banking but I would not plan on staying here and if you dislike Walmart I wouldn't even try here. Walmart is disgusting and most of the time the people are too. Most of the practices of this bank are out dated and damn right near illegal. Id be surprised if a federal audit wouldn't shut this company down."

Even if you're a high performer and consistently being #1,#2 or even #3 in your region each and every month there's still too much favoritism.  Some regionals take forever to get back and when similar situations arise they make help and make exceptions for some managers but make excuses for others.  Very poor sense of urgency when it comes to helping another location being staffed or even getting them staffed causing long long work hours.  The bank is clearly having a difficult time finding its image as its changing drastically every month bouncing everywhere and tossing out big expectations out of the blue but seeking results immediately.  Management responsibility has grown 500% from 5 years ago to now and regionals constantly try to compare when they were Branch Managers and what they would do if they were in our shoes causing unfair examples and comparisons.  The pay is very poor compared to industry average of 54K-60K+ instead they go 40K-50K expecting not to go higher so they don't cap out Branch Managers at a mediocre mid 50K.  The responsibilities continue to grow and compensation is just not structured correctly not to mention holding branches accountable to loan goals and making their bonus dictated on it but nobody is a loan officer or certified it almost seems ILLEGAL to hold employee compensation on a product that they're not licensed for."

Although that has been limited as of late.,Branches are opened 7 days a week everyday but Christmas. Training is limited. Pay is low for industry.

Upper management turns a blind eye.  When their hands are forced, they quietly dismiss offenders and sweep the illegal deeds under the rug.

Good if you are a newbie to the retail banking environment.,"Antiquated technology. Training is nothing more than modules. Then you are thrown into the lion's den to learn by trial by fire. The bankers are a readers of a sales script that targets an under/unemployed, under/uneducated demographic, many of whom do not understand the basic concepts of fiscal responsibility. The bank wants you to present options of overdraft without acting as a financial advisor that aids the consumer in making a decision that is ""right"" for their life circumstances. Give them the options and let the chips fall may where they may. Clients are allowed to excessively overdraft their accounts, many of which chargeoff resulting in denial of banking services at other institutions which in turn forces the customer to come back to WNB, pay the chargeoff, open a second chance account with another courtesy overdraft, which eventually is excessively overdrawn; thus creating a repetitive cyclical event of financial irresponsibility. Many in upper management have no prior banking experience and focus more on mall like sales gimmicks to line the pockets of executives with money made from the toil of financially challenged clients. Also, there are significant inconsistencies in operations...Many times areas are not given notice of changes until after they have not adhered to them, resulting in denial of monthly incentive."

The regional in georgia is not very plugged in. When I was hired it rained for 4 days and was sent to run my branch with no banking background at all.  Only 30 days later to be told the branch was performing badly and needed to be turned around asap. This of course is a challenge with 3 days of training.

I had an interview at another bank while working here and they laughed when I told them the account goals, they're all about numbers. You meet the monthly goals and your reward is higher goals.

These aren't 'bankers hours'. You're in at 9:30am most days, out at 6:30 or 7:30 pm except weekends. You work on Sunday's and it's almost always absolutely dead. We were lucky to get one customer an hour because no one thinks a bank is open Sunday's.

Working inside a Walmart isn't very glamorous and a lot of people side-eye a bank located in one. Honestly the only reason I would recommend a bank account here would be if someone had a bad standing at another bank. Otherwise this bank is a joke. 

Tactics to open new accounts just seem shady. Convincing customers to close their savings accounts and use a checking account as a savings to 'avoid minimum balances'...when in reality it's only because checking accounts count more towards their goals. 

You don't need to clock out for lunch at the location I worked at, which would seem like a pro...but my manager would hound us if we were done yet if we took longer than 15 minutes. Which is nothing when you're working 9 to 10 hour shifts. A lot of times working here I almost wished I worked for Walmart instead."

I climbed the ladder of hierarchy to the corporate level. I made many wonderful friends amongst my colleagues.,"With so many changes in the financial industry, and the bank's ongoing struggle to pass their OCC exam, corporate seemed to be in constant shambles. Management was forced to make changes within the business, but the leaders within the organization did not provide adequate resources for most branches to succeed. It was clear that corporate, themselves, had no idea how to get through the struggles. It caused for an unstable working environment. My suggestion would be to formulate a solid plan for success that is proven… Roll the information out to management with training, and ongoing support and encouragement from regional management. Unfortunately, things were constantly thrown in branch management's lap with high expectations to uphold (with the threat of losing their jobs) but with little to no support to make necessary changes truly successful. Many managers get by with ""fluff"" while regional managers looked the other direction. There seemed to be a lot of dishonest gain on all levels. Rumors of upper management taking subordinates to strip clubs after corporate meetings, scandal with in the company, and many other unmentionable occurrences. From the outside Woodforest had the wholesome ""Texas made"" brand. Internally, it's a different story."

Job is perfect for someone who is single, no children, or someone young just for the experience. You accumulate vacation time but due to lack of employees you are never guaranteed to even use it and cannot cash it in if it hasn't been used. Use it or lose it. They also push you to ""market"", their version of ""marketing"" is having you dress up in goofy costumes and handing out flyers. You will also have to raise money for charity. I was humiliated and duck taped to a chair with a sign many times. This company is willing to do anything and make their employees do anything in order to make a $1 and according to their rules you MUST do what you are told. Many times I was forced to stay after working hours because they believe in ""No Zero Days"". Legally they aren't allowed to MAKE you stay until you get at least 1 account but when your management is threatening to write you up or reprimand you, it scares you into staying. Management will push you as far as they can because if branch goals are met THEY (the managers ONLY) will receive bonuses for achieving those goals at the employees expense. There ARE incentives for retail bankers, the most I saw during my year of employment for making account goals was 1 simple Panara gift card for $25 from our regional manager."

Which after a nice long work week equals out to roughly $9.25/hr or less. In my tenured experiences, it was not worth the routine. If you enjoy babysitting fresh out of high school or community college kids, and having the weight of not one, but two branches on your shoulders, then this is the place for you! Oh don't forget the endless hours! Managers are usually in the branch an hour before anyone else and are expected to stay late without question. Forget about attending weddings, birthday parties or even holiday get togethers as you'll probably be working. 

Going from a traditional bank with traditional, community values, to Woodforest... this place was nothing more than a hybrid check cashing facility that has taken on more than it can handle in terms of competition, and will begin slowly bleeding out as the new year comes with new regulations."

For employees, benefits are decent (health ins, dental, vision and 401k)","For customers; fees fees and more fees. Some go down but others go up to compensate. There is no consistency with how each account is treated it is based on what each rep is willing to do for the customer if they like you or what the manager ""feels"" like doing that day. I've seen first hand accts allowed to be overdrawn thousands of dollars and others not even $5 over the $500 limit.
For employees; no fair consistency to your schedule, do not count on getting to use your vacation time and you certainly cannot use your sick time without penalty but they will still ask for a Dr's note ( this is a HIPPA violation). They do not like to promote from within, they prefer to hire someone outside the company and they do not have to have any banking experience; how would you like to train your new manager? LOL The sales goals, CTP's all can give you bonuses but it is hard to obtain when other employees do not pull their weight or are allow to screw up with out penalty, the payouts should be based on individual performance and let the manager sweat it out for the overall. Too many months did I pull in more than half the accts needed and other employees not even try, it was VERY frustrating. one last thing, pay is not that great and they base your salary on whether they really like you or not, so if you were a ""friend"" that got hired in you might make $12+ an hour"

It is rare that I must work late or on weekends, and when I do, it's always at my own initiative - I've never been pressured to work overtime. My boss takes great care to make sure we are not feeling stressed out or overworked (which I never am), and he takes time to talk with us about personal things too, or just chat with us about non-work related topics. It's nice to have a boss who always asks how your weekend went, and shares what he's done on his weekend, too. It's very obvious he cares about his team members as individuals, and not just employees.

Everyone I've met in the company has been great to work with/for. These people are genuinely kind, helpful, and enthusiastic about their jobs. I've seen them rally around employees who have had tragedy befall them - they've held fundraisers and benefits to raise money for several employees since I've been here. The company also has a great focus on charity events - they sponsor or participate in several walks, 5Ks, and bike rides, and also work with Habitat for Humanity, local food banks, and women's shelters, both personally and in company-sponsored events.","The salary seems to be a bit low, and the medical benefits aren't great. They do have a 401k with company match, however. We don't get many holidays off, which is surprising for a bank, and they are also on the low end for vacation time."

Internal business processes are poorly defined. Management doesn't seem to have the will to act with troublesome employees - or either they just flat out don't know what to do.

Very heavy on making account goals. Almost feels like a pimp and hoe relationship. The bank is open every holiday except Christmas. But if Wal-Mart was open that day, I'm pretty sure woodforest would be too. A lot of pressure on managers to make account goals, who then pressure the retail bankers, who then have to stand and market all day sometimes wearing clown, fairy, face painting or big silly hats to attract attention to the fact that there is a bank in Wal-Mart. Call me crazy, but I would not hand my money to clown. Not a professional environment."

When there is down time.....there is always time to market, market, market!

That means that even though I only started in May, I got a raise in October! You also get regular bonuses---the new account mark isn't always easy to hit, but with rare exception we always managed. You also get vacation within 6 months (2 weeks---how awesome is THAT?) and get time and a half on holidays. Plus, I can almost guarantee you'll be working a few hours of overtime.","Schedules change from week to week, which can make it hard to feel like you're adjusting to the work load. You also have to buy uniforms from the company (7 of them), and they're at least $26 per shirt (you provide dress pants yourself). Plus, they expect you to be on your feet almost constantly, and since you'll likely be located in a Walmart that means hard, concrete floors---which they expect you to wear dress shoes on! Don't expect to move up too quickly, either...some people had been there for five or more years before an assistant branch manager or branch manager position opened up, and as far as I could see those were the only advancement opportunities for people living outside of Texas (the bank's headquarters)."

You are expect as a retail banker to be able to run the branch by yourself even though your pay does not reflect all the work you put in. There is lack of communication between upper management, internal groups and retail bankers. They expect you to work 7 days a week if there isn't enough staff to cover all shifts. Upper management can be very unprofessional."

You also get to meet some pretty fantastic people and the other employees at your branch are like your family. There is opportunity for advancement if you kiss the right butts.,Higher management engages in a lot of job politics that really have no place. It seems higher management is out to get certain people and tries to find ways unashamedly. You have a lot expected of you and a large work load for below average banking pay. The managers of branches also treat the branch like their personal business which is what the company wants but it allows managers to do what they want with employees with little interference from corporate.

It's also very challenging since there are a lot of goals and pressure to meet them.,"There is a lot of pressure to meet goals. Customer's base is usually people from the lower class. Human resources basically doesn't care about your problems. Basically if your manager harasses you, they get away with it. This company has no integrity, they lack management experience. The turn over rate there is absurd. There is a lot of favoritism and the employees are so immature. There is drama and it's a hostile work environment. The hours are long.  The bank is open 7 days a week with extended hours up to 8PM. Most times you end up staying there past that time without any notice from management (and they expect it from you) .  They are open ALL holidays except for Christmas. Work attire is as follows: You can wear any slacks or business casual shoes but you are REQUIRED to purchase 7 different shirts, one for each day of the week, that can start out at $25 per shirt (which they deduct from your paycheck)."

You have the ability to be creative, and exercise your problem solving skills.  Your customer interaction includes a variety of individuals, this can be the 65 year old who is opening a bank account for the first time, to someone who  is very educated, and testing you on your knowledge of banking products and skills. You learn to interact with consumers from every walk of life. Not many banks offer the level of cross training you see with Woodforest. With most banks, a teller, is a teller. With Woodforest, a personal banker is a teller, personal banker, and operations team member. Woodforest offers training great training opportunities for a variety of banking regulations and product knowledge.","•	Advancement opportunities are rare
•	While general training education is great, this does not include lending (mortgage, personal, and credit lending)
•	You do NOT receive incentive for your required sales goals.

Management is ridiculous they have 1 branch manager and 2 assistant managers. These idiots get a little power and they think they run the world.STAY AWAY FROM WILKINSON BLVD BRANCH its full old butt managers who have been there years and know how to work the system. The only thing the assistants do is walk around walmart and talk about people and there on personal issues with one of there favorite retail bankers. The 2 assistants run completely over the branch manager because he has no balls to stick up for himself or no other employees. They like to dictate every single thing you do from drink some water to use the bathroom. They try to hold you after your scheduled hours not giving 2 poops that you have a life and kids to take care of. All they do is sit in the back office with another retail banker and talk crap all day although NONE of them have anyroom to talk. They do this to everybody several people have called HR. The only thing they did was demoted one person after he put the entire branch through hell. They are VERY petty they do things just to tic you off or just because its in their power.

It's a good place to bank, as well.","The hours. Let's be honest. Late evenings, weekends (yes, Sundays as well) and most holidays. It's excellent for the customers (who take FULL advantage of the late hours), but makes for a long day. This is the reason they ask for flexibility.

Highly, highly competitive. The bar is constantly being raised and enforced for account acquisition. And direct marketing is how the accounts are generated. Which means be prepared to hand out a ton of flyers to people who could probably care less. The focus seems to be quantity, not quality."

Always on call.  Way to many passwords for way to many different computer systems you have to sign into and if you do something on one system it won't even show on the others until the next day.

You start out at approximately $10/hr and you get an annual review which generally will pay .25 more.  The bank is open 7 days a week and every holiday except Christmas.  Most management is off every Sunday so if you go to church GOOD LUCK getting off.  The company doesn't empower the associates at all.  They don't trust you!  There is no training.

There is not one that is willing to help you!  If you call the business department for assistance they will say to follow the BEM.  You have to market!  Marketing at most stores is standing in front of the branch and hand out brochures all day.  Uniforms are awful.  You have to buy shits, one for every day of the week ($25.95/ for each shirt).

The location I was hired for was completely unmethodical in every aspect. The training consisted of shadowing numerous unprofessional individuals who were not organized enough to train. I was thrown onto the computer system in front of customers without being shown how the computer programs work. In front of the customer I was asked ""What do you think you click on for this transaction?""... without being shown a thing. There is no order or a remarkable leader to encourage or direct staff. I witnessed tellers greeting customers without a smile and with this greeting in a very drab voice ""Yes. What do you need me to do?"" The human resources department is also just as unethical. Having 6 years of previous banking experience I had decided that the role I accepted was not the one for me, I was a manager, leader and personal banker for my previous employer before seeking employment with WoodForest National Bank. I spoke with Human Resources regarding a different position better fitting for both myself and WoodForest. I was told that I needed to stay in my position and give a 2 week notice in order to be considered for rehire or be selected for a different position within WoodForest. I can't quite comprehend why they would want to waste time by keeping me in training knowing I would only be leaving two weeks down the road. They would essentially be paying me for training for a position I would not stay in which is a waste of everyone's time. I should have listened to my instincts; when I was interviewed, the manager and Teller Supervisor both had their cell phones out and on during the whole interview, even receiving phone calls during the interview, which I consider to be very unprofessional. This bank is also viewed the same way by it's local competitors such as Amegy Bank. Word is already out that this bank is unprofessional in how they handle things, I should have listened to others before accepting a position.

Those who have worked for the company wind up working there for years. Definite opportunity for longevity and job security. Somewhat relaxed working environment (all things considered). Every day is a different day. Comp days are easily acquired.,"You acquire sick time easily, but there is little room to actually use it. Comp days instead of holiday pay (not sure which is better). The fact that you have to pay for your own shirts (which are 25 bucks a pop and you need to buy 7 of them from the get go) is a massive Con. They're colorful, but not worth the money."

Most of them don't even work a 40 hour work week.  While they are there, they take personal phone calls.  I have never had the misfortune of working under some of the gross management as here.  I had one ""manager"" who could not even manage to work 30 hours a week.  And yet, she received the monthly bonus.  The employees do all the work and management sits on their butts and do basically nothing,  You have to buy your unform shirts that are of poor quality."

Good entry level management opportunity if you can put up with lack of training and listening to employees being upset for the long hours they have to work.,"Long hours - the bank is open 7 days a week!  As a Manager you are expected to work a minimum of 45-50 hours per week, but you are only compensated for 40 hours!
You better make your monthly goals or you will be expected to work your scheduled days off!
If your branch is short staffed, you will be expected to cover for your employee if they call in sick.  The Manager is the only salaried employee.
Training is horrible and Upper Management is not much assistance. No consistency in answers that are given!
You have to buy uniforms.
Turnover (especially in Management is high).
Open accounts, open accounts, open accounts - you have to do what it takes to make your monthly goal.  Many managers resort to what is called ""fluff accounts"" just so they make their monthly goal and get a bonus check."

Decent benefits for an individual, but horrible prices for a family.","The list goes on and on forever.  Horrible pay for the amount of work you actually do.  The average retail banker makes $10/hour for doing a vast array of work.  We are required to market throughout the store, bring in new accounts, open new accounts, be a teller, count all cash brought in, perform admin. tasks, be a tech support person, etc. This company is very micromanaged and managers can't even do their job. Bad checks are written all the time, giving the company a horrible reputation.  Regional Managers won't help as well as higher up too.  Monthly account goals are very unrealistic.  Some months are in the 70's and other's are atleast 55."

Can get fees waived most of the time.
Good place to start if wanting to get experience in banking to move on to a real bank.
I was able to move to Bank of America making double as a Manager.","Disorganized and lack of training.  100+ learning modules and only 3 days of actual training on teller, opening accounts, etc.

Company tries to be up with big banks (ex. Bank of America, Wells Fargo) but not at all compared, as I have family members as a manager/executive of these banks, and I am one as well.

Pay is mediocre, and not as much as it should be given the demands on employees as tellers, open accounts, know about loans, etc.

Company is all about opening accounts, no matter what the cost or what lies have to be told to customers.

New managers and employees expected to be as experienced as tenured employees or else be written up or fired.

I've also seen new employees be fired for things tenured employees have been doing for years.  When addressed, they were ignored, so there's favoritism to the ""old crew.""

HONESTLY, NOT WORTH ANYONE'S TIMES UNLESS THEY WANT TO USE IT AS A STEPPING STONE TO GO TO AN -ACTUAL- BANK."

1206,Woodforest National Bank,Retail Banker,2012-09-04,3.0,In-store Retail Banker,The everyday processing for customers is actually great.  Customers will do well with their accounts if they know how to manage it.  Everything a customer needs to manager their account is at their fingertips.,No formal training. Each branch is operated differently than others.  Upper management & corporate show no respect towards retail bankers.  Managers are thrust into branches and treated disrespectfully by upper management (I only know from my own manager confiding in me).  Management makes it difficult to give adequate customer service.

Upper management is often talking out of both sides of their mouth and expectations can change at the drop of the hat. Negative reinforcement is more popular than positive reinforcement. Many unethical practices for the sake of making goals. Hours are not very flexible and the bank is open 7 days a week. Although the company used to offer a lot of autonomy for its employees, especially to management, it is becoming more and more micromanaged. Raises are not always consistent or fair."
