Okish - Mediocre level institution in Korea but Woori America branch in Manhattan one the least favored Korean bank.

Low salary. It's incredible.

No upward mobility. Maybe in 5-7 years but you will burn out before that.

If you want to network, this place is one of the worst place to start. Let me remind you -- this is an embarrassingly small retail (compared to JP, Goldman) American headquarter of a Korean bank that has less than 50 employees....  NO ONE in Manhattan has even heard about this retail bank except for Koreans who has a checking account to wire money.. So don't come here for networking purposes- you will regret."
