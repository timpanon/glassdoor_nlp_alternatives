0,World Business Lenders,great place to star,2022-03-13,2.0,Administrative Assistant,they had some good benefits and great for just starting out in the financial industry. Great work work environment. I loved my co-workers although there seemed to always be some type of office drama.,The pay is very low and the company seems a bit volatile. Your position is near safe. while I was working there it always seemed as if the company would shut down or be sold at any moment. plus it seemed as if they were making a lot of diversity hires. I wold not recommend this company for anyone who is well versed in the industry. Plus the managers are always yelling in their offices.
1,World Business Lenders,Boiler Room Meets Gordon Gecko,2021-10-13,1.0,Senior Sales Executive,"Company is hanging on fumes - the only equity left is the 100s of homes they repossessed in their unscrupulous loans (google WBL / class action law suit).

Scumbag CEO and his old cronies from Stratford may face criminal charges in addition to losing all his plunder he got from duped borrowers.","This place is 'Boiler Room' meet 'Wolf of Wall Street' (without any good looking dudes - CEO and his dopey attorneys are old and gross looking guys (Andy).
Business model is simple - dupe homeowners into borrowing money and take their property. 60% interest rates are the norm. WBL isn't a lender as much as it is a real estate holding company. 
I still have nightmares and am in therapy for all the pain I caused unassuming borrowers / homeowners, many who lost both their business and homes. Covid was the best thing that ever happened to WBL- they repossessed more homes in 2020 than in any other year - total scumbags."

13,World Business Lenders,STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS,2020-06-09,1.0,Former Employee,you learn basic banking principles & great window views,"1. Compensation/salary is a joke
2. Unrealistic sales expectations
3. Product is difficult to sell because it is too expensive
4. Management shows favortism/nepotism
5. Management is indifferent to the hardships that regular sales reps go through
6. Some management is unqualified/unknowledgeable about the product
7. Leads are trash
8. If you have a decent lead, they take it away during their lead reshuffle
9. Constantly fighting with underwriting staff to get your deals funded
10. Underwriting staff requires too much documentation, to the point where the merchant loses interest & patience
11. Draw always counts against you
12. Low commissions
13. Hiring/firing of staff is questionable (previous reports of racist employment practices wasn't confirmed, but is believable. There has been legal settlements in the past)
14. CEO & upper management have encouraged people to quit and are generally unsupportive (unless you're one of their favorites)
15. Overtime is not allowed. HR & management will penalize you if your timecard is 1 minute over the allotted 40hr/work week
16. the promise of equity in the company sounds good, but there are too many unreasonable conditions that have to be met in order to benefit from that equity
17. Many stories about management being untrustworthy and treacherous
18. Office culture is uninspiring & stressful. Some management screams at employees
The list goes on & on & on........
Like any other company, if you go in there with a positive perspective/attitude and make the best of it, things should work out. But like many of my colleagues who have worked here, we tried using that perspective. The cons just outweigh the pros by a lot. Unless you're a favorite there (if management likes you for some arbitrary reason) things might be more difficult for you. My advice is to stay away. If it is your last resort, stay long enough until you can find other employment."

They boost company morale by organizing special events and having fun snacks for the entire company. And lets not forget the free coffee, tea and water the company  provides as well.  To add to all the wonderfully amazing thing already stated above, there are amazing views throughout the office like that of  the lovely Lady Liberty, Ellis Island, and lets not forget the astonishing views of New York.","They could provide more time off for its associates. It would be nice to be able to wear jeans to work and still dress appropriately.

-Upper Management works to be as transparent as possible.  There is a certain amount of confidentiality needed at every company in every industry but, for issues that matter across the board, we are kept in the loop.

There is so much drama and gossip among departments because many people are sitting idle.  Manager speaks to team members as if they are incompetent and with no respect at all. They create random departments for a short time just to fire all of you in the blink of an eye. No job security at all. They are very quick to get rid of people and the CEO has openly stated this. A lot of work place bullying and when brought up to HR they make a mockery of it and make an example of what was said in confidence. They do absolutely nothing to improve the work environment.

-Those there of intelligence are knowingly cooperating in the eventual foreclosure on unsuspecting homeowners
-Management will literally say ANYTHING to further the agenda at the behest of Doug
-VP titles are handed out like monopoly money instead of a pay increase
-Hiring of those in need of a work VISA is common practice at below market rate, only never to be signed full time after 1 year

Naidus and his executive team,  are parasites who feeds of the life’s of  brokenhearted people in need. They hired over 200 employees in a low socioeconomic class  to scam state taxpayers, than quickly firing them. They don’t even pay some of their employees!  Sales reps essentially borrow money though a daw system at a minimum rate if their lucky, some even get less. No vacation time, and the insurance sucks!!  Not only do these parasites target employees in desperate need, they also target companies that have a high chance of failing and tie their loans to real estate collateral. At a rate impassible to pay back!! I’ve seen rates as high as .80cent to the dollar. Just think about how many homeless families these parasites are responsible for. Their employees and customers need to be rescued! The government needs to step down and prevent this human life crisis from happening..  My advice to potential employees is to stay away."

You are expected to know the work in a short period of time or it’s more like a learn on our own type of situation.  Your manager is so busy that they don’t have time to interact with new hires and find out how things are going and it didn’t seem like they are concerned to know. They seem to keep spies on their teams to give them that feedback.  Its a possibility that after the 90  day probationary period you can be terminated if they feel you are not grasping the work. The work culture is poor, there are no core values and the atmosphere can feel a bit tense at times depending on the day and mood, and there is poor professionalism to say the least."

4. They provide some sort of beginning pay (it is a NON- FORGIVABLE DRAW)

In sum, for a non-college graduate, it is a fairly good opportunity to make decent money. However, I would not recommend this job to someone with multiple options. If you are interested in sales, and you do not have a college degree, or did not perform great in college, this is not a bad opportunity.","PLEASE NOTE- this is coming from someone who does not like sales, and is not meant for the sales industry. 

1. It is not easy to sell what you are selling
2. Most people do not make money for sometime
3. You NEED to be a good salesperson, and have the sort of personality (they do not provide good sales training). They provide good product training, but that does not seem important, at the beginning. 
4. They oversell the position, just be aware of that, I was, but some are not. You will not making 100,000 in your first year, in fact, you probably will never make 100,000 dollars a year in this job. 
5. The leads are not great, but I do not think leads are terrific in any industry. 
6. The guy who okays loan applications, is, well horrible. He is always late to work, and leaves early, which is problematic for salesmen (this might have been fixed). 

In sum, for a sales job, it is not horrible. However, you need to have a salesperson's like personality; the training provided will not be adequate. Additionally, be realistic, it is not likely that you are going to make 100,000 in your first year of work, something that is true of any job."

64,World Business Lenders,Save Your Time & Stay Away!,2017-01-04,1.0,Analyst,"The employees are great people. They find ways to lean on each other and create a fun workplace despite being severely underpaid and underappreciated by executive management. Outside of that, there is essentially nothing else positive about this place.","If there were a chapter in any accredited business book on “How Not to Run a Firm”, World Business Lenders would be an exemplary case study.

I worked for this company, in their NJ headquarters office, for a little over a year and I do not wish that burden on anyone else moving forward. I strongly advise anyone who is educated and with high career aspirations to refrain from accepting a position at this firm, unless of course it is your absolute last resort in life.

Firstly - the executive management team at this place has absolutely zero idea what direction they plan on taking the company. It is commonplace to hear employees saying something to the effect of – “The only thing constant about this place is change.” The hubris of this executive team is second to none. They rely on their past success, in the shady mortgage industry of the mid-2000’s, to serve as some type of indication that they’re the smartest guys in the room. Breaking news, they aren’t – and the toxic reputation that this company has permeating this industry is all the proof you need to reach that determination. Their inability to retain talented individuals should serve as another indication that something isn't right, but I digress. 

Secondly - over-promising, misleading, and underpaying employees is pervasive in this organization. If you value an environment that promotes honesty, trust, and recognizes its employees’ contributions, this place is the complete antithesis of that. 

Lastly - as an organization whose success is contingent on sales, one would think they’d have a great support system in place, right? Though commonsense would say yes, in this firm, you’d have to think again. Salespeople are provided with little to no support in generating leads. Despite the lack of support, you are still expected to generate a certain number of deals per month or run the risk of being terminated. It is not uncommon to walk-through their sales floor, which boasts 100+ employees, and hear silence or non-work related chatter among colleagues. You’d be hard-pressed to find 10-15 salespeople in the corporate location that are making money, and that is the sad, but unfortunate truth. Please understand that this place does not have an established culture, even after 5 years in business, conducive to nurturing talent and bringing the best out of people. Inevitable failure awaits an overwhelming majority of those who come on-board for a sales position, regardless of the dream that is sold to bring you onto the ""team"". 

While I care deeply about - and forged close ties with - my former colleagues at this company, they all know they deserve better. Though I do not know you, I hope you will heed this advice and save yourself the headaches, lint filled pockets, and most importantly – YOUR VALUABLE TIME!"

WBL is rapidly growing and changing and always for the best.  WBL is good about finding positions for people that really shine in those certain positions.  The greatest asset so far has been the knowledge gained in the industry and the process of lending in the alternative market place.  Management and other employees are always helpful and great to work with.  Management does listen to employees and almost always makes proper changes to improve current situations and protocol ASAP.,"Compensation has improved but is still the biggest negative aspect.  Starting out is very difficult.  A sink or swim mentality.

People stay for a the ""prospect"" of a visa or ""hope"" the company grows into a better company that actually can afford to take care of the people it hires. Very high turnover.

I wouldn't wish this employer on my worst enemy.,"Upper management over sells and under-delivers. They tell a great story of how much money can be made working with them. The opportunity for growth within the company is supposed to be phenomenal. In reality, there is no real growth possible. They are in an industry that they do not understand. They are trying to do asset based lending with prices equal to those of unsecured lenders. They treat their employees, in every department like slaves. I have seen underwriters work 15 hour days and told they aren't working hard enough. they pay their sales reps a $300 a week draw against commissions and then make it impossible for the deals to fund. I was told that order to make me team successful, i would need to work 12-18 hour days so that I could make sure that i was doing everything i could do to make it work. no overtime.  without question, this is the worst employment I  have ever had."

They only lend in 26 states, simply because they can't get around usury laws in the remaining states.  They want 4:1 collateralization and STILL want to charge 125% APR or MORE!!!

They will offer you a ""deal"" to come aboard and work their only to go back on the deal when your half way to meeting the quota set by whichever manager hired you.  An example being, they will offer you a job as an account executive with the ability to grow into a management position once you have met the quota they set for you, then they will go back on the deal when your half way into filling your quota.  This exact situation has happened on multiple occasions and I'm sure it will happen again.
