8,Yellowstone Capital,Sales Rep,2017-09-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Not much to be honest.,"One of the major cons is that when you walk in the place it appears as though a bunch of ""ex cons""are working there. My ""team leader"" NEVER showed up, and when he did, he stunk of booze. This is the same guy who never paid anyone for deals they funded. 90 percent of my team quit within a month of being there. Also, people steal your deals, and only the people who are tight with the funders get offers to present to their merchants. Simply stated, you can't close deals when you have no offers on the table for merchants you have opened. Everything gets declined. Long story short, DO NOT waste your time. They sell you the dream during the 'interview"", which is a complete joke. Anyone with a half a brain should not be working there."
9,Yellowstone Capital,Challenging,2016-11-21,2.0,,Gives you that opportunity to work with one of  the respected companies  out.,"Worked for 2 months, every lead got turned down. Defeats what the company is based on. I made no money despite the gazillion calls that were made. I believe they wean  out the good list for the chosen one and give the  bad credit ""no way in hell they going to approve you"" list to the newbies so one can fail."

13,Yellowstone Capital,executive assistant to a sales rep,2016-07-10,2.0,Anonymous Employee,learn alot amount extra capital to business,You can get fired anytime with no mistakes just because and off the books pay
14,Yellowstone Capital,Sales associate,2015-11-26,2.0,Sales Associate,Yellowstone is one of the top merchant advance companies with around 300million in loans a year. Good learning experience and exposure to the industry.,Didn't appear to be the opportunity that management made the position out to be. My commision split was 20/20/60 with me getting 20% managers 20% and the house 40%. With most of the leads I was getting going through everyone else in house and to me last it was difficult to find interested clients for a product that out to be easier to sell (money). Also the position is 100% commision which made things very stressful especially when sales were few and far between. There was also no CRM system so I had no idea how many times people were already called or if they already had a loan.
15,Yellowstone Capital,Avoid,2015-10-28,1.0,,the room temperature is comfortable,"No room for advancement, no benefits, no perks, terrible base salary, no structure."
16,Yellowstone Capital,Good Job,2015-10-13,5.0,Assistant,Good environment with a good chance to make great money. Everybody is very motivated i love it!,None yet. it has been good to me so far :)!!
17,Yellowstone Capital,Wouldn't Change a Thing,2015-10-13,5.0,Senior Funding Analyst,"Where do I begin..? I have been at YSC for over 3 years now and since the day I've started it has been nothing short of an excellent experience.  To be honest, when i first started, i really didn't know what to expect and if the job was going to be for me but I was given the right tips and advice to succeed here at Yellowstone.  After reading some of the negative reviews below, i really couldnt disagree more.  I feel YSC gives you everything you need to fully succeed.  The atmosphere from the top guy right down to the bottom is very motivating and gave me the drive i needed on a day to day basis.  The job really comes down to what type of person you are and how far you're willing to go to ""make it work.""  
Aside from the work itself, I couldnt ask for a better team of colleagues and people to associate myself with on a daily basis.  The environment is very laid back and stress free.  I really dont know too many people (that are not at YSC) that can honestly say that they love going to work in the morning - but I can honestly say I am fortunate enough to be one of them.  Realistically, and not knock any of the previous posts or people that came and left YSC, but Yellowstone Capital is the opportunity of a lifetime and I really wouldnt have it any other way.","honestly, i dont have a bad thing to say about it."
18,Yellowstone Capital,Great Place to Work,2015-10-13,5.0,Funding Consultant,"Currently employed at Yellowstone, and have been for just about a year. I have to say, it truly has been a great experience since the very beginning. Management is professional and motivated, and really goes above and beyond to listen to what their employees have to say. Yellowstone is constantly reinvesting into growth, which is great news for anyone fortunate enough to be a part of the team. Not quite sure about the other review referring to the unprofessional interview, but never once have I heard anything remotely inappropriate. Anyone who is thinking about applying, feel free to contact me , if you have any questions.","None. Not a place that you're going to sit around and collect a paycheck. You need to be motivated, and can handle challenge."
19,Yellowstone Capital,Just another Craigslist scam,2015-10-01,1.0,Sales Representative,You can be a complete scumbag if you like. You can do literally whatever you want. They're not paying you so why would they care. Employees drink on the job. The bosses will even have a couple of drinks with you if they like you.,"Man where do I start. You start ""working"" and nothing is prepared. They have no desk for you to sit at. This is because they are not sure if you are going to come in. This is because most people don't. They are smart enough to realize this is a fraudulent company at the interview. I figured I'd check it out since I was unemployed and if it was bs it will be a funny story to tell. So anyway, you sit at some random person that just quit, apparently they just quit left and right since you cant make money, and just talk to the people around you. I asked EVERYONE how long they've been there. Everyone replied, ""this is my first day/week/month"" No one has been there more than 3 months. Eventually they finally get you a desk and email 4-5 hours later. They give you some leads. You look at the leads and they are from 2011.... Every Person you call is already out of business or says they applied years ago and no longer need it. This happened for months. After staying there for 2 and a half months, the most recent leads I had gotten were literally 1 year old to the date.... 
Everyone had this problem. They operate under many different names when we call people so they can't associate out bad service with each other. I can go on for ages about this company but I wont.

Long story short  Issac gives good leads to his jewish friends and give old leads to everyone else hoping that everyone else can catch those old leads when their product has run dry and needs another one. Odds are not in your favor.
Bottom line I keep in touch with people there and not a single one of them has made money.
Frauds.

Also they try to get customers with the experian scam. Experian scam is when they get people to pay 1 dollar for a credit check and then experian starts charging them 20 dollars a month after that hoping people do not see them withdrawing it from their account. It is impossible to cancel with them because you cant do it online and they are unreachable through the phone. You have to go to your bank or credit card company and tell them to stop payment."
