No acceptance of change ."
2,Zephyr,good experience with the investment team,2021-09-13,4.0,Associate,"good learning from all the investment team members (there is a separate portfolio ops team) in India, the team is process oriented. The initial days were frustrating around the process, but after a few rounds on a few deals really liked the process flow and ability to engage proactively with companies. Also, my reporting manager spent a lot of time personally coaching and training , got first hand exposure to a lot of deals and access to knowledge and entrepreneurs","there is a lot of reporting and US intervention. Some company employees were not helpful and very aggressive with portfolio companies and everyone in the company,  dont understand the role of portfolio ops except for shouting. Worklife balance may not be easy to achieve in the first 6-9 months."
3,Zephyr,Avoid this pseudo-fund,2021-08-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Can't think of any except some good colleagues at the junior level.,"Far too many - fund run by three idiots who have no clue about business or investing - no surprises that fund hasn't returned even capital to investors in 15+ years. The pompous MD sitting in NY gives irrelevant gyaan all the time to compensate for his incompetency but has zero credibility even with his own employees (why would he have - even a monkey would have made more money in this period). There are 2 MDs in India - these jokers wouldn't be hired as senior associates by other funds. Both have an inflated sense of themselves, engage in name dropping (as if anyone cares) and they are so despicable that no one would want to even talk to them socially or claim to know them. 

Culture - totally toxic. Less said the better - talk to ex-employees (yes, there are loads of them) and founders of portfolio companies. No ability to retain employees - even admin employees join and leave. Top management has zero leadership skills."
