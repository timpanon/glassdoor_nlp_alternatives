1,Zipper Eisner Associates,Financial relationship manager,2018-11-13,1.0,Financial Relationship Specialist,None at all. I worked for 5+ months with out any pay.,"Job description is not at all accurate. You cold call for all the senior reps. You then send them out on your appointments that you should be going on. They make you pay for all your exams, transportation, etc. with no compensation what so ever. The recruiter says you will work with many different areas of a clients financial life... but they ultimately just want you to sell them a life policy. Do not work here. If you are then get out."
