1,o3 Technology Solutions,Bad company to work with,2017-08-04,1.0,Anonymous Contractor,No Pros about this company. This is a company which fools contractors and their companies,Total lies and once on project does not make any payments to contractors or related companies. Need to try a lot to get the payments released. Employees has started companies on their relatives or siblings names as middle layers to fetch a portion of the amount they get for the contractors from clients. Beware if you work for this company as payment will be difficult to get. When approached all are same as even you don't get response from anyone including CEO or CTO. Even after leaving its a big fight to fetch the pending 3 to 4 months payments
2,o3 Technology Solutions,Good for getting entry into derivatives systems. No growth once you get that experience,2016-08-16,2.0,Senior Consultant,Good for fresh college grads to get entry into derivatives systems. You will learn about all products and systems on job.,Underpaid employees. No long term growth plans. No recognition for employee efforts. Management underestimates efforts required for all projects and employees end up doing extra work to meet deadlines. All good except you do not get the bonus you expect after putting in those extra hours.
3,o3 Technology Solutions,Management co-opted,2013-10-05,2.0,Anonymous Contractor,Great pier workforce able to get the job done under the worst circumstances.,Managements has lost all common sense; no collaboration with workforce.
