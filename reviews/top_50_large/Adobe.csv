0,Adobe,BDR Life,2022-03-30,5.0,Business Development Representative,Fantastic company with great benefits,Low commission and intricate products
1,Adobe,Employee focused and socially aware,2022-01-04,5.0,Software Architect,"Adobe has been great to work for, they work very hard to make sure that employees have the resources they need to succeed. I appreciate their aggressive moves towards diversity and pay equality as well as supporting the communities they are in throughout the globe.","Adobe is a very large company and that means that things move slower (career-wise) than they would in a small company, and it suffers from the same thing that many Silicon Valley companies suffer from which is that if you want to progress your career it is faster and more effective to leave the company than to work your way through the internal bureaucracy."
2,Adobe,Good future for the company,2022-02-16,5.0,Senior Program Manager,"Culture takes care of the employees. Lots of learning opportunities and internal movement laterally is highly encouraged. Decent pay and benefits for the area. Historically, the stock benefits kept employees at Adobe longer than most tech companies. Great CEO and company usually stays out of the media compared to other Tech companies. Fantastic work/life balance.","Almost zero vertical mobility. Lots of people leaving for senior leadership roles elsewhere and then some come back years later in higher roles. Utah is still treated low for pay compared to most other places in the US. Given the higher cost to live in Utah now, many want to see a change to this policy."
3,Adobe,The least toxic employer I've ever had,2022-01-14,5.0,Senior Site Reliability Engineer,"The company as a whole is very good about keeping the toxicity common to large corporations at a minimum. Because of its heritage as a software engineering company more than what's considered a ""tech company"" today, there's a very healthy engineering culture with a relatively low level of meddling by upper and middle management in most parts of the company. Employee benefits are very strong and the company is excellent at integrating a remote and geo-diverse workforce, even prior to the pandemic. The headquarters facility is well-run and facility staff (from building operations to kitchens to security and safety) are fantastic.

Incredibly smart people work here and for the most part embody the company's stated value of bringing their genuine selves to work.","Compensation and growth opportunity is not commensurate with the company's stated aims for employees. After a decade of record-breaking years, employee compensation rises quite modestly.

The engineering heritage of the company is eroding a bit. Offices with doors that close and allow engineers to think about problems and solve them were torn out and replaced with open plan spaces that are noisy, busy, and unproductive.

Reorgs are increasing in frequency -- something of a red flag -- and often disruptive."
4,Adobe,An incredible atmosphere for success,2022-03-25,5.0,Business Development Representative,Adobe is constantly working to empower its employees in the pursuit of success and quality of life.,"I have not had any negative experiences working for Adobe. The employees are held to a high standard and therefore there is a competitive work environment, but it is all done in such a positive manner that you will be better for the atmosphere provided."
5,Adobe,Superb Work Environment !,2022-03-22,5.0,Principal Solution Architect,"- Very friendly and cordial work environment where everyone, including management team is very supportive
- Values and respects individuals
- Believes in achieving goals as a team ,where everyone plays their part and supports one another
- Compensation and Benefits are world class !
- Excellent work life balance",- Yet to find one !
6,Adobe,Fun and non-competitive atmosphere,2022-03-29,5.0,Senior Computer Scientist,I really enjoyed my time at Adobe before retirement. Adobe hires quality people and it makes for an interesting place.,Salaries are slightly lower than some of the other major Silicon Valley employers

Great mentorship options
Very good managers
Very positive work environment
You really can't do better, it's a fantastic place to work","Doesn't allow for personal international relocation, regardless of reason."
8,Adobe,Magento Commerce Group is Toxic,2022-01-05,1.0,Senior Software Architect,"Adobe Brand
Benefits
Good products 
Vacations
Good technology","Magento team is extremely unethical and toxic. They hire outside talent to help them, but they don't have ability to listen new ideas and proven approaches from industry. 

Leadership is unethical, play dirty politics, break promises, lie frequently, play favoritism due to various biases. Seen people there leading engineering teams who has never coded in life, cannot understand complex design discussions and problems but still played their way to higher ranks. It doesn't matter what you know and can do, but it matter who you play with better.

They don't realize that these non technical politically correct people are easily replaceable but not hard working engineers with proven industry experience. 

I have seen more than few people left under extreme depression due to all these politics and toxic culture. Sad part is that even after escalations to higher management by multiple peoole, they didn't do much.  If someone looking for a growth within a company, instead of helping, they are cutting people who are not 100% agreeing with their approach, they need yes man without ability to challenge the status quo.

Even though they have failed strategy for many years now within Magento. They are truly working like an organized gang of people who know each other previously, anyone else coming from outside with high potential is seen as threat to their insecure minds."

-Exciting opportunities for growth 
-Great work environment
-Great pay",Not any I can think of.
10,Adobe,You have to find the right team,2022-01-20,4.0,Product Marketing Manager,"Great culture, good company morals & ethics, great products, pay was decent, they really celebrate creativity, nice people","You have to get a manager who wants to be a manager. You need them to fight for you, elevate you, highlight your accomplishments to senior management otherwise you get lost in the shuffle. They don't encourage movement to other depts as much as other companies, and it can literally take years to get a promotion. The unspoken rule is you do the job for a year and then get the promotion. Also, be vocal and open with others about equity/stock/shares. I found out it was very unfairly distributed on my old team with some people in management lying about it without even being asked directly."
11,Adobe,Inclusive culture,2022-03-22,5.0,Creative Director,"Good programs to promote inclusivity, a lot of clubs, awareness of equal pay and diversity.",A lot of politics similar to other companies this size.

13,Adobe,Great place to work,2022-03-07,5.0,Enterprise Business Development Representative,"Great perks, great brand, market leading products, fun team","Like most organizations it took time to move around, but it was important to network. I also worked there right as covid hit, so all sort of ""normal"" was lost for a couple years no matter where you worked. they took care us and gave us budget to build our home office"
14,Adobe,Cog in the $10 billion machine,2022-02-15,2.0,Customer Success Manager,"Adobe is major player in multiple industries and a massive enterprise globally. While I was in the Marketo organization, we certainly still felt some fundamental benefits with that gigantic umbrella above us.

- Excellent healthcare package and 401k/HSA
- Extensive additional benefits like commuter card, gym stipends, H&W, etc.
- Looks great on a resume
- Sometimes they brought a literal cash grab machine into the office (pre-COVID)","The flip side is that you're not a person or have any intrinsic value, you are simply a number or name on the spreadsheet that is expected to deliver. 

- Below industry standard salary
- For a CS role, it was extremely focused on upsell/cross-sell and you'd be expected to sell at all costs (especially to the detriment of the customer)
- Bonuses rarely came out correct or as advertised
- Management only cares about impressing those above them and the front-line employees are all expendable and simply don't matter"
15,Adobe,They prioritize the well being of their employees,2022-03-14,5.0,Customer Success Manager,Amazing benefits and warm company culture.,"Small fish in a big pond, hard to get promoted or move around within the company"

Frequent free lunches. Very divers workforce. Software purchasing discount for friends. Stock options.","Office Politics gets promotions. Some of the worst people management I have ever seen. You get stuck waiting for your stocks to vet and to qualify for your sabbatical, but 5 years is a lot of time to suffer. The good parts of the company are filled with overachievers who always reminded the teacher to give homework. The bad ones are run on Peter Principle and politics."
32,Adobe,Product Management at Adobe,2022-03-08,4.0,Product Manager,"- Company Values
- Employees are treated equally and given equal opportunity (for the most part)","- Work/Life balance- you are often working 10+ hours a day
- Making changes/improvements takes years of review and approval before anything happens (whether it's the job itself or the projects you are working on)"

Adobe also has many bright minds that are great to work with - especially within product.","Adobe's operations divisions are surprisingly disorganized given Adobe's size and reputation. Adobe wouldn't be Adobe without 5 teams all doing the same thing. 

The data is also very disorganized requiring extensive munging when building pipelines to projects. Much of Ops management is also old fashioned - still using Excel and PowerPoint for everything.

Slow to promote. Poor work/life balance (turns out when there's unlimited PTO, a culture forms where people rarely take any)"
37,Adobe,Best company I have ever worked at,2021-06-08,5.0,Senior Computer Scientist,"- Very smart, down to earth people. It is important for me to be at a company where I can learn from the people around me and I have never felt this is more true than at Adobe. 
- Everyone is very approachable. I have never felt like ""I can't talk to that person"". 
- Adobe as a company actually tries *hard* to do the right thing. When social issues have come up (internal or external), there has been a fairly open discussion and the companies actions have been transparent and understandable even when not everyone agrees with them.
- We have a huge amount of technical freedom and a rich and deep research organization always coming up with new things to try.","- We are still struggling to really nail our server offerings on the creative side. This is an opportunity -- if you are someone who shines in that arena we need you!
- We are dependent on our platform partners to be able to deliver the best experience to our customers. That can be problematic at times. 
- We build a lot of products beyond Photoshop and Acrobat. But not everyone outside Adobe knows that and almost everyone is going to ask you to fix a Photoshop/Acrobat problem at some point in your career (probably many times)"
38,Adobe,Great place to work especially for recent grads,2022-02-01,5.0,Senior digital strategy analyst,"Great culture, amazing people, learning opportunities, working for a creative company","Too much powerpoint work (at least on my team), sometimes pay/promotion isn't very transparent, tough for non-MBA & non-engineering roles to move around the company"

84,Adobe,New ugly side,2021-12-21,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Been here over 8 years and had a great ride. Considered top talent and been well-compensated. Stock price has really appreciated. I've contributed to multiple new products generating $100M+ annually and a handful of new patents. As a female engineering leader I feel I've been treated equally relative to my male peers which isn't the case elsewhere. Fantastic people, excellent company culture, successful business & operating model.","The last two years have brought out a new ugly side of Adobe, unfortunately. Executive leadership is all in California resulting in insular thinking and is clearly being more open about their support of left-leaning politics. My peers in other locations feel our leaders lack awareness of different perspectives, lifestyles and experiences of employees across the United States. Being in CA myself its harder to understand this but in recent months I can see what they're talking about. Examples include Adobe's prompt action to subject itself to President Biden's ETS vaccine mandate seemingly before the ink had dried. During my team here Adobe has never, I repeat, NEVER been a front-runner on any issues involving difficult decisions and significant change... but rather we conservatively and prudently wait to see what other major tech players do along with the consequences, and then follow suit or act differently if appropriate. In the case of ETS, many other tech companies and large employers are waiting for this controversial issue to play out in the courts and ultimately the Supreme Court before imposing what can be such a life/career-changing requirement on their employees. But contrary to the Adobe I've grown to love, it feels its appropriate to force all employees - remote or not - to vaccination NOW regardless of current and future court outcomes. And another example: occasionally, we deliberately 'over-rotate' with our diversity and inclusion efforts resulting in obvious reverse discrimination in our hiring practices and development opportunities, but leadership casually sweeps it under the rug. Its painful to write such a review about a company with 9 great things to every 1 drawback, but these drawbacks are inexcusable and SO uncharacteristic of our Adobe-4-All mantra."

Love Covid global days off and hope they continue. Love that they subsidize your personal volunteering with extra donations from Adobe.","Workload is high, especially at End of Quarter. Some mid-level management (at least in my department) is pretty unaware of work below them and too focused on pleasing other departments over protecting their team from unnecessary work. Adobe struggles a bit with integrations of new companies but I expect that happens everywhere."

I was excited to be part of this wonderful, well-known, beloved brand. The benefits are amazing. Lots of work life balance, healthcare is great,  there’s a nutritionist on staff, tons of unheard of added perks...all top notch. Adobe executive leadership truly cares and has put a lot of thought and research into making Adobe a great place to work.  But there’s a gap....","After several weeks of onboarding and participating in discovery meetings, it was clear that Adobe VPs and “heads of x” weren’t carrying the culture created by executive leadership down and through to the  individual contributors.  There is also a significant amount of unhappiness within the DX marketing org. Apparently there was a re-org last fall, and few understand their job and those that do, aren’t happy in their new roles. They openly admit they’re not sure how to integrate Workfront resources and because of that, they are pausing on spending time learning until they have to. Layer on top of that no clear direction from Workfront marketing leadership on new messaging and themes. It takes forever to get anything approved by Adobe. All of this creates doubt about the future. Without clear direction and lack of culture, me and many others jumped ship."

95,Adobe,Exceptional company with rigorous standards,2021-02-22,5.0,Customer Success Engineer,"I could write a novel of pros for Adobe. They have a genuine concern for employee well-being from physical to mental health, work-life balance, to job satisfaction.

The whole company genuinely feels like a cohesive team, all working toward the same goals with the same passion and concern for one-another. Despite the organizations size, sub-teams feel like smaller businesses that are easy to navigate socially and professionally. The clear work-ethic throughout inspires an overall attitude of excellence and drives you to achieve and work harder daily. Goals are clear, the workload is communicated and understood.","Every company has it's flaws, but it's challenging to pull out anything more than a minor complain that would be commonly found anywhere. The workload for my time is a little higher than it maybe should be, but I'm confident efforts are constantly underway to make improvements and hire more great people to fill in.

Unless you are willing to venture out and make yourself known, you could potentially feel isolated from a social perspective, especially during Covid, but even minor effort takes you a long way."

97,Adobe,Cards are stacked against you but at least you have great benefits,2021-05-25,3.0,Enterprise Account Executive,Adobe has great benefits and a great employee stock purchase program.,"Management treats employees like names on a spreadsheet. They do not care about your experience or strengths when considering new opportunities. Management does not lead, they are often unresponsive and unavailable to meet. 

It's very hard to get paid at Adobe. Lists are constantly changing, you are responsible for attrition, there is very little help in generating pipeline and managers are slow/hesitant to approve comp exceptions.

Quotas are unreasonably high and you do not have the support from management, BDRs, Inside Sales or Marketing to grow pipeline. Solutions Consultants are amazing but stretched too thin.

Forecast calls are terrifying. Management looks through opportunities in Salesforce and then interrogates seller in front of entire team.

Also, Adobe does not want to pay you. If you have a nice base, I think that they will give you a list and quota so high it's unattainable. You will not get a raise and if you do it could be applied to your variable."

I reported this to Adobe's HR and Forter's CEO, with substantial proof. I was told “there’s nothing they can do, as those people don’t work here” by Adobe's HR. Forter's CEO, seemed to think the behavior was perfectly acceptable.

I also provided substantial proof this vendor cheated on the POC to get into Adobe and other businesses, which I was at. They cheated to beat out other vendors. Again crickets.

Think twice before working at a company with these kind of values, it not worth being abused by their vendors."

It actively promotes a culture of being the best version of yourself and incentives you to becoming that.

For this review, please know I left under good circumstances. I was not hit as hard with what follows as some, but I got out while the gettin' was good. Adobe sales comp is totally [insert your worst curse word here] messed up. They have a negative dollar to dollar hit to quota for any customer who cancels. This means you inherit a customer who is cancelling a $500K - $1M license and you are immediately that much in the hole. For a relationship you didn't start, and had no influence on. They have tried to ""fix"" it, but their fix was retroactive and I have friends who ended up owing Adobe $20K - $30K in COMPENSATION after the ""fix"". Some people I know haven't seen a commission this year and now owe Adobe more money than their entire variable compensation. It's a horror story."

150,Adobe,Acquisition Woes & Toxic Adobe Lehi Culture,2021-08-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good benefits, beautiful facility, global COVID days off, bereavement leave for pregnancy loss","Adobe is ranked as one of the best companies to work for, which not only conflicts with my experience at Adobe, but makes me worried about going somewhere else. My experience at Adobe has been so poor. After reading my examples below, you may ask yourself, ""Why not go somewhere else?"" My answer is that if this is as good as it gets, there is nowhere that will be better than Adobe and that is why I am still here.

Examples: 
1. Myself and others were misleveled upon acquisition and have been essentially told to ""deal with it."" In regards to pay, a female manager alerted Adobe she was underpaid not only at her level, but at the level below her, and was told to be grateful for what she has and that no laws had been broken. Many people have given Adobe the opportunity to make things right since the acquisition, myself included, and Adobe has refused each time. 
2. There is a toxic, White, patriarchal culture that is pervasive throughout Utah. It exists at Adobe Lehi. White men hire white men and are offended (and retaliate) when diversity concerns are raised.
3. The ERC does not take employee concerns seriously. It is well known, and openly discussed, that you should not surface concerns to that organization. The default is inaction. I know several people who are considering their legal options to get concerns addressed. Note: If you are a current employee reading this and you have to go to the ERC, please document all interactions with them and avoid meeting in person. Better yet, go directly to your HR Business Partner.
4. Male leaders are not punished for their sexist behavior. When reported to their superiors, they tell us things like, ""He's better than he was,"" and, ""He's just lonely. Cut him some slack.""

TLDR; When you have enough resources, you can make anything look better than reality. I believe that is what Adobe does. Investing resources into community events, internal groups, etc. is insufficient when you are unwilling to do the work to create a truly healthy work culture. I know I speak for other women at Adobe Lehi when I say we want to be paid and leveled fairly, treated with respect, and listened to when serious issues occur."

Overall the company has a good vibe and I found it enjoyable 80% of the time. Plenty of latitude to do your own thing and own your space.","Plenty of latitude is mostly due to management apathy and inaction. Horrendous aging codebase shows signs of prolonged hacking and neglect. Senior researchers tend to throw their weight around and outright blockade development they don't agree with. Most other staff are frantically bugfixing for the researchers who avoid code reviews entirely. Your career can easily be stifled falling into the servitude of research staff with endless menial maintenance. This process leads to a revolving door of staff with heavy attrition.

Try here. If you get lucky you can get something done but if you experience misconduct then prepare yourself to exit promptly. Expect no help."
162,Adobe,"Brilliance, kindness, and respect",2020-09-24,5.0,Senior Software Developer,"My colleagues are out-of-this-world technically skilled, but are almost universally humble and generous with their time. 

The company's response to COVID has been both humane (giving us company-wide time off on a regular basis) and customer-centered (focusing only on the priorities that'll help our users the most). 

When people take time off, they're truly off; on my team, we don't come back to missed Slack messages on Monday mornings (or even many weekday mornings). For the summer shutdown (a week) and winter shutdown (another week), email is truly silent as everyone takes real time away from work, and we all come back ready to go again.

I get to work in extremely technically advanced spaces while keeping time for myself and my family, and am ecstatic to have landed at a company that supports both.","It's a big company, so things can move slowly; the focus on robustness means that you're unlikely to start working in the latest-and-greatest UI frameworks or to integrate exciting betas of third-party products. Adobe makes up for this by being fast on hardware adoption, though – the products have got to work on a variety of chips for extremely advanced levels of work (hardware demos often show off how well a new machine runs Adobe editing software), so the research teams get to skate out ahead of the rest of us."

It is important to hold people accountable and to achieve goals, so there is a silver lining, but it is difficult to strike the right balance between overwork and sanity. In Adobe's defense though, they do provide benefits to reduce stress. Just the execution and practice take time."

Consulting is a great practice because you get to work with a huge variety of clients on challenging problems. Always a different team and a lot of variety so you learn a ton. I had some amazing opportunities for growth. The values of Adobe as a whole are incredibly strong and make it a great place to work.","Sr Management came in from Big 5 consulting and tried to recreate a sweatshop like you have at bigger firms with recent college grads - expect our teams were 15+ years into their careers. They started treating people like numbers and it turned a job that everyone loved into one that everyone disliked. People don't leave jobs, they leave bad managers. They were always moving the goal post and never took the time to celebrate achievements. But Adobe is a classic case of ""golden handcuffs"" - even when you are unhappy, people stay because the benefits are so good. If they were to replace Sr Management for consulting with people who had trust in their teams and helped them grow, it would be a great place to work again."

338,Adobe,Marketo Specific Review,2021-01-22,3.0,Customer Success Manager,"Benefits are amazing
Innovative customers 
Awesome events held by Adobe","The only thing that will keep your head above water working with Marketo CS is the benefit of working for Adobe, but the two are still very disconnected. Marketo CSMs are treated like secondhand citizens, your compensation will be lower than what you see listed for an Adobe CSM and if you are not Enterprise you will have an aggressive and arguably unattainable sales goal. This isn't truly Customer Success, it is sales and do not let them tell you it isn't. They have also implemented a new ""level"" system that makes it so they can tell you you are getting promoted without actually giving you any title change or any significant compensation increase. 

Management plays favorites and is extremely cliquey. If you aren't meeting quota you will be treated like scum and if you are meeting quota they will treat you like you got lucky and that you better double it or else. They create a toxic environment of competition between the employees and there is a real high school mean girl mentality with a lot of the CSMs and if you are not in their inner circle you will get to look forward to snide comments about your performance, looks, or really anything they can come up with to try and knock you down a peg. I know several people, including myself, had to start going to therapy to deal with the environment. Thank god Adobe benefits cover it! I still flinch at the sound of a Slack notification from the issues with this team. 

There is also no official training and you can go your entire career here never actually getting into the product. I literally have never actively been inside the Marketo product, they do not even give CSMs a demo environment to test in or be trained at all. The one silver lining in that mess is that you have an SC team that knows what they are doing. I have never worked with more capable people than the people on that team and they can cover you for demos, but it needs to be tied to a new money deal, not troubleshooting with a customer or helping them understand a product they maybe just purchased. 

My advice to people who just want a foot into Adobe, join Marketo it's less competitive than the other products, but keep in mind that management isn't on your side to jump to other teams so if you can network under the radar that's your only chance. They don't want to lose anyone because turnover is already bad. I watched them lose a lot of amazing top performers to other companies because of this. Your opinion doesn't matter here, but the rest of Adobe seems to actually care about career growth."

The workplace is nice--gym is top-notch, cafeteria is great, and other amenities make it an enjoyable work environment. I feel like the company, my manager, and my coworkers all support a solid work/life balance. Not only is there a lot of talent at Adobe, but there's an incredible amount of all-around great people and that makes work even more fulfilling. The company shutdowns (1 week off) at the 4th of July and at Christmas are AMAZING. Flexible PTO, sabbatical of 4-6 weeks every 5 years, $10,000 tuition reimbursement every year, four months paternity leave, 6 months maternity leave, employee stock purchase program with a guaranteed 15% ROI every six months, even if the stock dips. Several times when my family has gone to the dentist or doctor the offices are surprised at how great our health insurance is. There's also a decent amount of internal mobility that happens, so Adobe seems supportive of that.","This is hard...I've been with Adobe four years and it still feels like my dream job. Maybe one thing is that since Adobe is still growing so fast and acquiring companies, it can be challenging to learn so many new things and adapt to be able to support new directions and integration efforts."

Great and inexpensive benefits","Good luck getting off your team after a few years. Virtually impossible to leave your team if you're doing a good job. Managers will talk negatively about you to potential managers ruining any chance of getting off that team so you'll stay. 

Also, as a remote employee, it's impossible to meet other managers so even harder to build relationships with other teams to move to. Overall, unless you're in or near a corporate office, you'll never move up.

Digital Experience Cloud is MESSED UP! Not sure how they've gotten so far without being sold off. It's a hot mess over there. Multiple solutions in the same space, no direction and even less leadership that knows what they're doing. Honestly, it's terrible."

- A lot to learn since the product suite and industries they touch keeps growing
- Cruise by and still not get fired makes for a pretty easy job 
- Amazing PR and on many lists of ""best places to work"" so you can share that on social media","- Very political organization like many other large corporations with ""meh....so so"" leaders who either moved up the ranks by just working there forever (but didn't grow true leadership skills) or newer and somewhat better leaders who are cut-throat and moved up by stomping on others
- Does not care about people, it's all about closing business and leveraging the weaker/nice people to push their agendas
- No people develop whatsoever, no concept of goal setting, quarterly check-in and promotions happen based on tenure not talent/deliverables. 
- Mid-level managers are just individual contributors with a manager title, you will learn nothing from them and they won't develop you either. They cruise and hope you cruise with them
- No diversity even though they are on many lists, its all paid PR. Most of the top leaders are White or Indian men. They have some token female leaders but they all hold leadership roles for HR or CSM type organizations and they aren't the best of the best coz they keep the best to do actual work."

- Adobe is a company built on acquisitions, and while the business strategy is usually rock solid, sometimes the comms isn't.

- I worked in the creative cloud team and the work expectations are too much
- They talk about gender equal etc but I don't see it practically, If you are a working mother or female in general, what you speak weights less
- They do not take 360degree feedback during performance reviews, manager just takes the review from one senior engineer whom he believes and your performance is measured based on your relationship with that sr engineer.
- Manager do not say it, but they expect ppl to finish ur sprint work (how much ever time it takes, they only need end result)as well as spend some extra time and contribute to projects outside what you do and also do regular brown bag sessions and presentations, in short work for more than 50hrs per week and thats what they consider to promote you.
- If the manager does not like anything in you, they put on PIP(performance improvement plan), and u should agree to whatever they say, and if they decide to fire you, whatever you try to improve they don't even consider it. 
- So, if they put you on PIP, better quit the company and move to something else
- Overall, bad experience in my entire 15 years of career."

- As a designer, you are so close to the tools that you use.","- I think this happens at a lot of big companies, but you sometimes feel like a cog in the wheel.
- Acquisitions are a heavy strategy for Adobe, so sometimes you end up trying to tie solutions together rather than ideating completely new solutions.
- Navigating a highly matrixed, political system is sometimes draining. Can feel like you spend way more time in meetings than designing."

566,Adobe,Better than most think,2019-08-03,4.0,Group Product Manager,"(1) Work/life balance at Adobe is just amazing. Especially the shutdowns in July and over New Year's are super valuable (it gives you a real mental break that you otherwise don't get).

(2) The company has a strong monopoly with the Creative Cloud, which brings in huge profits and took the stock price where it is now. 

(3) It is an amazing brand and working for Adobe makes you truly proud.","(1) Level of stress really depends on what product you work for. On the Creative Cloud side everyone is somewhat dispensable (it's a monopoly after all), which means it can be a pressure cooker and very political. How else to stand out?

(2) Given that work/life balance is so amazing, the compensation is a bit lower than elsewhere. I think it's totally fair but something to be aware of.

(3) On the Experience Cloud side, Adobe doesn't have the same level of experience as other companies. Adobe is not a traditional Enterprise software company, which means it's somewhat uneven.

(4) Kind of hard to make a career progression, given how nice the work/life balance is. Arguably it's better to make a career elsewhere and then join Adobe later on in your career."

- Cramped office with people jammed into every corner of the building
- Office space designed for low profile walls to promote collaboration that really was more of a cost cutting initiative that made for a loud and distraction work environment
- Little movement at the upper echelons which prevented movement beyond Sr. Mgr or Dir
- Strong focus on hiring leaders from the outside instead of promoting within
- Low appetite for taking risks
- Lacking in ability for internal innovation that led, more often then not, to acquisitions for growth
- Certain departments were very hesitant to allow any formal work from home programs
- Recent high turnover in tenured employees due to internal drama and a culture that is starting to go down hill
- Unclear organizational leadership at the BU level
- Strong emphasis in diversity that over rotated to a negative bias towards over represented groups ie a perception that certain employees received promotions primarily because of belonging to an under represented gender or race.  This includes an internal view by some that others are immune from termination because they fall in an under represented category even if those individuals were under performing"

596,Adobe,Genuine people in an exceptional culture,2019-05-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I can honestly say that I've never been surrounded by so many genuine, authentic, and nice people in my career. The work environment is one where colleagues truly care about each other. It may sound simple but it's really motivating to be at a company where employees care so much about each other and the company cares about you- as a person not just another employee.  There is also a mindset here where leadership is always questioning the status quo, pushing everyone to think bigger and differently, not get complacent, and to push for disruption if it will make us better. For a company over 30 years old and very successful, it's incredible to see and hear our leaders pushing for new ways of thinking so actively. There is no ""old vs. new"" guard that you might see at other companies. In addition to all this, the offices are gorgeous, comfortable, and creative. Food is excellent and subsidized a lot (not free which I like as there's no waste and less entitlement that what I've experienced at other Valley companies).","No real cons from a working perspective, I could get picky and say the elevators get crowded at lunch time and parking is tough if you show up to work late!"

600,Adobe,An Amazing Employer That Wants To Help You Grow,2019-11-04,5.0,Marketing Manager,"A lot of companies expect you to just sit, put your head down, work for 8 hours, and go home. This is NOT that place. Adobe prides itself on its company culture and it shows tremendously through the leadership, its people, and its dedication to innovation. Some cool things about Adobe off the bat: they have a learning fund that encourages you to take classes, go back to school, or even go to conferences to help you develop in your career.  There are a lot of on-site events for holidays, volunteer opportunities, and more so there is always something cool going on. Of course the wellness center is pretty awesome (and there are fitness classes you can take), and the food is pretty on point. 

One major thing that has been a refresher is that Adobe and the people who work here really put an emphasis on constructive and positive feedback: everyone here wants you to succeed. That energy carries throughout the workplace. You also feel very empowered to to help others as well, which creates this community and continuous cycle of trust, positivity, and communication. 

I will say this: Adobe is not for the faint of heart. ""Good enough"" isn't enough here. If you're okay with that, and you're an individual who likes to thrive, push, and succeed, then you will fit in just fine. There will be days where you will be putting in your time, and you'll have a 10 hour day. There are some days where you might leave a little early. What I will say is that you WILL take pride in the work you do, and nothing here is meaningless, at least in my opinion.","A work from home option would be nice, but I can also understand why they'd want people in office as it can be very hard to foster a work culture if employees are remote."

603,Adobe,Marketo Commercial CSM org is in full tail spin -2020,2020-02-24,2.0,Customer Success Manager,"Unlimited PTO (but strings attached to take it).
Stock options (but Adobe takes their taxes out of your stock credits).
Ability to work from home Wednesdays (but can be taken away on management discretion).
Co-workers are all very intelligent and great Denver office.
Parking and commuter benefits to office off 18th and California 
Well stocked kitchen with snacks, drinks and food.
Lunch provided last two business days of the month.
Two kegs tapped on Friday after 3 PM.
$360 yearly health credit (Most people used for ski pass)
~$1k dropped into HSA for high deductible healthplan per year
Pet insurance offering.","Commissions not being paid on time because ""Someone left the business.""
Compensation plans not being delivered until a quarter of the way through the fiscal year.
Sales targets are increased by 10-20% over last year with less ability to meet them.

Senior management never has answers for direct questions and is not genuine or forthcoming with what's really happening from top down decision making.
Same Senior Management has been promoted for the team's performance, but creates negative culture putting extreme pressure on FLMs that is then transferred to FLM to CSM relationships.
There is a palpable distrust and dislike for senior management throughout the org and cross-functional teams. This makes it difficult for any other team to want to work or support the Commercial CSM org.
Crying, confusion, discomfort and overall uneasiness ripples throughout the entire org regularly.
Feedback is rarely asked for, and when received goes no where.
Renewal team operated without a manager for almost 12 months
Layers of middle management have been added.

Constantly changing and broken quoting tool.
Accounts have changed hands multiple times, which is well known as a major complaint from customers as to why they leave Marketo.
CSMs are the catch all for almost everything related to current customers, where more responsibility is added but compensation is not raised.
Asking to utilize your unlimited PTO is only approved based on your performance.
Favoritism from FLMs to their favorite CSM friends.
No on-boarding  or mentoring for new CSMs when they join the org.
No known promotion track for CSMs.
Overall lack of diversity on the team with only two POC in the entire org.

Competitors are catching up with Marketo in regards to pricing and functionality which is making the CSMs ability to renew or expand customer much harder. 
Customers are expected to spend 8% more per year with almost no additional functionality added to their subscription.
Auto-renewal language added to contracts as sneaky way to make them stay with the company. 
Product reliability has been viewed from customer perspective as going downhill.
Forcing customers to purchase Professional Services to get basic help utilizing the product.

Non-existent training on Marketo product itself.
CSMs are expected to ""learn as they go"" while being the trusted adviser for the customers marketing decision making."

619,Adobe,"Interesting brand, but somewhat lacking a rudder",2020-03-06,3.0,Associate Director,"Lots of basic tech benefits, something just about every company offers these days.  If you're on the creative cloud side, good for you.","I was on the experience cloud side and things are pretty much half-baked.  Engineering is solid, but coordination and collaboration across the portfolio is lacking.  Can cause frustration for cross-functional groups, such as mine."
620,Adobe,"Hostile work environment, fear and intimidation",2020-01-26,1.0,Support Engineer,Nothing other than good insurance.,"New Magento support management that started in October 2018 has created an environment of fear and intimidation. They have put at least one person on a PIP in each support team and fired them to scare everybody else. We  feel disconnected from larger Adobe. Management has absolutely zero respect to their subordinates, especially lower ranking ones. 
Adobe ""Unlimited PTO"" has been codified into 10 business day per year by support management. Mandatory overtime that is enforced by fear. 
6-week competition with $25 gift card prize  - what a joke."

626,Adobe,Terrible culture under fake frontage,2020-04-28,1.0,Software Engineer,Can buy Photoshop at a discounted price,"Very bad culture within teams, micromanagement, favoritism to promote and hire mostly Indians while firing non-Indians. Ultra leftist culture - CNN and MSNBC are on TV on every floor. All invited ""guests"" are Democrats.
If you are non-Indian, stay away from this company - they will crush you and throw you under a bus in no time."

628,Adobe,Growing (and profitable) cloud company,2019-10-09,5.0,Senior Systems Engineer,"Legacy software company that successfully has moved into the cloud (like Microsoft)
Company has a great culture, excellent benefits, and is competitive for compensation.
Company has significant growth, is moving into the B2B enterprise cloud software space (Magento/Marketo), and is profitable (unlike many other cloud companies)
SF and SJ locations","Company is a large enterprise and as such has some of the issues you would expect
Company acquisitions can be somewhat difficult when part of a company being acquired"

- benefits are amazing
- tons of PTO
- employee stock plan is great
- coworkers are awesome","- not the right office for sales
- management can't control much, too low on the totem pole
- no room for advancement -- senior people tell you ""you need to leave before you can come back"" because the funnel for advancement is so clogged
- the ""next role"" doesn't exist in Denver, you need to be in San Fran or Lehi"
630,Adobe,Best company I've ever worked for,2019-08-14,5.0,Group Product Manager,"Outstanding colleagues, incredible culture, great salaries, room for advancement, easy to try new roles, visionary leadership, flexible work schedule (as long as you get your work done well), extraordinary benefits, listens to employee feedback and actually does something about it.","Sometimes overly-processed, lots and lots of meetings (often with 20 or more people in them), some politics at the higher levels (usually doesn't impact most people),  a few bad apples (try to avoid them)."
631,Adobe,"Good, but not great...",2020-07-06,4.0,Business Intelligence Analyst,"Great benefits, time off, etc",A surprising lack of formal training.
632,Adobe,People-focused and surprisingly forward thinking company leveraging industry-leading software to drive innovation,2014-01-18,5.0,Senior Program Manager,"People focused: Adobe really makes it a real priority to retain good people. What's different, at Adobe, is you can be rewarded for deep area expertise alone. There doesn't seem to be a press to discover everybody's path to Senior VP. Instead, if you do a great job and your talents are needed, Adobe will try to keep you.

Strong rewards: pay is equitable if not better than peer companies. ESPP, in particular, is ridiculously good. Health care is similar to most high tech companies but they do offer pet insurance which is somewhat unique.

Management: very open, addressable; feels like a small company at times.

True performance-based review process: no bizarre stack rank, no funky ""grades"", just a straightforward conversation with your manager about how you've done and where you're going.

Work/Life is second to none: Need time off? Take it! No limit on PTO. The simple agreement is, simply, make sure your job is taken care of.","Things can be a little frenetic. As Adobe shifts from the old to the new, some plans come in at the last minute. 

Hierarchical career movement may be limited. Org structures are pretty flat so, while your scope of influence may grow, you might stay in the same spot in the chain of command for some time. 

There is some discipline-specific segregation, typical of a mature software company (e.g., testers only do this, marketing people only do that, etc). I think this is more of a holdover culture from older employees as I don't see any segregation coming from higher levels."
633,Adobe,Amazing company with great culture and benefits,2020-01-09,4.0,Technical Support Engineer,Awesome health insurance with no copays. Company shutdown twice a year. Unlimited PTO.

636,Adobe,absolutely great place to work,2019-10-09,5.0,Senior Product Manager,"Most office locations are centrally located in major cities (Seattle, San Jose, San Francisco, New York) and are well designed. Adobe has invested heavily in building out beautiful workspaces with top notch facilities (gyms, cafes, etc).",Its a big company and most of it's money making products are dinosaurs. Some business units and product teams are way more dynamic than others.
