0,Akamai,"Great culture, challenging and stimulating environment",2021-09-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Akamai is a great company to work for. Its culture is based on talent and merit. An employee is generally given all the tools they need to succeed and the rest depends on their hunger and motivation.
Work-Life balance and employee well-being are among the pillars of Akamai culture.","Honestly, can't find any cons."
1,Akamai,Amazing company to work at,2022-03-24,5.0,Software Engineer II,Very interesting challenges to solve and a great culture,Can't think of anything really
2,Akamai,Best place I have worked in 25+ years,2022-02-17,5.0,Software QA Engineer,"This is the first company I have worked at where 'work/life balance' isn't just a slogan. Management really works hard to ensure that employees are supported. They have helped us out with a reimbursement for setting up our home offices. And the new plan for remote work is super flexible! 

There are plenty of employee support groups for whatever you interest is; that are very active. The community and environmental engagement programs are top notch. And did I mention unlimited PTO!?!?

Communication from management is proactive. I Love working with the people in my group. And so far I haven't encountered any real jerks in the rest of the company.","Healthcare plan is better than many, though still not really top tier. And price wise it is on the high side of the middle range.
Sign-on bonus and other incentives are paid out as RSUs over time. (some prefer this)
Big gap between performance reviews and any pay increases taking effect."
3,Akamai,Great Company,2022-03-23,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Great company, competitive pay, encouraging managers, team environment",Can't think of any negatives.
4,Akamai,great place to work,2022-03-23,5.0,Senior Engineering Manager,"good tech, excellent benefits, smart people","moves real fast, runs lean on staffing"
5,Akamai,Great place with great opportunities,2022-03-21,5.0,Project Manager,"-Awesome leadership team
-Interesting product

-Sometimes there is red tape around certain initiatives"
6,Akamai,Great company,2022-03-22,5.0,Sales Associate,Work hours great benefits nice staff,No overtime no management assignments left to struggle
7,Akamai,Great Company,2022-03-23,5.0,Senior Director,Amazing Culture and Management Team,None that I can think of.
8,Akamai,Highly variable experience,2022-03-21,3.0,Security Researcher,"Work life balance is great, as long as you’re in the right group. Flexible hours and WFH indefinitely","Company is pretty dysfunctional as a whole, leadership is disconnected from long term efficiency. Compensation targets “the mean” so employees are underpaid compared to other tech companies in the area. I’ve heard of people doubling their salary by leaving on several occasions."
9,Akamai,Akamai is in the Glassdoor 2022 best places to work for a reason,2022-01-24,5.0,Solutions Engineer,"I have been with Akamai for a relatively long time and haven't written a review so it was about time! There are many reasons why I think Akamai is a fantastic place to work and I'll mention a few, but they are far from all. If you like these - consider joining us - I want more awesome people to call friends & colleagues! 
- Great people. When I say that I mean in the full spectrum as human beings. Pretty much all the people I have worked with throughout the years are genuinely nice people who work hard at achieving Akamai's mission to make the Internet a better, safer place for everyone. There is tremendous talent here at every level - engineering, customer support, product management, sales, hr. The tone is set from the very top by Tom who is extremely hard working & smart, cares about the company & people deeply and manages the company to the highest ethical standards. Evidence of which is our inclusion in the JUST 100.
- Culture. Akamai is a diverse company with people from all over the world and in almost all parts of the world - united on values of honesty, transparency, fairness and mutual respect. While there will always be exceptions I really feel these are the overarching principles by which we go about our days.
- The mission. Everyday we who work here are responsible for making billions of people's online experience a good and secure one. Be it streaming movies, reading the news, shopping online, banking, you name it. We take this responsibility seriously and go to extreme lengths to make sure we get it right. When something does break or doesn't go as planned - we fix it as fast as we can and try our best to make sure it doesn't happen again. Ironically, most of the time people don't know we even exists which means we are doing it right.
- Our technology. Akamai has been around since the early days of the Internet - pioneering many of the fundamental technologies & concepts that power the Internet of today. But we aren't standing still - there is evolution and innovation happening here everyday. Everyone is empowered and encouraged to contribute to this. Just over the course of the last year I have personally played a part in innovations in both edge computing and security for example.
- Akamai is profitable with solid financials. As opposed to many if not most of our competitors we aren't bleeding cash every quarter. This means the company has endurance which is critical for material & long term investments - be it in new technology, hiring talent, scaling up to meet future demand or weathering out storms.
- We are serious about our environmental & sustainability programs. Early on the company set goals for emissions, energy and e-waste and publish a yearly sustainability report on how we are doing. This is one of the reasons we are included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) and the FTSE4Good Index.","Overall there's not much I would say are big cons as they typically come as consequences of the pros but for full transparency here's a few.
- We don't market ourselves as much and as well as we should. This mostly affects attracting talent (so hopefully this review can help change that a bit). Customers and those in our technology space know us well but outside of that we are a bit anonymous.
- Profitability means we invest with care. That's not to say we don't take any risks - we do - but if the economics don't materialize after a while we also aren't afraid to move on.
- Bloated organization in parts. Primarily I would say this manifests as too much middle management and process sometimes. But I never let that hold me back and neither should you :)"

15,Akamai,Getting worse over time,2021-11-10,2.0,Engineer,Initial offer and benefits are competitive. Its a big company so its not unstable like a startup. A lot of people here so smart its unbelievable.,"You won't ever get a meaningful raise, and may get laid off. Company is getting very top heavy and leadership has ivory tower disease. They act like they care and schedule lots of feedback meetings but its just show. All big decisions are based on dumb indirect inputs like surveys and data, or they just secretly decide what to do without talking to anyone and lying about it. There is plenty of staff but no leadership so managers protect the ones who don't work but somehow never get laid off. Avoid working here if you are a responsible person, because you will be doing the work of three people and watch your boss do nothing about the ones that aren't working. And then you get laid off, not the ones doing nothing."
16,Akamai,Love the company,2022-03-19,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Great place to work. Highly recommend.,We have been slow to come back in the office. I miss the team synergy in office.

Customers love the products and the products are stable and very good.,"Sometimes too conservative. The products are perceived by the market as being expensive and many best of breed solutions are selected ahead of Akamai

Turf wars. The recent reorganization resulted in about a 4% layoff... but they treated those people very well. Worse off are some of us left behind, and I was a lucky one. I was effectively demoted without cause, despite consistently very good reviews. The rising tide of the reorg floated some boats but sank far more others than it should have; many folks were pulled off of leadership and management tracks for no good reason; some people were put on PIPs for poor reasons, effectively managing them out without severance or the good treatment for those who were laid off. This has been very disappointing treatment of people who have been seen as valuable (but perhaps expensive) employees. A lot of very good people are leaving. I’m sure things will shake out and they will do well and be a great employee again, but this was a very disappointing end game for many of us. And it WILL be the end game."

* Very mature, prudent company. Incredible safety culture - which is great when you're supposedly ""on call"" for incidents - my phone has rung 5 times in 2 years. It's not an emergency unless it's an *emergency*. We don't move fast and break things.
* Ethical - The company is not actively doing heinous stuff (no radicalizing teens with social media, not exploiting an underclass of independent contractors, etc). It's a poor commentary on the state of the world that that's a pro, but good luck finding that at a big tech company these days.","* After an activist investor came in in 2017, the company (apparently) cut back on a lot of perks. So don't expect a lavish Christmas party, or business trips around the world. I think compensation is on the lean side for the area as well.
* Certain BUs have a stricter time off policy than others - that 6 weeks might really be 3-4!

250,Akamai,asdasdasd,2020-05-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,good company with good pay,parking can be expensive to find if you are working in cambridge
251,Akamai,I enjoyed this company but I don't recommend.,2020-01-30,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's very difficult to divide Pros and Cons. I'll try to write actual situations I encountered, not just writing my impressions,  ""good or bad"".
So let me mix them up here. As a memorial to my leave this company.
(Place and title is anonymous)

== Culture ==
	
I had worked for a bureaucratic company that everyone including non-tech people would know the name and is several ten times larger than Akamai. 

From my experience, Akamai has five times more managers and positions compared to a far larger company than Akamai. 

I feel too many management teams and the job titles end up leading Akamai to ""no decision can't be made"".

Even though Akamai is still small - midsize company, Akamai is the most bureaucratic company I've ever experienced.

The interesting part is that there are so many rules but many managers even don't care about the rules.

They tend to overwrite even very basic company rules. In most cases, those rules are used to say ""It's not my/our job"". A lot of red tapes in Akamai. So, it's sometimes impossible to achieve a very simple thing.

Let's say, when you go to someone to ask a task following a guide on the intranet, you might be told ""it's not my task because my manager has told me it's not our task even if they're defined and written on the intranet"".  Or ""I know Akamai is selling that service/product but our team doesn’t have enough skill, so we don’t do that.""
	
These are just examples, but you would often encounter similar situations because one small task is divided into many small tasks. It's very common throughout the company, not depending on your job title.  So, in most cases, I think your responsibility is very small compared to average companies. 
If you like small tasks and don’t want to experience new things. I recommend this company. You would get a great work-life balance.

But if you are like go-to-guy, I don’t recommend this company because a lot of people would come to you and push you to do their jobs even if those tasks are not your responsibility. No rules. 

You need to work with many people to achieve a small task. Sometimes, you need to find someone who follows the company rules secretly behind his/her managers if the manager is kind of people who don't like to follow the rules. The more you are versatile, the more you would encounter these troublesome situations. 
	
I felt Akamai consists of village culture. Cliques are everywhere. They control the company and block innovation and changes. And the culture created by them is, as you can imagine, naturally corrupting.  If you like corruption and are good at getting benefits from the culture, this culture will fit you.
	
I think this creates village culture. I've seen several bullies consistently over the years. One bully is recognized and reported even by a customer. So, I could say it's the prevailing culture. HR recognizes those bullies but seems trying to confine them as if there is nothing happening.
	
And I've seen some managers seem to have difficulties communicating with customers or partners. I've seen and been told by customers or partners that some of Akamai's managers are arrogant even in front of customers even when they have trouble with their platform. Naturally, many staff employees follow that kind of style while saying customers are most important.
	
So, you often encounter many illogical situations. One best point in Akamai would be that you can get more anger management ability.

I was told by my former colleagues in Akamai. ""You proved yourself to be a really bad guy because you could work for such a long time in Akamai"" 

Many good colleagues quit. The average is around one or two years. They are still good friends.","Instead of Cons.  I put my review from the perspective of technologies.

== Technologies ==
	
I don’t recommend this company, especially for engineers. If you want to have some experience with CDN, go to Fastly or AWS. 
	
Akamai CDN is based on old physical server technologies, there a lot of legacy operations that seem to be automated very easily. Akamai is trying to move on to new technologies, but it's too slow.

The number of CDN servers is still number one in the world and the strongest point from the perspective of capacity. But Akamai started losing the advantage as other cloud vendors are focusing on CDN. 

And I feel making things more complicated by dividing into many manual tasks is the typical Akamai way while many tech companies making things easier with technologies. 

There are many small products based on CDN which could be a simple product with other venders.  I would say they are coming from too many organizations and politics. The way I look at it, to create more positions, Akamai has needed to divide one product into many products. 
	
Maybe there is so much to do. But that would be because of a lot of manual work which comes from the immaturity of legacy product architectures and approval processes which have to go through many people. It's very common for engineers to say that they feel they are wasting their time, should be able to consolidate these tasks.

For example, with AWS, you may be able to do a task in 5 minutes. With Akamai, it takes one month or impossible. If it's a simple task, these things could happen very easily.
	
And roles are divided into many job titles. So, your responsibility would be very small. Depending on your situation, most of the tasks you do could be clerical tasks.

At least I know a few guys who weren't satisfied with their roles and quit saying that their responsibility is too small and they can't understand why a simple single task requires many people. So, if you have good work ethics to learn more and work hard, I think this is not the place you should belong to. You would encounter a lot of red tapes and politics, local rules by cliques.

For example, in other companies, one person can manage and complete one simple task. But in Akamai, sometimes it can be called a project and may require three or four people. But you can’t tell these things from job description open on the internet.
	
Akamai is trying to expand into new technology areas such as enterprise security which are completely different from CDN.

But Akamai has track records keep failing new business. You can find them if you look up on the internet carefully.

As I see it, Akamai tries to put those new businesses into the same business framework as CDN. So, Akamai still has difficulties to get those new business rolling. So, you shouldn’t expect much in these areas. Some people may like birth pains to create new things and get new business rolling. 
	But I think only you can encounter there would be politics and red tapes, a lot of reasons ""we don’t do that"" by old cliques who stick to the experience of CDN. I've seen a few people left in very short terms, again and again, saying that they had trouble with those situations. It seems a typical innovation dilemma. If you have good experience in those areas, it wouldn't work here.
	
Even with CDN business, Akamai doesn’t allow customers to sign up online. You need to sign a contract that is really complicated and hard to understand and takes a lot of time. From outside, as many cloud companies allow customers to sing up online, it seems an easy thing. But Akamai has a lot of reasons why ""we don't / can't do that"".
	
There are a lot of people involved in one product development, but even the specifications of a product are very vague. Most of the specifications are ""not defined"". So, learning a product takes a lot of effort and time then even with that effort and time, you will still be not sure about the product. 

Actually, there are many materials online, but most of them are sales/marketing materials even though they are supposed to be targeted at technical people.
	
In most cases, you need to work based on some kind of rumors.  Product information is usually exchanged verbally or through chatting. In most cases, the source of information is someone's blog on the intranet.

No culture to write down information.  Everyone is not sure who is responsible for a product even though there are many product managers.
Product managers (I don’t know why there are many product manager titles for one product) are in most cases not able to be responsible for their products probably because of a lot of red tapes."

Cheap Hershey's kisses candies are the ONLY form of free snack the company will provide. The company will decide to delay annual raises by 6 months to save a few pennies and this has happened multiple times!!!
* MASSIVE offshoring to low wage countries especially in engineering. You will be left wondering why they even bother paying you to sit in a high wage country. You will see your colleagues leave and management will replace the headcount by hiring 2 engineers in a low wage country such as Poland.
* Extremely dated technology.

You'll have an opportunity to work with really huge datasets and the intersection between your work and your daily life will start to become apparent as you realize just how much traffic Akamai controls. It's a real opportunity to make a difference with some decent technology.

There's a huge and shiny new building in Kendall Square that Akamai will be moving in to very shortly. It's very modern and cool.","The tech stack at Akamai is almost entirely proprietary. The company does let teams integrate open source and new tech as they see fit, but the process is very slow. Basic solved problems like continuous build and integration seem like unmoveable behemoths, even though they are not. Technical debt is rising and the company leadership has explicitly admitted that they are prioritizing revenue streams over any sort of technical debt reduction or mitigation. Over the past 5 years the company has gone from a fairly nimble if a bit introspective organization to a profit hungry big business.

There are a few departments that seem to be guided by randomly throwing darts at a board with no thought to how it will affect other units. Communication between business units is poor to non-existent."
272,Akamai,Wonderful company,2019-11-26,5.0,Senior Manager,Akamai is by far the best company for which I have ever worked.  The management has the best interest of the employees in mind.

Problem was that many of them were hired in the last five years—unfortunately into department leadership positions.","Akamai went from a great place to work to a nightmare in a short period of time.  Akamai became extremely lazy in the hiring process over the last half decade.  Rather than finding good cultural fits, they just started hiring the first candidate that met a desired quota.
Real Estate leadership team was an example of nepotism at it finest.  It’s run by a crew of inexperienced career climbers with undefined, but well compensated roles, and a “do as I say, not as I do.” attitude.  Hint—when you tell other departments that their space utilization is an issue, but most of your Directors and VP work from home or their real estate brokers office 3-4 days a week, it’s not a good look.
HR leadership is a lacking.  They generally couldn’t be bothered to weed out harassment or bullying even when it was staring them right in the face.  Victim blaming and excuse making became all too common.  Suggestion: Stop ignoring the patterns of misbehavior and hope it will go away when mistreated employees get fed up and leave.   Acknowledging, but failing to correct or remove the problem actors doesn’t solve anything.  It just reinforces that the misbehavior is acceptable to a company that represents itself as an inclusive “Great Place to Work”."

- amazing scale which can teach a motivated engineer tremendous skills and techniques","- toxic culture and extraordinarily political.  teams sabotage each other to ensure that their competing ideas win, it seriously happens all the time.  
- sadly, people play on Tom's personality to get projects done or tanked
- many in senior leadership are clueless, or willfully ignorant, about what is happening in their teams. 
- Good ideas, especially those based in industry best-practices are often ignored or discounted because of Not Invented Here, or early inventor syndrome - because Akamai's tech was truly so great in 1998, they struggle to let go of parts of it that now have been leap-frogged, leading to a bizarre state of advanced and very cludgy or backwards and outdated technology  - and not just for legacy systems, but even new work.
-  As an example - the VP in our office showed up to work less a couple times a year - only when bigwigs would visit.  Effectively delegating his entire job, even direct reports wouldn't be able to reach him for weeks at a time, he never did perf reviews or gave feedback - nearly non-exisistent leadership for his teams - but he talks just enough of a good game to leadership to somehow get away with it for years now."

Being a woman at Akamai is challenging.  If you're a woman, beware of working for another woman at this company.  Hypocritical female executives."

289,Akamai,Akamai doesn't really develop anything.,2019-01-17,2.0,Systems Architect,Large company.  Liberal work from home policy.  International.,"Your work will never see the light of day.  

Akamai started as a web caching service and pretty much stopped there.  They have gone on to buy other little companies to acquire new technology and ... don't seem to do anything with it.  Akamai has annual layoffs where folks that are not politically aligned get axed regardless of their contribution or technical importance.  Honestly though, Akamai needs to lay off a LOT more people.  Because Akamai doesn't really develop any  new technology, they really don't need all of those engineers and developers.  Seriously, Akamai could be 1/10th its current size and still be just as ""productive"".  

The liberal work from home policy is nice, but it also has a down side.  My manager lived in another state.  His manager lived in another country.  Our BU was run by another guy in another country.

Nothing seems to get done.  My team produced lots of great work but there was nobody to hand it off to -- even the teams that requested the systems in the first place.  Nobody is in charge.  Nothing seems to go anywhere.  There is no direction."

297,Akamai,Run for your life,2019-08-05,1.0,Marketing,Great pay (but how much is your happiness worth?),"The recent marketing leadership team that was hired approximately 2+ years ago, is extremely shady, from the CMO down. I dare you to be good at your job and try to do decent work in that department. The problem is, if you are good at what you do but, you are surrounded by unqualified people in the wrong roles, you are inevitably going to disagree with them. That doesn't fly with the egos in this marketing leadership team. They are only interested in ""Yes Men."" You can almost surely expect to be on the next round of layoffs if you don't get with their ill-conceived program. A lot of talented people have gone out the door for no good reason. Did I mention the layoffs? They happen annually as well as random points throughout the year. Job security is non-existent in the marketing department.

There is no actual plan in any of the day-to-day work, no overarching strategy in the marketing, and no analytics being used improve the effectiveness of the work. Even though the tools are readily available, it takes competent leadership get the department to properly put them to use. There's little to no cooperation between teams and zero accountability when things get really screwed up (and they do get screwed up often. Projects take so much longer than they ever should. Work is finished and approved, then reworked constantly, because of the lack of clear leadership, guidelines, decision rights and strategy. The amount of money being wasted in the department is crazy.

Bottomline: It's miserable in this department, run."
298,Akamai,Not what you it appears to be,2019-09-19,2.0,Engineering Manager,"Location, in the epicenter of technology in Kendall square",Managers who only think of their own careers. Be prepared to be tossed under the bus.

300,Akamai,Well run Internet networking company,2015-11-30,4.0,Senior Technical Writer,"Akamai is the leader in its field of content delivery and moves1/3 of the world's Internet traffic on its servers. It's technologies are often leading edge, and as a general rule the people tend to be smart and easy to get along with. The company is particularly well managed, treats employees well,  and compensates people at an above average level. The overall benefits package is very good. Management is very transparent (this is a public company) in does quarterly meetings telling us how the business is doing.

Excellent work/life balance.","There aren't many downsides to working at Akamai. There is the general challenge of working in Cambridge which can be expensive to commute to and live in. The company does not provide things like free parking or gyms, etc. Currently the company is in multiple sites in Cambridge having outgrown its resources. It is expected to relocate (probably in Cambridge or Boston) in 2017.

As to your particular job and the career track that depends almost entirely on your managers. The company does promote somewhat from within, but doesn't make it an emphasis.

Over the past 4 years the company has nearly tripled in size from 1800 to 6000, and the quality of the people has diminished. People there tend to be happy and have voted the company the 3rd best large company to work for in Massachusetts. I think that the company's ranking is based more on the past than the present, and is a good marketing exercise."

Technology wise there is lot of scope for improvement
Career path forward is a bit of a concern"
308,Akamai,Great engineering environment,2016-03-11,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Akamai was built from the ground up by engineers and engineering principles.  Engineers are really treated as core assets of the company and have the opportunities to effect change.  

There are numerous internal programs that allow an ambitious employee to both learn about new projects, present on their own projects, or nominate new projects to improve the company or offer a new service to our customers.

Telecommuting is definitely an option.  You're given the tools you need to be able to work anywhere.","There is a lot of legacy systems, legacy tools and legacy methods that are difficult for new-hires to pick up and learn.  It's difficult for a new-hire to be able to significantly contribute within the first few months. 

Documentation is really scattered and difficult to nail down.  Much of the knowledge is tribal knowledge that is handed down from engineer to engineer.

As Akamai has gotten bigger, it feels as if they're starting to nickle & dime where they can.  Yes  cost-cutting measures are expected as you turn into a multi-national corporation, but some decisions really seem to focus on reducing cost, and not really recognizing the consequences of those cost reductions."
309,Akamai,Employees are not valued,2014-01-26,2.0,,"The atmosphere is very relaxed, which helps creativity and communication between the team members. Employees are typically very competent and friendly. The technology behind the company is very unique and interesting.

There are many departments and an employee can develop their skills by switching groups although it might not be very easy.

The education assistance program is a great tool to further develop ones skills.","The company has a policy of not sponsoring green cards until the last 1-2 years of H1B, despite promising otherwise during hiring. Those who are on H1B, DO think twice about this. This is not just in one department, it's a company wide issue. The management will use this policy as an excuse, which gives an impression that upper management don't value the employees while unnecessarily create uncertainty and frustration for the employees.

There management structure is convoluted with many tiers of mid-level managers and the messages are many times lost along the way. With that, there are also a lot of politics going on which can be frustrating.

Career advancement is not uniform across the many groups of the same department, it VERY much depends on the manager. Perhaps this is true everywhere, but a checklist of skills and contributions would help.

The company is starting to nickel and dime by reducing personal workspace in the new offices, doing away with free sodas and weekly lunch."
