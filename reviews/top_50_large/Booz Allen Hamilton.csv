There is plenty of opportunities to define your own work streams within company. If you are good at networking and play your cards right, your work can have high visibility and you can grow within the organization.",Company can be very slow moving at times. Their engineering efforts are brand new and they are still stuck in a bit of a consulting mindset.

29,Booz Allen Hamilton,a bit too woke,2022-04-02,4.0,Consultant,"Solid company, never have to worry about your paycheck. Strong technological support.",Going too far down the woke trail. Pushes a lot of beliefs on the employees without taking into account that they may not believe the same way.

If you have a decent mgr(s) to support, it can be a great job.","Core values are preached, but not always followed. Disciplinary actions for so-called ""ethics violations"" are arbitrary. They're currently trying to remove the ""relationship"" building and the ""customer service"" of EA positions, which is what that position is actually about. Lack of transparency from Executive Team. Bold changes every 2 years that put people in a tail-spin only to have them dropped because they don't work and no one seems to have fully thought through these changes - appears capricious although I imagine its not."

For the most part a very humane place to work, but it varies team to team.","-There's a big difference between being competent as a consultant and contractor to clients, and succeeding internally at Booz. It can be very political and a person's success is often tied to the senior leader they align.
-The company's leadership says they care about women and diversity, but they don't know how to translate their values into the employee experience at the daily level. 
-Many senior leaders at the firm are biased against strong women leaders, and favor technical talent over competent leaders and managers who could lead the business and company in the future. 
-Lack of transparency, informality with performance management and back-stabbing by mid-level management can make it a toxic place to work once you get to a certain level. 
-Most talented and credentialed people are excited about the mission and promise of the company but leave because they're poorly managed."
35,Booz Allen Hamilton,Environmental challenges,2022-03-28,2.0,Associate,"Great CEO - sincere, empathetic and caring. Company that generally strives to do the right thing for employees and communities. BAH name looks good on resume","The culture in parts of BAH is toxic and in some groups bullying, gossiping, and finger pointing are the norm. ln HR in particular this type of behavior is common and accepted. Leadership is lacking. Those in charge don't seem to know how good leaders behave and their judgment is quite poor.   Incompetent, messy ""leaders"" are celebrated for ""fixing"" issues that they created. There's been a lot of turnover in HR the last couple of years and apart from some new folks who don't know better yet and those who've seen enough dysfunction and are actively looking to leave, what remains is mostly those individuals who thrive in the toxic environment that they have created"
36,Booz Allen Hamilton,Good company if you understand the reality,2022-04-01,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"High profile client relations, good market salary and benefits",Core values are paper thin.

Project leadership in the tech field expects everyone to do as told and take the heat (I.e., superhuman deliveries) for underbid projects.   The internal and billable folks are treated very differently.   Be sure to get the position expectations in writing in advance.   They hire Java programmers and expect them to be Python developers and hire Python developers for  Ruby on Rails positions.   You have a background in DevOps?

My managers are supportive and understanding and the company doesn't really tolerate mean people in the firm. It's also got an excellent work-life balance and the transition to being a primarily WFH company has been well executed.,"The fact that contracts are often short-term is a problem. I'm constantly having to find new work as contracts begin and end. This means the quality of projects I'm on can be hugely varied. I absolutely LOVE what I do right now, but I've also been on projects that have destroyed my soul. Also, compensation is a serious black box and you never know what you're going to get as your annual raise. Could be great, could be terrible, but you have no way of knowing what it's going to be."

This job boosted my resume, and helped me land a new job at an amazing company.","This is not a good place to work if you are passionate about software and want to grow your skills. The job is extremely slow paced. You are in a silo with your team and your contract. There is no sense of culture or community here. No company wide goals or objectives. It felt like I was working on a group project in college again.

The quality of code is poor. The technology stacks are ancient. There was zero structure to anything. JIRA boards were rarely used. There are no resources available for learning.

The way 401k matching is done is shady. You do not get your 401k match every paycheck, or even every month. It happens once per year on the last day of the calendar year. That means that if you get hired in January, and quit on December 30th, you will not receive any 401k match. Its basically an interest-free loan that you're giving to Booz Allen. You could've been making gains on those contributions all year if they were vested monthly.

A senior manager told me that Booz likes to hire more and more people each quarter to show growth to their shareholders. They are not afraid of hiring employees without having any actual work to give them."

172,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great Company,2022-02-03,5.0,Senior Consultant,Great company to work for. Pay and benefits are hard to beat anywhere else,Haven't found any yet as I have been here for 3 months
173,Booz Allen Hamilton,Do not recommend working here,2022-03-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Booz Allen “brand” name on your resume,"Throughout my 3 year tenure I left the company extremely disappointed with my experience. I had high hopes when joining the firm originally. I worked for a notoriously difficult Navy client in San Diego, CA in PMW (program office) 120 but left with a bad taste in my mouth from my treatment by my own internal team as well. You do not get a choice in determining which program office or team you are placed in. If you are not assigned to a team outright you will be placed on the “bench” for a maximum of one month while they look for opportunities for you and will be forced to resign if there are no open billets. This also applies when your contract ends with your client. If you have the unfortunate luck to have a client-facing role you will be in tricky territory from the beginning - most of the government clients are absolutely miserable people to work with. They are extremely demanding, condescending, stuck in their bureaucratic old ways, do not know how to communicate effectively and will demean you behind your back any chance they get. You should expect ZERO support from your Booz Allen management and leadership when you face these challenges with your client. The company only cares about keeping the client happy often at your expense. This is something a colleague had brought up during a team meeting to management in my first week on the job and I wish I had listened at the time. Of course leadership pays lip service during all internal meetings and pretends to care about their employees and advocating for the company values but it’s all crap. My team was a revolving door and I was the last person standing that was relatively new to the firm. Myself as well as some others in my team (whom are all gone) asked management for guidance and support and a path to promotion but were met with outright hostility during our annual reviews. Other program offices were the same according to stories I heard from the many people who have resigned. You will be assigned a so-called “career manager” which is nothing more than a glorified supervisor whom will do little to nothing to provide you training or real support with clients. Peer reviews are discouraged and there is very much a “sink or swim” mentality. Expect to be cutthroat in your dealings with others and play office politics to the extreme OR stay with the company for 5+ years to get promoted to the level that you want. Working for Booz allows no creativity in your approach to your daily work and you will be expected to fully conform to client and firm demands day in and day out. If you are client facing you will be expected to report to the government on site location whenever your client demands you to, with no exception. If you are located in San Diego you will be expected to report to NAVWAR in downtown San Diego which is a run down and rat-infested WW1 facility with claustrophobic cubicles for contractors. Contractors are not even allowed to park on site. Lastly, the pay at Booz Allen is shockingly low compared to the other big 3 and even top 10 firms in the country. Additionally, I did not see any others receive bonuses and the annual merit increase was below the national average for many. For a firm this large and profitable the health benefits were disappointing and I found myself spending a lot out of pocket for my health care. Most other employees I had confidential conversations with throughout my tenure were also unhappy with their experience at the firm and were actively looking for other jobs with better pay and a better working environment. Save yourself the trouble and work at the many other consulting firms out there where you will be paid what you deserve and will be supported."

215,Booz Allen Hamilton,Slow Growth and Functional Stovepiping,2022-01-29,3.0,Senior Consultant,"Booz Allen Hamilton does a good job of providing their employees with some tools to help them succeed in client engagements; a faster computer, networking connections to more experienced professionals, and even while working for government, insulates the employees somewhat from unnecessary regulation and trainings: You have more flexible working hours than your government colleagues.","Booz Allen Hamilton is famously a ""sink or swim"" organization. Their business model is billable hours, so its no surprise that they try to put you in front of client as soon as possible, even if that means you are undertrained, or alone. It also means that you oftentimes don't get to choose the clients or work you want, as your managers will have the role of keeping ""billets"" filled, and your interests don't make the business money. The facilities in which you work are often run-down government buildings with poor IT infrastructure, and clients who are themselves government bureaucrats often espouse an obstinate opinion on how things should be done. Creativity and ambition are consequently not rewarded half as much as conformity and obedience."

Booz Allen takes career growth seriously and offers many trainings and money for tuition. 95% of my coworkers have been fantastic and my bosses have always prioritized me as a human being over just another cog in the machine. I had terrible Covid in 2021 and everyone at the firm from top to bottom was extremely supportive and worked with me to get me back to work on my own speed. Couldn’t have asked for a better job while having pretty bad Covid.,"Experience with leadership and coworkers and work life balance can depend on the projects you’re on.

358,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Do not believe the hype, it's more Machiavellian",2021-12-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"•The CEO seems to genuinely care about company and his employees versus the previous CEO only caring about having a legacy. 
•COVID response went well. Most people were already semi-remote since they have hoteling 
•Being a government contractor makes it a fairly stable market for employment.
•A staffing agency pretending to be a consulting firm. By augmenting the government staff, the only asset is the employees so the benefits are good. 
•By not manufacturing or providing anything of significance to the DoD, the job is a lot easier than the traditional DoD contractor. 
•Does not perform traditional consulting services so, it is less cutthroat. They do like to refer to Booz Allen as the “firm” with such pretentious.
•To stay ahead of competitors, Booz Allen is continuously scanning for the next thing. Regardless of your own ambition, you can get exposure to a number of different areas and ideas. Whether you will be to apply is highly unlikely. You’ll know the buzzwords and will need use them since your managers will be using them. Don’t worry, they won’t really know what they mean or how it is to be applied either. 
•By working as part of the government staff, the work demands are very diminish compared to other DoD contractors. It really allows for a lot of flexibility such as going back to school, starting a side hustle, being an involved parent, realizing your tax dollars being wasted, pondering how did that person get promoted, etc.
•Very Niche market. Only certain areas of knowledge can be gained when supporting the government. Most of what you’ll learn will only be relevant when working for the government. 
•If you are looking to get a government position, Booz Allen is a lot easier path in getting into those positions than the US job boards.
•As long as you don’t have a dedicated seat on the client site, you have a lot of flexibility as long as you get your deliverables done. If you do have a seat, you can only hope to have a good client because you’ll be sitting next to rats. Figuratively, metaphorically, and literally
•Overall, it is an easy job. As long as you are willing to take the abuse of clients and know your only road to promotion is through attrition or kiss up to the right people.","•Two things to keep in mind: Technical skills are not required or very little is required. Optics means everything. Optics is referred to in Booz Allen speak as “shaping”, “booz allen fit”, “likeability”, and “managing up”. Your persona will need to mimic Smithers from “The Simpsons”, Dwight from “the Office”. This is especially true for any non-engineering type roles i.e. Program/Acq Mgmt, Cost Estimate, Data Science (yes this isn’t what is advertised), BFM, etc. 
•Client relationships are more important than your employment. Sr. Associates and above would rather see you leave Booz Allen than lose the client. Basically, the clients can treat you as they may as long as it is legal. Yes, there is a high turnover. Most of worse clients are former Booz Allen.
•Your all-round experience at Booz Allen will be determined by your client and Job manager. Your Career Manager may not be much better because they will pawn you off to the Job Manager. 
•If the client, Job Manager, Career, or Senior Associate do not care for your personality (yes, it is a big deal), you will be considered “not Client/Booz Allen fit”. Your future will be either a PIP, Lack of Work, or ignored all together. You can also wait 2-3 years. By then most people will have left and overnight you’ll now become invaluable.
•If you’ve spent any time with a DoD Contractor such as NG, Lockheed, Raytheon, etc. Two years at these employers is equal to 25 years at Booz Allen.
•The government and Booz Allen are really behind on the most fundamental levels to include the technology. Do you know DOS? 
•Management and client will use all of the buzz words. Do not trust or assume they understand what they are saying or talking about.
•Unlike the CEO, most of the management is focused on “Managing Up and Kicking Down”. There are very few leaders in the management chain between the Principal and Lead Associate levels. Most of the Lead Associates and Senior Associates are not very knowledge in their area of expertise.
•Any of your ideas is up for grabs by your clients and leadership. They will take the credit because it was through their great leadership skills of walking around, ignoring you, saying “I’m working a proposal”, and kissing up to those above led you to do great things. Enter Data Science.
•Here is what to expect: Engineering – BAH does not manufacture or build anything. If you want read and write reports. This is your gig. Cyber – Big Push by the clients. You might get lucky and do something useful. Contracts/Install Support – A cog in the wheel of paper work. PM/Acq Mgmt: A glorified Executive Admin that manages a client’s calendar and updates PowerPoint slides. No PM skills gained or needed. Cost/BFM/Data Science – Learn Pivot Tables, watch your team turn over every 1.5 years, and most importantly flatter your leadership. Poof.. you’re Principal or Senior Associate.
•Career Progression: Consultant to Sr Consultant takes 1 to 1.5 years – Time card approvers hate having to authorize your overtime; Sr. Consultant to Associate takes 3 to 4 years – still don’t know much but you’ve successful faked someone in believing you know something by now; Associate to Ld Associate takes 5 to 7 – wow you are still around so Sr. Associate needs you to manage their team while they work to get promoted; Ld Associate to Sr. Associate takes 10+ years – which client and Principal did you sell your soul to or make look good; Sr. Associate to Principal takes TBD – The Principal you sold your soul to either got promoted to VP, retired, or clients are growing your capability. You might get lucky like Cyber or Data Science."

3. Interesting work","Just one major one - Defense Contractors bid against each other. Often the only differentiator between bidders to the government is price. This is where you hear that the stereotype that everything in the military was built by the lowest bidder - so yeah. When they bid the absolute lowest they can in order to win the contract, there is very little overhead available for raises.

Their internal IT is less demanding and competitive than client facing teams. For people tired jumping from contract to contact, it's relatively stable in comparison.","Its Information Services team is highly inefficient and are behind in their frameworks and methodologies. Lots of the managers and directors have been there for decades. Hard to bring in meaningful changes. 

When it comes to employee appreciation, it's always just lip service from the management. It's sad to see some good team members leaving because of that.

Had the honor to work with a few inspiring leaders. Unfortunately they all left because of office politics. Information Services team now have a lot of incompetent middle managers at Sr. Associate and director level. Lots of micromanagement.

Booz responded to Covid very well and continues to offer impressive benefits to staff. There is a lot of opportunity for computer science, data analytics, engineering, cybersecurity, and other data/IT work.","The firm pays well but less than competitors for junior staff. Middle management is not overly-skilled in people management and decisions are made behind closed doors regarding a person's future (i.e. raises and promotions) that one cannot participate in. Upper management has great ideas for people management but it isn't translated down to middle management.

While Booz is not directly responsible, the federal govt can be incredible slow and tedious. You and your team may have wonderful ideas, but depending on the client, those ideas may not be viable or may take a while to implement."

Claims of diversity and inclusion only apply to some populations, and prejudices and mishandling of the needs of other populations are downright in violation of the EOA/EEOC.

In my 7 year tenure (2.5 as an intern, nearly 5 as full-time), I have yet to fully understand why this process is so overly complicated for no reason. Additionally, you have to be your best advocate for anything you'd like. I thought leadership would be a bit better in certain advocacy, but I don't think that's the case...or rather, that it's a consistent case. Your career manager and admin team alignment can either make your experience grand...or not.

When I say leadership, I'm not referring to the C-suite, but I'm referring to the admin teams led by ""middle-upper"" management (Lead Associates, Senior Associates, Principals)"

420,Booz Allen Hamilton,TERRIBLE PLACE TO WORK; NO STABILITY,2021-12-13,1.0,Machine Learning Engineer,At least there's variety in my work. If you want to be part of Kafaesque endless cycle of pointless bureaucratic nightmares and develop a new shiny algorithm for managers to smash with a hammer with until they're bored of it then BAH fits the bill.,"You constantly are pressured and need to look for billable work, even though you're expected to not be paid for your time doing it (interview or writing RFPs). Right now it's a week before my Christmas vacation and I have 4 days left in this year before I go away and I'm constantly told to meet my billable target of 88 hours and hounded about it each day. When you are given billable hours, it's either for a project you hate or for something you wanted but hours are limited and clients keep scope-creeping when they detect any signal of life in you. Most project leads are sexist, ill-equipped to handle issues and enormously corrupt- favoring their ""army"" buddies and spending enormous amounts on bribing clients. I'm constantly working 12 hours for the past six months, while others get paid twice my salary to once in a while check their phone or harass you about how ""liberals are ruining America"". The few engineers that are competent there, have to compete in a constant death match to get billable hours and there's very little camaraderie. Clients projects often will set random immediate impossible deadlines, then once you have finished to their specifications, they won't even view it or they'll complain that you used an ugly color on your api model interface- when you spent hours not sleeping to create a complex AI model and the interface wasn't even in scope. Booz Alllen Internal investments are often disorganized and poorly funded, and have the same ideas repeated each time because no one has enough time to ramp up on them. Don't expect to be respected or treated like a human if you work here, because to BAH you're just menial wage servant with no outside family or other demands besides work."

If your starting salary is low, you'll be hard-pressed to ""catch up"" to industry standards with just annual raises. The firm can feel very ""little fish, big pond."" No matter how great the firm is as a whole, your experience on your team is truly what your employee experience will be (e.g., if your team awards and expects working after hours, you will most likely experience working after hours; if your team awards balance and only working core hours, you will most likely experience balance)."

CEO: It seems like Horacio thinks of all our employees when decisions are made, which is nearly impossible with ~28k employees. He makes time to attend different meetings and events that aren't ""mission critical"" such as business resource group activities, pride month, women's appreciation month events, etc. Many CEOs (even of small companies) are not like this. It seems like he's always listening and engaged

Business Resource Groups
Education Benefits
Vision Benefits","The main issue that I continuously run into is that those above a certain level in the firm make their own rules. It's really difficult to put a process in place successfully when you have to govern senior management. I have heard ""I've always done it this way"" more times than I can count. Of course, this type of mentality trickles down and those that use their authority to skirt the rules typically have direct reports that do the same.

The facilitator for the ""live"" (virtual) New Hire Orientation session was really great! She seemed to really know her stuff, embodied the culture, and gave great answers or pointed us in the right direction for the best answers. (I just wish I had had her session earlier in the onboarding process)
- Great team members are the norm (and those that don't fit this culture eventually work their way out for the most part)
- Fairly / competitively compensated
- Great benefits!!
- Lots of resources to help you","- Almost TOO many resources and information out there to familiarize yourself with... it can be overwhelming
- If you are not staffed from day 1, your first few days with the firm can feel a little ambiguous in regards to how you should be spending your time
- A lot of points of contact in the recruiting/hiring/onboarding process made it a little confusing about who to actually go to for questions

Definitely a lack of diversity in the leadership space. Ultimately spending 2.5 years on the project I was staffed to only showed me that govt agencies can be very incompetent and wasteful, where BAH fails is allowing these agencies to continue to waste tax payer money, but instead BAH just sneaks in and gets those contracts where they just need to justify seats in a chair as opposed to providing quality consulting. No bonus structure if you're an Associate or below. I was told that I was performing at the top of my peers and got a 2.5% raise each year and was forced to live in one of the more expensive cities in America. When i asked to work remote, a number of BAH subcontractors were given the ability to work remote, I was told that I should simply request to roll off the project because the project wouldnt support it. during my job search after I rolled off I saw the same role that I was working offered through another subcontractor with more pay and the ability to work remote.

- It was a great opportunity to get a peek inside IARPA, which is where many new technologies that push the envelope are developed. 
- I got to learn about deep learning and neural networks, including Tensorflow and PyTorch, as well as pick up some skills in AWS cloud computing.
- I also really liked the manager and the team that I worked with on an internal R&D program. Unfortunately, that program lost funding after I was there only three months.","- I have just gone sideways in my career for the past year. I really wanted to work on a hands-on data science project and put a machine learning model into production, and I never got the opportunity because I got descoped from one program (where I was only allowed to talk about data science) and the other program lost funding after I was there for only three months.
- I guess this place works out for some people, but I just felt like I was lost in the shuffle. 
- You really are on your own if you get descoped from a program. You are told, you find your next job by networking. But how are you supposed to network when you get hired in during a pandemic when it's all remote work?
- When I applied for roles on other projects, I was too expensive for most projects or else lacked the right experience. There was much more interest in my resume outside of BAH than inside the company.
- It's crazy that BAH hires people but then makes them find a role once they are inside of the company. Like, you think you're going in for your first day of work, and it turns out that it's not your first day of work, but instead just a new phase of your job search."

- Chance to work with lots of technologies
- Chance to work on seemingly important federal projects for your country
- Good place for those with no experience

Not a pro/con: Your mileage will vary based on the project you work on. Booz Allen has hundreds (or thousands) of contracts spread across the federal government. It's more like thousands of companies in one than a single uniform unit.","- They appear to hire almost anyone, lots of warm bodies. This is good if you need experience, this is bad if you're a good engineer because you'll end up pulling dead weight on your project.
- Too much corporate cheerleading and propaganda. The two-day new hire intro is lots of drinking Kool-Aid and pretty thin on important details like benefits etc. It could be condensed into one day with how pointless the cheerleading is. Tons of Booz Allen spam to your inbox like ""how booz allen is embodying its values in the month of may"". Does someone get paid to write that spam?
- The structure of Booz Allen feels very nebulous, poor organization. For instance, they have tons of subdomains that you go to do various tasks like setting up a printer, contact helpdesk, etc.. yet they don't have a centralized area where you can see all the subdomains. You are just expected to learn/know. Very disorganized
- Too many meetings, as a developer expect to spend 5-10 hours a week in meetings.
- PTO policy is bad, 15 days per year, woof, get with the times. If the project I was on was managed better and Booz Allen had better PTO I might have stayed.
- My project was a trainwreck. Team Lead was in over his head. The organization was terrible. Lots of subject line only Jira tasks with no info. No planning. Also, the guy just didn't do anything. Very bad for morale when you see that coming from your lead.

It's highly unlikely I would work at Booz Allen again."

- Work culture is non-judgemental and treats everyone like adults
- Your initial base pay will be good. 
- Work life balance is fantastic 
- There is a lot of access to technical training programs (on your own time)
 - Great tuition reimbursement plans for those who want to continue their education.
- Well recognized name brand firm that will help your career.
- It's a cushy place to be, and there's nothing wrong with that or wanting that.","The work you do a Booz is boring, meaningless, and unfulfilling. Even if you're on a ""Cadillac"" contract like I was, most of what you do are box-checking services for government employees who will almost currently never use your products after its delivered. Expect to spend a year or more on a project and have nothing tangible to show for it by the end, or expect to deliver something that could have taken three weeks. 

- Salary adjustment will never exceed 3.5% unless promoted. 
- You will need to spend years here to get promoted, when you could have left to boost your earnings
 - Healthcare plans are garbage
- Staff-aug work means you're not working for Booz, and your also not a Fed. It's a terribly unfulfilling in-between state.
- It seems some people are constantly on fire, and others are at the spa--which speaks to staffing mismanagement

People also generally care about the missions. Booz focuses mostly on military and defense clients. So if you’re interested in Air Force, Navy work, this is a great place to gain exposure to it","Even though people are generally pretty nice and try to be helpful, it can be clicky. Also your career manager is suppose to help you with throughout your career at Booz Allen but sometimes that person is not be as helpful as they could be (I suppose it depends on who you get). Your career manager takes in feedback from your current project (manager and co workers), which influences your promotions, reviews. I sometimes found it frustrating getting feedback from a third party (my career manager) who doesn’t work with me, but I know this is a common structure in consulting. Like at most places, the people can make a huge difference on your experience and in consulting you often work with a range of people. But it’s nice when you feel like your leaders care and support your growth. I didn’t feel this as much from my leaders."
865,Booz Allen Hamilton,“Capability Hires” beware!  The Tech Excellence program is NOT a job.,2021-06-24,1.0,Senior Consultant,"Pay, time off, and benefits are good but not great. Coworkers tend to be smart, capable, and dedicated. Depends on your project but contemporary tech, software, and tools are used.","Offered a Dream Job. Instead spent months on The Bench. I am disgusted that I could be offered employment after one 30-minute interview but never told there would be a second far more arduous search to find an actual project. 

My offer letter stated I’d be employed as a software developer supporting an intelligence agency. I was never offered that work. Instead I was told to take the first project I was offered regardless of its alignment with my skillset, career goals, or location and that if I didn’t like it I'd be allowed to look for something else after 9 months.   Oh and if I left the firm within 18 months I'd have to repay the training cost ($5K).  My experience wasn’t unique.   

I was hired through one of the Tech Excellence programs along with ~10 others. Our first month was a 4-week training course. A month after the course ended, 4 people had been assigned projects. The rest of us were instructed to apply to project openings on workday, i.e. find a job (wait what?). And our applications were for the most part completely ignored. BAH’s recruiters and hiring managers completely ignoring their coworker’s applications and messages is indefensible. 

If you don’t have an SCI clearance don’t bother trying to be a Data Scientist here.

Avoid the “Tech Excellence Programs”. They are a bait-and-switch. You’re a number they can use to bid on proposals."

This can be great for networking and there are many company events that you can attend to meet new people. Pre-covid my team had flexibility to work from home at least once a week. 

There are a lot of opportunities to work on different types of projects, especially if your background is in STEM. I've seen many people take advantage of all the opportunities and the resources that the company offers which can be very helpful when/if switching to a different company.

There's definitely a diverse group of people with various backgrounds, and the company culture overall was pretty good.","If you don't actively network and seek for new projects, the projects you end up working on may not be something that you're interested in. There's always some amount of pressure to start looking for new work once your current project comes to an end which can get annoying.

This could be for most companies, but the more you become engaged in different areas within your team and your projects, the more work you'll have to manage. The work you pick up never really goes away, so context switching and time management can become difficult if you're not careful.

I've noticed that the pay in general is not as competitive compared to other companies, and the salary seem to depend more on your background and the range can vary pretty widely even within the same level."

1123,Booz Allen Hamilton,Horrible Working Environment,2021-04-05,1.0,Data Scientist,"Large Recognizable Company
The Ability to get involved in different activities and programs
Great clubs and extra curricular activities","Horrendous working conditions: 15 of us were crammed into a room meant for 5 people for 8 hours a per day.
Awful Management: The main reason I quit, managers were not only toxic, but refused to train up junior employees and allow them to grow (when I brought this to their attention, they just said they were too busy to train me). Managers were consistently condescending, belittling, and petty.
When I brought these issues up the HR, they just made the problem worse.
Lack of opportunities: Good luck finding a data science project without a high level security clearance. 
IT COST ME OVER 10000 BUCKS JUST TO QUIT!!! Company gives you flex dollars. The money deceptively isn't yours. If you spend Flex Dollars and quit within 2 years, then you have to pay back everything. About $6000 flex dollars were spent voluntarily, these I'm not angry about. However, my manager forced me to use flex dollars for training and certifications. My managers forced me to spend 4000 dollars that weren't mine, to take courses and get certifications I was not too keen on getting. Essentially, they forced me to be indebted to the company, and work it off, very very scummy practices. 
Complete lack of recognition: I won an entire competition on behalf of BAH, and the VP didn't even congratulate me by name, or simply say thank you for going out of my way to bolster the image of the company. 
Disgustingly Low Pay: For a data scientist, I was easily able to get 20% more than I was making at BAH. They pay you like garbage, far below what you're worth with pitiful raises each year (mine wasn't even 1%).
In short: work somewhere else. The prestigious title isn't worth your time or dignity."

1211,Booz Allen Hamilton,Excellent work/life balance that I've experienced so far. The work and people are good.  The R&D structure is silly.,2021-02-10,5.0,Lead Data Scientist,"- Where traditional IT consulting firms tend to BS a lot of the math, Booz has a lot of technical experts and government subject matter experts. In previous firms, I've seen statisticians leave because they were told to vet invalid models. There seems to be emphasis on doing it right here on most of the projects that I've worked on.
- Training. Training. Training. They do a fantastic job of finding opportunities for you to grow. After a few years, I think you get like... 7k per year to allocate towards certs, tuition, etc. - there are some caveats if you leave within 2 years, so keep that in mind.
- Like a lot of consulting jobs, placement on the right admin team will make or break the experience. I found a wonderful team that really cares about growing me, and the people are generally pretty friendly. If you want to do technical work, the SIG is where you want your offer to come from. If you really care about Aerospace/National Security/etc. or a specific domain, you'll want to be placed in a group in that sector.
- Great work/life balance because federal consulting is their bread and butter. If you're trying to focus on work-life balance and would rather avoid non-stop travel, this is a great place for you. You're also not forced to do any extracurricular activities a la Deloitte and can just blend in the background if that is your flavor. Promotions won't be as quick, but you can treat it like a job.","- Not really a con for most, but I've found that because I was pushed into dashboarding roles for so much of my career (prior), I got stuck on more dashboarding efforts here than data science/ML. Transitioning to more technical roles takes a lot of effort on your own time. AI/ML is really competitive right now, so I can't fault them too much.
- Compared to some other consulting gigs in the DC area, pay is ever-so-slightly below average. I was able to negotiate, but some of my more qualified coworkers that were hired out of comp sci were making under 80k after 2-4 years. 
- Lots of rework and waste from an R&D perspective - see advice to management."

1287,Booz Allen Hamilton,Good company,2021-02-09,4.0,Team Lead,Good benefits - leave and 401 are fair. Company encourages diversity hiring and support.,Company is actually geared toward developing younger talent (at lower salaries) and working them through the years to more senior roles. Understandable but for middle aged or older workers there is not really much of a path beyond whatever you hire on as. Interview process is chaotic at job fairs. Cannot know what the client will be like - some are truly horrible and cause 100% turnover of personnel in a year. Not Really BAH fault but it can be an unpleasant surprise.

1343,Booz Allen Hamilton,90% great place to work,2021-01-21,4.0,Lead Associate,"Pay and benefits are usually decent, especially if you're a more recent hire. The quality of your coworkers is much higher than at any other place I've worked- folks are smart, creative and tend to be go-getters who will generally tell it to you straight. Variety of work and opportunities for growth in terms of training and learning communities are unparalleled. In general the best place I've ever worked, and the fact that you can fairly easily rotate between projects keeps work seeming fresh. Also BAH is at the forefront of some of the industries of the future, especially AI.","Salaries for longer-tenured employees, at least at Associate/Lead Associate levels, are often somewhat below market, leading to newer employees being better compensated than those who have put time in and proven themselves. The criteria for advancement can sometimes seem kind of vague/arbitrary. If you're looking for a more structured environment or for requirements/tasks to be fully spelled out for you, you're going to struggle. Overwhelmingly one-sided political culture, which is openly embraced or even pushed by leadership, can make those who don't agree with the progressive cause de jour feel isolated and like they can't speak up out of fear(limiting diversity of thought). TBH I'm nervous even writing this."

1347,Booz Allen Hamilton,Steady work in DoD landscape,2021-01-28,4.0,Organizational Change Consultant,"The company is really leaning into the current social inequities and seems to be planning to make any necessary adjustments. The DoD market is continually needing adjustments, and therefore the work is steady and each project is unique. The company additionally has taken it upon themselves to not let anyone go unless absolutely necessary. There is a lot of available training and potential to shift to new work if interested. The 401k match is 6%, however, you need to stay through the end of the year to receive that match.","The federal workspace makes for a very slow moving and change resistant client. Pay is somewhat linked to available contracts, and pay is lower than other firms due to overhead as a publicly owned company. Anyone under senior associate does not receive a bonus. Associate level is barely considered management level and responsibilities are often closely guarded by lead associates who are power hungry."

1372,Booz Allen Hamilton,Really Enjoy Working at BAH,2021-01-20,4.0,Software Engineer,"I like being able to move between contracts. It is like starting work at a new job but with the same points of contact throughout the BAH network.

The people there I've worked with have 95% of the time been awesome! Lots of talent and feels like a really fresh environment. I was led to believe Booz used to be pretty stiff. 

I got a promotion, and two raises in the 1.6 years I worked there. I also got 2 awards with bonuses attached. They were small like 800 apiece before taxes. But it was nice to feel like my work was being recognized. 

I've been working here throughout COVID-19. They handled it awesomely! They pretty quickly moved to remote work as much as possible (This is a big feat considering our main client is the Government). They promised when it all began to not start terminating anyone for like 6 months at the very least and they set a large sum of money to the side to ensure they could keep people employed.

The best part I think is that they won't let you go between contracts. They keep you on the bench paid while you are looking for new work. I can see the advantage to both parties here. Lower cost in recruiting and retain people you've already vetted to have experience!","Government work sometimes is outdated and there can be a lot of red tape that restricts delivering better products. This isn't BAH's fault just a downfall of working with the Government.

Tech stacks can be dated. I got worried when on the bench I would get stuck doing something that doesn't align with what I have in mind professionally.

I feel vacation could be a bit longer coming in? Could also be a bit more transparency on raises. I often tried to discern this information I feel I am being underpaid but I don't really feel like I have any avenues to address it. My career manager is probably the only one at the company I am not the happiest with. Feel like he isn't the ally he is supposed to be? My understanding is he is supposed to advocate for me and outline what I need to be doing to ensure career progression. This includes salary increases. I've got okay raises but I got stiffed on an agreement I made before I got hired to give me a 5k raise after 6 months. He didn't advocate for me."

1380,Booz Allen Hamilton,Solid,2021-01-21,4.0,Senior Lead Technologist,"Booz Allen takes good care of its employees. I've seen them do what they can to accommodate people when issues around benefits come up.  There is generally strong camaraderie between colleagues. It's less cut throat than some consulting firms. Part of the reason may be the less-rigid tracking of sales credit. Make no mistake, they know the role you played and how many dollars were involved, but they don't dole out percentages and officially track it. The diversity is also wonderful! I have really enjoyed the effort put into diversity, and I notice the difference when I look around at the other contractor firms when on client site.","General Contractors thrive here (e.g., General Management Consultants), even in the highly technical fields. The most important thing is that you are a business administrator. You don't have to have skills and experience in what you're selling/administering. Booz Allen tried to create a technical track, but nobody in it get's promoted into the bonus pool even in their technical capabilities and client impact is remarkable. Of course, they also created a special unit, the Strategic Innovation Group (SIG), that is supposed to house the technical expertise of the firm. That is part of what prevented the technical track from working."

1487,Booz Allen Hamilton,"If you're gonna be used, get paid",2020-12-09,4.0,Senior Consultant,Pros: Significant- BAH was able to absorb onsite contract losses due to COVID-19 and find other work for affected employees. That's nothing to sneeze at with all the nationwide layoffs. Education benefits - use them strategically and don't leave $ on the table. Take advantage of the Employee Assistance Program to get the free therapy and anti-anxiety meds you'll need. Some positions are still a refuge for 2010's style active alcoholics and 'looks good on paper' candidates. Park your butt here while you get sober and sort your life out if you can. HR screening is lackluster at best. If you have a TS/SCI full poly you can murder a hobo and still get a job.,"You will drop dead in your current contract before they ever move you to another project. There is about 10% mobility within the firm. (Unless you are incompetent - then managers will pass you around until dealing with you becomes unavoidable.) Once you are hired, it is preferred to fire you and hire a new replacement rather than promote you within the firm - strange though it may sound. Don't waste your time fighting that fight - ask existing employees for the skinny. If you take advantage of education benefits, you owe the firm one year of service after completing otherwise you have to pay that money back, so plan accordingly. Get in, get what you need, get out and move on. BAH will low ball you on all salary negotiations, so get the experience you need and move to a SDB to make $ and then jump back to BAH at a higher level. The initial HR intake interviewers are all worthless subcontractors. Don't worry about researching their questions - they're just as clueless as the average job seeker. Check the right boxes and you will advance. *But* confirm that you are applying for a fully, funded awarded contract. Protect yourself. If you apply for any job more than 72 hours after it's been opened...good luck. Managers have less than 30 seconds to screen your resume in a 80 page .pdf compiled resume file - so make yours pop. If you think you have a shot, network within the firm - that's *a* road to success. If not, network outside and open your options. (I have never seen internal networking pay off FWIW.) It's the 21st century: straight white people need not apply. (Sorry guys/gals not my rules. ) Plan accordingly - unless you have a TS/SCI full scope poly - then you can murder a hobo and still get a job. Don't get emotionally invested - view BAH as your rebound relationship."

Although many jobs are oriented toward information technology, cyber security, and US defense systems, there are also engagements focused upon science and engineering development, project management, political and business analysis, marketing, change management, and many other professional skill sets. Pay and benefits are competitive. Job security is generally high but is dependent upon the employee's technical skills, ability to obtain and retain clients, and people skills. Employees are largely in control of their own career and job prospects within the firm.","Not a good place to work for employees who need to be told what to do, who cannot work in a team, who have difficulty with communications and professional relationships, or who are inflexible in their tasking or work environment.

Bunch of “boozers” with zero experience outside of Booz Allen making decisions. Don’t even give employees the Friday of thanksgiving off even though clients are not working (basically fraud because we still billing to clients on federal holiday).

I have an excellent healthcare policy, along with other good benefits, and I have had consistent (and generous) yearly raises. Work life balance is great, and there is so much opportunity to grow with this company. But this year they have truly won my loyalty with how they have handled the COVID 19 crisis and they have really proven that they look after their people. They did not hesitate to move all employees to remote work when it became obvious that we needed a shutdown, and they are in no hurry to push us back into the office, maintaining a people first approach that things are working fine remotely, so why put people at risk? The only people back are ones whose contracts require them to be at a client site, and Booz is working with them to be sure they are maintaining acceptable standards. I have never at any point felt that my job was at risk during this crisis, and we have been assured along the way that we not only are NOT going to have layoffs, but they are still actively hiring. While some of the government contract work we do is not ""sexy,"" it sure is reliable, and I have been so grateful for that this year. I have seen many fellow employees go to failing startups in recent years only to end up back at Booz. Also, Booz has a culture of standing behind its minority and LGBTQ employees providing additional support resources. They also provide assistance for employees facing life challenges and have also improved Maternity leave in recent years, which from my understanding was a previous deficiency. This is truly a company trying to grow and constantly improve. You will have opportunities here if you pursue them.",The only con I have is that they only match Retirement accounts once a year in January and you must have been employed until December 31st to get the match

A lot of my peers and direct managers and job leaders were really nice people who definitely cared about you.,"This is a staffing firm that very much cares about getting people in seats. As you move up the leadership chain you can see where they care about the business more than the people, which of course happens at a lot of places but normally behind closed doors in the C suite. My career manager was a senior associate who pushed back on a few things that would’ve helped me but hurt the business. Also the pay is at the low end of the scale for tech. My total comp doubled by moving to a tech company."

My manager at the time expected some email and reports from me on Sunday nights at 9:30 PM or on Saturday mornings before 9:00 AM.
1706,Booz Allen Hamilton,Love working at Booz Allen,2020-08-27,5.0,Consultant,Work-life balance is a big positive.,The size of the company sometimes leaves you feeling unguided.

Good benefits
Enough contracts to keep employees working when a contract ends","Radical left organization which sends employees ""social equity"" emails which talk about racist and sexist terms like ""male privilege"" and ""white privilege"". They claim to be ""inclusive"" but instead they create a hostile work environment for white employees trying to put guilt on them with their ""social equity glossary"".

They also support an openly Marxist organization like BLM which participates in looting, arson, and violence against those they oppose. They also support criminals who resist arrest, often violently as seen in videos."

 - Love the Career Manager setup.
 - Good benefits.
 - Flexible work schedule (depends on contract)
 - Everyone (like, EVERYONE) is genuinely nice. It's kind of weird how nice people are. 
 - You can cold email anyone in the firm and ask for a coffee date and they'll be more than happy to talk to you about your career goals.  
 - Great work/life balance (again, depends on contract)
 - They've handled COVID amazingly. Vowed not to lay anyone off for at least 6 months, even if the employee was unbillable, they covered the salary. Have been great in allowing flexible work schedules during quarantine, and 90-95% of staff are remote as of August and they're not forcing us to go into the office unless it's actually necessary for our contract.","- I've heard the pay isn't as good as the other big gov consulting firms, but we have a way better work/life balance."
1711,Booz Allen Hamilton,Meh,2020-09-04,3.0,Senior Consultant,They took a chance with me and were upfront about a decrease in my salary when moving from my current job. A lot of talented and professional people work for them. Big company with plenty of opportunities for lateral movement.,"CAVEAT: My experience with Booz was not a typica corporate Booz or regular consulting Booz experience. 

Management was very customer focus and not too employee focused. This lead to concessions made on behalf of the client's interests which weren't all that beneficial to the workers. There are also a lot of unprofessional and untalented people who didn't deserve the job where I was hired. However, these undeserving individuals made enough of a commotion to be an HR nightmare that management just put up with them for the sake of appeasement and appearance. It negatively affected the morale of the employees greatly."

Countless examples of losing a contract and team pulling together to place 95% or more staff onto other contracts or carry them on overhead until they can be placed. With COVID, the CEO announced no one would lose their job due to COVID and pledged $1M towards better health care, child care, people on overhead, etc while the economy recovered.","As with any large company, there are pockets of awesome and other pockets of mediocrity. Tough if not impossible to tell from the outside, but either ask lots of questions, know someone inside (not in the hiring chain) or join and reassess your position in 6months.

I sat in orientation getting the usual pitch about corporate values. In my head, yeah, right...but in my experience, they actually practice what they preach.
No complaints about any one there.
On the corp level, they took early action to assure people that they still had jobs during the current pandemic crisis. Many other companies took a less than charitable view of the whole thing.
The benefits are there and available to you, but in all honesty they're mediocre at best.","This gets lengthy as there were several complicated situations. 
In spite of management denials, this is a contract house, you are a contract employee and will remain that way until you lose your funding or find another contract. Management repeatedly denied this, saying you're a full time salaried employee. Which you are as long as you have a charge number.
The company holidays match up with gov holidays and nothing more. You will NOT have Christmas Eve, New Years Eve or even the Friday after Thanksgiving off unless you use your vacation. I've never run into that one before.

The job that I was in as well as most others involves working with/at the local DoD installations, namely TARDEC or Selfridge. Not bad places to work if you can stomach working with government employees. Pretty much, anything and everything you've heard is true....

As I said, I had zero problems with local management. That's not the case with these from on high. Those folks came across as nothing more than used car salesmen, and I didn't trust anything they said."

Moreover, I was pushed out of the contract and replaced by someone with fewer qualifications. My belief is that this was done solely to cut budgets and increase manager bonuses. I have since left, however, even in a COVID-19 environment, they are making me pay back almost $2000 for a course I completed more than 15 months ago by forcing arbitrary language in their company policies to avoid paying full cost for a course.

1892,Booz Allen Hamilton,A company on the move,2020-03-12,5.0,Brand Manager,"I have been with Booz Allen for more than 10 years and have seen the company go through amazing changes during this time. Many of the reviews from former colleagues talk about how much the company has declined since it went public a few years ago. But even employees who left the firm only a few years ago would not recognize it today. Booz Allen is very much on the move, overcoming its transitional pains, rebuilding a once-again great culture, and shifting its strategy from staff augmentation to more strategic work with an emphasis on emerging tech. This is a place to go for self starters who want to have more control over their career path, enjoy endless learning opportunities, and a strong work-life balance.  The people are amazing and mentoring. The work is of national significance to the country and you can truly make an impact.","The compensation and benefits—while good—are not what you will find at other large consulting firms. If money is more important than work-life balance, this may not be the place for you. Also, government work is not for everyone; it's a calling to help serve and protect citizens and warfighters but it's not always glitzy and exciting."

It's a breath of fresh air in the often mercenary, profiteering management consulting industry.","Compensation is low, no bonuses below the Senior Associate level, and depending on which account and office you're aligned to, you may have trouble finding the exact role you want. Also the compensation issue means that they have trouble attracting the top-level talent where they need it."
1894,Booz Allen Hamilton,Toxic culture,2020-04-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,This is a well known company.,"The firm has an overall toxic and demeaning culture.  Turnover in my department was  extremely high.  Management only pays lip service to company core values.  Many leaders are solely concerned with “managing up” via brown-nosing and manipulation, rather than supporting, empowering or developing their teams.  In a lengthy professional career, this was the worst experience I have ever had.   I could not get out fast enough!"

Instead of making an executive decision on how BAH would handle ""social distancing"" for its employees and protect their health, the organization continues to put many of its employees at risk by neither having them work from nor creating options like alternate work schedules.  The “telework” option now being discussed literally says things like employees must respond to emails within 30 minutes. It reads like the instructions that parents give their teenagers when they’re leaving them home alone. The lack of regard for employee health and disrespect in treating professionals like children fly in the face of everything you would expect from an employer."

I won't go as far as saying that the firm didn't care about what went on at the client site or about their employees, but I will say that the priority was always to show up and bill.

- If the intention was to transition from ""consulting firm"" to ""butts-in-seats"" chop shop, it succeeded admirably. 
- The bottom line is now all about quarterly earnings, not people. 
- More and more contracts are ""administrative services"" in nature and less about innovation/solutions (ie. real, actual ""consulting""). This has opened the door to some really toxic and hostile work environments and the ""client is always right"" attitude allows so many good people to suffer under some very nasty clients. 
- Little to no opportunity to move to other projects outside of the Wash DC. area.    - Loyalty is not valued they way it used to be.

There are a lot of different contracts and positions with the company, so if you want a change you wouldn’t have to leave the job, but transition to another contract. They have lots of training opportunities, too.","They’re constantly encouraging you to be involved in the company. This is great for climbing the ladder within the company, but if you have no interest in that, it’ll get a little annoying."

1983,Booz Allen Hamilton,Experience varies from team to team,2019-11-25,3.0,Senior Consultant,"Some flexibility, depending on your leadership and contract. Some people on my team work from home often. The people who work here are pretty fantastic, smart, and fun to be around.","Salaries are not competitive as compared to other contracting firms. Most of my team at the senior consultant level make less than I made in a much lower COLA. In San Diego, expect low wages! Additionally, experience of working varies from project to project, and team to team. My first project was great, and now I’m on a project with a petty team leader who made it clear from the beginning he did not want to be my manager. Also, the San Diego office is all open workspace and it’s weird and not conducive to working. There isn’t enough space to work  (people often working on couches, in kitchen) and it just has the overall vibe of a library."

I have never been happier with a company that I have worked for than I am with Booz Allen Hamilton.",In my time with BAH I have not come across any cons.

Depending on where you are aligned, leadership and career opportunity can be tremendous.","The ""Employee Value Proposition"" is a major area of focus, program development, and career models... if only it was put into practice.  The disconnect between the beautifully articulated vision of a career at Booz Allen and the actual ability to experience that vision is vast, which makes it all the more demoralizing to hear about and exhausting to try to realize."
1989,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great Opportunities,2019-11-21,4.0,Consultant,There are a lot of opportunities to grow and expand your skill set if you show interest.,Depending on which project you work on the tech may be outdated.
1990,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great Company,2019-11-21,4.0,Senior Associate,The most impressive aspect of Booz Allen has been the company's ability to maintain a great culture and highly intelligent and capable people in an extremely competitive market that typically rewards lowest cost.,You are sometimes more limited with respect to career growth if you are outside of the DC area
1991,Booz Allen Hamilton,Good ole boys club,2019-12-10,1.0,Associate,Great name to have on your resume.,Experience is only there if you want to be in project management. Middle management runs the firm and senior leadership doesn’t seem to connect or be engaged with the employees or projects happening in the firm.

Company has assumption that those promoted will manipulate others to perform the work for them if they don't have the qualifications.

1996,Booz Allen Hamilton,Mostly governmental staff augmentation,2019-10-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Some of the people were excellent
-Some teams and managers were good and tried to take care of their team
-Working with government entities can be extremely frustrating, but also rewarding due to the scale of potential change","-The work is significantly more staff augmentation than actual consulting. Rarely does the work focus on solving a problem, it is mostly about occupying a seat for the government and shuffling whatever paper comes across your desk.
-Promotions and salaries are arbitrary, very political, and not merit-based. My only meaningful promotions and raises were given when I went out to another company and got a better offer and brought it back.
-Leadership is focused on sales, not developing people - they are very willing to let some sit in a role for years on the same contract, rather than try to maximize their value by aligning their skillset to the work
-Leadership maintains heavy control over the people they hire, even after the employee has moved on to another contract - people at Booz refer to this as leaders 'building their pyramid'.
-People who want to advance are required to work off-hours on contracts, often resulting in people working 100+ hour weeks for months with little chance of actually getting promoted."

I can barely afford to pay my rent and bills. Even when working way more than I should, working weekends, and holidays, working through illnesses, etc., I have not received a pay raise or promotion. There is no promotion structure. If you are looking to grow in this industry, please look elsewhere. I can only document 80-hours worked per pay period, even when I work closer to 100. I carry much more weight than what I am treated. Program Management and Senior Leadership do not care to help, and won't compromise to help you get to where you deserve to go."

Each day presents a challenge, we are not micromanaged and often given leadership responsibility. We are each responsible to drive hiring, present trends and, meet with Hiring Managers to educate them of the process and back up performance with metrics and coordinate large hiring events. You can expect to manage 60+ req's in the defense side, per Recruiter. You are generally recognized for your outstanding performance. If you can't handle working autonomously or are adverse to hard work and hiring goals, it is not the right place for you. Pay is excellent, we are paid WAY above what Glassdoor claims is the high end BUT you earn every penny. This is not the typical ""Recruiting job"". If you look at description for a Recruiting Lead, that is more what you should expect to be doing. Managing your clients within your ""Service Offering""  to make offers quickly and meet strict deadlines advising on best practice with a keen eye on compliance at ALL TIMES. Its truly a wonderful place to work. We work with purpose and know we are making a contribution to the betterment of society and the DoD.","Headcount drives promotions even if you exceed all hiring expectations. Promotion will come eventually, I believe, but it takes a lot of time and dedication to prove you are able to lead. You must be assigned a challenging task, like integration of a new system or a large contract and then perform well to be promoted past Senior level, into leadership track. You should expect to act as a Lead before you get that title. We don't all receive a recruiting bonus for hires in a quarter, etc. I think more can be done to recognize outstanding performance. We could have more contact with the decision makers, those that recognize top performance. Maybe a meeting once a year and invite those that consistently meet their goals and/or are on track for promotion. Lots of work."

2062,Booz Allen Hamilton,Booz Allen is a Criminal Organization that Steals from their Employees and Commits Federal Fraud,2019-09-28,1.0,Senior Lead Technologist,"No, do not work here.","Booz Allen steals from their employees and defrauds them. Booz Allen is a broker for the federal government and federal contractors. Their business model is to win contracts and then to advertise those jobs. The way Booz Allen steals from their employees is that they will assign a different level of service on each end of that transaction for a significant portion of their workforce.

So, for example, if an employee gets offered a job they will give you a different job than the one you accepted with more responsibilities and experience required, but at the original pay. Also, when you get another position in the company at a higher level they will tell you to wait for the promotion in their internal process to the end of the year. Meanwhile you are selling service at a higher level for a whole year. Then at the end of that year they will often decide not to give you a promotion to match the title and job you are already doing. This is company policy that your job rank and title on a contract does not need to match your rank in the internal system and corresponding pay.

In this way Booz Allen can pocket the difference in service levels, or provide the government with free labor and they can win more contracts by stealing and defrauding their employees.

It is no different than if the federal government said they want to buy gold and Booz Allen puts out a bid for gold. Somebody then sells Booz Allen gold, but Booz Allen only charges the government for silver and pay the vendor for silver. The government then gets gold at a low price. Likewise they can also charge the government for gold, but only pay the vendor for silver. But, if the vendor is a human being selling labor, instead of materials, there is little they can do to prosecute because of the lack of employee protections.

This is what they do with employees instead of materials. The only difference is that doing fraud like this cannot show up in any audit because nobody compares the job levels on the contract with those in the HR / pay system. Also, it may not be illegal under regulations, so it would be very difficult to prosecute independently, so they can get away with it. Also, since there is no law requiring an employment contract after 90 day or 6 month trial period, they can just say if you don't like getting scammed, then you can walk away.

They will try to pin this on individual managers, but it is company policy. They do not tie your rank to the rank on the contract. So, you can be a Tech Lead (level 4) on a contract, but could be a level 3, or even level 2, and technically nothing is stopping them from making you a level 1 in the HR system. This of course will determine your pay. Also, you won't show as being severely underpaid in any audit because they put the wrong rank in the HR system.

I think this is alarming for all individuals, but of course could be used to hide any discrimination based on race, or sex, in addition to just being used to scam employees and pad the wallets of the stockholders and management."

First of all, I was never able to get staffed on a project that I had interest in. It was always management finding something and almost forcing me to stay. The work and environment was not the best but was decent.  However everything changed when I let my management know that I was switching job to a competitor. They were mad that I was leaving and probably thought they wanted to take a revenge. Even before my last day of work, they terminated my clearance which made my clearance go into Loss of Jurisdiction (no clearance). Crazy thing was I didn't notice this until the first day at the new work; I was working in a secure facility without clearance for few days.
Since then, I haven't been able to get my clearance back and it was very hard for me to find a project due to missing clearances. 

This is very very unprofessional and the company is going downhill BIG TIME. Totally messed up my clearance and the career.

You can ask one manager how to do something and go to the next manager and it’s wrong. Extremely high turn over. People in positions that they shouldn’t be in. Was more knowledgeable than people that had been there for years. They also play favorites. They let certain people telework, while barely giving any hours to other people. When I left upper management told me I was making a mistake and that I was getting paid what I was worth at Booz, and the new company was over paying me, told me it was my fault I didn’t get monthly snapshots because I didn’t press the issue enough to my manager(which I told them I reminded them twice a month) and he said that wasn’t doing enough, that their benefits couldn’t match Booz Allen(which wasn’t true). Basically made me try to think I was stupid for trying to leave Booz Allen altogether.  There is no room for advancement here, there was even a senior consultant being used as a team lead when I was there. Management also promises bump ups but usually never delivers. My best advise is to never work for this office. I’m sure Booz Allen is a good company and has good offices. This is just not one of them. You will notice after a month or two of working here, that many people are unsatisfied and looking for a new job. Spent a good amount of time venting about working here to other employees and there are plenty that do the same. Good luck if you decide to take a job at this office."

No effort in growing or stressing professional (job-related) development for the weak and inexperienced hires.  Does not even attempt to tactically sell peripheral services, but rushes to take on responsibility from the client and push additional work to current employees.

They invest in you because they want to have the best talent out there, competitively speaking, which is also great for your personal growth (e.g. pay for your PMP from Georgetown, or your INCOSE if your an Engineer, etc.).  There's a lot of opportunity to be exposed to different projects if you are aggressive about that as well and you work with a lot of really talented folks.","Some of the brightest, most talented folks I've ever worked with jumped ship when we went public; or were let go because they were too expensive (and in my opinion, worth every penny).  There are some real corporate b-s'ers at the top and if you get stuck being managed by one of those who isn't great at their job, you'll get pigeonholed into your contract and it's tough to move up.  Also, if you get partnered with a career supervisor who isn't managing what you do day-to-day, it can be tough to move up since they don't know what you're working on, how you're performing, etc. directly. 

Also, there's a real culture there of going above and beyond and the work/life balance is really terrible.  Taking your laptop home and making it an appendage is a thing. It's tough to unplug and not have it be frowned upon.  There's a little too much of a competitive spirit around there."
2215,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great company and culture,2019-02-07,5.0,Associate,"The benefits are fantastic. Booz Allen matches your 401k contributions up to 6% of your salary.  The company culture is great and they really try to reach out to employees on a regular basis. Telecom positions are hard to come by, but they do exist. If you have a good Career Manager you'll go far in this firm.","My biggest complaint is that there is no tracking on internal talent and the skillsets they have so the firm is constantly hiring for certain capabilities. This is most frustrating when you are looking for a new contract and you see open positions that you fit, but it's a capability hire which means you cannot apply for it.  Which leads me to the way you work at Booz Allen; when your contract ends it is your responsibility to find another ""job"" within the firm. If you don't find a new contract within a certain period of time (I believe it's 2 or 3 months) you get a warning letter that if you don't have a job within 2 weeks you will be let go."

2244,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Nice company, but mentors weren't able (or weren't willing) to help match me w/ the right projects",2019-02-19,3.0,Consultant,"I started with Booz Allen Hamilton directly out of college not knowing what to expect. Everyone on my home team (and on subsequent project teams) was welcoming and kind. Though the Consultant salary is lower than for firms like Deloitte or McKinsey, it is still very solid for a 23 year old. Benefits were decent too.","I came to the firm as a general management consultant hire with a background working in/studying political science and campaigns. Though there were some projects with roles for entry-level consultants in areas like communications or research - they were few and far between. More commonly, people like me got shunted onto the operations teams for one of the dozens of IT/Tech Modernization projects that are Booz's bread and butter on the civil side. (The military and defense jobs that make up the other side of Booz's bread and butter were only for vets or civilians with very specific technical skills). These operations roles meants I spent my time organizing meetings for people, processing and tracking on-boarding and off-boarding of other consultants for our project, and other mundane tasks. Within these projects, the only way to move up and take on new work would be in learning to do a semi-technical role. Working on requirements as a go-between with the developers on one side, and the clients on the other. Stuff like that. 

Though everyone at Booz was nice, no one on my home team was able to really help me get matched with a project that interested me or would make use of my actual skillset. There weren't a ton of projects out there that actually would have been a fit for someone in the mode of the classical liberal arts student (me), but there were some. Many less jobs than for my colleagues with true technical backgrounds (software dev, hardcore data analysis), but some! Enough jobs that it was apparently worth Booz's time to recruit many liberal arts students! But in my case, I spent two years at the firm working on two projects that bored the hell out of me, then left for greener pastures. Both times that I was looking for new projects (when I initially joined the company and after offboarding after a year in my first unsatisfying project) my bosses from my partner team were more focused on getting me quickly billing on a project (any project) than on finding something that would actually be a good fit. It's a shame, I liked many things about the company a lot. Overall though, my experience there was quite poor."

This may have to do with the company slowly chipping away at employee benefits. The 401k match dropped from an automatic 10% to a 6% match. 401k fees are paid directly by employees from their accounts, and bereavement leave was decreased without any communication from management. At the same time the company still has an ""off the record"" expectation of employees working extra hours each week to make up for training opportunities that generally never happen. That won't be mentioned by any recruiter.","Booz Allen believes over-management is the key to success. The creation of a new job leader role just lumped additional daily/weekly responsibilities onto the most burdened employees, despite the previous construct working for most people. The amount of upper management is staggering  and stifles middle managers who have to present financials and project reviews that are tailored to each one of their 4-8 internal bosses. As for external customers/clients, the company markets itself as a cutting edge IT leader, but severely lacks institutional knowledge of cybersecurity, cloud hosting/computing, and basic network engineering.

I was told I would be able to have multiple roles when I was going through the interview process, and when I chose the position and resigned from my then former employer, I was told how the contracts they wanted to put me on fell through.  I was then put on ""busy work"" and nothing that was substantial towards my educational credentials or skillset because I was a contractor and had to remain billable, so anything that was remotely close to my background, even something that I was not interested in, I had to take or risk not having work.  You are strongly encouraged to market yourself to others and network your skillset.  There aren't any real stable roles for you unless you are apart of a clique and get in good with the right people.  They're also so used to letting people down when it comes to contracts and work, there's no real communication about what happened, as though you should get used to it, as I heard plenty of times, ""Welcome to the world of consulting"".  You will hardly have communication with your career manager unless they're either on the same project as you, or reviews come up.  You have to pretty much hunt for opportunities, especially if you are new.  I also heard the word ""political"" one too many times."

Caveat for ""The Bench"": If you don't have billable work, then you are left to find work on your own in a convoluted and confusing process until you either get work or receive your ""Lack of Work"" (LOW) letter.**

The quality of Career Managers (CMs) depends on the person and the amount of managerial experience. Most do not have that experience.

From the first day, the firm provides you with a comprehensive overview of the firm, the values, expectations, and structure.

However, based on the experience thus far, its more than just lip service. Immediately upon arrival to my job site, my first line leader and her boss made an effort to welcome me to the firm, address any questions I had, and ensure everything was continuing to run smoothly. Beyond that, unlike most contracting companies who will hire anyone with the minimum requirements and a pulse, my co-workers with Booz Allen are incredibly driven and passionate about their profession. The care and precision the firm places in bringing in quality people creates a great workplace that fosters energy and growth.

* Luxurious facilities
* Decent money","This is a company that operates on what feels like liberal Democrat policies, and is managed by a bunch of military veterans with no leadership or people skills. Why do I say that? They say one thing and then do another, and they say one thing and tell YOU to do another. They claim to value everyone's different work styles and methods of problemsolving, but the truth is it's full of bad leaders that don't know how to tolerate differing opinions or anything they disagree with (they'll shove the ""Booz Allen way"" down your throat all day long, and if you don't kiss the ring they'll harass you until you either quit or they can find some technicality to justify firing you).

This is what working for Booz is like:
* If you disagree with someone of the opposite gender, then it's entirely about their gender, not that merits of the two viewpoints. They do that deliberately to silence any dissention.
* ""Respecting others' opinions"" actually means ""do what you're told and don't have ideas of your own.""
* In their world, ""teamwork"" is code for having a bunch of people involved that don't need to be in every detail of what you're doing.
* High performers that are more competent at their jobs than their supervisors are viewed as threats, especially if they refuse to be micromanaged. If you're smarter than your boss at what you do, mark my words they'll find some way to fire you.
* The only thing leaders there care about is yes-men. It doesn't matter what those yes-people do, even if they're bullying or harassing you--the yes-people will be the ones who get preferential treatment.
* You can work yourself to exhaustion for this company and they'll never say ""thank you"" or ""good work."" It's not the Booz Allen way to recognize low-ranking employees for their contributions. Lead Associates and Senior Associates always act like they planned and strategized everything, even if they knew nothing about it.
*Their ""purpose and values"" are a joke. They care more about their ""feel good"" culture than they do having healthy debates.
*The majority of the Lead Associates and above that you'll meet don't care about the job or anything else that actually matters; all they care about is playing politics, so don't trust any of them.
* Leaders are insulated from the consequences of their actions, so they can freely mistreat ground-level employees without being stopped by HR or the leaders above them.

Colleagues were great and had I the opportunity to serve and learn on many interesting projects. If you are young, fresh out of college, aren’t married and have no children, this is a great place to gain experience and cut your teeth.","I was a manager with a stellar career at Bah. I left because I was offered a better opportunity with another firm. 

No clear path for promotion, it differed from team to team. You may be amazing on one team, you’re up for promotion, then switch teams to chase an opportunity, and all of a sudden none of your previous hard work matters and you’re starting from scratch. 

Perception is everything there. 

Constantly reorganizing internally. 

You are always walking on egg shells waiting for a “lack of work” notice.  

Work/life balance is awful. If you have a family, be prepared to make some pretty difficult choices in terms of work vs family. Either your family will suffer because you are working all of the time or you will have a difficult time being promoted because of the perception you aren’t working enough. 

No OT unless you are junior. Otherwise, be prepared to work long hours with little more than just your own self satisfaction that you did a job well done. 

Someone once told me, “After working in a chicken coop for a long time, you forget how bad it smells. It’s only after you leave, you realize how bad it was.”

I totally agree with that statement when it comes to my time spent there. I feel thankful for my time there, but never realized how stressful it was until I left and started working at another company. In hindsight, I wouldn’t change a thing. But moving forward, As a father/husband, I wouldn’t work there again and subject my family to the crazy long hours and stress. If you aren’t physically working there all of the time, you’re answering emails on your phone all night/weekend. Additionally, you may put in 60 hours of work in a week, but if you didn’t put 40 of those hours toward a contract and did internal work for Booz Allen, your career may be in jeopardy and you could end up with a lack of work notice.

2583,Booz Allen Hamilton,Perspective depends on your team.,2018-04-13,3.0,Senior Associate,A lot of good people and multiple opportunities.

At Booz, it's all about who you know."

2588,Booz Allen Hamilton,Career Builder,2018-03-14,5.0,Staff Systems Engineer,"1)  Phenomenal professional development and corporate training.  Booz Allen offers hundreds (I'm not exaggerating) of training courses.  The majority are self paced web based courses, but there are lots of in-person training opportunities as well.  Perfect example: BAH leadership decided that they needed more people with data science skills so they partnered with a data science training company to teach any interested employee!  My management has also been very willing to allow me to get involved in things that interest me.  

2)  Booz Allen has work in all kinds of areas and all over the world.  If you get bored with what you're doing all you have to do is talk to your manager and you may be able to roll onto another project.  My last annual review my manager was very interested in whether or not I enjoyed what I was doing.  BAH periodically puts out a call for people to join a new project overseas (i.e. Germany, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, etc.).

3)  Benefits are definitely above average.

4)  The firm has some incredibly smart people.  We've got PhDs all over the place working on things like UAVs, robotics, cybersecurity, etc.  You'll get exposed to some pretty high tech work we're doing if you go to the open houses and lunch & learns.",95% of Booz Allen's business is with the federal government and 70% of it is with the DoD.  Government work can be pretty slow and inflexible.

Benefits have continuously gotten worse since I started back in 2008.  Team leaders pick one or two favorites and can ignore the rest of the team.  Company is highly segregated so there is no cohesive leadership across the board so hope you get on a good team and you even get noticed.

For lower level consultants, you won't get paid as much as other consultants in the market but you would still need to work the similar LOE based on your role on the project. Sometimes you would get extremely high pressure from upper management and there's no way for you to resist. Small raises and slow promotions.

The absolute worst part of the process was that the recruiter obviously had no idea what my resume should warrant salary and position-wise and offered my a salary and position commensurate with a recent college graduate. Let's just say that I have a lot more education and work experience than that. I felt that they had put me in a really poor position to negotiate salary and that the offer was actually insulting.

If you don't live in DC Maryland or Virginia(DMV) you are pretty much screwed. Booz Allen likes to pretend it is some major international company but it really isn't. Yes they have opportunities abroad and other states. But most of the work is highly concentrated in the DMV. If you live elsewhere I think you are taking a huge risk by working for Booz Allen. If you don't have a project right away you may be out of work in a few months. Honestly other consulting firms have better options for people who do not live in the DMV.
Another problem is they have so many people on the bench who will eventually get lack of work letters aka you will be out of work if you don't find a project letters. But they will constantly hire people from the outside for ""capability building"". So they will fire people because they don't have work. But they will hire people who they don't have work for.

As a software developer, I was rewarded in terms of compensation, workplace accessories (Macbook Pro), etc. I enjoyed using enterprise GitHub, Slack, Atlassian products such as JIRA, Amazon Web Services, Azure, and others. There is also flexibility to WFH if you are on the ""bench"" or if your project allows for it.  Lastly, the location of your hub is typically pretty reasonable in relation to where you live, so commuting while on the bench or working remote is typically not a problem.","I was lured into this position because I was told there was an abundance of work in my hub and that commuting inside the beltway or into NoVA was not going to be a problem. I asked a ton of questions during the interview process about projects, work-life balance, client locations, etc. and the answer was always ""depends"". Once I got to the firm, I realized day one that you're more or less just a number they use to bid on proposals. The ""bench"" is where you are when you don't have work. I was hired with about 10-12 other employees who all rode the bench between two to eight months without work. As ""capability"" hires, you come into the firm without work. It's your responsibility to apply to two jobs per day, and interview as much as possible. You are encouraged to apply to positions even if you only hit 35% of the basic qualifications. As a developer, you are also required to perform technical interviews, mostly whiteboard or technical algorithm solving. Imagine this, you wear your suit and tie to the BAH interview, you get the job and then you find out you don't actually have a job... but you have to apply to two jobs per day, the location might be 30 miles and hours of traffic to get to, and you might not even want it... on top of that, you have to interview AGAIN and AGAIN until you find something. If you are offered the position, and it's a ""billable"" project, you will be strongly encouraged to take it, even if you don't want to. The recruiters don't describe this to you during the interview process, even if you ask the right questions."

If you don't work with your manager you likely won't get promoted or good rewards because your work won't be recognized by anyone who can reward you.  It is essentially an adjunct faculty provider for the government, so the company itself has no core being or purpose and contractors have little investment in the long term goals of their clients due to the lack of reward possibility as an outsider doing insider type jobs.

I would recommend it to anyone looking to have a career in public service because you have the ability to 'get a taste' of various government agencies without committing to anyone for longer than ~6 months. Depending on your goals, you can take many different career paths--to executive leadership, subject matter expertise, project management, etc. Within the Federal consulting space, there are few better employers.","Booz Allen is a large and bureaucratic organization, not unlike the majority of clients it serves. To make change, especially at the junior level, you have to be extremely proactive to the point of being abrasive. Most people starting out are not comfortable taking this approach and end up 'falling through the cracks' and never taking full advantage of what the Firm can offer them. Relative to commercial consulting firms, Booz Allen struggles to provide competitive compensation. Top talent can typically make 20-30% more in the commercial space, so there is a bit of a talent gap at the junior levels."

Many ""data scientists"" do not know how to code, have 0 knowledge of machine learning and statistics, and are hired because they have any resemblance of engineering knowledge related to math. I can understand that they are hiring bodies to train them later but the quality of work suffers immensely because of it. 

The pay is not anywhere near the industry standard either... 

Don't let the rebranding facade fool you - turnover is very high and many are hired to the firm without any clear project in mind for them leading to a surplus of employees on the bench looking for work even after their employment begins. 

As a data scientist, the only tasks that I have been given to work on are purely software engineering, computer infrastructure (basically IT support), and administrative tasks. This is definitely not a one-off situation as many of those whom I have met with are suffering from the same situation."

Offices that I've been to are nice,","There are a lot of downsides to BAH, I don't want to come off as bitter so I'll try to be factual.  As the nature of contracting and resources working at customer sites, it's very difficult to feel that the organization cares at all about the off-site employee.  The ""hoteling"" and open office environment are contributing to the deterioration of moral.  As benefits increase BAH makes an effort to keep insurance costs down but they're in the trends as other organizations and just offer awful medical plans unless you'd like to spend $600 per month for the family.  The only way to advance within BAH is the person above you has to leave in some fashion...wooden box, new opportunity externally or relocation for another opportunity.  Transfers internal to the company are lateral at best therefore  no upward mobility unless you make your own contract and prove invaluable to the revenue of the organization.

Most managers are pretty flexible in leading their teams.
Work-life balance is pretty good for junior staff who work full-time on client site.","Booz Allen is no longer an elite consulting firm.  Breaking off the elite commercial practice in 2008 (Booz & Company--which has since re-branded as Strategy& and is now part of PwC) left Booz Allen Hamilton with a large public sector practice that provided most of its support to the Federal government.  The firm bet big on its disastrous ""Take Share"" hiring policy back in 2010 which led to a deep bench of available staff.  When anticipated work did not materialize to the levels projected, it resulted in a lack of work situation and literally thousands of employees at all levels up to partner were let go from 2011-2014.  The company went public in that same time frame (late 2011) and had to pull a lot of cost-cutting levers to project itself as a profitable company to investors.  Losing a lot of re-competed work to small businesses and the government's spending cutbacks due to Sequestration all contributed to BAH going from a company 26K+ employees to under 20K at its recent low.  Growth projections had the firm at topping 30K employees, so the company was way below the targets the C-suite Partners had set back then.  These days, new talent is hired in at starting salaries less than the firm offered at the same level a decade ago.  Job security is very uncertain even if you are on a billable task.  Management will move a higher salaried worker off of a task to be replaced by a lower paid new hire.  Workers in a lack of billable work situation are generally let go within 2 weeks to 2 months depending on tenure.

Promotions are very hard to come by and annual raises are anemic due to the firm's strong culture of holding down costs.

The firm is no longer at, or near, the top of the list for advanced degree professionals who are truly interested in being a consultant.  Deloitte is a much better option for someone who wants to do this type of work in the federal space and work for a large well-known company."

So many issues, combined, make this experience unbearable  on a day-to-day basis. Although the experience can be subjective, it's really important that these be considered or else you're just testing your luck. Here's an overview: 
- your career manager (the one responsible to staff you on a project) makes or breaks your career. Most CMs I've heard about do not care about their subordinate's growth, development, conflicts, etc...they're only looking out for themselves
- Besides the CM role, no one else is formally expected to support, mentor, or advice you...
- this firm is just as politically driven as its clients are...relationships win over merit and morals. So just imagine, as a new hire, if you don't have a relationship with your CM, you're already on an island. You don't have any other formal source of support.  
- there's an expectation that you should know every single thing required because no one wants to be accountable in training or educating you about the most foundational things like process
- people are often pressured to sacrifice their integrity 
- some contracts are setup in a terrible way where the firm has overcommitted without the necessary resources...and the team has to take the lift for the firm

Also, the experience can be very inconsistent based on who you report to.

2736,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Talented people working in a competitive, cutthroat environment with immature, naive management",2017-11-24,2.0,Associate,"- Talent: in general, your colleagues are bright, talented, hard-working people. 
- Company provides $5000 annually supporting training and professional certifications, which is great for those in their early career
- Energetic, vibrant team atmosphere with a 'can-do' attitude
- Colleagues are accountable and look out for one another
- Highly structured and regimented environment, a dot-the-I's-cross-the-T's environment, which can be a pro or con, depending on the context.  The upside is that people  communicate very directly with one another, so you always know where you stand with your manager.","I think these are very bright people who are well-meaning, but will do “whatever it takes” to please the client, hence the issue of ethics.  I can see why Booz Allen’s image was tainted after the Edward Snowden incident.  People aren’t taught ethics here – and I’m saying this after having worked at a large, internationally-recognized company where “doing the right thing” is a priority.  

Bottom line: when push comes to shove, they do not care about you, they just care about making the client happy, and if you're not a yes-(wo)man exhibiting obsequious, sycophantic behavior to your project and/or career manager, basically nodding and smiling to everything that they say (so they can do it ‘their way’) – even at the expense of your ethics and morals, you are doing yourself a disfavor in your career at Booz Allen.  As I can see there are multiple reviews on here highlighting ethical behavior (lack thereof, specifically) of senior management, I can support that with first-hand experience.  Senior associates have asked us to come in on the weekends but without clearly outlining policy for charging overtime for paid-time-off on weekends.  Once someone asked, “how do we charge weekend hours?,” and the senior associate replied with, “Make it work!”   This is senior management, by the way, and it’s not going to change. 

Highly structured and regimented environment can lead to following the rules too much to the point that it can lead to mistakes.

In all, I think Booz Allen is a place ideally suited for someone in his/her early career to obtain training and experience, but not ideal for someone in his/her mid-to-late stage career."

Benefits are good with a great 401(k) match and generous leave.,"How much you enjoy your work, what the work life balance is and if you like your manager all depends on the project and client. Many projects limit your hours to just 40 hours a week so you can have a good work life balance (though you may have administrative tasks or proposal efforts on top of that) but others don't so those projects can easily turn into 60-80 hour a week affairs. Also, if you got off a project there is strong pressure to find a new one as quickly as possible or you'll receive a Lack of Work and be laid off. Some admin teams are more strict about this than others so some will give you more time and resources while others immediately toss you aside. The work can vary too, depending on the project. Some clients are great and the work is fast-paced and interesting while others are slow, frustrating and repetitive. The benefit of all this is that if you have a crappy client or admin team, you have the ability to switch around until you find one that suits your desires more."

2792,Booz Allen Hamilton,Overview of Booz Allen Hamilton,2017-10-09,2.0,Senior Consultant,"Decent Brand Name: Booz Allen Hamilton still has a relatively strong brand name due to the size and history of the company (about a $5B company with a management consulting history), which allows for stronger exit options (as in it will help you get an interview when you have Booz Allen on your resume).  

Above Avg. Culture: The work/life balance is strong (think 40 to 50 hours/week, but this depends on project/division). There are many company events and ways to get involved (only if you're based in D.C.). The work environment leans collaborative vs. competitive. The company focuses on driving towards an inclusive environment and a dress for your workday policy; this means all races and types of people are welcome and you can typically dress down a little from what you would expect from a consulting firm. 

Public Sector Work: If you enjoy working within the govt. space and learning about how the govt. operates, then Booz Allen is a good option for you. Almost all work is with the govt. and you'll get to interact with govt. employees, officials, and really every other aspect of the govt. Booz's website is a good place to see what type of work they do. Some examples: IT implementation, business process re-engineering, project management, program management, change management, strategic communications, Cybersecurity, other technical fields etc.

Nonpartisan Operation: Booz Allen's work will exist no matter what political party is in power. Booz Allen's work is not partisan and Booz will typically stay away from anything that may be too much of a risk or touchy subject (Booz is a very risk averse company). Partisan politics do not play into Booz's daily operations, so if you fear that you'll be working for ""x"" party, you're not; Booz Allen is a business, it will execute effectively on govt. contracts to implement govt. policies or improve govt. operations, etc., and it's very much less about the politics.","Management Consulting No More: Many people associate Booz Allen with Management Consulting, but this perception is become ever more obsolete. The projects for the govt. are typically very long (think a year or longer). Most projects now are staff augmentation, IT implementation, program management (administrative oversight), Cybersecurity, or other technical fields. It is very important to recognize that management consulting work is no longer a prevalent area for Booz Allen because if you're looking to gain the core management consulting skillsets, you should look at other firms. 

Poor Compensation: The pay is far below industry standards. Senior leaders will say our ""competitors"" are other major management consulting firms, but in reality there are major issues with that statement. 1) the other management consulting firms will pay anywhere from 10% to 50% more in salary with the average falling between 10%-50% more. 2) Booz Allen does not really do the same work as other major management consulting firms. You cannot say that public sector ""consulting"" is the same as private sector consulting because of one important reason: typically the skillsets gained from public sector consulting are not completely identical to that of private sector consulting. Consequently, Booz Allen employees will lack certain skills that are necessary for transitioning to private sector/industry firms. These skills that management consultants at Booz will lack typically fall into the quantitative analysis category (many who read this may disagree and say that Booz has lots of Data Scientists...well please read the next section). 

Qualitative and Quantitative Separation: The typical perception of ""management consulting"" work is powerpoint and excel everyday with powerpoint being the qualitative/strategy/communications/soft skills side and the excel being the quantitative analysis/hard skills side. There is an interesting phenomenon at Booz where if you're a ""management consultant"" you're left with the qualitative and strategic side of things and the quantitative is left to the ""data scientists"". In a world where a balanced skillset between analytical skills in excel and qualitative/soft skills is becoming ever more important, stripping Booz Allen management consultants of their opportunities to learn the quant. side of things truly hurts their careers. 

Non-HQ Workers are Treated Terribly: If you work in any geography location (meaning anywhere but the HQ locations in D.C.) you have a TREMENDOUS amount of downside to your job/career. You're treated like a second class citizen because you are not part of the ""club"" in D.C.; this means as a geography employee, your projects are worse, you are stuck on bad projects, you are  limited to a small number of clients, you are limited to certain types of work/projects, leadership doesn't pay attention to you, your pay is less, your activities aren't paid for by the company, you don't get as much training or staff development time, you are disconnected from the firm, you are not able to network, D.C. people think you're not good enough, you're seen as expendable (firings left and right can occur at ease in a downturn), you'll always be picked last for exciting opportunities (meaning you'll never be picked at all), your advancement opportunities hit a ceiling at a point, and much more. It is critical for those seeking opportunities at Booz to recognize the downsides they will face if they do not work in the D.C. offices. Please take heed. The experience in D.C. however, is much better. If I worked in D.C. I would give Booz 3 stars instead of 2. 

No Vision/Major Growth Opportunities for the FIrm: Booz does not seem to have a strategic path to the future. And this makes sense given the nature of the govt. work (and consulting firms in general as professional services firms have trouble innovating). Booz will only grow if the govt. grows its needs. As a result, Booz exists as long as the govt. exists (which is forever). But at the same time, the govt. will not likely undergo any sweeping/fundamental changes, and that means neither will Booz (so expect the work to stay status quo for the long haul). 

Large and Segmented Company: Booz is a large organization, it's like having multiple public sector consulting companies mashed into one. For example, the defense and civil side operate almost as completely different entities. As a result, these entities can have different cultures, work/life balances, skillsets needed, etc. Take note of which part of the company you're applying for to determine if it will be a good fit."

Great benefit package

Many awesome people who are very smart and very hard working 

You get what you put in: if you're a 60+ hour week kind a guy/gal, always available, and dedicated to your clients, you should be well rewarded

Gary Rhal is the man! He now leads the Engineering and Environment practice. I have never worked with a better mentor/leader and manager. Even if you're a bit nuts, if Gary believes in you, he'll stick by you.","Politics, politics, politics. One reason you'll need to work 60+ hours per week is you'll need 10 to 15 hours to deal with the politics inside the firm. Nuts! Maybe it's gotten better since I left.

Burn out: those 60+ hour weeks really add up. By year 3, I was nearly cross-eyed. In fact, I never had to take vacation time because I'd put in so many hours before I left and so many hour when I got back, the vacation hours were never needed.

Strange benefit of having a nervous breakdown: I know this will sound ""crazy,"" but I knew several people who had a nervous breakdown while working at Booz. In fact, I had a nervous breakdown. Almost to a one of us, we were promoted after we came back. Maybe this was just happenstance, but the seeming correlation was frightening.

Transformational culture: Well, Booz is a consulting firm, right? That said, it seemed a new corporate initiative was being rolled out every 6 months. We would be greener! We would be more nimble! We would consolidate management to better respond to customers' needs! We would incentivize  managers to work across practice areas! We would open lines of communication between partners and peons! In the end, most of the initiatives I witnessed ended in the dust bin of corporate history for lack of a real implementation plan and/or leadership support. Yawn. It became too easy to ignore the ""latest initiative."""

There is ""talk"" from management about taking care of employees, but no action.
""Nickel and dime"" PTO by charging PTO for non-billable time.
Directed to use my personal laptop because the company still has not provided a laptop and there are client deliverables.  Greatest concern is having to place client data and solutions developed for the client on personal equipment.  Client expressed concerns 8 months ago, but company has not addressed those concerns.  Followed up with manager twice, who replied he would look into it -- no follow-through by manager.  
Found recent news articles that company is under investigation for inappropriate cost accounting for DoD accounts and for securities fraud.
Cons far outweigh the pros.  What appeared to be pros during the recruitment phase turned out to be false or misinformation.
Older technology with no inclination to shift, but that is a reflection of the federal agency (client) .
Took a salary cut (about $4K) with promise of rich benefits that offset the cut. Benefit summary/costs not provided until first day of employment, and benefits cost more and have lower coverages.  End result was drop in net pay of over $700/month with less competitive benefits.
Until recently, ""Booz-Up"" and ""Boozer"" mentality appears to merge company name with alcohol consumption at after-hours mixers and ""business"" lunches, which appears to be expensed by the senior manager present; I don't have visibility if those expenses were passed directly or indirectly to clients.

Way too much management, control and oversight - things are micromanaged and employees cannot exert any authority or approve any expenditure, not even $1 without a junior executive approving.  Everyone below executive essentially has to be 100% billable,  all the time because the business model does not generate sufficient  indirect labor in a flexible, appropriate way and the leadership sees indirect labor as a cost and not as an investment.

Firm is growing and is an exciting place to be relative to a few years ago.

I think your experience is going to be 100% dependent on the skills you bring to the firm, the team you're hired into, your first client/project, and your career manager. I was lucky enough to get hired into a great team with a great career manager, and many of the people on my team are doing really interesting stuff that I'd also like to do. I also came in with a strong (but somewhat general) consulting skillset, which made it easy for me to be plugged into a few different initiatives. My first client/project wasn't great, but I was able to use my pre-Booz Allen experience to get something much better.","It's all federal work, which may get old for many people. Promotions and access to great work can be highly political (knowing the right people/being on the right track). Salary and benefits are solid, but nothing to write home about. I think that the senior people (principals on up) make great money.

I experienced trouble with management in several locations working for Booz. There is little respect for the analysts, they are just worker bees. Management chain only trusts and listens to other managers in their chain, rather than actually respecting the knowledge, contributions, and experience of the analysts on the ground working with the clients. The managers, who are usually rarely on client site, think they know more and as much as you say to argue your case and support yourself, they have plugged ears. In several locations, managers pursue new contracts, then ignore the work just to focus on pursuing other contracts. There is little attention paid to actually managing the project and staff well. Contractors are taken on as ""experts"" but treated as children. There is little opportunity for advancement. Not to mention, bonuses aren't given even though they have reported growth in the last couple years where they expected to see loss. Benefits have gone down hill every year. 

Basically this is just another place to clock hours. The only two reasons I gave them two stars rather than one are:
1- they have maternity leave. That said, they made it feel like it was a burden to them. Manager wasn't particularly supportive.
2- there are lots of jobs available because it's a very big company, so it's fairly easy to move around if needed, and you can keep your paycheck, no matter how mediocre. Don't expect it to get you any advancement though."

However, considering many, if not most, employees are recently separated military service members/government employees with little outside contracting experience, these claims are largely accepted and defended throughout the firm. I received a $20k dollar pay increase upon switching to another company, and this increase wasn't for a different position either. It was for the exact same position that I had when I left Booz Allen. I still sat at my same desk, working alongside all of my same colleagues.

Booz Allen has to be the industry leader for work/life balance.  Because of this, it’s not uncommon for people to have other major sources of income on the side.   It really is amazing the amount of free time you have when working for a government contractor.  

For the most part, managers are always available to talk to about any issue and they really try to put you on projects that you want.  You can easily get by on 10am-4pm days.  I personally know a lot people who only showed up to work when they had meetings.    Also, to get a job at Booz Allen, you don't even have to do a case study.

Booz Allen is an excellent brand name.  It’s really overwhelming how highly external recruiters and firms think of Booz Allen.  Obviously, this is a huge positive, since if you don’t move up as quickly as you would like at Booz Allen, you can just leave, for probably a much better offer monetarily.  This is really important at any large corp, since oftentimes it is very crowded come promotion time.","Some in upper management and HR at Booz Allen have a bad habit of lying.  This is more so than I’ve seen at really any other company I’ve worked at, so it’s worth mentioning.  They will absolutely lie to you when trying to recruit you.  They’ll tell you about bonuses and fast promotion.  It’s important to know that it is company policy that no one below senior associate gets any bonuses, regardless of what they tell you.  They have this vague concept called the ‘People Model’, but in reality it’s just a bunch of false promises; no two managers give the same definition of it.

Booz Allen is currently in this weird stage of deciding if they should be more than a government contractor.  They spend a lot amount of money (which they get from huge gov't contracts) in anything that has the word ‘innovation’ and in creating products that don’t have a legit chance of selling.  That money could be better spent elsewhere; for instance, the firm wonders why their commercial arm isn’t getting any legs, but it’s really because they don’t bring in any legit rainmakers.  You can’t ask government workers with no industry connections to bring in commercial business - that’s not a good strategy.

Other than that:  health benefits are relatively subpar. no bonus unless you're senior associate above, regardless of what they tell you.

Overall: If you’re looking for an extremely relaxed environment at a big consulting shop, I really couldn’t recommend any better place to work.  If you’re fairly technical and want to challenge yourself professionally, I’d recommend looking elsewhere."

Management is distant from employees, company values change too often, company looks only at the bottom line and forgets about the people that bring in that revenue, poor advancement opportunities, salary competitiveness is below average due to the high costs of overhead and expected company profit, and the list can go on and on. Leadership, at least at the Quantico area location, is immature and lacks a lot of the basic leadership skills needed to be an effective and powerful leader. Management changes in this area quite often giving the impression that no one wants to be on this team long. If you are planning on joining the Booz Allen team, be aware that you must negotiate your best possible deal up front as when you get in you are pretty much locked in to a bleak future. Another interesting fact, the turn over rate here at the Quantico team is very high. Not only myself, but I know of 6 to 7 other people within the same year leave the firm and never look back.

Managers are so overwhelmed, I found that for many teams I was on, they didn't even have time to assign tasks to me. When they did assign tasks to me, they didn't set expectations. Interacting with clients is a pain because the management will talk over you, interrupt you, undermine you, or just straight up tell you not to interact with clients.

You don't actually have a job when you work here, you need to apply internally for jobs. This is difficult because people hire who they know. I have not found people helpful at all in trying to bring me in to new projects.

Worst of all, the general incompetence in some of the markets is staggering. I've come into projects where the manager has been doing everything themselves and its going terribly. I've come into projects where nothing is happening at all. I've come into projects where I've had to rewrite entire artifacts because the previous ones were complete trash.

This is particularly frustrating to talented staff members. Compensation at Associate and below levels undervalue talent of employees.

The opportunities are only limited by what you want and are willing to pursue. Leadership is very involved and has interests in getting to know every individual (of course depending on your individual team/cluster). Everyone I met at the firm was always willing to help others, eager to learn, and very involved. Senior leadership tries their best to keep all team members engaged through multiple events and activities during and after hours. The firm really gives you the capability to grow yourself as a professional by providing training, workshops, etc. that you can attend in order to expand your skill set. Managers are there to help you and will work with you according to the type of work life you desire. Climbing up the promotional ladder is systematic as all the levels come with prerequisites and requirements one must complete/meet in order to be promoted. This firm strives to remain apparent and above the trend in the current market. Overall, I would really recommend Booz Allen to a friend or colleague simply due to all of the opportunities for self/professional growth.","Finding the exact project that suites your needs can be quite challenging. At times, between projects, you can be sitting on the bench for long periods of time waiting/looking for a project to be available. Of course, the way to avoid this is always be proactive and look out for new opportunities as well as have an awareness regarding when your project/support ends. It always depends on what work is available and where your current standing is. Frequently, you can find yourself not finding a suitable project of your desire for weeks/months. New projects don't always follow the same line of work or have the same required skills which makes continuity of specific work an issue. Often times, you have to accept what you end up with. 
Salaries are somewhat in the below average - average range. Within the course of a year, I have seen multiple people leave the firm for better pay."

My review is of the IMAG team specifically, not the company as a whole. First time I've lost a job with more than one year in with no notice and no severance; they'll screw you on the way out.

Colleagues are all smart, professional, nice people (with few exceptions). Management is very open and takes a genuine interest in their staff's career development, beyond just staffing their contracts. There's a great culture of collaboration and support, nothing competitive or cutthroat.

Work-life balance is excellent. Level 1 consultants are capped at 40 and in my experience that is strictly honored by management. Above level 1 I've averaged around 42 hours per week and rarely exceeded 45. If you're working from a company office and not client-site, you'll most likely have flexible hours and telework.

Career growth and advancement opportunities are there if you want them, but can be weak if you aren't actively pursuing them. Highly motivated people are able to advance quickly in salary and title from Consultant to Associate. Above that it's less clearly defined, you generally will have to be able to sell work to get the next promotion but it seems like most are able to get grandfathered in to their first management roles when their manager gets promoted. There's definitely a big culture of promotion from within -- the CEO started here at age 23, and I get the impression that the majority of senior leadership has worked here for 10-20+ years, often as their first job out of college or out of active duty military service.

Benefits are solid. The 401k in particular stands out-- immediate vesting, great fund choices and fee ratios, 6% match for your calendar year contributions as long as you're with the firm on December 31st. $5,500 available per year for external academic tuition and certifications, and there's great free internal training available on top of that. 15 days of PTO for junior staff, and you don't need to take time off when you're sick as long as you can log in to your laptop and telework.","The work at times feels meaningless and like a waste of taxpayer money. I suppose that's the norm with federal consulting. The federal government is notoriously slow-paced and bureaucratic-- simple, quick technical fixes can take an inordinately long time to get the required approvals and funding. Everyone seems very content with their work but nobody seems particularly excited. One DoD client I work with manages a multi-billion dollar budget with a series of disorganized Excel workbooks that have no traceability-- they can't get funding to invest in even basic database and analysis platforms.

Pay seems to be a little below average versus competitors (~5-10%), counterbalanced by advancement rate. Although benefits are good for the most part, the people who have been here since before we went public will tell you about how much better they were back in the day.

If you get stuck on client site, a lot of the pros listed above do not apply. No flexible hours, difficult to network with colleagues and thus difficult to advance your career."

3218,Booz Allen Hamilton,Associate,2016-12-20,4.0,Associate,Working on the functional side as a programmer at Booz Allen is fun because you gain a diverse set of skills from various client projects. I feel lucky because I have a really great team that I work with and everyone supports each other.,"The tough part is that sometimes the personnel that represent the government clients aren't truly invested in the projects because they are funded by tax payer money. As a result, the motivation to continuously do great work fades away.

Because of this, capturing and winning projects is given more importance than the product that is developed. In the end, the product is not given the same value and so moving up in the company means becoming a good salesmen instead of improving one's functional skills. 

Also, there are no bonuses for Lead Associates and below that can serve as an incentive to do great work on a continuous basis."

Last I was there, it was only 2 days long and Principals were in such a hurry to staff they were skipping orientation altogether.  Because of the senior staff's financial incentive to grow teams, BAH has become much more about quantity of folks rather than quality.

Most of the non management level employees were good people.,"Their business model is to hire high ranking military officials and win contacts via connections.  They have no care in the world if they actually fulfill the job.  Where I was at they destroyed the morale of people who were there before by lowering their pay and housing allowance, claiming they get '$5000/year for training"".  This was also a fraud; it was just a justification for their ridiculous overhead expenses.  The bottom line is they will do absolutely nothing for their employees if your contact doesn't explicitly mention it as a necessity.  There were also people staffed overseas who were considered 'local hires' a year after they were stationed.  That means they must pay their own way back to the states even if they get another job at BAH.  Very, very unethical behavior with many lies to the clients.  Needless to say in many places they have destroyed their reputation with their arrogant hollow corporate culture and negligence of their own workers, especially when compared to other companies who work on the same site in most cases.  They also refuse to help more senior workers get high clearances when the opportunity is there.  Oh yeah, and their ""culture"" is that of a overbearing parent punishing you repeatedly saying it's for your own good with your very own 'career' manager who knows nothing about your skills.

3296,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great Company...unless you're a Designer,2016-10-19,4.0,User Experience Designer,"Booz Allen is an excellent company for those looking for job security.  Our clientele mainly involves government agencies and the military, and so contracts with them are numerous and tend to see extensions as more work is added.  The pay is great and the benefits are awesome.  I've enjoyed working with a lot of of my coworkers.  While the office life is more ""Corporate America"" than most fresh-out-college people would prefer, the atmosphere is typically positive and light-hearted.  The firm itself, tries to provide a respectable culture, centered around their core values.  Work is contractual, meaning you're placed on contracts the firm has successfully bid on, and you charge your time to those contracts for your pay for the duration stipulated by the contract.  Because of the numerous contracts attained by Booz every year, work is plentiful, and you'll never get stuck on one thing for too long.","Booz Allen has a problem with providing work to its designers.  Because of the nature of our government and military contracts, most of the work we provide is ""maintenance"" on legacy systems.  This is a huge problem for a designer, because unless you're also a competent back-end programmer or database guru, you're going to be out luck finding a contract that needs your expertise.  Also, because of security concerns, you're typically unable to display work on your portfolio.  Designers live and die by their portfolios, so this is a serious issue for a designer looking to further their career.  During my tenure, I've watched every member of the design branch on our team, leave the firm, either cause the work wasn't furthering their careers, or they couldn't find new work.  When you can't find work, you're placed ""on the bench"" which is our way of saying ""You'll be let go unless you find a contract to charge your time to.""  When I was on the bench a year ago, I tried contacting a team focused purely on UX Design opportunities for the firm, and they were struggling to remain afloat themselves.  This is a significant problem that Booz needs to address, if they want to retain their designers."

Just about all of the people I've worked with at Booz Allen have been a pleasure to work with. Some are more competent than others, but overall the employees all do really great work and genuinely care about their clients. I have a number of friends of mine now who I met working at Booz.","There's a triple threat model that makes it pretty hard to make the jump to Senior Associate. You have to be perceived to be able to (1) execute your work, (2) lead teams, and (3) sell work. The hard part isn't necessarily doing these things, but in being perceived that you're doing these things. I know a number of smart people who could be argued to be meeting these metrics, but, for whatever reason, haven't gotten support from senior leadership for that next-level promotion. To really succeed you need to make lots of friends, socialize a lot, and be a pretty charismatic person. Also, it helps to be a bit lucky ;-)"

3301,Booz Allen Hamilton,Just a number to management,2016-10-26,2.0,,BAH employs some of the best intelligence professionals in the business.  Many of those have years of experience to share with both clients and company employees.  An employee can network with various people in the company and no one bats an eye when a junior consultant contacts a Principal or VP.,"A candidate receives a lot of attention from management and recruiter during the recruitment process.  After an new employee onboards, management no longer pays attention to the employees.  

Mid-level management is not willing to support employees in advancement or transfer to other opportunities because that had a direct impact to the managers' numbers.  A request for position change or raise of salary is denied due to constraints until the employee submits a resignation letter, then magically the requested item is available.

Management strongly encourages employees to work additional hours even though the work is not compensated.  Employees are expected to complete non-client related company work on their own time.  If an employee was to complete company administrative duty for 8 hours, he/she is expected to still fulfill 40 hours of billable work per week."

Even the internal career levels/titles are dependent upon performing work for the coporate side, rather than being based solely on technical expertise and client satisfaction."

-Lots of prior military service (in the area that I was in).
-Very military reserves friendly.
-Great managers.
-Very stable, depending on available contracts.
-Advancement is strongly tied to ability to sell new work. (pro/con).","-Often solo on smaller projects
-Some big contracts quickly turn into office augmentation rather than actual consulting. This was a problem, because it severely restricted ability to hit various review targets for advancement.
-Review system is convoluted to the point that it seems analytical for advancement, but it's still at the whim of the money available. UNLESS, you are out there selling new work, in which case, you'll advance fast.
-Navy focused part of the company is pretty separate, so while leveraging companywide resources is possible, it's harder than it should be."

I would have greatly appreciated that but other than that I don't have a lot of cons about working for Booz Allen.
3380,Booz Allen Hamilton,IT Manager,2016-09-02,5.0,Manager,"Work life balance
Benefits: Even though nearly every business changed medical plans after Obamacare, BAH's remained better than most. Similarly retirement plans used to be incredibly generous, they were cut but are now still much better than most other companies. 
My leadership was excellent, no micromanagement and minimal scrutiny provided I performed to their expectations.","This could be a pro or con, the company shifted to a hoteling model for offices vs. assigned offices. The end result was more working from home, but the con part of this was reduced face time with peers and feeling more out of touch.
After going public, the firm had less flexibility to weather financial stress. Meaning budgets were often slashed/reallocated elsewhere and occasionally staff cutbacks, however those were very reasonable in my opinion as well as done in a most respectful and supportive manner."
3381,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great Company,2016-08-29,5.0,Lead Associate,"Great reputation, outstanding ethical culture, and the company truly has its act together from a business perspective. Executive leadership (Principal, VP, SVP, EVP) listens to employee suggestions from junior staff. Benefits are among the best in the industry. Strong, competitive salaries, even for junior positions. Training and professional development opportunities abound. Office facilities and IT support are outstanding. The company has made great strides in improving the look and function of the office environment. When not on client site, dress code has been relaxed to allow (and encourage) business casual. Policies and procedures are well defined, which makes working with different teams nearly seamless. Work life balance is good compared to other consulting firms because most projects are locally based.","Overall, morale is good, but it is very dependent on the team atmosphere and opportunity to advance. Turnover among young employees is high, which makes staffing projects a challenge. Turnover at the Senior Associate and Principal level is not high enough, which negatively impacts promotion from Lead Associate. Not enough support staff available for contract management and finance, which can impact the response time to client requests."

I definitely was not engaged in the kind of work I was promised when I joined the firm...work that would challenge my skills, knowledge, and abilities. Also, their benefits package, especially the 401(k), got worse and worse each year."

There is a lot of interesting work of all types going on at the company. It is nice being able to be close to clients on site but also being able to go back to the Booz Allen offices to enjoy the perks along with other coworkers.

Great work life balance.","The experience is very dependent on who your career manager, administrative team, and client are. Some people luck out and have fantastic all-of-the-above - they get promoted fast, big raises, the best projects, etc. However, if you land on a team that isn't perfect, Booz Allen does make it very easy and comfortable to make changes (for the employee's best interest). 

Not the best transparency of performance/raise/promotion scales. Not consistent at all across the firm.

The pay is better at other places but the work life balance is the reason people come back."

The company is still a body shop. Number of billable people on a contract matters more than anything else to leader. Quality of personnel & proper fit to client are not really a priority. Especially on contracts that require clearances. A cleared c-player will get paid well and get the job, rather than the A-player without the clearance. This is very true in their Cyber Security Accounts. Training time is in addition to your required billable time, and business development (with ambiguous businesses objectives,  and no ability to influence human capital policies) are also in addition to required billable time. Basically...they will take advantage of your time if you let them."

Which speaks for their ethics, in my opinion. You are not treated like an intern but a valuable member of your corresponding team, given real-world expectations and deadlines with top of the line exposure to most facets of the firm. As a Summer Hire, I was able to meet Horacio Rozanski (CEO of Booz Allen)... TWICE, which I never thought I would get the opportunity ever as an intern anywhere else. The biggest tip I have for someone entering an internship within the firm is to not pigeonhole yourself, rather, network and attend as many events and meet as many people as possible. Apply yourself and this internship opens a lot of doors for you. Oh yeah, and people here are incredibly smart - surround yourself with good people and you start performing at their level. I highly recommend this company if you are trying to take your career to a new level.","Sometimes you are required to travel to different offices (DC, Maryland, Virginia offices) in order to fulfill your job... which to some could be negative but for me being able to work at the M Street office and being able to overlook Nationals Park and head downstairs to a game later in the afternoon was a good balance of work and fun."

Many of the market teams also work very hard to make employees feel like they are part of a family rather just a cog in a huge wheel. How they do it could use some improvement though","After breaking off from its commercial counter part and going public,  the culture has drastically changed. Everything is about the bottom line and employees more than anyone really feel that. Raises are horrendous, middle management cannot help junior staff understand the changes because they do not understand changes that upper management and leadership are making, and people no longer feel valued. You cannot even get parking reimbursed when you go visit a client.

3407,Booz Allen Hamilton,Solutions Driven,2016-08-05,5.0,Consultant,"Booz Allen's greatest asset was its corporate culture, keeping in mind I worked there prior to 2005.

""'if you point out a problem, you better have a solution, because  if you open your mouth you'll be tasked with its resolution!""","If there is any challenge to cite, its the very challenge I so respected.

And finally, because it is a relationship-based company and business, you can make some friends in and out of the office.","In my opinion, and I know other alumni will disagree, but the company changed after going public.  Despite their attempts to seem up to date and agile, they are still a buttoned up, staid culture.  The benefits were great when I was there but I have since heard they're not so great anymore.

I sought a position with BAH because it enjoyed an exceptional reputation and because I had been favorably impressed with the BAH contractors I crossed paths with during my federal service. There were a number of positions I interviewed for and I was ultimately hired to serve as a strategic communications associate on a BAH contract supporting the Defense Health Agency with its TRICARE medical health program for servicemembers and retirees and their dependents. I looked forward to sharing my experience with the members of the BAH team and assisting in the production of exceptional communications products for the client. As a new employee, everyone on the team was very welcoming and helped me through the onboarding process. The members of my team were some of the most intelligent, passionate, diverse and professional colleagues you could ever hope to work with.","Upper management is laser focused on everyone being 100 percent billable to ensure the kinds of profits they forecasted and promised to shareholders. If you are not bringing in ""billable hours"" you will receive a Lack of Work (LOW) letter and will be given 30 days to find a new contract or be let go. That made me feel that I was simply a revenue generator and NOT particularly valued.

For all my experience, I found I was given rather mundane tasks to perform and that the work was not particularly challenging. Creativity in accomplishing tasks was not wanted or encouraged. Further, we were encouraged to NEVER give ideas to clients on how to better accomplish tasks or improve products and told simply to “do precisely what the client wants when he/she wants it.”

The firm also expected that employees attend varied events during our off-work hours in addition to on-site client support. We were also frequently given additional work relating to growing new business for BAH that we were required to do in our leisure time away from supporting our clients. These tasks were frequently provided on short notice with extremely short deadlines for submission and most were definitely the equivalent of another full-time job. Rarely was I compensated for any time I spent working such business development support work. Often, too, the individual placed in charge of pulling the proposal or presentation together to pitch the new business was a young associate seeking a ticket to a promotion. If this individual thought you were being uncooperative or that your level of enthusiasm for the completion of the work was not what it should be, they didn’t hesitate to throw you under the bus with senior managers. These individuals, as well as your team client-support team colleagues, had input to your job performance evaluations. So one was obliged to always “put on a happy face” and do whatever one was asked to avoid negative assessments from coworkers and colleagues.

Further, I found there was very little direction from management in how many tasks were to be performed. It's a lot of demanding to get things done without much direction, which is fine as far as avoiding micro-management. Perhaps because of my years of experience my colleagues and managers felt they didn’t have to give me much direction, but most of the time I felt like I was out on an island figuring most things out by myself. Colleagues were so busy getting their assigned work done, and ensuring that they got their 42 billable work hours each week, that I didn’t want to bother them for help or direction on how to complete some tasks. This, as you might imagine, led to dissatisfaction with work and afraid to ask for help. 

Management is required to constantly be bringing in new business and they couldn’t be working business development if they were always answering “stupid questions” from subordinates or explaining to superiors why a particular employee wasn’t functioning at 100 percent.

On my team, the team manager was located in another state. We held daily staff meetings by conference call and she would actually be on-site in the client support role only a couple of days each month. That wasn’t really a sufficient amount of time to get to know me very well or to know what my strengths were so that I could be given tasks appropriate to my experience. 

I was an 80 percent disabled veteran when I left military service. This required that I have numerous appointments for health care for various medical issues, most frequently during work hours. I tried to schedule as many of the appointments during pre-work or after work hours, but that was not always possible. Paid time off with BAH is rare and there are NO DESIGNATED SICK DAYS. So, I found myself always in a running battle with both my client site manager and my career manager over my needs to take time off. I was lectured more than once about how my absences from the workplace demonstrated a “lack of concern” for the client and for BAH and that I should stop such absences IMMEDIATELY. So, needless to say, my career manager was on my case about this CONSTANTLY. While hiring me may have helped BAH reach some goals for hiring disabled workers or disabled veterans, they were not happy or supportive of the time I had to take off for medical appointments. The career manager is the person who has nearly complete control over your career path and can force you down a road you don’t like if they don’t like you. I’m afraid that was one lesson I learned the hard way at BAH.

To stay 100 percent billable, I was never to be sitting at my desk waiting for someone to assign me work. If I was efficient with my time and completed tasks faster than was anticipated, I was expected to be eagerly seeking other work and the “right work.”

There is a lack of passion, culture, and real leadership. There is a ton of management. The "" Leadership"" team dusts off core values and ethics a couple times a year but doesn't live these or demonstrate them on a daily basis. The ""culture"" of the firms seems to be manufactured - a lot of people pretending there is a meaningful culture. It's not that there is a negative culture, it's just that it's very bland, neutral and not at all aligned to what the firm says it is.

Finally, I lost that TS/SCI clearance while working for BAH because I wasn’t engaged in work requiring such a clearance. BAH uses clearances to substitute for a National Agency Check and doesn’t assume custody of an employee’s clearance. Rather they allow unused clearances to “archive,” meaning an individual can lose their clearance because it is not being actively used."

3458,Booz Allen Hamilton,"More political than the Government with rapidly declining leadership, vision and culture",2016-07-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Mid-level managers (Associated and Lead Associates) keep the business running on a daily basis, are dedicated to their jobs and provide great mentorship for junior staff.

- Most junior staff are extremely talented and dedicated to their jobs.  While senior managers (Principals and above) are generally disengaged at the junior levels, there is still a lot of camaraderie among junior staff, e.g., after work happy hours, team building events, etc.

- The firm has many self-selectable career paths which enable staff to focus and grow in different areas, e.g., specific technical capabilities, business development, leadership, etc.

- The firm has extensive educational resources for junior staff to expand technical skills.  Each staff member receives $5k and 40 hours - annually - for internal or external training.

- Because many client sites are already full, many contracts offer the ability to work from home (some contracts even allow for 5 days/week).  

- Moderately competitive 401k plan with a 6% match.  Decent relocation packages are also provided on an as-needed basis.","- Only the top 5% of senior-most staff (Senior Associates and above) are eligible for annual bonuses.  

- To ensuring ongoing profitability, Senior leadership (Principals and above) frequently rely on administering Lack of Work (LOW) notices to junior staff when contracts end.  LOWs are 2-page letters from HR saying “[you] will be terminated in 2-3 weeks if you do not find new, billable work.”  Unfortunately, even well-managed teams and top-talent are subject to these notices as just a few weeks of non-billability can unhinge a team’s financials.  This creates a culture whereby “nobody is safe” at any moment in time.  If you’re interviewing with Booz, ask your hiring manager or recruiter to provide the number LOWs that were administered in the prior year.

- While the firm has made strategic acquisitions in the past and claims a heavy focus on innovation, the firm has not yet branded any truly innovative products/services outside of its existing contracts.  This occurs primarily because senior leadership struggles maintain proper focus between billability and investments.  For example, whenever investment projects start to take off, billability becomes an issue; whenever billability gets fixed, there’s never enough resources to continue on the investments.  As a result, most “innovations” at the firm never get past a 5-slide “kick-off deck” or a basic user prototype.

- Because of the relative unpredictability associated with Government contracts, the firm undergoes frequent re-orgs whereby senior staff (e.g., Principals and above) switch between technical practices areas, resulting in wide distribution of unqualified leadership across the firm.  Rarely will you find a team where its Senior Associate and/or Principal understand - or even have general technical knowledge in - the inner-workings of their projects, resulting in poor judgement calls, damage to project timelines and lower-quality client deliverables.  If you’re interviewing with Booz, throw a technical question at your prospective Senior Associate/Principal and carefully assess their response.

- The overall culture is extremely political.  At the Associate to Senior Associate level, there seems to be unnecessary focus on how much you network and make it “appear” to your leadership as though you’re engaged (read: the loudest mouth wins).  In some cases, low-billability teams are exempt from layoffs simply because their managers have been long-running buddies with their Principal or VP.  In contrast, other, less-connected teams may suffer layoffs because their Senior Associate and/or Principal are not well-networked with their newly-assigned leaders. This encourages new management to terminate existing staff and re-hire what they think are more qualified staff.  But, by this point, another re org will have occurred…

- Talent is eroding at lower levels because of existing attrition, aforementioned leadership challenges and lack of interesting work.  According to public sources, the firm’s employee base swelled up to 27k in 2014; however, it has now retracted back down to about 21k employees.  Be mindful that this is Government contracting and, despite the firm claiming a heavy focus on innovation, there are rarely opportunities to innovate within the context of a pre-established Government project.  Many of the top talent is now fleeing to smaller, more innovative tech firms, Deloitte and other consulting firms that don’t rely heavily on LOWs.

- Rather than allowing all consultants the opportunity to focus on innovation, the firm recently created a new business unit (read: more unnecessary silos) around innovation, product development and modern technical capabilities (e.g., data science).  Unfortunately, this “business unit only contains 5% of staff, leaving the other 90% to focus strictly on the billability of their existing contracts.  This creates numerous conflicts across internal teams who have somewhat similar skill sets, i.e., the “innovation team” perpetually wants to hire the best and the brightest, leaving only the leftover 95% to focus on existing, more-mundane projects.  

- Benefits have diminished since the company went public and they continue to decline every year.  For the previous 401k program, the firm would add an annual lump sum to your 401k equivalent to 10% of your gross salary; now, the 401k program is a basic 6% match.  Health benefits now consist of high cost, high deductible plans (for all employees below Principal level).  Annual merit increases and promotions are minimal relative to those of other firms.  The only way to get a significant salary-bump is to hand in your resignation and hope for the best.  If you’re interviewing with Booz, ensure your hiring manager has you confirmed for billable work.  To be even more specific, ask them exactly which date you will receive your first “B-number.”

- Senior leadership regularly hires junior staff with no true billability plans and they over-promise on job roles during the interviews. Many senior leaders also rely on resignations and fighting territory wars to artificially grow their areas of the business.  If the interview makes the job sound “too good to be true,” please do your due diligence and get verbal agreement on exactly which projects/clients you will be starting on day-1.  

- The firm has an aging account management and staffing model which puts unnecessary strain on Lead Associates and Senior Associates, effectively requiring them to work 5+ simultaneous jobs to be successful (e.g., ensuring the team is billable, hiring, fueling innovation, leading projects, writing proposals, etc.).  Further, Principals and VPs typically sit in meetings all day, rarely make face time with their teams and expect mid-level management to carry all of the workload/responsibility.  Through my tenure with the firm, I’ve never seen a Principal (or above) write a single word within a proposal or client presentation - they either delegate down or hire/fire to compensate.

- The firm’s resource management function is very different from other consulting firms and arguably broken.  While most companies’ resource managers are dedicated to aligning non-billable staff with billable work, Booz’ resource managers merely review staff availability lists with Senior Associates and Principals - it’s not in their job role to actually understand your team’s skills or contract needs.  This puts significant stain on all levels of management as they must regularly attend these “list reviews” with no actual action from the resource managers. 

- The firm broke off their overhead/operations business into a sub-company.  Because these staff are not client-facing (read: less profitable people are less valuable), almost all benefits for this sub-company (e.g., health, 401k) have been eliminated over the past few years."

The work is great experience, but you don't always get assigned to a project that perfectly aligns with your interests. That being said, you are responsible for finding your own projects, so you can switch after putting in some time on your first project. This can be kind of a blessing and a curse-- it's stressful to be responsible for finding your own work, but it's also nice to not get bogged down doing one thing for too long, and switching projects can be an opportunity to get involved in work that you're really interested in (if you can handle the stereotypically DC networking-required culture)."

3490,Booz Allen Hamilton,Not bad!,2016-06-18,4.0,Software Engineer,"- Very relaxed workplace.  Booz is not a bunch of ""suits"" anymore.  Casual attire now accepted unless you're client-facing.
- Super fun coworkers. Lots of social events with coworkers and some bills were picked up by Big Booz. 
- Fairly good pay for the area.
- Tons of learning opportunities.  They'll take you as far as you want to go in terms of learning and really emphasize personal development. 
- Definitely room to move up.  Promotions left and right.
- Fairly good benefits.
- Awesome work/life balance.  
- the SIG in Booz is always trying to take notes from Silicon Valley","- Not the most talented fellow engineers.  Some fresh grads were coming in without knowing how to use the terminal.  To be fair, Booz can get away with this because they honestly get paid to manual test their clients projects so Booz just throws their poor engineers at those projects.
- If it's not clear by the manual testing project noted above, Booz can have some seriously bad client project.  Ex. -  15 year old technologies that are hanging on by a thread.  Have fun sifting through 15 years of hacked together, poorly designed programming and trying to tack on another patch.
- Projects start and then inevitably die really painful slow deaths. Not much really comes from internal projects. 
- All the good engineers seem to leave after a year or so, leaving mostly bad hires to stick around.  Most likely, the longer someone has been an engineer at Booz, the worse they are.  
- Really easy for other devs to ""coast"" at Booz and not have to progress.

3497,Booz Allen Hamilton,It's great... For awhile,2016-06-25,2.0,Lead Associate,"- Opportunities to learn different skill sets. 
- Networking
- Ability to move around company of you don't like your role. 

I have been with Booz Allen for more than a decade. I have risen through the ranks and have a solid understanding of its culture, it's motivations, its clients and how to work within its ecosystem. 

Pros.... hmm there truly are many. Especially if you are coming from college, do not have a young family and are very hungry, having the flexibility to work long hours. 
I am actually thankful for all of the opportunities provided from my time at Bah. I have met a lot of really smart people and gone to many fascinating places and have done thing a people would only wish for.","- They have removed several holidays and our ""floating"" holiday. 
- Benefits are no longer competitive. 
- Work Life balance is awful. 
- Claiming that you can take training or use your Education benefit is a joke. 
- Teams are constantly shuffled from leadership to leadership to help ""develop"" whatever capability is hot at the time. 
- Internal processes differ from team to team and are at the discretion of the Career Manager. 
- if you can't perform your job using the standard issued Booz Allen laptop, you're out of luck. Trying to get your team to purchase equipment that are industry standards externally, feels much like you would imagine presenting a case to congress. 
- I feel their decision to move to ""hoteling"" destroyed the sense of team that used to exist. 

The work life balance at Booz Allen is not very good. On average you are required to work 42 hour work weeks (the 2 extra hours supposedly make up for the training you'll never be able to take. But the pressure your leadership will put on you will far exceed that. I have had many pay periods in which I have put in 60, 70+ hours a week. I have had to spend the night on more nights than I would like to admit to meet deadlines with a short turn. 

The promotion process is truly up to the leadership of your team. Regardless of meeting and consistently working at all of the firm provided criteria for the competencies at the next level, how high-performing you are, the amount of staff you manage, the amount of money you bring to your team or how many awards you've won, if your leadership doesn't think you belong at the next level, then you'll never be promoted. 

They don't value employees who have been with the firm for a very long time and bring an extensive understanding of government clients and solutions. I have a close friend who has been with the firm for almost 20 years. He has only been promoted once (not uncommon - you can choose to stay at your level and not move up). He has been awarded many times by various teams for his participation to projects over the years and has never been a discipline or behavior risk. Bottom line, he is solid and I would use him on every project if I could. His only true raises have been ""cost of living"" raises over the years. Since he has been there so long, his ""rate"" has gotten too expensive for contracts. And because they can't let him go for any other reasons like performance, discipline etc... Management has been ""drying"" up his work and offering him opportunities which he can't consider (for example, in a whole other geography).  After his work has dried up his work, he will be given a lack of work notice. Unless he's placed on a ""long-term"" contract he will be let go. 

Booz Allen used to really be the greatest place to work for. Unfortunately, that is no lager the case. Expect to be worked like a dog, treated as if you are never working hard enough regardless of hours. Expect to get emails and phone calls late into the evening and over weekends that will require your attention. 

During the hiring process they will talk about all of the great benefits like insurance and the education credit. I know terms of insurance, I pay more out of pocket now than I ever have. For the education, you will only be ""reimbursed"" for it after your leadership has approved that it is a skill you'll be able to apply toward your client service offering. And if they do approve it, you will still be on h hook to paying for it and they will pay you back. 

As time has progressed it has also become more cut throat. Don't expect to lead a team unless your team leads move into a new role or you develop a ""new service offering""."

This can easily lead to consistent 50-60 hour work weeks, sometimes more.  Expect a few 70 hour work weeks.  Everything you do that is NOT billable work you will have to make up on your own time, evenings, weekends, vacations, all-nighters.  I've been in th workforce for over 30 years post-degree, and Booz Allen is the only place since college where I've had to pull all-nighters.  

Another con ... The quality (low) of some project managers.  Not only in skills (people skills seem to be lacking among many) but in an overriding sense of entitlement and better-than-thou attitude.  Makes working on some projects unbearable.  

The performance assessment system is a joke.  It is a 360 assessment, but everyone knows who wrote what about them ... Thus, those poor quality people get rated far too leniently because who wants their PM (or any coworker for that matter) to have a personal vendetta against them?  

Finally, since the hotelling concept, everyone works at home and there is complete loss of comraderie and group cohesion and no friendships are formed beyond work related phone calls and emails.  Very sad. 

Many in here reported on the loss of benefits. Yes, very true. But for me I would take a pay cut to have the other coins I mentioned above ironed out.  Just couldn't take it anymore, left after 6 years."

In an unfortunate turn of events, when I got to the work site, I found that I was instead the bottom-rung hourly worker bee in an administrative office with no number-crunching computers, no scientific software, and no database, and that my work isn't actually funded and the contract expires in a few months. I was also not-so-politely informed that my business opinions are not, shall we say, prudent to express. I know it sounds like I must have run over the President's dog, but no, nothing like that happened; it was just one of those bait and switch business situations. I know that they did need my resume in order to try to obtain funding, so perhaps that explains the bait and switch."

You work with great colleagues and are always challenged to go above and beyond in your work.  Working in a multi-contractor setting, I take pride being a part of Booz as I truly feel the firm gives you tools to outperform others.  

Very happy with my PTO and holidays accrual.  Most teams in the firm are VERY flexible with scheduling and work/life balance.","Booz loves to say that they hire your for a career and not a job.  Overall, I'd say this is true.  However, the increase of Lack of Work letters (layoffs) and previous cuts from a few years ago demonstrates that things have changes since BAH went public.  They are about the bottom-line albeit probably not as bad as other contractors. 

While the 401k is better than most it is not what it used to be.  The previous program made BAH a differentiator.  Now it's only slightly better. 

The health benefits have taken a huge hit since JAN2015. The employee's contribution has increased about 20% and out of pocket expenses have skyrocketed since DEC2014.  The switch to more of a Hoteling firm has led to cost efficiencies, but the ""Booz Allen Culture"" has been lost.  

Wages have stagnated along with the economy, so wage growth is slow depending on your level.  Lastly, very easy to get lost on client site and miss out on firm initiatives and growth.   You have to be proactive to be noticed and make your own opportunities."

Heaven for the principals.,Old Booz is gone and will never come back. It's a revolving door with a charge code. If the consultant has no charge code then he/she will get a lack of work notice and get kicked out in heart beat.

I'll say I've worked for two Fortune 100 ""Top companies to work for"": Quiktrip, the gas station and Booz Allen Hamilton. I'll say that if you, as an employee, value leadership that cares about you, invests in your education and advancement, and actively listens to complaints and suggestions, you should pick the gas station. 

A lot of reviews on here pin point Booz's failures when they went public and senior leadership began catering to shareholders, which is very true. Decentralized leadership (who the employee has never actually personally worked with) absolutely does lead to loss of human capital that will eventually create professional generation gaps across the firm as people are given lack of work statements, are fired, or are let go. 

Every experience is different, but I would only suggest Booz as a transitory job and not as a career.

3639,Booz Allen Hamilton,Not a great place for a long term commitment,2016-03-29,3.0,Associate,"I decided to work for Booz Allen because of the chance to work with some interesting technologies and projects, including biometrics and systems requiring high security.","The company is a consulting firm and their employee model is one where an employee works on an ""engagement"" which is a contract that can have a varied duration. At the end of the contract, the employee is responsible for finding another engagement within the company and if they cannot do so within two weeks, they can be fired. Management has no responsibility. There are a lot of opportunities for work, BUT 99% of them require relocation, which is not an option for everyone. Frankly, they don't pay enough to make a relocation like that worthwhile, especially given the short term nature of most of the work. The company really does not invest in its employees. They say they will pay for training courses, but then the money is never available. Even if you do take training, you have to make up the hours in additional billable work.  

The 401K match only occurs once a year, not quarterly. The upshot is that if an employee leaves in the middle of the year, they can kiss any portion of the match good bye. I don't know any other company that does that.

The company talks a good game about ethics and values, but I have seen senior management make decisions where they then require employees to lie to customers."

It's a firm with a heart, not just a checkbook, and it has supported me through many different stages of my life, from being single, to married, to parenthood, to divorced parent raising children. I worked for many years in the office, but now the firm allows me to telecommute which has been wonderful. The work is interesting and challenging, we have a strong culture of diversity, I love that we're in Working Mother magazine's ""100 Best Companies"" Hall of Fame and that the number of women hired and promoted to senior levels keeps growing significantly. There are clear paths for advancement and the benefits are amazing (the firm helps pay for adoptions! They match 6% of your contributions to your 401K! Onsite fitness centers! Childcare discounts! Great leave policies! So much more.) I love the people, the flex-work opportunities, the huge focus on the health of employees, and the culture where we work hard but have fun too... lots of fun employee events, contests, networking opportunities, family events, etc. I really like our new CEO too. He worked his way up through the company (started as an intern in Argentina 2 decades ago), he's very personable, and he's a strong proponent of diversity. I've worked at Booz Allen so long that I sometimes take the firm's benefits and culture for granted, but when I talk with friends at other companies I'm reminded just how great I have it.","I know the economy took a hit nationwide and Booz Allen did a great job keeping staff and benefits, but raises have been pretty low across the board for a few years."

You are given an experienced career manager who gives you insider knowledge and paves a way for you to begin career development not just thrown out there to fend for yourself. You meet talented hardworking individuals who for the most part are friendly and helpful.","I would like to say that this is solely my experience not to be generalized for all others who work at the firm as I would imagine some may have better experiences. The main problem I have with the firm is the lack of positions available for junior staff with no experience or security clearances. Most junior projects you apply to want a minimum of 1 year experience and/or a security clearance both of which are hard to attain as a recent university grad with no prior work experience. Majority of your time is spent sitting around doing nothing except struggling to find a project and doing mediocre tasks that no one wants to do (planning dinners for management, planning hiring events, getting the pizza at the door etc). Company in general is really sloppy and miscommunication occurs way too often (hiring managers don't respond to your emails, interviewers skip or forget to interview you, you are promised a position but then find out said position doesn't exist etc). In reality unless you are a seasoned professional with a minimum of 3 years experience and an active security clearance it will be incredibly difficult to succeed at this firm.  To put the icing on the cake the firm tries to push all of their employees to get ""billable"" meaning when time is running out you will be scrambling to find a project that barely fits your skill set just so you can become billable and not be let go. This isn't an environment for solid career development. If you are a recent university grad thinking about joining this firm reconsider and exhaust all other possible options first."

Employees have a sense of pride for working for this company especially while it was growing quickly.,Mostly Federal contracting and consulting. Very little commercial opportunities.

Booz Allen has a forward leaning leadership team, supporting exciting corporate growth initiatives, creating more creativity in the workplace. Surrounded by VERY smart people who are empowered to implement new ideas, and deliver top-notch service to clients. By getting engaged in the firm's forums and functional communities, and connecting with leadership (at all levels), you can shape your own career and grow with the firm. But the responsibility is on you to stay connected.  The company is committed to getting better and improving, and takes employee feedback seriously. Culture is very collaborative- it's expected that you will support projects others initiate (which can be a con, unless you're initiating the work).","It's probably like this at any consulting firm: we are always developing new products, focusing on different problems, hiring new people. There is a lot of ""new"" which can at times make it hard to stay focused on the long-term projects and priorities that are important but not as splashy. Mid-career managers need access to more training and support. Hoteling has basically destroyed my organizational skills and made it harder to feel connected to others who aren't on my immediate team, but I appreciate the flexibility of working in different locations as needed."

If you like a exciting work in a dynamic environment with great leadership, you will be impressed by the company.  The benefits are competitive with other consulting firms and you will have an opportunity to hone your consulting skills in many different fields.  One of the big plus's for me is the company's commitment to Community Engagement and giving back.  We support many different nonprofit organizations with a particular focus on veterans, wounded warriors and STEM programs, but we have also supported the Arts!","Booz Allen's primary clients are the US Government.  If you have an interest in working with different parts of the government, you will find many exciting opportunities where you can make a difference.  If you are looking for short commercial engagements, though we have a commercial practice, it's not as large."

Working internally as part of the infrastructure, flexibility around being able to telecommute and work life balance in general was a huge deciding factor in coming to work for Booz, especially as a new mother. Performance recognitions are a priority for some and it feels great to have your performance recognized.","Hierarchy is critical (at least internally, not so much for those that are client facing) and impacts your effectiveness when you're ""level"" doesn't carry enough weight or authority, regardless of your skills or experience. Even though there is flexibility to work remotely, there is still an expectation to be in person fairly often but with the limited amount of hoteling space available, it's difficult to find space to work when in the office."

3710,Booz Allen Hamilton,Depends on your manager,2016-03-16,4.0,Associate,Booz Allen has been an awesome place to learn and grow and expand my skill set. I've had a few fantastic managers who mentored me from a recent college grad to a mid-level manager. I've had great experiences and opportunities and have been able to attend industry conferences and events and learn so much. My current team has amazing work-life balance.,"I've had really awful managers who were cutthroat and interested only in their own promotion and using my work to bolster their reputation. This team also had no work-life balance and asking to take time off was frowned upon. I've seen this across the firm in pockets. There are some people who will step on anyone beneath them in their rise up the ladder. I don't think most people are like this, but there's something in the water that doesn't stop these people from being like this."
3711,Booz Allen Hamilton,Associate,2016-03-13,2.0,Associate,"Work life balance, especially if you work off the client site.","Greatness is gone, they try to live off the brand name now. Causes - Split with commercial side, Private Equity cost controls, and focus mainly on quarterly performance after IPO. Salaries are capped to keep them competitive for contracts and you can't advance unless your boss advances. Now just another defense contractor."
3712,Booz Allen Hamilton,Work-Life Balance,2016-03-11,4.0,Analyst,"I've completed my first year with BAH and overall I am very happy. The level of professionalism and appreciation the company has displayed makes me satisfied with my work, which segues to a happier family life at home. I've worked for several large companies and it was always been the same MO, ""work-life balance is paramount"", yet I always found myself doing work at home, staying at the office long hours and being stressed out when I wasn't at work. BAH truly does take work-life balance to heart and it’s not tongue in cheek when you're told your efforts are appreciated and noticed. Wages and benefits are competitive, but the true value of working at Booz Allen Hamilton is the environment, opportunities to advance, networking and finally the company culture/value system. BAH is the benchmark for consulting and is the catalyst for the success of several Fortune 500 companies and Government Departments. If one commits to doing their job well, being professional, adhering to the company's core values and continuing their education, there are no limits to where you can land.","The company is very government contract-centric and the headquarters is located in the D.C. area. If you have a desire to climb the corporate ladder, relocating to the D.C. area will have to be a pit stop or possibly a final destination. If you don’t mind harsh winters and living in a city with the most functional drunks in the country, this shouldn't deter you."
3713,Booz Allen Hamilton,Mechanical Engineer,2016-03-08,3.0,,"Good pay, okay benefits, can be a flexible work environment, but not so much at this office.","Mostly managers in this firm, usually around 4 managers to 1 person, per project. Always seem to be answering to someone, rather than solving the engineering problems at hand.

Expect to work all hours and weekends...without reward.  If these surges were for short-lived, mission critical activities - I'd get it.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  These are typically random data calls from managers who are unorganized, unprepared and unable to manage priorities.

3804,Booz Allen Hamilton,Tremendous Company,2016-01-04,5.0,Lead Associate,"Booz Allen is one of the best places to work in the government contracting sector. Despite recent cutbacks (attributed to government budget uncertainty and a corporate transition to a publicly held company), Booz offers a strong benefits package and competitive salaries.  What's more refreshing is the corporate culture.  As a consulting business, the company is committed to developing talented, providing avenues of self improvement, and a retaining skilled/marketable employees.  Contrasted with an industry that looks at employees only as project-specific resources, this employee-focused culture enables employees to define their own career paths and creates an entrepreneurial climate where good ideas are generally rewarded.  

The company is forward-thinking and self-correcting.  Leaders emphasize employing best practices to deliver a unique working experience.  The company embraces teleworking (where contractual constraints allow) and provides employees with a wealth of resources, intellectual capital, and training to build a world-class workforce.  

In summary, as far as government contractors are concerned, the company is a breath of fresh air and offers a unique experience that many enjoy.","Booz' entrepreneurial climate isn't for everyone.  Some interpret the focus on self-improvement and networking as a sink-or-swim culture.  Networking at Booz is built around the ability to offer an in-demand service or capability across project or market boundaries.  It's not necessarily about self-promotion as some interpret it.  It's just about understanding how your skills translate to other projects or markets.  This becomes more complicated if one's career management team is not actively engaged in helping the employee understand how their skills can be useful in other project/markets; the team doesn't actively search for follow-on work.  

So, if you are more inclined to focus on providing common solutions in a particular field, say computer systems administrator without having to contribute thought leadership, building technical/market expertise, and working across projects, Booz Allen may not be the right place to work."

- BAH prefers to hire externally rather than allowing current employees the chance to move around
- Be prepared to use your PTO/VAC time to cover bad weather days when the Fed offices are closed
- Stuffy, uptight dress code.  Dress shirts/pants mandatory, ties were mandatory depending on the management, however it didn't seem like the rules applied to everyone equally.
- In the event of bad weather and the Fed offices were closed, BAH would penalize YOU for that by forcing you to use your VAC/PTO time to cover that day.  I've worked at different Fed contractors prior to BAH and have never encountered this ridiculous tactic.  Previous employers would code the day as a holiday, company overhead or a regular workday for the employee
- Bait and switch. When I was hired, I was hired for a position that I applied for and interviewed for, at least that's what I thought. 

I was at the 2-day orientation seminar at the VA headquarters when a guy in the group (someone attending the orientation as well) approached me and introduced himself and stated where he will be working and the office (same office as me). He was hired for a completely different job function and area than I was, but the same office.  The guy recognized my name  (name tags we all were wearing) which is what prompted the introduction. 

He then said I'll be working with him as well in the same group. I corrected him and said ""oh no, I was interviewed for and hired for (blank position). You must have me mixed up with someone else"". 

He said he didn't have me mixed up and I'll be doing 'job ABC' instead of 'job XYZ' (the position I was hired for). It turned out he was correct. 

I learned about the initial deceptive practices regarding my position of this company from a stranger coming up to me at the VA employee orientation and informing me I'm not going to be working in the position I was hired for. That's HOW I found out.

The manager I got was NOT the manager I interviewed with. I asked (different managers) why I was placed in 'job ABC' and not the job I was hired for. I do not think that's an unreasonable question. I never really got a clear answer, even after asking multiple times. I was told I would be phased into the position I was hired for down the road after an expected volume of work was cleared out (just 2-3 months max is what I was told).

The manager I was assigned to did not want me there from the beginning. His dislike for me was evident from the first moment I met him. Why did this person have a problem with me? No idea. The other people in the group (including the guy from orientation) were treated differently than I was. 

After a period of about 7 months (the volume of work was lowered in 'job ABC' where I was 'helping out') and not being phased into the role I was hired for I was told the position I applied for no longer existed and 'job ABC' (which I didn't like anyway) was being phased out. 

I ended being 'benched' for a while. During that time I found another job AWAY from BAH, gave a standard notice and got the hell out of there!

- They hire too many people it seems. Lots of lack of work notices are given after a while (less than a year in the offices I worked at). 

- Some of the people are nice to work with, but the vast majority have zero social/people skills.  

- They seem to hire a lot of younger, fresh out of school grads and work them to death. 

- Most of the employees at the office I worked at seemed uptight, highly stressed and agitated. I didn't get a chance to know many of them other than small talk in passing.

- The work/life balance mantra BAH likes to emphasize is complete BS. 

- I began to notice LOTS of BAH faces I would normally see in hallways, elevators and cubicles disappearing before I left (the last 6 months working there). I asked someone there whom I trust what's happening with these people disappearing and she told me either they're finding other jobs, or contracts aren't being renewed by the Feds or they're getting lack of work notices. 

- You will be set up for failure. Tasks will not be explained to you effectively and when you do something wrong (due to lack of guidance from management) they try to make you look incompetent. I would not be surprised if this is done to people intentionally.

The mentality is old school. Wear jeans for crying out loud. The majority of people at my location are sitting in cubicles most of the day (except to go to the bathroom, vending machine or lunch), what difference does the clothing make? Ridiculous. 

BAH lost a contract the week after I gave my notice which put a number of people on the bench with me. They were told the same thing as I was. We were told that 'WE' had to find ourselves other positions in the company to avoid a layoff. Management was zero help with this matter and they really could've cared less."

My fellow employees were a great group of people, which made going to work a pleasant experience.

This is a real detriment to the company that you are contracted to solve their problems. When your contract expires all the knowledge and synergy that you have created is gone. The next group that gets the contract must start from scratch to come together and make the project work.

3849,Booz Allen Hamilton,Former Military,2015-12-30,4.0,Associate,"Depending upon your office location, there are opportunities to work on a number of different projects that stretch you and make you stronger overall. The work is usually pretty interesting and the people are top-notch. It's not a bad company to work for.","If you get out of the military, recognize it's difficult to shake your last rank. What that means is if you leave as a master sergeant, it's hard to break into a leadership role in some offices because it's occupied by retired O5s and above. And while nobody overtly throws around their former ranks, it is often subtly referred to. 

Also remember that if you're working government/military contracts, you haven't joined ""The Corporate World"". You're still ""a military dude"" in the eyes of most corporate hiring managers. So, if you intend on transitioning to being a civilian completely, then this may not be the right choice for you."
3850,Booz Allen Hamilton,No Job Security - No Stability - Not a Real Career,2016-01-13,1.0,Senior Consultant,"Opportunity to work in a variety of fields that you may not originally be the most qualified.

Opportunity to move around.

Still has some name recognition.","1. No real job Security

2. No real long term positions left in the company

3. Have to scramble for a new position every 4-6 months

4. Glorified temp-agency, becoming more of an IT solutions provider

5. Easily moving around internally is not what Booz Allen claims it to be. 

You need to stay employed by a project team to keep your job, and this becomes harder the more you get promoted and the higher your salary gets. You become more ""expensive"" as your rate goes up, so it's hard to get that internal hire.

Most hiring managers don't want to hire internally, especially if they're making a business case for Senior Associate. You have to show that you're building the business, not just shuffling around existing talent. Priority is actually given to external hires!

This is not the Booz Allen Hamilton of yester-year, and anyone in the industry knows that. They've axed benefits, paid time off. 

The good talent is leaving in droves.

Job-Stability: I can't stress this enough. Get ready to always be looking for a job, once you join Booz Allen. A friend of mine observed ""It seems ever since you went to Booz Allen, you've been looking for a job.""

One new co-worker at Booz came from Accenture, and told me, inquisitively, ""You know, it's not really clear who it is that's responsible for keeping you billable. (employed)"" I had to admit grudgingly ""Well, just you.""  He expressed to me that they have what is known as an ""Engagement Manager"" of some sort, who actually is held accountable for keeping you billable when your project ends.

There are two ""resources"", if you can call them that, at Booz Allen to supposedly help you stay employed when your current project ends. 

One is the ""Career Manager"", which everybody has, but their job is not really to keep you billable. Being a Career Manager just consists of additional responsibilities on top of that person's regular job. They pretty much just dole out general guidelines and tips. 

The second is an internal department called ""Resource Management"", staffed by what are called ""Resource Managers"", but again, they are also not held accountable for actually getting people placed in jobs. All they do is give you lip service about reaching out on your behalf, and they can provide an extra layer of visibility if you're up against a Lack of Work (impending layoff) situation. It's got to be the easiest job in the world. I would love to have a job where I'm not held to any standard or held accountable for actual results. You can think of them as your college's career counselors (you know, the [usually] state employees who haven't had to look for a job in 20 years?)

Career growth: No one will really level with you about what it takes to be promoted. You can try to discuss with your leadership what concrete steps need to be taken, and gaps that need to be filled, but nobody will have that discussion with you.  They'll simply tout abstract ""Core Values"" and blame you for not understanding it what it takes."
3851,Booz Allen Hamilton,Limited Career Growth Opportunities,2015-12-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"BAH offers good internal training and opportunities for networking within the company. They also have a good tuition reimbursement program, as well as good commuter benefits.","Health Insurance Costs have increased dramatically, limited annual salary increases, limited career growth based on contract, constantly changing organizational structure with no added benefits to employees, flawed annual/year-round assessments (i.e.just because you get a promotion, does not mean you get a salary increase)"
3852,Booz Allen Hamilton,Lead Associate,2015-07-24,4.0,Associate,"I consistently feel like I work with the best and brightest.  The diversity of employee backgrounds brings rich value to project work and to the client.  If you need to augment your team's skill set with something else, you will absolutely find it either through your network or resource management.  I also consistently feel that the work we do is making an impact.","The company has changed a great deal since going public a few years ago.  Pressures on utilization have increased greatly - the amount of people getting a ""lack of work"" notice  has increased. People are not given adequate credit for all of the extra proposal/BD work they do on top of billable work... the pressure to be billable is higher, yet the expectation to do BD work  ""in your free time"" remains the same.  This makes work/life balance challenging at times. Additionally, the higher you are promoted, the more ""expensive"" you become... which makes it harder to stay billable (you will no longer be considered for certain roles, given your cost as a resource). It seems a strategy to pressure senior leaders to grow their teams, if we are over-hiring then letting people go a few months later. Benefits have changed dramatically for the worse and pay increases are nowhere near what they used to be.  The retirement plan and healthcare benefits are MUCH worse than they used to be (albeit still better than many other firms.)  You will be lucky if you get a 2% increase, so it does not keep pace with inflation certainly.  There are no bonuses. 
The firm is an extremely political place to work.  Your success is highly dependent on having a strong set of advocates and a big network.  There are many overlapping ""sandboxes,"" so you must be careful not to anger the wrong group of people."
3853,Booz Allen Hamilton,Good Place to Start,2015-12-28,2.0,Associate,This is a good company to get some experience under your belt.

Benefits are awful and raises are non-existent, yet you are required to take on more work as more people leave and are not replaced. You are always made to feel like you should be grateful that you have a job and that your a ""cost"" and not an asset to the company. My advice for anyone looking to work here is to come in, get your experience and leave."

3856,Booz Allen Hamilton,Excellent Firm,2015-12-06,5.0,Associate,"My experience with BAH has been wonderful.  BAH has a strong reputation with clients and other consulting firms as providing leading edge AA&S services to federal clients.  The firm also demonstrates its interest and push for talent management and human capital development: Job managers and career managers in my account group are engaged with employees, provide functional expertise to clients and employees, and the firm's culture is one that encourages sharing of cross-functional intellectual capital.  There are limitless opportunities for professional development and pursuit of personal interests that relate to one's functional area.  Compensation involves a total package approach, and my experience has shown a willingness for job managers to allow employees to accept other internal positions rather than standing in the way.","Direct compensation is a bit lower than other firms providing similar services, and bonuses are few and far between.  However, the direct labor rate is often based on specific contract ceilings and the time period during which an employee accepts a job.  It is also easy to feel disengaged from the firm when working exclusively on client site, but there are after hours networking events that can help mitigate that problem."

3859,Booz Allen Hamilton,Could be better,2015-12-17,3.0,Senior Consultant,Opportunities for growth and development. Pay is pretty good especially considering I don't have a degree (I do have experience to make up for it). Benefits are decent. Premiums for my family and myself are relatively affordable.,"Booz Allen Hamilton tells you during new hire orientation that the company is family-friendly and flexible, if you need to take time off don't hesitate to do so, and you can work from home too if you need to. What they don't tell you is none of this applies if you are working on a client site where you will be expected every day, between the core established hours, and if you take time off make sure your work is covered or there will be hell to pay later. This completely contradicts the fact that if you're out sick or had a family emergency you really aren't thinking about work, you're thinking about your family or getting over your sickness, but they'll still expect you to not drop the ball.

Micromanaging and the ""We're Booz Allen, we're the best and everyone else sucks and is incompetent"" mentality gets old quick. Be prepared to have someone looking over your shoulder when you do your work to make sure you don't screw it up. I'm pretty good with details and am a bit of a perfectionist but this is a whole other level. And also be prepared to take over client tasks that aren't being led by Booz Allen, just because your task lead or supervisor thinks Booz Allen could do a better job. Yeah, that'll go over well with the people who were actually brought on to manage the task.

Vacation and sick leave are lumped into one pot of time, so if you get sick often like me be prepared to not have any vacation time available to ummm, go on vacation. I am of the opinion that employees shouldn't have to sacrifice vacation time for being sick."

3908,Booz Allen Hamilton,20 years experience - new to consulting,2015-11-04,4.0,Chief Technologist,"Booz Allen is a firm that values it's people.  The desire for talent to develop and thrive feels genuine as well as consistent.  I know that at my level I don't deal with all of the realities that one might coming up from undergrad - but I have found the firm to have honest leadership, real interest in it's people and their capabilities, and genuine concern for work-life balance.  Realities being what they are consulting, especially Federal consulting can be challenging depending on different situations that come up - but the firm has made real commitment to keeping it's people through government shutdowns, economic slowdowns, and the shifting market in general.  I am new to the client-side of consulting, I have worked in the Big 4 previously on the services side, and I am enjoying the challenge of the transition and the impact of working directly with clients in the field solving big problems that face our citizens and their government.","If you have an open mind and are interested in being a consultant - meaning you want to learn how to be effective with clients and with your own team within the organization, and you are not afraid of hard work, Booz Allen is a great place to be.  It is still my first year so I am reserving the right to further refine the 'cons' of the experience but so far I am learning a ton, working a lot, and developing lots of relationships."

There isn't any growth or direction and hard to go from core staff to client facing staff when in the past it was looked upon as a good move towards anyone's career. Since so many individuals are leaving than being hired, causing more work on individuals who are currently with the firm. Not sure where the firm is going but do not recommend at this time for anyone to join."

Client facing staff are very supportive of each other.","Cons are similar to any company of this size, disconnect between management and staff is often cited. The main issue is it seems that sometimes the tools/resources provieded to client serving employees are cutting edge and feel like you have a great opportunity to serve clients, but sometimes you can tell the company made an internal ""business"" decision and don't provide the same level internal quality to client facing staff that external staff are known to provide and give the company a good reputation (generally)."

The medical coverage used to be great but declined significantly. All three of the available health and dental plans have high deductibles. Tuition benefits are decent ($5000 reimbursement per year).
Job Security: One of the downsides of the great job security was that it seemed very difficult for management to terminate people who underperformed. You and your colleagues are then forced to pick up the slack for people who should not be on your team.
Work/Life Balance: Our team would often work over 40 hours per week. You constantly feel like your work takes precedence over your life. There seems to be little attention to any type of work/life balance.

Advancement based on merit is not common but more of a business decision and unless one asks for advancement and then works with a plan to achieve agreed upon goals, promotions are rare.

3986,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Decent company, but little upward mobility (client side employee)",2015-10-06,3.0,Information Security Associate,"Decent benefits, competitive salary (in IT), and mostly good atmosphere if you want to stay in your current position outside of management. Every client will be different, but mine allowed telework for my entire current 4 year period and Booz has no issues with that.","Proposal work!! If you want to move up at all in Booz you MUST do proposal work and help bring in business. Most proposal work is done at night and weekends AFTER you have completed your daily job for your client, and team calls typically take place 7 days a week between 6-8 PM for the duration of a proposal, and there are absolutely no incentives for participating in proposal work other than possible promotion some day. Typically people work their day job and proposals on nights and weekends for years hoping for a promotion. Only senior management receives bonuses based on proposal wins. Unless you want to be married to work, consider this a job without upward mobility.

Horrible employees get rewarded by being left alone. My management has tried to have 2 employees that telework and simply do not contribute fired on multiple occasions but HR always blocks it. In our unique situation these employees could have another full time job and no one would ever know. In the end the company doesn't care about individual performance as long as the team gets the job done. If worthless employees refuse to contribute its just on everyone else to get the job done with no consequence to bad employees."

4002,Booz Allen Hamilton,Associate,2015-09-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Overall this company is great, at least it was when I first started in 2007. The DC office was great because I had never seen so many smart people.  I was always wondering how I tricked them to allow me in. In 2014 the health benefits were top notch but I have heard they may have changed. The profit sharing ECAP used to be great but that was also changing.  So when I was with this company my experience was great. Perks were always fun with great parties, happy hours, and baseball events. Tampa Leadership at the time I left were great people and would do anything they could for you (as long as YOU felt comfortable talking to them). When I first left the DC office, the leadership in McLean were instrumental in helping me move back to my hometown in Florida. Best experience with work life balance, if you work in the Kennedy office.  Otherwise if you are client site, is the client requires it, you can't usually work from home. Pay was very competitive for the Tampa area.  Performance Appraisal process is fair and thoughtful.  Very much aligned to great companies and how they rate their employees.  Very goal oriented appraisals.  Tuition reimbursement is a great bonus!","In Tampa specifically, management was very military-male donminated with little female leadership. Management didn't make it to client-site locations very often, which was not good for morale. Client work was starting to dwindle making many employees nervous about finding their next project. There is a lack of certain type of work in Tampa, which makes it difficult to move to different contracts if you are burnt out or thinking of leaving. The company was quick to give Lack of Work (LOW) notices with may people being let go. I saw a lot of this the last 3 years of my employment. The client site employees didn't always feel connected to the corporate Kennedy office, which also didn't help morale. They are slowly losing what made them special as a company and premier consulting firm. This started to happen after going public. Budgets for fun activities and such is disappearing, which was always one of the perks. In order to advance in this company, you have to be available 24/7 by your phone and email and be involved in responding to RFPs. And even if you are a hard worker and involved, you can be passed up for promotions because you would then become too expensive for your contract and price yourself out of work. So there is a balance of wanting to become leadership and having a contract that fits your work and pay grade."
4003,Booz Allen Hamilton,Senior Consultant,2015-09-28,4.0,,Very impactful work and constantly changing which keeps it interesting.,Some of the little perks have disappeared over the last few years.

4005,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great Resume Builder,2015-09-23,3.0,Consultant,My colleagues were intelligent people who were great to learn from. There is real opportunity to continue education as they offer tuition support to employees. There is also a pretty flexible work-from-home policy that adds to the appeal. Professionalism is important.,"As an aspiring software developer, I felt under-utilized and unchallenged in my endeavors.  Working for the government meant using antiquated tools that would no position me well for modern work environments. I was an eager learner and hard worker, but never felt that the effort that I put in came back to me in the form of accolades, salary, nor recognition."
4006,Booz Allen Hamilton,Future is cloudy...,2015-09-26,3.0,,"Excellent co-workers, depending on project. Good initial salaries. Variety of opportunities to learn new skills. Great way for people early in their career to learn how to navigate corporate / government environments. Nice company to list on your resume, still carries a level of prestige (though not as much as it had been).","Merit increases are anemic, make sure you negotiate a good salary up front - you won't make up for deficits over the years. Senior management is disengaged with staff, they don't know what their staff does, who their staff is, and how their decisions will affect the people actually working for them. Not as competitive as they had been, so opportunities are not as plentiful. Benefits are being systematically pared down to nothing - health benefits are not even competitive in the market. Retention practices are abysmal, and therefore BAH is losing longtime employees, and losing organizational knowledge. This used to be a wonderful company when I started years ago...now it's just another body shop. No more work-life balance, no more employee consideration."

4008,Booz Allen Hamilton,Associate,2015-10-17,1.0,Associate,People you work with (your teammates).  The work is satisfying.,"Once the firm went public more and more people were given ""lack of work"" notices.   Mine was on my birthday (nice touch) though I worked probably some 50 hours/week and had a tough job, but fell victim to the ""reduce higher salaries to make the bid proposal more appealing.""  The firm used to have core values and people respected management.  However, I'd say in the San Diego office the turnover is probably some 40 people/month out of an 800-person workforce.  As long as you are bringing in money, you are relatively safe.  Disappointing the loyalty, from the lower-level employees to the firm (high) is not reflected by upper-level management (so low it doesn't register)."
4009,Booz Allen Hamilton,A good place to start. Then get out.,2015-09-02,3.0,Associate,"Booz Allen still attracts some of the smartest and hard-working people around. To a great extent, it is possible to shape your career if you are a tireless networker who keeps an ear open at all times for new opportunities. There's also a good amount of growth at the Consultant to Associate level, with the opportunity to gain managerial experience relatively quickly. After five years at the firm, I was managing a team. This is experience that would be very difficult to come by in government and other firms.

The retirement match is one of the best in the contracting world with a 100% match up to 6% of salary. The BIG catch is that the company match is done only once per year, and if you are not an employee on December 31st, you don't receive any of the match. Tuition reimbursement is generous at $5000 per year.","The firm is so focused on its bottom line and return to shareholders that it is nickel and diming its employees to death. Attrition is VERY HIGH, something approaching 50%. We went from having excellent health insurance to a high-deductible plan that doubled my monthly health insurance costs. Management moved to a hoteling system whereby employees reserve space on a daily basis. This would be ok, except that management took way 30% of the available space to give to senior leadership as permanent offices. Where are we supposed to work? Annual salary increases are meager. A rating of exceeds gets a paltry 3%. A promotion gets 7% without an adjustment to the new responsibilities of the new title. Being promoted to Lead Associate is akin to a death sentence because there won't be any contracts that can afford you. Then there's the constant fear of being laid off. Two week of no billable hours and you're fired. That's precisely why employees look for jobs elsewhere as well as inside the firm when their contracts are up. There's nothing to foster any kind of company loyalty."

Recently the company has taken steps to offer alternative career paths to those who are less interested in the business development/proposal work and want to focus on more technical/domain specific work where they can utilize their subject matter expertise.","Like most companies there are things you need to deal with to ""navigate"" a successful career. Without a decent mentor it will be difficult to know this.

Resource Management: The resource management process, on paper, is a great way for the firm to align the skills and interests of their employees to new opportunities once they are not billable. However in the interest of getting billable work quickly employees are urged to be ""flexible"" so while you may be qualified for a role you may not necessarily be interested in it (doesn't align with your short term or long term career goals, commute is not beneficial for you.....etc). Different management teams will handle this differently but for the most part there is a significant amount of pressure to accept an assignment sooner (rather than continue looking for a better fit) so as to mitigate overhead charging. Also, while employees are encouraged to be the CEO of their own careers the expectation is to work their current assignment through the period of performance. This is a bit conflicting because employees may find a role that is a better fit for them vs their current assignment. 

Advocacy: Simply put if you do not have a strong advocate in management your pay increase and potential for promotion will be disappointing. This may pose a problem to those who work on client site full time and are limited by how much face to face interaction they can have with management at the local Booz Allen office. High performing individuals with excellent annual reviews (including amazing feedback/reviews from the client) can end up with standard pay increases. If you want to be promoted it needs to be clear to your career manager so that both sides can knowledge the milestones you need to hit for the next level. Just doing good work will not cut it. Again, even if you do both of these things well your efforts can impaired if your brand is not strong with your management."

4052,Booz Allen Hamilton,"What they say and what they do, The Dichotomy of BAH",2015-09-14,1.0,Associate,"People, always great people from various backgrounds who work hard serving clients on a daily basis.","Promotions:  Non-existent for most employees as there is no written formal path to promotion.  It is entirely upon your leadership to submit a request and verify that your market can absorb the increase of your new salary (2-5%), If this is not possible you will sit at the same level for several years.

Salary: Barter high when you come on board because salary increases are extremely sparse at the lower employee level, most receive between 0-2% a year.  Discussions to increase salary according to increased client work, obtaining an advanced degree or certification will not result in any increase, sadly.

Bonuses: These only occur at the Senior Associate level and higher, so if you spend nights and weekends working on proposals and doing business development, you only helped pad their compensation packet for the year.  You will receive nothing for your time other than a thank you E-mail.

Survey: Results are dismal in several areas primarily with salary, compensation, bonuses, and the like.  Senior leadership has touted transparency and fixes, but to date hasn't even briefed the results other than a snippet of the results that were massaged in order to shape the message.

Career assessment: Career assessment has no linkage to yearly salary adjustment, it is merely a paper drill to make someone feel like they are helping.  Most career managers within the company are the same level as the people they are managing, which makes it a little difficult to recommend ho to succeed from the same hole.  Most career managers are just time card monitors who check to see if you have done your time daily.  Sad excuse for career progression, definitely not a Google or Amazon type of work environment.

Transparency: Near zero, once in awhile the CEO  sends out an E-mail to state where he has been and what he has been up to, very little material on who he saw and what they were doing.  Very little leadership engagement with employees, most have never seen there leadership at all.  Like an episode of Undercover Boss in reverse, most couldn't tell you who their leadership were at the 3rd level above them, since they have never received an E-mail from them nor seen them.  Surveys come out once a year, but they are pre-populated with weighted answers that phrase questions such as, do you like X or love X, do you think you leadership has done a fantastic job or great job.  Very poor survey approach with no ability to capture what is wrong with the company.  No ability to either capture the issues nor to effect change on them if captured.  Left hand of the firm has no clue what the right hand is doing.  Nor regard for anyone at the associate and below level, if the CEO wanted to know what was going on within the firm he would grab individuals from remote sites, client sites and little no name sites with 10 people and ask them how he could help, but nope, its picture time, let me go to the big locations and get some golfing in. No anonymity to report issues as evidenced by the numerous posts on this site."

Overly weighted with salespeople who promise the world that can't be delivered, and with very tedious ""butts in seats"" positions at government agencies. The interesting work in between (except cyber and analytics) is few and far between because it's not what we're known for. The politics and fiefdoms affect everything. The attribute most valued is time at BAH, which can frustrate smart people with good experience coming from the outside. You'll see top performers with a dozen years of excellent experience and graduate degrees be hired from the outside at the same level (Senior Consultant) as a top performer a year out of undergrad who spent that year at BAH. It's changing, but right now there's a premium for joining out of undergrad and putting in time, a kind of grade inflation, that doesn't map to mid career hires.

High caliber of employees, colleagues and teammates. Supportive team environment. Fosters individual growth and development. Good benefits. Ethical, value-oriented, supportive organizational culture.

The firm is very supportive to employees who have to relocate due to military family moves or other reasons employees have to relocate.

Great access to upper and senior management, including Partners.","When I first started 10 years ago, the firm had separate vacation and sick leave banks, and the sick leave was UNLIMITED (yes, you read that correctly). They then switched to one bank of Paid Time Off (PTO) to use for sick time and vacation, so you are basically penalized by draining any potential vacation time you have if God forbid you get really sick and have to use up all your PTO due to illness. On top of that, the amount of PTO time is not very generous and is accrued based on your career level and years of service. So, if you are an entry level consultant and just starting out, forget about earning much vacation time until you have a few years under your belt and promote to higher levels. The firm also promotes a work-life balance, but in my experience this varies by individual team, and I've seen little work-life balance demonstrated."

Pressures on utilization have increased greatly - the amount of people getting a ""lack of work"" notice has increased. People are not given adequate credit for all of the extra proposal/BD work they do on top of billable work... the pressure to be billable is higher, yet the expectation to do BD work ""in your free time"" remains the same. This makes work/life balance challenging at times. Additionally, the higher you are promoted, the more ""expensive"" you become... which makes it harder to stay billable (you will no longer be considered for certain roles, given your cost as a resource). It seems a strategy to pressure senior leaders to grow their teams, if we are over-hiring then letting people go a few months later. Benefits have changed dramatically for the worse and pay increases are nowhere near what they used to be. The retirement plan and healthcare benefits are MUCH worse than they used to be (albeit still better than many other firms.) You will be lucky if you get a 2% increase, so it does not keep pace with inflation certainly. There are no bonuses. The firm is an extremely political place to work. Your success is highly dependent on having a strong set of advocates and a big network. There are many overlapping ""sandboxes,"" so you must be careful not to anger the wrong group of people."

I was promoted twice within 4 years in terms of level (Senior Consultant to Associate to Lead Associate) and twice in terms of position (team leader to deputy PM to PM) and was never able to achieve a salary commensurate with my work and responsibilities.  As a PM I was paid less than the people answering the phones for the client on the contract I managed.

4089,Booz Allen Hamilton,Working at Booz Allen,2015-08-13,3.0,,OKay pay and benefits. Your time at Booz Allen depends your manager.,The management does not help much in placing you on project. You have to be proactive in getting your next project. The projects I worked on delivered littlevalue to the client
4090,Booz Allen Hamilton,Booz Allen survives on their name alone,2015-08-28,1.0,Senior Consultant,Having the name Booz Allen Hamilton on your resume impresses recruiters. There are probably good teams at Booz Allen but I've never encountered any.,"Booz Allen operates on a team structure where the Senior Associates dictate the culture of their domain. Of the four teams I was on, one Senior didn't care about the people under him, another only cared about how you contributed to proposals (not how well you supported the client), a third created a toxic work environment and flat out told me he would not help me find another contract after I said I was looking for another one, and the last one was dishonest and met with government officials to get insider information on upcoming contract information.

Working our way down the management structure to the Lead Associates, the story doesn't get any better. On one team, the Lead was friends with certain people outside of work. Those people were looked after and got the promotions and bonuses. For everyone else, it's not hard to fabricate some excuse as to why you didn't get the promotion or didn't qualify for a bonus. Being the one in charge of performance metrics, I knew who really deserved the promotions and bonuses. When the Lead's friends who are in the bottom 50% get promoted twice in 2 years and others get nothing, its clearly favoritism. Other Leads stake their career on the work of those under them because they don't have the skill to get the work done. They will act friendly to you but if you ever ask for anything in return like a raise, you wont get any help. And once you move on, they will turn against you.

Moving down to Associates, you encounter a group of people who throw around their position as a low level manager to cover for the fact that they probably don't know how to do any of the work they're asking you to do for them. And once you do that work, they generally have no moral qualms with taking all the credit.

And now we get to the backbone of Booz Allen, the Consultants and Senior Consultants. These are the people who do the real work at Booz Allen and generally don't get paid any near the market average to do so. In this group there are two types of people, those who are enamored by the Booz Allen name and will try to move up the ladder and those who realize that they're getting paid well below the market average and move on to something better. Unfortunately, the former group often coincides with less talented people who like to play it safe and just sit there and do their menial job and nothing more.

Beyond the employees, Booz Allen has corrupted the government to such an extent that they should be banned from competing on contracts at many agencies. After moving on from Booz Allen, I joined a small company that had recently unseated Booz Allen from a contract after the office consolidated two teams (Booz Allen's and ours) into one team. The company I joined was given high ratings while Booz was given average ratings. We were given a 6 month contract with the option of additional 6 month increments. We were also competing with Booz Allen for another contract in the same office. Booz Allen, still unhappy being unseated and having already corrupted the government official in charge of the contracts, had the government add an addendum to the contract we were both competing for that said the winner would get both that contract and the contract that Booz had just lost (the one they were rated as average). Booz won the contract and we were out despite having fairly won the contract 6 months prior and having had years of excellent performance in that position. After winning, Booz Allen tried to recruit everyone from the team I was on. Not a single person went to Booz."
4091,Booz Allen Hamilton,Senior Associate,2015-08-09,3.0,Senior Associate,Good company culture.

Saying you work for Booz allows you to do so with pride and most people recognize the company when you mention it.  They have OK benefits and their compensation it competitive,"Benefits have declined in the last few years.  They are still above the minimum but they are not very competitive anymore.  I used to think I was receiving amazing benefits but now when I talk to friends outside the company I realize we are a bit behind.  The medical plans went up in price significantly and high deductibles where added.  PTO is horribly low with only 3 weeks to start and that doesn't increase for five years.  There is no sick time so if you need to be out, you have to use the PTO.  On top of that, the company now follows the government holiday schedule which means the day after thanksgiving is a work day, so you have to take PTO for that too.  They used to have floating holidays, but they stripped those from us because we gained federal holidays...Columbus Day...Exciting!  Resource management is also not very good anymore.  The recruiters are ineffective and not very helpful when you want to apply internally.  They say they are all about hiring from within first, but in my department alone, more than half of all the new people in the last year came from outside even though there was interest among the team."

I would only watch that you don't get too comfortable in those seats.  They way federal contracts are positioned, it's easy for senior management to get complacent and then lose the contract.","Senior managers will tell you, at any level, thank you need to sell work and that they have a rewards process in place to compensate you.  This is no process that's been defined to compensate you other than you annual review/raise.  Ask a senior manage and they won't be able ot provide any details on this place but they'll encourage you to sell for them.  

There is no office culture or harmony among staff.  Management is just looking to put a butt in a seat in order to bill the govt.  If you tell your manager that you're not interested in a position that they offer you, then prepare to be ignored.  Even if you've stated your goals and are on a billiable project; you will be ignored.  

I feel that I've attempted to gain traction across several different projects within my six+ years and there is either turn over from management (so you start over with a new person), or the contract is lost because the leadership screwed up the negotiations.  

The real heros at this company are the Associates and below.  They actually DO all the work and get none of the benefits. 

Oh and pretty much any fringe benefits are gone or now costs a lot more.  They're trying to ""remain competitive"" which translates to ""it's your problem now."""

- As far as consulting goes, probably the best for work/life balance (except for during proposal season!)","- Brutal entry level salaries with some teams, there is no consistency. For example, some teams within the same market bring on new hires based on experience and education. Others do not. There is no reason somebody fresh out of school should be making the same as someone with a graduate degree and a year or two of relevant experience or several years of work experience. It is also hard to comprehend why teams in the same market/client space bring people on 20-25% higher than others. As a career manager, we've brought these issues up to leadership who ultimately don''t act on it. That leads to managers not taking the time to invest in the staff they manage because they know they will be gone in less than a year.

Booz Allen is what you make of it.

Nice people to work with.","Since going public the culture has been on a steady decline and is a shadow of its former self. Same goes for benefits. While not horrible, benefits are just average now. Health insurance benefits changed significantly this year and are pretty poor. Salary increases have also changed greatly and HR's market data for salaries is not accurate. In all fairness, much of this is driven market and not necessarily Booz Allen's fault. Although, if/when there is an upswing, I doubt things will go back to the way they were. 

Attrition has not been good. I have seen many very talented colleagues leave over the past few years. Hiring standards have also decreased.

Utilization/billability trumps everything. If you are out of work, resource management is not really that useful. It all comes down to your personal network.

40 hours of training time is not free. You are expected to make up the time that you use.

Work life balance is what you make of it. If you want to get promoted/noticed/good raise, you will need to work your standard 40-42 hours AND sacrifice your free time (often nights and weekends) working on proposals, marketing, and other administrative tasks.The frequency increases as you move up the ranks and declining work/opportunities is frowned upon. I do not feel like these personal sacrifices are appreciated. 

Promotions not so much dependent on merit as they are politics.

Annual reorganizations and internal rebranding efforts. Enough with the flashy media campaigns already.

Overall, not a horrible company to work for."

4205,Booz Allen Hamilton,Once Great,2015-05-15,3.0,Lead Associate,Generally good work-life balance for non-managerial staff.  Decent salary.  Company tries to do good for employees.,"Company often over-engineers change.  Constant stream of change supposedly to improve, but often crafted in white granite halls devoid of working level impact or input. 
 
Federal government is company’s bread and butter.  There is no profit motive, and it shows.  Taxpayer dollars flow in.  Work is largely in support of giving the bureaucracy meaning.   You get insight to inner workings of tax dollars.  Very sad and depressing how wasteful the government is, lots of uncaring workforce collecting a check and great benefits, waiting to retire at taxpayer expense.  Majority of work ends up sitting on shelf collecting dust, just check in box busy work. 
 
Lots of change since going public.  Droves of knowledgeable people quit or laid off.  Continuing decline of benefits to feed shareholders.  Loss of 401k automatic contribution was watershed moment.  Minuscule pay raises limited by government trip wire (salary limits) and contract limits. 
 
Company no longer a firm.  Butts in seats is the model.  Stay billable.  Branding has suffered immensely and less time to invest in building new markets.  Company once considered itself the “Mercedes-Benz” of government consulting, but is now a run of the mill sedan. 
 
Senior Associates (start of management level) and above panic when March comes around (end of fiscal year).  That’s when annual layoffs happen.  Annual headache created by  going public. 
 
Senior leadership constantly repackages services to make it seem new and improved.  There’s only so much “improvement” you can do in a government services environment.   But they are slick at creating smoke and mirrors flashy marketing material and presentations.  Sad thing is the government clients are years behind (software, management concepts, value stream, streamlining), so they don’t know better.  What also fuels this is many retired military and DoD clients work at companies like Booz Allen.  They have contacts.  The old boy network thrives. 

It's not Deloitte & Touche, McKesson, or Price Waterhouse.  It's DoD consulting, which may be an oxymoron."

Turnover is most likely 40%/month and the firm has gone from one that's concerned with their employees and grooming them upward to one that is concerned about one thing, one thing only...the bottom line. I was let go during a recompete of a government contract and asked beforehand if I would be willing to accept a 20-30% pay cut and though I agreed, the Principal I worked for went ahead and hired someone behind me at even a lower salary.  I heard about my lay-off when he slid a ""lack of work"" notice across his desk to me...effective date my birthday.  Also, people say they are good about helping you find work within the company; my assistance consisted of HR sending me a spreadsheet and it was up to me to contact various program managers to see if they required my expertise.  
     My last day consisted of my PM meeting me in the parking lot to get my badge and laptop...think this made me feel like a valued member of the team? Oh, well three weeks later they had a luncheon and praised my good work.  The financial result was crippling to me; nearly 18 months to find a job during the worst recession in years.  The only way I'd recommend someone take a job with this group is if they were desperate and were actively seeking employment elsewhere.  Of the 20 or so people on my team, perhaps 3 still remain with the firm with the vast majority taking lower-paying, but more secure government jobs.

- The company is suffering from multiple identity crises. It can not decide if it is a consulting company, staff augmentation, or professional services.
- Innovation is squelched, despite the creation of a very large innovation group. The company uses almost none of the technologies and skills it purports to be expert in.
- The company's business operations team (called the GO team) is disconnected from market demands and mostly cannot be relied on to do anything except make life difficult.

Benefits, while not as goos as they once where, are industry compettivie.","Shocking erosion of corporate culture over the last five years and continuing to move down the value chain in terms of work conducted for clients.  The firms investments in people have seriously declined and they have become miserly regarding benefits, pay, team building activities.  Sadly, what was once one of the premiere consulting firms has become a staff augmentation shop.  Interesting project opportunities are few and far, often it is embarrassing to admit what work you actually do for clients.  More embarrassingly, are senior management's characterizing / spin the work as interesting and impactful. While there are still many smart people at the firm, the departure of dynamic staff (smart, balanced, with good interpersonal skills) continues to accelerate.  Additionally, career progression is opaque and does not follow logic.  This isn't anything new.  Pay scales are distorted and wide (e.g., staff at a lower level earning significantly more than those at a higher level sqashes motivation for advancement).  As mentioned, a lot of smart people remain and the firm still attracts some good people (not sure how long this can last as the brand will continue to erode given the current state), but these ""smart"" people are often overly ambitious people who do not work well with others and think they'll be promoted to partner next week (lol) and will do anything to make that happen (including back stabbing, shameless kiss up to SAs, Principals, Partners). Much of the aforementioned results from the Carlyle investment and becoming a publicly traded company.  When we joined BAH, a part of our intro. training focused on how BAH is not a public company and professional services organizations shouldn't be publicly traded companies...well that piece of the training is gone.

If you truly want to be a consultant, you should look somewhere else, because the firm is not focused on its traditional management consulting. Changes to corporate structure have all been targeted towards improving the bottom line, and employee development and the opportunities to do different types of work for different types of clients have decreased dramatically.

- They started giving lack of work letters to people who had been with the company 10+ years and who had always been stellar performers versus looking at the people who were marginal performers (but who currently happened to be billable).  
- When I left for maternity leave I handed over PM responsibilities I had to a co-worker ""x"".

4326,Booz Allen Hamilton,"Once Great, Now Declining",2015-02-10,3.0,Associate,"Work-life flexibility, talented colleagues, big and resilient, variance of work, secure employment. Booz Allen is a large and established consulting firm, where it's easy to work there for your whole career if you chose to. Environment is energetic and smart, and the company is big enough that it's easy to find new work and/or new clients while retaining your current position.","For the past 5 years, Booz Allen has been focused more on shareholders and bottom line than on employees and clients. Our emails from upper management tout increasing profits despite declining revenue - like it's a good thing. It is a good thing, for the shareholders, but the slashing that's taken place to make it possible have all directly affected the employees. 

First came small and pretty inconsequential changes - no more biannual laptop upgrades, then our first big change: from everyone having their own office to ""hoteling,"" where each employee reserves an office each day and checks into and out of it like a hotel room. This allowed Booz Allen (BAH) to eliminate empty offices (employees who were on client sites always or almost always) and consolidate employees. A reasonable change, and understandable. 

Next came compensation changes we were told that our compensation actions (read: raises) were to no longer be tied solely to performance, but rather a host of new criteria, one of which was ""bid-ability on contracts,"" meaning ""will your salary make it easy or hard to bid you on contracts?"" Of course, proposals compete largely on cost, so it's always easier to bid a cheaper employee on a proposal, so this gave leadership a way to freeze salaries or give paltry or in some cases insulting raises with a black and white justification, and the deniability of ""it came from upstairs."" Lots of talented employees jumped ship at this stage, because raises are the #1 tangible retention tool, and many took these paltry raises as writing on the wall that they were no longer appreciated at BAH.

More recently, BAH is selling real estate - closing offices. That's a magic trick that can prop up the bottom line, but you can only use that trick once. 

The most recent change has been to our benefits - in short, more expensive healthcare with high deductibles. For example, my plan cost increases $150 a month, and my deductible went from $0 to $2600. Healthcare will cost me $4400 more this year than it did last year; or if I got a $4400 raise, that would put me at zero. 

Booz Allen used to be a high line product at a high line price. We used to be able to command a high price - from clients who wanted more than simply getting the job done, they wanted it done well - and thoroughly, by the brightest and best. Clients would choose Booz Allen for the same reason someone might choose a Mercedes-Benz over a Toyota. In our recent years, this race to the bottom of how cheap we can possibly make operations, how little can we pay our staff, has caused a loss of top talent, and hiring just-good talent as opposed to the sharpest and most impressive applicants. I'm imagining management wanted to cut operating costs, but retain the Firm's reputation - that's just not possible. They got their wish - they made the Firm cheaper. We're just another contracting firm now - a glorified staffing agency."

Started off on a billable contract right away. Was offered little to no guidance but using common logic and networking skills I was able to grow my contacts, shadow IT and business development experts, and become familiar with the consulting model.

Depending on your contract the work can be extremely challenging. Staff come and go and only the strong survive in client-space. If you have a political/feudal government client - good luck. Know how to play the game. Work hard and look out for yourself, place your teammates in a position to succeed. Selfish individuals are immediately identified and not rewarded by management.

In my short tenure I made opportunities for myself by leading change and demonstrating exceptional delivery. I was rewarded with back-to-back promotions (Consultant -> Sr. Consultant -> Associate) in 2 years.

Firm training is decent but not advertised. You will determine how your career progresses. Non-existent hand-holding.","Benefits have noticeably decreased the past few years. 401k dropped from 10% employer contribution to 7.5% matching to 6% matching. Health insurance deductibles are in effect this year. Employees are unhappy and frustrated.

I have witnessed cases in which top talent were given LOW letters due to their contract funding being cut. Most employees sit around and twiddle their thumbs, banking their careers on their career managers. If the career manager is busy, on vacation, or simply not knowledgeable enough to find new billable work... it's bye bye for you. Keep in mind career managers have basic training and seminars they attend - but they aren't all-knowing.  Network network network to put yourself in the best position to succeed and survive in this tough market.

The different account leaders are not collaborating at an effective level. Staff turnover can be prevented if home teams communicate with one another on horizontal staff transitions.

The firm is in danger of becoming another seat-filler corporation. I am lucky enough to be highly visible to management because of the excellent work I'm doing. But some of my teammates feel very alienated from leadership and are unaware of our business operations. Everyone is busy and I noticed the folks that complain are the ones who do not do anything about it. They are unwilling to work a single minute over 40 hours a week, refuse to attend company socials, and badmouth teammates that succeed. Management is performed at the micro level and it seems to be hit-or-miss depending on client and work location."

4352,Booz Allen Hamilton,Some valuable work but gross mismanagement by senior leadership,2015-03-13,2.0,Associate,"Booz Allen does provide excellent support in obtaining continuing education and certifications needed to perform work.  Booz Allen still lives on its reputation from the past.  It was once a thriving, top employee driven firm with the best and the brightest employees and top level benefits.  If you happen to land on the right team and project, it can still be that way.  However, as many others have mentioned, that is not the majority of cases anymore.  It does have many offices and that can be helpful since employees can work at any location which helps with commutes.  Some good managers still exist at the mid-level area in the firm and they do try to support their employees.","Booz Allen's entire executive management team needs to be replaced...including the recent promotion they had to CEO.  They do not understand business strategy (and actually any leadership concepts) and you can't even discuss topics with them without a set of PowerPoint slides that ""look pretty.""   When they say ""strategy"" at the firm, they really mean ""organizational realignment"" and not true business strategic planning.  So....every year or tow, they move boxes around on the organizational chart and they change the names of the groups. I guess no one has read any Harvard business strategy publications.  Shrader was an engineer and lived off the old general market strategy of using client relationships to win additional work.  However, the market changed and when clients said they needed to save monies, they cut higher paid employees and still went for ""generic work"" that others can do.  They also cut operating costs without understanding how their changes would impact the work environment for employees.  Their strategy to hire employees without having any contracts to place them on was disastrous the first, second, and third time they tried this (it took 3 times of this insanity????).  They will probably do it again too.  Partners are so far removed from their employees and day-to-day work they don't know what proposals have true chances of winning and what skill sets their team members truly possess.  How can you run a business that way?  The leadership does not seem to understand that the employees that are available to work and that they are hiring versus the work they are selling is a huge mismatch.  Then, they blame internal staff for the problems that they create.  They continue to promote employees to higher level management that have no management skills and they do not apply performance measures to management."

4358,Booz Allen Hamilton,Lost Its Reputation,2015-03-04,2.0,Lead Associate,"When BAH was privately held, the reputation was valid. We were an ethical company that provided a good return on the clients' investments in us. The firm supported the employees with great benefits (ECAP) and kept people on when a contract ended or a position was de-scoped while they (both the employee and the firm) looked for another contract. I felt valued and well compensated.","That all changed when the Carlyle Group bought out the private side. After a couple of years, the BAH leadership took the firm public. And everything went downhill from there. It was clear that the shareholders were the most important part of the equation. People were no longer kept on whilst looking for another contract, wages began to freeze, raises (if you were lucky enough to get one) went from 6% (my average) to 1% within a year (and I had the best performance review I'd ever had!). The quality of people hired was far below what it had been due to the lower salary they began offering. Many of the best leaders left the firm or were let go after years of employment. Benefits were cut drastically. The ECAP became a 401K with standard matching. With ECAP, the firm contributed an average of 10% of my salary while I never contributed a dime. With the 401K, I was required to contribute and with the matching, the total was far less than the ECAP.

Even though the compensation and benefits decreased, the expectations of the firm remained the same: MUST work on proposals (above your billable hours), the assessment process (""revised"" almost annually to ""improve"" the process) remained time consuming and ridiculous (even though one can only record 8 hours for the effort), and the ethics which had been so valued began to erode. I personally brought an ethics violation to my management, it was investigated, and even though all agreed it was a serious violation (on top of other well documented performance issues), the firm decided to retain the employee because ""we need the billable hours he/she brings in""."

It often does not even care if the staffing is best for the client - more often it must be best for the bottom line.  Networking is challenging, the firms way of staying in touch is to remind employees to fill in time sheets and to take on line training.

It remains a great place for entry-level professionals coming out of college or graduate degree programs, as their labor rates are lower so they will have an easier time finding projects and gaining exposure to career advancement opportunities.","As others have acknowledged, the corporate culture has distinctly changed. ""Billability"" has become the lowest common denominator for determining employee value; upon contract end, you have a slim margin of time--sometimes days--before lack-of-work (LOW) notice. Although employees are expected to seek out their own opportunities, there is very little guidance or support to help match employees to open opportunities, and the Resource Management system intended to perform this function is understaffed. Even when securely on a contract, this emphasis on billable targets impedes career development as it encourages staff to stay put in minimal-growth opportunities for the sake of job security. 

Individual experiences vary significantly, however, because there is wide disparity in how teams manage their budgets and staff. It seems that a team's leadership has free reign to determine its own LOW policy and make other significant decisions impacting staff without Firm-wide guidance. Such leadership decisions tended to feel reactive rather than proactive and were often poorly communicated to staff."

The firm offered a good work-life balance.","There were few opportunities for promotion to middle or upper management for people with technical backgrounds like myself. Contributions by the firm to employee retirement accounts were being scaled back in a stepwise manner when I was leaving the firm in 2013, the first step down was to ~7%, and I recall that a subsequent step down to ~5% matching contributions was planned for the following year.  There was no bonus structure in place for any employee below Senior Associate.

Pay isn't terrible. It's not the best but it's far from the worst.","Terrible benefits. No sick days or personal days. If you're sick you go to work or take vacation time. 

The company forces you to go to training or meetings during regular work hours and it's not billable. In essence you work for 8 hours a day but dont get credit for the mandatory meeting/training. So you either have to  work extra or take paid time off. 

You're expected to participate in proposal writing, which can be a many, many extra hours yet you're not compensated for it and you don't  get comp time for what could be working 40 extra hours a week. 

Their health care just changed to a terrible high deductible plan that, coupled with the lack of raises for many this year, results in a net loss in pay from last year. 

They have a 6% 401(k). However they on deposit their contributions once a calendar year. So, if you are there for 11 months then leave you get no match.

They have contracts in prestigious places -- primarily federal government and DoD and work with exciting technologies.  

They hire for talent and culture fit, not for contracts.  You have a few months to get work where you can train and get certifications, and they'll keep you on for several weeks after you lose a contract to find new work.  Not your typical government contractor that lays you off when your contract ends.","It's a massive company, it's so easy to get lost in the chaff and not get recognized, if you are on the wrong team you will not succeed. Period. Some leadership takes care of their employees, other leadership just sucks the billable hours out of you and then gives you a 1% raise at the end of the year.  Good luck moving to a different team if you get tucked away on a bad one. I tried for 4 years to move teams with no traction.

The assessment process is tremendously complicated, burdensome, and opaque, people sometimes have to take a few day of unbillable time in order to work through them.

Everything is about billing and time recording. If you enter time 5 minutes late you might not get promoted.

Benefits have been slipping ever since I've worked here. They used to pride themselves on taking care of their employees, providing top tier benefits and compensation, but recently they've moved to the middle of the pack if not the rear."
4421,Booz Allen Hamilton,Senior Consultant (Contracts) Extremely Disappointing!! WORST Career Decision EVER.,2015-02-16,1.0,Senior Consultant (Contracts Client Site),"- Matched my previous pay 
- Paid for my relocation costs (you have to repay it if you leave within a year)","Let me preface this with your experience with BAH is 100% dependent on your IMMEDIATE TEAM. I cannot speak for the company as a whole or upper management since I was only there for a little over a year. I've had friends who love BAH and friends who despised it; my personal experience was a complete nightmare and the worst career decision of my life thus far. I was hired as a Senior Consultant for the contracts management team.

Before I came to BAH I worked for the government as a Contract Specialist. I had experience with supply and services contracts primarily in the R&D arena (CPFF, CPAF, and FFP contract types varying in complexity and size $150,000 - >$250M). I also had a good amount of knowledge in the pre-award process, solicitations, RFPs, RFQs, proposal evaluation, cost & price analysis, contract award, post-award management, FAR, DFAR, NMCARS, SPS/PD2.

None of that mattered because once I started at BAH I was put on a team with a Team Lead who literally micro-managed every single aspect of my time at work and didn't trust anyone. One of the first things she said to me was ""you need to CC me on EVERY SINGLE e-mail you send out,"" I thought she was joking and was about to laugh when I realized she was 100% serious. With all that experience I was only given tasks that I performed easily within the first 3 months of my previous government job. I felt like they didn't utilize my potential and knowledge base. To make matters worst my Team Lead was incompetent, she rarely did any work and would throw you under the bus in meetings if something went bad and personally take credit for things when they were good. She would CONSTANTLY ask ME how contracts were structured and how they worked and information about the FAR and DFARs clauses and how it applied to the contract and then VERBATIM repeat that to the client to appear intelligent. I always saw her on Facebook, shopping online, IMing her friends, or on her phone. She would always tell everyone how busy she was and how much work she had to do, but would do none of it herself and assigned the work to her team while she shopped online and looked at vacation places (and we were at the client site 100% of the time) which is extremely unprofessional. She would literally berate her team, including me, in public and yell at us whenever she was frustrated or stressed (about what I have no clue because she didn't do anything). If you didn't cater to her ego and do everything she asked without question she would write you a terrible performance review, have you put on probation, and eventually fired (which happened to my friend and teammate who, by the way, had a law degree from UC Berkeley so she was pretty bright). To make matters worst this woman was my Career Manager so I had no one to go to for help. I did have a talk with her about the whole situation and how I felt under utilized and how she treats her team and me, but that just made things worst. I looked into transferring to another team, but that wasn't viable if there wasn't a space available on another contract, department, or a need. Plus my current Team Lead was my Career Manager too so I could assume I wasn't going to get a fair recommendation. In addition, she was in cahoots with the Senior Associate and continually stroked his ego so I knew no one would have my back or fight for me.

The last 9 months of this job was literally the worst in my professional life. I dreaded going to work everyday because of this person and would count down the minutes until I could leave. She also pretty much implicitly said you couldn't go out to lunch and to just eat at your desk. When you would go to talk to another co-worker she would come back after you left and ask that person what you were talking about. I was afraid to say anything at work to her or anyone else in fear that she would have one of her outbreaks and berate you. I was also afraid about how she would impact my career and mobility. I was literally mentally exhausted everyday and professionally depressed, not because of the work at all (which was mind numbing-ly easy) but because of this single person. Even though I made the team and her look good in front of the client and her boss with the sheer amount of contract mods I was doing, I knew what was going to happen come performance review time since I didn't stroke her ego, and asked questions when she didn't make sense. To protect myself I put in my 2 weeks notice right when my 1 year was up so I didn't have to repay the relocation costs and so she wouldn't stain my professional career with a terrible performance review. 

Overall, if I was put on a team that actually was intelligent and did meaningful work I might have had a different outlook which is why your experience here is really dependent on the team you get put on and the people you work with. Unfortunately, I was stuck in a hard place with no one to back me up which only makes you feel more miserable and hopeless."

The management in place does not fully benefit from the diverse work history of it's employees because managers tend to define employers by the job they are currently doing. 

The company also appears to be in transition from advisory work, which set Booz Allen above it's competitors, to possibly becoming another managed services firm which, over time, will detract from its' brand image."
4441,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great place to work once you come to terms with the culture.,2014-12-16,4.0,Associate,"Great benefits, a wealth of knowledge and experience in the company, mentors are at every turn, culture is aimed at developing and growing employees.","When I first showed up to work I noticed immediately I was by far the youngest person around. I thought at first that was normal but then I noticed more and more over my next 4 years that there is some age discrimination. Not in hiring or blatant but it exists. I was passed over as the lead on projects multiple times by people who were just as, or even less, qualified than I was but they were older. They claim to be a ""flat"" organization but the hierarchy is very clear. Because most of the staff is former military the culture subsequently became a very militaristic type work environment. In most ways it was good but it did not allow for a lot of chances to disagree or challenge the status quo without being seen as a troublemaker."

Lots of opportunities due to being a huge firm, competitive pay and benefits, intelligent employees, great culture for those who enjoy collaboration/socializing, etc.","While there are a wide range of opportunities (there is a career path for almost every type of profession), it's still possible to be pigeonholed into a specific role based on your resume, if you aren't careful."

4445,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great company to work for,2014-12-29,5.0,Consultant,"good people, interesting work, learn something new every day","working on client site, and having difficult clients"
4446,Booz Allen Hamilton,Changes at Booz Allen,2015-01-06,3.0,Senior Systems Engineer,Highly professional workforce. Values integrity in its employees. Competitive salaries.,"Needs to figure out how to compete in today's economy.  Too much emphasis in the past few years on growth at all costs.  Workforce is slowly becoming diluted with talent. Difficult to take pride in work, when the work that we pursue is not commensurate with our skill and expertise level.  The Firm has reduced benefits significantly while not admitting it to its employees (reduced vacation, eliminated sick time, reduced 401k matching, training hours have to be ""paid back."" ).  Very little support to people who want to support clients from remote sites.  There are many unfilled jobs, that could be filled by staff who are available across the country, but no incentive to fill those jobs remotely."

4448,Booz Allen Hamilton,Great place to grow your career - if you land on the right team,2015-01-08,4.0,Lead Associate,"I was on the traditional ""management consulting"" side of the business.  Leadership quality is uneven, but when it's good this is a fantastic place to be.  This company wins just about every kind of work that exists in the federal government, so if you're proactive and part of a successful team you'll get opportunities to try a lot of different things.  I've done data analysis, strategic planning, communications, organization design, human capital management consulting, etc.  If you get stuck, with 25k+ employees and a strong culture of collaboration you can usually find an expert to help you out from within the company ranks within hours. Most of the clients are good to work with and the projects are interesting.  My typical project was 6-18 months, which felt like a good balance between stability and variety.  Unlike some companies, the end of a contract doesn't mean unemployment unless things are really bad in your market (or you are expensive with a niche skillset).  Tell your management you want to advance, raise your hand to help with proposals and marketing work outside your client work, and you can be promoted every 1-2 years - especially if you are a strong writer and have some leadership experience already.  Work hours are extremely reasonable; as a manager I typically logged 45 hours/week or under and was hitting all my marks for clients and internal management alike.  Proposal season in August-September is rough but you know it's coming and leadership does a good job ""sharing the wealth"" so the same people don't get relentlessly piled upon.  Internal training is almost non-existent these days, but the $5k annual tuition reimbursement easily makes up for that and the firm has deals to get people into external instructions programs that fall within that limit.","Balancing client work (often performed at a govt. office) with firm responsibilities gets frustrating when you have technical issues accessing IT resources due to security requirements on the part of the government or the company.  This is a daily fact of life.  Some government work locations are better than others.  Compensation is not great compared to what you can get in other industries, but within the industry it seems reasonable, and to be fair the requirement to be billable to government clients limits the firm's flexibility in this area.  I suppose the trade-off is less money in exchange for more support, interesting projects, and good name recognition among federal consulting firms.  Senior management comes off as being untrustworthy at times, such as during the aborted stealthy removal of parking/transit benefits this past summer, but this is mitigated if the intervening leaders are good. Benefits (health care, 401k supplements) continue to erode, which has not been great for morale."
4449,Booz Allen Hamilton,Too much overhead,2015-01-07,3.0,,"Great structure, most ranks are possible to earn, decent review and evaluation process, managers have a lot of pride in the company","There is an overall distant feel between contractors and the company itself.  Those on overhead, primarily admin positions, are treated as essential pieces to the company while contractors are pushed to their work sites to make the overhead.  BAH has tons and tons of computer based training for their employees, which is awesome, but its buried under hundreds of links and pages that make no sense.  Finally, they encourage employees to take surveys about their core areas but never address the results or implement any suggestions."
