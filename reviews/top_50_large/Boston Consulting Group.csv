- so many growth opportunities","sometimes the workload can be high and fast-paced and you have to really put in the work, but you will always get compensated for the work that you put in and will always receive the recognition that you deserve"

Good compensation and very good health benefits"
2,Boston Consulting Group,"Great Company, Great Culture, I'm at home",2022-03-29,5.0,Administration Services Manager,BCG lives by its values. The culture is evident from the moment you join and is embedded into everything we do. I absolutely love it here and valued as an employee and as a person. D.E.I&B is a focus and consistently lived day in and day out. I don't see myself living anytime soon.,Some departments are so new that processes and procedures aren't set in stone yet. It's a great opportunity for someone to come in and leave their legacy in an impactful way.
3,Boston Consulting Group,"Lots of great perks, hours are kind of long",2022-03-30,4.0,Associate Consultant,"Fun new experiences, great team events, a lot of support for you as a person through programs to benefit bringing loved ones to events and COVID response","The hours can be difficult to manage life if you have a partner or just want more breathing room, staffing can be complex to navigate so you have to be really intentional working on projects you like"

I doubt it!,2022-02-25,5.0,Partner,"I didn't come from a classic management consulting world and after joining BCG, I am blown away with the culture, resources, capabilities and humility at BCG. It is the most fulfilling, purpose driven, value focused company I have ever experience and I have worked with many large F500 companies. The work is exciting, diverse, challenging and interesting. However, there is a huge priority put on work-life balance and support mechanisms. There is no ego, politics or top down hierarchy. I literally can't say enough about how rewarding it is to work here.","With the exception of Covid, if you don't like to travel, this probably isn't a great place to work. We are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and that includes air travel but there is still a lot of time away from home."
5,Boston Consulting Group,No career path,2022-02-25,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Healthcare paid for.
Profit sharing 
Bonus - but could be higher.
Time off","If you work in BST or in a Non- consulting role, there is absolutely no career progression unless someone dies or leaves. Too many 15+ year complacent employees. And anyone trying to change this is gas lighting you. They don’t want to change it because then they are up for competition, and their promotions were given based on the old model where you stay long enough, it will be “your time” to get that promotion regardless of whether you are qualified or not. Cronyism, not politics. They admit that they know it’s horrible and don’t do anything about it either. BCG - where you go
coast or have your career die!"

Also, the exit opportunities are amazing. Felt like essentially every door was open.","The hype of the cons is also real. Hours were typically pretty rough, working around 60 hours per week. 

But perhaps worse was the constant pressure. There is always a meeting or deadline right around the corner, and you’re constantly reviewed by managers. The perform or leave culture takes a big mental toll."

It's also a big company so systemic change is tougher than it would be in a startup. But they are super open to feedback (to the point where they ask constantly, but at least it usually makes a difference).

My friend -- a teacher in a public school -- has a higher hourly rate. Unless you're planning to hack it to the top and TRULY believe that you will make it (less than 5% do), it is likely not worth it.
- The issues worked on are, for the most part, trivial.

The culture is inclusive, fun and global. They offer amazing, best-in-class benefits and mobility options.","While BCG has very competitive and generous salaries for consulting staff, they do not pay well for non-client facing roles such as HR, recruiting, marketing, finance, etc. There is a significant gap here in terms of years of experience for roles they are hiring for and what they are willing to pay; which often gets outweighed by the amazing benefits and flexibility they offer (especially by women who have or are trying to have a family)."

191,Boston Consulting Group,A romanticized job that doesn't disappoint,2019-07-15,5.0,Associate,"Business support teams make this group a true pleasure to work at.  
Working day in, day out with some of the highest level minds on the planet. 
Benefits include: fully paid health coverage for the fam, generous time off for the junior level staff, an industry leading luxury travel policy.
Training is person, not career, centered.  The training and personal development I've received has provided me with some of the most valuable advice I've ever received for my life.","Negative experiences almost always derive from our position as a client services firm, not internally."
192,Boston Consulting Group,"Might not recommend the assistant role, except to those who need great healthcare",2021-09-27,3.0,Senior Administrative Assistant,"- amazing healthcare benefits (NO insurance premiums, also extremely low copays, unlimited sick days).
- you can bill a lot of OT, and managers haven't been pushing back on hours of OT billed since covid.
- extreme feedback environment. You will learn a lot but you need to have a thick skin and a flexible ego.
- admin team recently introduced a year-end process where managers collect downward feedback from their reports.
- overall positive culture.
- BCG does fascinating work for its clients (although as an assistant it can be hard to ""dive into"" the work and understand content, take on ""stretch opportunities"" and such due to their own lack of capacity plus lack of trust from executives).
- current remote model means assistants can join more case team events (previously held for consultants only at offsites).
- good name/experience to have on your resume.","- Boston office specifically uses a ""new"" (past several years) evaluation model for assistants, that is separate from how other business support teams are eval'ed. Most assistants in this office dislike the model due to extreme ambiguity and lack of transparency around pay/promotion structure and feedback-collection burden, but admin management seems either ignorant (very unlikely), uninterested, or vehemently opposed to this. This model is also spreading to other offices...
- despite great benefits and OT, assistant comp isn't competitive with other industries and firms due to base salary. You can make way more money (think +$30K) being an assistant at a biotech or finance/VC firm in the Boston area.
- very high volume of work for assistants, before and especially since covid. Managers encourage assistants to ""push back"" on unnecessary requests, set boundaries with the people they support, and step away after normal business hours, but fundamental problem of assistants being overloaded with scheduling persists with no solution in sight. Stemming from this, assistants may experience high levels of stress and long working hours.
- less senior assistants tend to be ""team players"" more than senior assistants, being more willing to cover other assistants and contribute to team events and culture.
- assistants are responsible for alerting their coverage when they're sick (vs. managers coordinating), and for securing their coverage for vacations.
- very limited internal mobility for business support staff (ex. admins, finance, HR) partly due to perpetual competition with internal consulting-track staff.
- sharp cultural divide between business support and consulting staff. Consultant evals are much more meritocratic and they get more clarity around progress tracking and promotions, consultants are paid way more money, they have dramatically higher budgets for team events, are the unsaid focus when BCG talks about retention and improving D&I, etc. Won't lie, after a while this really stings."

Getting BCG on the resume opened a lot of doors.
BCG Navigator offered a breadth of information at fingertips.
Work-life balance as the job is not overly complicated and the work hours are meant to be 8am to 5pm exactly.","- Business model for DRS is at odds with business model for the org as a whole, meaning there is a conflict of interest between succeeding in the role and progressing your personal development and career.
- Work is transactional by nature, meaning that unless you are resourceful and step outside of what management wants you to do, you will not get any exposure to meaningful BCG casework.
- The job becomes managing cheaper outsourced research firms to increase the profitability of the DRS department. Basically, you get good at creating and managing 6 research requests that you don't do yourself, but merely send off to case teams after you ""QA"" them. 
- Moving over to the consulting side is not possible from DRS, or from the Knowledge Team for that matter.
- DRS was managed and run like a call center. Butt in seat at 8am, punch out at 5pm. Not recommended for those who value autonomy and don't like to be managed via hours."

they do lots of give aways 
good for the average single person 
lots of office perks with food and stuff",lowest paid for EA's in the range for the role with other companies with the amount of work that you must provide.
301,Boston Consulting Group,Summer Internship Review,2021-07-07,5.0,Summer Associate,- Extremely helpful and collaborative,- Work schedule can be long
302,Boston Consulting Group,Bait and Switch for Immigrants,2021-05-28,3.0,Senior Project Manager,"Has one of the best health insurance in the market
Pay is per market benchmarked standards
Has a profit sharing plan at the end of the year ( in lieu of a 401k match)
Has a lot of parties and free food
Has a fully paid company outing( depends on the office)
Has a education reimbursement policy with approval from manager
Has lot of rewards and freebies thrown in time to time ( like company logo swag) 
People are smart in general and nice to each other
Overseas travel is another plus
Work life balance is optimal","Very little career mobility within the company
No 401k match
Has periodic layoffs. I have seen lot of people who get rolled off the company if they can't make partner.
The green card policy sucks big time. There is no clear policy that is communicated to the employee. It is very much left at the manager's behest. Managers usually bait and switch the employees using the green card as a tool to keep them. HR is not helpful in resolving such matters. 
Overall, this is a very top down company. It talks a lot about diversity and equality, but if you peel away the layers , none of it is being practiced, in reality. In my case, my manager kept promising a green card filing for 2.5 years without actually filing it, but always making sure to 'bait and switch'. HR will deny any meetings or calls. Immigration team will work in collusion.
To summarize:


No diversity at leadership that can understand issues related to immigration
BCG managers do not fully comprehend issues faced by immigrants
BCG leadership (at Director+ levels) have very little training about the immigration process in this company 
HR does not fully comprehend issues faced by immigrants and are not very helpful
The Green Card process does not provide transparency to the employees, leaving them with zero control of their own situation
 Needless to say, the different players in the BCG immigration team have any accountability to employees as the process itself doesn't call for it"

461,Boston Consulting Group,"Software Engineer BCG Platinion: an incredible variety of clients and work, supported by a world class consulting firm",2020-10-09,5.0,Senior Engineer,"Being part of the engineering team at Platinion (a tech-focused unit of BCG) has been a great experience, and I have gotten to work with the best group of colleagues I've ever had. Each case / project has been a totally unique tech stack and problem to solve. Because we are a consulting firm, there is a good mix of heads-down coding and work along with client facing work. Platinion is often brought in by clients to build prototypes and MVPs for projects which makes the work faster paced and I think more fun. 
Platinion has a bit less intense style compared to the regular consultants at BCG, where there is pressure to be promoted or leave every 2 years.
We operate somewhat independently from BCG but still have all the perks and benefits of working at a top consulting firm. Perks that include the best health insurance ($5 copay for EVERYTHING), first class flights for flying, and incredible office spaces (the NYC office serves* breakfast and lunch every day with ample snacks and free Joe coffee throughout the day)

*going into the office and all office services are of course on pause for 2020 due to COVID
I trust our Platinion leadership and especially the BCG leadership; the BCG North America team I feel has done a great job handling the tumultuous year 2020

Consulting can feel rather isolating with traveling to clients and being on different teams all the time. BCG does a great job of recognizing this and making efforts for team and office events and culture. (They do a much better job at this than my former employer, a large IT consulting firm)

I'm not sure if this is available for Platinion but on the BCG side, when you are ready to leave or are told to leave, you are given a 3 full or 6 half months salary to seek your next position, as well as assistance from career services in your search.","The pace and workload can sometimes be high, but because cases have set end dates (usually at most a few months) there should always be a light at the end of the tunnel. 

From an engineer's standpoint, traveling every week to a client like a consultant felt like too much. But with COVID we're obviously not traveling at all and I am guessing that client travel will lessen or change dramatically after this.

The actual salary is a bit lower than what a software engineer in NYC could find, but other perks and benefits, particularly the health care, help to make up for it.

Platinion had to grow rather quickly and made for some hectic and maybe-not-as-thorough recruiting .

This year has especially brought to light shortcomings in Diversity and Inclusion among the nation and BCG is no different. Platinion and especially engineering lacks Black representation and has made strides with but still behind in gender diversity. This year has felt like all the right acknowledgements of the issue have been made; BCG has launched many efforts including 'inclusion accelerators,' millions of dollars in in-kind pro-bono work and actual monetary contributions to causes. But it will take time to tell if a significant positive difference is made."

You will work hard and get rare and unique opportunities  that many people don't get until much later in their career.","Between the last minute travel and the luck required to find ""good"" projects, there are a few AFDs (areas for development). While the hours can be grueling, it's not uncommon to be told the night before that you're travelling somewhere for a project starting the next morning. This can make planning your personal life a bit difficult.

\\Social Impact - Many local and global partnerships with NGOs, opportunity to work low- or pro-bono for social impact organizations
\\Mobility and Travel - Frequent work travel leads to lots of perks redeemable for personal travel; quantity of BCG offices across the country and around the world means the possibility of transferring to different cities (not the easiest process but definitely doable!)

800,Boston Consulting Group,Interesting experience,2019-12-10,3.0,Project Leader,"Pros: 
1) Paycheck and Benefits: Most attractive part, maybe the only motivating factor on some days. 

2) Quality of work: Work undertaken by BCG is mostly interesting and potentially impactful. You feel that you are part of a project that can change the way an industry works or client's TSR

3) Clients served: You get to work with leading players,  and it is a privilege to share board rooms with CEOs and be able to learn from them 

4) BCG MDPs: The Managing Director & Partner team is terrific and one of the major reasons why BCG is a top-tier strategy consulting firm. The amount of information and industry expertise some of the Partners have is jaw-dropping and even C-level execs pay close attention to what a BCG partner has to say. 

5) Fellow consultants and non-consulting staff: Most of the consultants and associates in the office are fun. Consultants are supported well with L&D teams, staffing teams","Cons: 
1) Long hours: Consistently clocked >70 hrs/ week. Though weekends are protected, Sat is spent recovering/ grocery/ laundry and then by Sun eve--you are packing for an early AM flight on Monday. This makes you question the money you are making. If you making 1.7x the market rate, you are sorta working 1.5-1.8x hours as well. 

2) Middle management (Senior Project Leaders/ Principals): Not everyone in middle management is a great people developer. I once worked for a senior Principal who would constantly fret about his promotion and how if he doesn't become a Partner soon, he'll have to leave. That made for a terrible case experience as he was so insecure and made everyone work long hours (unnecessarily) to deliver ""value""

3) Up-or-out policy: BCG is aggressively pursuing the up-or-out policy. Every year size of incoming class gets bigger, but people start leaving after 12-14 months. All you need is 1-2 bad case experiences for the firm to make up its mind and force you to leave. This policy makes sense superficially, but it assumes that everyone develops at the same pace. At the same time, you do not need to be exceptionally smart to have a long career at BCG. BCG has a very peculiar work culture/ process, some people are able to adapt and some don't. If you have some industry/ real-life work experience, it may hinder your success at BCG as you may feel we are not answering the right questions or our work lacks technical detail. Most ""successful"" consultants at BCG joined the firm right out of undergrad and only have consulting expertise."
