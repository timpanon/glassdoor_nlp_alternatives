0,Box,"I feel old at this company, yet can't seem to leave.",2021-04-22,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"It's all about the people, people, people. Every team I've been on at Box for the past 7 years has been filled with supportive, intelligent, humorous, down-to-earth folks, and I can't stress how big of a positive impact that has made for me in my day-to-day. The work is constantly challenging -- with the support system from my colleagues and manager I'm able to grow and take on harder assignments knowing they'll have my back if I run into roadblocks. I also feel like my manager does a great job advocating for me and creating a safe space for me to voice my concerns if anything comes up.

Lastly, the cafeteria fries (pre-covid obviously) is some of the best I've ever had.","Transitioning to a more mature company, Box is still battling through EOL'ing some legacy tools and products. Migrating off of these old systems takes time and we don't always have the resources to do it while continuing to successfully run the business. There certainly have been moments of frustration in asking for these resources and seeing our tech debt only growing - it wasn't until recently that this has changed for the better and we've been able to get some new hires to help us through it."
1,Box,"Great people, software, and culture",2022-03-29,5.0,Account Executive,Box has a great work culture and has done a great job of hiring and developing a platform that people enjoy using,Pay could be below market rate
2,Box,Box is not a great place to work anymore,2022-03-05,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Good culture (but how its getting diluted)
Good work life balance
Some managers do care about employees","No equivalent refreshers (stocks) even if you are performing good (based on yearly review) at your current level (I am not talking about next level). So basically after 4 years your TC is going to be less.
Managers are valued more in my team. In my team only manager's birthdays and joining anniversaries get celebrated with kudo boards etc. 
Promotions: I see that some teams have lenient promotions vs some have very strict. If you want to join, try to join new, less established team where you will have better chance to get promoted. If you are on IC track, it's really hard to get promoted. While if you are in manager track it will be better. Also I have seen the trend that people who are bold, good at presentation and keep themself's in limelight have better chance for promotion.
Overall Box is not a great place to work anymore."

The people I'v met during my first few months have all been super kind, and always offer to help. The atmosphere overall is really chill, and there are so many fun interest groups to join, so there's really something for everyone.
They also have a lot of opportunities to volunteer and give back to the community .","Unfortunately, they don't 401k match.
Some stages of the onboarding process were made difficult as a returning employee, much more so than just coming in as a new employee.
Not so much a con, but I have noticed that most new hires are not fresh graduates so it is a bit daunting for interns to be one of the few employees coming into the company with less than 3 years of industry experience."

There are less silos, walls, and ""not my problem"" attitude than at other companies I have been at. Definite emphasis on things important in a startup like customer focus and ""Getting Sh*t Done"" and reducing unproductive meetings and paperwork. GSD is one of the company's core values. Customers love the product and you definitely see how your work makes people happy.","More stingy on cash as management is focused on improving EPS. Less raises, less swag, no 401k matching, etc. When Box was 100 people, buying everyone an iPad for Christmas and a black-tie party in San Francisco was possible.

I could go to the gym at lunch several times a week, and for the most part, my manager didn't care where I was as long as I was present in meetings and finishing my sprint tasks.","The culture is a bit boring, and the management leaves something to be desired. Core engineering teams are understaffed and underfunded - the Sales org is really where most of Box's investment lies.

I've been immensely proud to know that our leadership is vocal about the issues that impact their employees.","-This has recently gotten better, but for most of my time at Box there was never a clear career path for my org. It was difficult to determine my standing, which made promotion conversations and cross-org-career changes hard to navigate. However, recently more structure/mapping has been put in place to make this conversation easier.
-My org/teammates have been consistently underpaid/undervalued compared to the market

They hire the brightest and most innovative from many of the large tech companies who have loads of experience. The office space in RWC is also the nicest space I’ve ever seen across all of big tech (compared to Google, Amazon, SFDC, etc). Fully stocked cafeteria for meals and the best snacks anywhere. Exec staff is also very approachable and will actually remember you and thank you when you work on a project together. Amazing experience from the top down.","The biggest gripe I have (and why I don’t give 5 stars) is the annual performance review process. It is mandatory and it takes HOURS away from actual work you could be doing for the company. You have to review yourself in full detail and also get several peers to review you, which takes so much time away from the larger company goals. If the required performance review could be shortened/eliminated I would give 5 stars. Also if OKRs could be reduced to once per year vs every quarter, it would also improve the overall workforce efficiency."

Perks are pretty standard for tech companies (still no 401K match which is surprising), but the people you work with are awesome, several talented people across sales, marketing, product, engineering, etc. The product is the best in the space, which makes it easier to believe in the long-term success of the company. Aaron is an incredible person and product visionary and makes the company feel like a family.","Our executive level changes have brought some important operational changes for the better, but have started to drastically erode the culture that made Box such a great place to be. Even though Box is a flat organization, the executive team seems totally in the dark on what things feel like at the ground level. Targets continue to get higher without a proportional increase in enablement or headcount and it's stretching all aspects of the company. While many tech companies hire smart people and get out of their way, Box hires smart people and then subjects them to micromanagement from the higher ups. Good ideas or logical anecdotes are often dismissed while the company continues to pursue strong numbers for the market. In general, the CRO is an extremely aggressive, egotistical addition to the e-staff team and has a lot of people worried about Box's culture and what it means to work here."

The internal communication is fantastic, I know exactly what's going on within the company, the product roadmap, strategies, etc. Previously, I've worked at companies that did NOT share this level of information and it's refreshing to have that at Box. The values are very clear and the company does a great job trying to promote those values throughout the organization and live up to the values. I must say that Box does a great job showing the value it places on employees, it was one of the things that I picked up during the hiring process and was reflected in my offer (not just the offer itself, but the communication behind the offer). That made my decision to come here super easy as that can be really hard to find in a company with 2K plus employees and growing!","Sometimes, the ""fun"" that is injected in the corporate meetings is a bit over the top, IMHO, but I understand that this is a young company and the culture reflects that. I'm not really saying this is a hard ""con"", but something to be aware of...honestly for many this is a ""pro"" as it does promote a level of levity as part of the culture."

Buying into the mission is super important to me, and I am a huge supporter of Box's mission of changing how the world works together.

A few other good things:
- Work/life balance is a priority for most managers and flexible working isn't uncommon
- Unlimited PTO affords employees the ability to take the right amount of time off
- In-office experience includes lunches, snacks, drinks, etc.
- Box is huge on culture and the importance of belonging
- Hard work is rewarded appropriately","There are two cons that I'd call out for prospective employees:

1. Box doesn't do 401(k) matching as of today. That being said, in my opinion the ESPP program more than makes up for it - but there's no traditional 401(k) match.

2. As part of growing pains, the top priorities aren't always clear to employees in some areas since it sometimes feels like there's a ""flavor of the quarter"" mentality coming from senior management."

101,Box,Great place to grow,2020-04-30,5.0,Mid Market Account Executive,"Box was my second place of employment out of college and I've been here almost 4 years now. The culture is really phenomenal especially on the sales side of the house. There is a strong sense of community among coworkers and people really do want to see you succeed vs. hyper-competitive sales cultures. Additionally there are tons of resources around ERGS and room to grow with your career with upward mobility. 

The management in particular has really show their true colors during Covid-19. Aaron's leadership and generosity through out this pandemic has made me feel 100% secure in my job. Which in turn has allowed me to focus on what is really important and that is my customers and doing my job well. Management has also been extremely transparent and hosting weekly 1:1 fireside chats with various executives and the sales team members to share their own experiences in their roles and how we can translate that to benefit our customers. 

I also would say after a number of years our product offering is finally rounding out its suite offering to better compete with the larger traditional ECM players and better differentiate ourselves from basic files sharing.","No 401K Matching, Stock performance mediocre over the years, competitive market"
102,Box,Great Place to Work,2020-11-30,5.0,Manager,"Box has a culture that allows you to be yourself, but also try new things. It is empowering to be in an environment that rewards you to take chances, even if they result in failures. It is OK as long as you fail fast, and learn something from it. 

It has also been an opportunity for growth for me personally. Starting out as an individual contributor, and then being tapped to lead a team was an opportunity I had wanted, but had been denied in other organizations.","To get the level of autonomy that allows you to take chances and fail fast, it does not have the level of mature processes of larger more formal organizations."

The culture is unlike anything I've experienced before.  The people at Box are highly talented, hard working, and extremely humble.  They check their egos at the door and pitch in to help one another.....so refreshing!  It really feels like we are all in this together and rowing in the same direction.  

On the leadership and technology fronts, I've never seen the kind of access to leadership and product like we have at Box.  We truly have the ability to influence the future roadmap and serve as a strong voice for the customer.  Box is recognized as the leader in the cloud content management space by all the major analyst firms for a reason.  The current and future innovation coming out of Box is visionary and leading the way.  

Leadership, including the exec team, take a very active role in engaging with Boxers and with customers....it's pretty impressive.","Box is very nimble which is typically a strength.  On occasion, there are areas that could benefit from a bit more structure and process."

I love being part of a company that cares so deeply about its mission and wants to delight customers by making their lives and businesses easier.  The work I do feels meaningful and interesting, and I routinely collaborate with brilliant and fun co-workers.  I love that the company as a whole has an inclusive, kind, agile, and fun culture.  Senior leadership exhibits kindness, creativity, drive, humility, caring, and support of others, and that culture trickles down throughout the organization.  Our CEO (a company co-founder) in particular is different breed of executive: a visionary who is humble, tenacious, charismatic, funny, and deeply caring.

This reflects really well on the core values at Box. I'm able to truly be myself at work and feel very accepted for the work I do. Also, there is great recognition for jobs well done.","Despite being a best in class product, there is very little brand awareness outside of the company. There are also some decisions that are made in terms of comp, spending, etc that don't really make sense.

There is an excellent work life balance, unlimited vacation, free lunch, and good overall benefits. eStaff is well respected and comes across as open and approachable.","The company-wide focus is on becoming profitable and reducing costs. Hiring is slowing or has stopped completely in most teams. Teams are repeatedly asked to do more with less. Growth opportunities are becoming more limited.

Mid-level leadership is spotty (lots of Director and VP level people have been leaving over the last year or two). In Box Consulting, there are some members of the senior leadership team that seem to be good at ""playing the game"" and managing up, but not making any real impact on their teams. New senior managers and directors are brought on, especially within the Growth and Strategy team, but they don't make any real impact and aren't respected internally. Constructive feedback on this team is not welcomed. Meanwhile, individual contributors are leaving and their positions aren't being backfilled but are being moved offshore (which some members of the leadership team are bragging about). Senior leadership within Box Consulting seems out of touch and uninterested in receiving feedback. The only priority is billable customer work - even if that means sacrificing efficiency and process improvements. BC is moving closer and closer to a traditional Consulting org, but they don't get comparable compensation. Time tracking is scrutinized, comments are required, and must be done daily.

Monthly healthcare costs are high. There is no 401K matching even though people have been asking for this for years."

Given the landscape we're in now, our products are also positioned well to win in the market which is a HUGE selling point for our company. Our engineers are phenomenal and our teams really know how to work together.","There are times when management and leadership can make decisions too quickly and end up having to re-evaluate some of those decisions down the line which impact employees and their work. On the flip side, sometimes decisions don't have a driver which end up holding up processes and procedures which happens in any company.

Culture: both online (via Slack) and in the office is stellar - hands down best place I have worked. Growth mindset is definitely emphasized and failing isn't seen as a 

Recruiting: very impressed by how the team selects candidates who are not just a cultural fit but also who will succeed - even if they are coming from another industry or role.","Onboarding can be a bit of a sink or swim experience, so depending on your manager and who you are networked with, it can be tough at first.

While the nature of sales is competitive, Box does a fantastic job of keeping hiring standards high and ensuring that culture continues to be the most important aspect of bringing people on-board. Secondly, having a leader like Aaron Levie is unheard of. I have so much respect for him and the passion and commitment that he has for the success and mission of the business carries over in everything we do and is incredible to be a part of.

I have never worked at a company like Box where my ideas are not just heard, but valued and encouraged to be put into use. Everyone, from the most senior leadership down, is transparent in what is happening and what the goals of the company are. The company takes extra care in ensuring we, as employees, are well taken care of in our every day lives in and out of the office.

Feedback is a two way street, which allows for strong communication between peers, management, and upper management. I've never worked for a company that a CEO has a weekly call to give updates and highlights. The support from our entire company during the current pandemic has been incredible.","Box is an amazing product, but we earn our wins. Customers may think ""everything works"" or ""everything is fine"" or ""we have O365"" until we can show them how Box integrates with their tools, but helps them with very specific use cases. It can be difficult to get in the door, but if you make it count - it's worth the hard work."
157,Box,Great place to work!,2021-05-05,4.0,Account Executive,"People are awesome, work environment is extremely inclusive.",Tough marketplace to compete in.
158,Box,Amazing journey,2020-09-14,4.0,Account Executive,"Great place to work with intelligent, driven people. We have an amazing solution that can change the world and how people work. Our Teams work closely and always do what is right for our customers. I truly enjoy working at Box.","Needs to work on the ""meeting"" culture. We have meetings, to have meetings when something could be covered in email or a slack message. I understand the desire to stay connected in our WFH world, but most Sales professionals have been working WFH for years now and is not a new concept in the world of Software sales.
Market with our solutions first. We keep seeing a push on our products which we understand internally, but it would be helpful if marketing started with what problems we are solving for our customers and would make it much easier to explain our value prop during discovery calls and pitches. Small cons, but great upside!"
159,Box,Incredible community and culture,2020-09-21,5.0,Marketing,"Box knows employees are people too and enables you to balance home and work life with flex hours, remote work, great mental health benefits, lots of community activities and more. The product is also really epic - we are helping companies thrive and survive during the pandemic by enabling secure, remote work. Feels great to know we help companies and orgs from the IRC (International Rescue Committee) to Disney do incredible things.","Meeting heavy culture, but teams working to solve for that and give time back."

161,Box,Worth it,2020-04-02,4.0,Customer Success Manager,"Great people and a great product. You'll have access to a ton of resources to be successful, but it will require focus and it won't just ""come"" to you - you'll have to jump in, and Box does a fantastic job of recognizing and supporting you when you do. You'll be exposed to all kinds of use-cases and customers, good and bad, that will push you to the next level on a professional, technical, and personal level. Lastly, Aaron is as great of a leader as they come - he's as honest and transparent as you can be when managing a public company.","It's not easy - understanding the product, aligning it to value based use-cases, engaging with customers, finding the right internal alliance - it's all hard, and can be a challenge if you're remote. The pressure from competitors exacerbates all of this as well. Box is the outright best product on the market but it's also 2x or 3x the cost. We can lose focus sometimes as a result of external pressure but if you have the right attitude and perseverance it will be worth the ride."

Our bar is high for culture and I haven't worked with the typical silicon valley jerk yet in the many years I've been at the company. Lots of career opportunities.","Execution. There is a need for counterbalancing the visionary product strategy in our culture to rely more on strict data driven decisions, product market evaluation, and understanding what size product we can actually achieve with our size organization.

Through our non-profit arm Box.org we are encouraged and given time to go serve the community. There are volunteering programs happening all throughout the year that we can get involved in. I love how Box prioritizes helping the community around us.
The management is very transparent and always keeps us in the loop on all the happenings. We are never blindsided.",There's a lot of work to do! So it is up to the employees to create the work-life balance. But the management is supportive of your boundaries.

Really good health care and parental leave options. Free food in different capacities across the global offices. Commuter benefits, options to work from home when needed. Open Communication from higher ups.","Company is struggling to stay on top of a competitive market; therefore a lot of decisions are made hastily in an effort to increase revenue. The result is a lot of short term band-aids on processes that were rushed into execution. This also puts a lot of manual work onto the operational staff. Lastly, there was not a lot of room to grow; my work hardly changed over the three years I was there even with title changes. 
Biggest con is that employees are consistently underpaid in anything outside the sales department"

- Super amazing culture: we have a ton of in-office perks, but I've been amazed by the offerings now that we're remote for COVID (ie: virtual dance classes, cooking lessons from our chef, etc.). We have Friday lunches led by leadership, which offers great transparency and opportunities to ask questions

We are provided all of the tools and resources we need to succeed. The team is highly skilled and experienced, and work gets done more quickly and efficiently than any other company I've worked at before. 

The culture fosters inclusivity, humility and drive. I work with some of the smartest people who genuinely want to be the best versions of themselves both at work and outside of work. I am inspired by fellow Boxers who do countless acts of good in their communities.

Aaron Levie is an incredibly driven and visionary CEO. Things have been extremely busy this month and last with the COVID-19 pandemic, and Aaron was already ahead of the curve on building a strategy for our company before the pandemic fully took off in the U.S. I was inspired to see the way he mobilized over 2,000 people to come together and support each other, our customers and our communities. 

Box has a great mindset pertaining to remote work as well. I live in Colorado and they were willing to be flexible with a fully remote position for me, which I appreciate every day. The team has adapted to the new fully remote life better than I could've ever thought possible.

When I am at HQ, I am blown away by the amenities, food and events.

Box offers unlimited PTO and I never feel strange about using it. Box really values mental health of employees and encourages employees to take time off with friends and family, or just R&R when needed.

Again, I really cannot speak highly enough about this company.","Sometimes the amount of work travel can be draining for my role, which only happens during busy seasons (like events)."

- I've never worked with better customers - very fun to work with

- There aren't as many structured professional development opportunities compared to other companies (e.g. no leadership development program)

Some other benefits include Caltrain commuter benefits (Box is located in downtown Redwood City right above the train), and like most tech companies we have snacks and an in-building cafeteria and coffee bar.","Product strategy is clear, but questionable. The way that products are shipped at Box always involves at least 3-4 scrum teams to ship 1 thing so naturally, shipping takes a long, long time, if it happens at all. Urgent customer requests come in constantly at a rate that the teams are unable to ship. PMs have a lot of scope, but very limited impact, so unsurprisingly, the PM org goes through a lot of burn out and churn. PMs are then expected to fill in the gaps, which are massive due to limited to no resourcing across design, user research, and analytics. There's an overall sense of nepotism at the leadership level and leadership continuously hires more Director-level PMs to do IC work, because there aren't enough PMs to do all the work.

And to boot, no 401k matching, compensation is lukewarm, no bonuses for PMs under Director level, and no stock refresh until your 2nd year."

At the time, I was looking at Salesforce, Google, and several other tech companies, but Box stood out from the beginning because of the culture, training, and opportunity for success.  They hired me as an Outbound Business Representative and they offered me a 2-week training course right off the bat, which quickly got me acclimated to the solution and how to sell it.  Furthermore, they offer on-going training that allows you to stay up to date with what's new with Box, and consistent email communication as well.

Soon enough, I was promoted to more of a direct sales role on a vertical team, Inside Sales Representative for Higher Education, where again, I was coached and mentored very closely.  After a year in that role, I was promoted again to Account Executive for Higher Education.

Overall, Box has trained, challenged, and rewarded me for my hard work, which is something I love to see in a company.  I believe in the culture, the solution, and the future roadmap, and can't wait to move to Redwood City, where I'm sure they will continue to keep us Boxers happy.","As a public company, Box has changed quite a bit since I started.

Everyone is incredibly friendly, you get free food, the benefits are super cheap (though not free), and the CEO is inspiring.  This is a hot place to work- there's no doubt about it.","A lot of the folks are very inexperienced, and it can be frustrating to come in with experience under your belt and have to watch people make rookie mistakes without being able to jump in and save them from themselves.  It's very frowned upon to say ""Hey- you're doing this wrong"".  If you're trying to do something brand new- the sky's the limit.  But if you're trying to change an existing system or practice, it can be very challenging to do so while tip-toeing around everyone's feelings.  In some ways- it's great to be in a place that's so positive.  In some ways it's paralyzing.  This is particularly true if you're in the Customer Success department where an army of rookie, poorly trained (But very well-intentioned and hard-working) CSMs are running the show in ways that defy all logic (and their supervisors)."
