23,Curriculum Associates,CA Make My Life Better,2022-01-26,5.0,Senior Editor,"Thanks to working at CA, I was able to buy a house shortly after getting married. Previously, it had been a difficult thing to figure out where to buy because my husband and I commuted in opposite directions. Since CA treats employees like responsible adults and lets us work remotely, we found a house within our budget, closer to my husband’s office, and close enough to our families to see them every weekend. We couldn’t have done that without CA.
 
Without a commute, I have more time to prepare healthy meals and exercise. We are also in the process of becoming foster parents, which CA has shown a lot of support for. My immediate team is very excited for us and will work with any scheduling conflicts. CA at large has updated the parental leave policies to specify fostering.
I also appreciate the DEIB work the company is doing. Practice makes progress. Hopefully we will slowly but surely make the products and be the company we aspire to be.","I know this is new, but a clearer policy for fostering would be helpful. With all of the unknowns in the foster care system, additional clarity from CA would be comforting. 
Also, I have been an editor for a long time. When I consider trying something new, I'm afraid of losing the security and benefits at CA to try. This is not a position I've ever found myself in before.
There was some over-promising around DEIB. I think the company has been transparent about shifts and am still hopeful, though this is not how everyone feels."

Culture/Value: 

The culture at CA is amazingly supporting, friendly, and open-minded. The focus on student and educator needs is paramount and drives the work that we do. 

The more senior team members are genuinely excited to share their knowledge and experience to help other members of the team grow.

Working at CA has been able to give me an incredible sense of fulfillment. I love the work we do here and am committed to it. Yet, there is no expectation from the company for me to give up other aspects of my life to complete this work. Burnout is not expected or celebrated here. Especially after this last year, CA has done and continues to support its employees not just professionally, but also personally. Whether it is through providing online (or in person when possible) fitness classes, supporting parents with remote instruction/flexible schedules, or caring about the mental health of its employees, I am grateful to work for a company that cares about its employees.

The culture here is supportive and inclusive. People here each other rise rather than step on each other on the way up. It is rewarding to work somewhere that supports both personal and professional growth.

I am honored to work for a company that has the values it has and lives up to them.

-Rob Waldron, CEO:
It would be hard to write a review of the company and not mention Rob Waldron. He leads the company with integrity, grace, and humor.

139,Curriculum Associates,A fine company to work for if you don't have any greater goals,2020-11-23,2.0,Sales Support Analyst,It was close to my house.,"As with most bad reviews of this company, a major con is that bad behavior is consistently rewarded. Being humble is certainly not a value this company holds dear. I witnessed time and time again inconsiderate and toxic teammates be rewarded for stepping over others, throwing others under the bus, and being an all around brown-noser. Teachers pets tend to do well, which makes sense since it's an education company. 

This is also not the place to work if you are not interested in the mission of children's education and optimizing taxpayer spend. It will get very old very soon, and you will be reminded of this mission almost daily in one form or another. If you so even much as look like you're disinterested in being there, they'll find a problem with you. This company wants ""yes"" people and does not at all value creativity or innovation in the slightest.

Finally, this place is really not the place for young people to get a start in there career. This is a place where people end up and put down roots. Fine for middle aged employees with families to feed who have already gotten experience elsewhere. You will get no practical experience at this company, only experience as it pertains to educational software. Not one single thing I learned during my time here was applicable outside of the company - except how to be a brown-noser. If you have greater career aspirations, skip this company and find something that will give you more widely-applicable experience to work toward those goals. Do not get stuck here, which seems to be what the company wants since it invests no resources in training, skill development, or career pathing."

I am very happy working at CA.","As with any job, there are high expectations and projects/deadlines that must be met. This is not necessarily a con, but certain times of years come with a heavy workload."
156,Curriculum Associates,Best Company and Job Ever,2020-10-02,5.0,Educational Consultant,"I was hired by Curriculum Associates pre-Covid and have been training to present i-Ready content to schools and staff. I have felt extremely supported every step of the way. I appreciate my amazing manager and the entire CA team. My colleagues are just a text or email away to answer any question or to add support. I'd also like to acknowledge the amazing and helpful tech staff who have patiently answered my many calls. CA is generous in their pay structure, and allow us the time to thoroughly train so that we feel confident and prepared. They even send some fun perks to make us feel valued and appreciated. They seem to hire the most positive, kind, and bright individuals I have ever had the opportunity with whom to work. I have learned so many new tech skills such a how to conduct a smooth session via Zoom, and I love the interaction with all my attendees. I feel so honored to help teachers navigate this product and love seeing their excitement when they learn all that this product has to offer to differentiate instruction for their students. CA also prioritizes educating us all on systemic racism and I appreciate the regular meetings to better inform ourselves and to have a voice in the company. I never expected such a fulfilling and fantastic career after my many years in the classroom and I feel so honored and blessed to be a part of this amazing company.","My only con is that I didn't have the opportunity to use this product with all of my classrooms over the years. The lessons are highly motivating for students (just ask my third-grade grandson), and teachers have a wealth of data, tools, and resources right at their fingertips."
157,Curriculum Associates,"Great Mission, Great Company",2020-10-16,4.0,MBA Student,"Curriculum Associates bakes its core values into every part of the company, inward and outward facing. Employees are kind, smart, helpful, and passionate about what they do and the students and educators they are serving. Everyone is open and helpful, and quick with kind feedback.",The company touts itself on transparency and potential for lateral shifts but depending on your department it is easy to get siloed. Because of the nature of public school systems there is a lot of red type when creating content.
158,Curriculum Associates,Incredible!,2020-09-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Engaging and exciting work, welcoming atmosphere with teammates cheering on your successes, consistent communication from leadership.

160,Curriculum Associates,Awards for Best Place to Work is Legit,2020-10-02,4.0,Account Manager,"Taking the jump from a state job that I held for 20 years was scary but I'm so glad I did. CA attracted me with it's focus on their Core Values and I'm proud to say, two years later, I'm still attracted by it. This company stands by it's Core Values...people say it, live it, and remember it. Leadership doesn't just lead, they listen and act upon your feedback. It speaks volumes when the CEO responds to YOUR emails...like within a day or two...and I have no real ""direct line of management"" to him. People everywhere care about your well-being (send out virtual get togethers, complimentary fitness classes, check-in emails) and do everything to support you (provide training, equipment, feedback). I don't feel micro-managed and have the ability to still be creative with guidelines. The multiple awards the company has earned is truly legit. :) I'm thankful I found a work place that honors people and places their priorities in bettering our world through education.","There aren't a ton of negatives...serious. The remote work is challenging at times but if you are organized, diligent, and a great multi-tasker, it'll be easier. Working with every single time zone is probably the most challenging in terms of cons...but there's solutions to address this. The fast paced nature of the ""business"" does get hairy to navigate and work load can be daunting at times...but for me, the pros outweigh the cons by far."

From our CEO down, I have found everyone to be honest and up to the challenge of doing hard work, even when difficult conversations are needed to accomplish the goals.

177,Curriculum Associates,A Really Good Surprise,2020-03-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This was by far be the most refreshing interview experience I have ever had. There was value in the fact that I was a person in the process and not just a piece of paper. Every step of the way, I was asked if there were any questions or concerns with the process and what worked best for me. The process was very timely and all steps were well communicated. My visits to the office were also well coordinated and moved like clockwork. They valued my time as much as they valued theirs.

Becoming a part of Curriculum Associates was not only a breath of fresh air but a culture shock . . .  in a really good way! This is the first large company that I have been apart of that truly says it like it is and lives up to their mission statement. I have had the opportunity to become a part of a phenomenal team with a very strong sense of community. That alone to me speaks volumes to the value Curriculum Associates places in themselves and others.",None that come readily to mind.

Well, it's true! It's hard to believe how great the work/life balance is, work-from-home flexibility, great compensation + benefits, and a lot of incredibly smart, talented people who really care about the mission to serve young students. I never feel micro-managed,  everyone is supportive and encouraging.","I came from a much smaller company, and CA does feel a bit corporate (I'm sure as you've read, the company grew exponentially over the past few years and is still growing). Diversity is still somewhat developing (I'm a young minority woman and much of what I see especially in senior management are older white men). There's quite a learning curve here because of the complexities of the product/processes, but as long as you're patient with it you'll be fine."

Things take forever to get done. If you're an engineer who values efficiency, and doing things right, CA will change that.
The tech stack for some teams is outdated. You'll get stuck working on something that provides very little value outside of CA.

191,Curriculum Associates,Too good to be true,2019-09-21,5.0,QA Engineer,"Worked here for more than a year. Already left some comments about work culture here and now would like to talk about work/life balance here. One most important thing is our company really thinks family is the first. At the first you might doubt that if everyone cares family first then who is going to finish the work? But with my more than a year working time here, I found that everyone not only finish their jobs with excellent quality but also handle family stuffs very well. My own experience: had a baby last year, company already gave me lots of flexibility to accompany my wife for all prenatal checks(yes, every single one!) and during the due day window, I was working at the hospital right next to my wife. Even though I said I was working but my colleagues really understand me and try not to bother me. My wife felt safe as I was always around. Then the company gave me 2 months paid parental leave to take care of my baby. Apart from that, whenever I need time to take care of family, like when baby is sick, I can always take necessary time to handle it first. This is a great relief for me to get my family well. 

Thanks for reading long story until here.  To answer the question: how can you finish your work given that you spent the time to handle the family stuff? I had the same doubt as you at the beginning but now I believe there is no need to worry about. In fact, when the family is being well taken care of, I feel better when at work. This boosts my efficiency. Besides, I know I should be grateful to my company’s generosity, so whenever I have free time, I am willing to carry out extra commitments, even though they never ask me to. This is really good when you are voluntary to pay back by hard word, you never feel tired.",Not at all to be honest

226,Curriculum Associates,Excellent benefits and consideration of work/life balance.,2018-07-23,5.0,Professional Development Specialist,"I am entering my fourth year working for CA, and overall find my managers and upper management to be very respectful of personal time and flexible with scheduling needs around family and private life. There are very distinct busy seasons during which one oftens work more than 40 hours a week (including travel time), but also specific slow seasons where the work load is very light. The company culture has become more supportive and collegial over the time I have worked there, which has made it even better than when I started initially.","There is a lot of travel expected.  Because the number of employees has grown over the last couple years there is less out of state travel, however in some regions there are still many overnights expected during the busy season. A pathway to advancement is also not super clear, and many management positions are filled from outside the company."
227,Curriculum Associates,Doing important work with incredible colleagues,2018-06-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The product helps students all across the country. Colleagues are smart, kind, and value collaboration. The company shows it values its employees by being flexible about work schedules and working from home.","Not a con, but something to be aware of is that the pace is lightning fast. The workload can be heavy during certain times of the year."
228,Curriculum Associates,Good company losing its way,2018-06-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Good culture and benefits. Executive leadership seems to care about its employees. Very understanding of family and life events. Does seem to care about its customer base and helping educators.,"Could not recommend this as a place to work now. Too many big lies have happened. The company for years was sold as a place that was going to stay independently owned . Yet, as soon as the former owner retired we were sold within a year.

Additionally, other departments can have a major influence on your review, even overriding your own manager, causing reviews to be given which are not entirely fair and extremely one sided. This affects your bonus and yearly raise, and working hard seems to matter very little if someone in another department dislikes you, but will not talk to you about it. You find out about your problems at your review with no warning or ability to respond or course correct, if they exist at all.

The company positively reinforces bad behavior by promoting individuals who are toxic and also bad leaders. As long as results are done, and other trampled over, that’s all that matters.

Lastly, the company just seems to be becoming a bit of a cult. They think they are so great and amazing, but really they are just another place to work.  

It’s sad to see CA come to this as I did Love this company. They are slowly losing their head and soul and overtime this will lead to unhappiness, mismanagement and bloat."

It's the most exciting and diversified job I have ever held.  Huge talent here at CA but you would not know it because it's an ego free company.  Amazing t environment with a common goal - to make a difference in the world.  CA is a company that cares about every employee no matter what level you are.  If you want to be promoted there is no one that will hold you back.  You are encouraged if you want to move to another role.  I feel that the amazing environment starts at the top with the CEO.   He is a great mentor to everyone here.  This is a company where family is first.  Most companies will say that but CA means it.  We are encouraged here, we are rewarded here, we are family here!",I honestly have nothing negative to say.
231,Curriculum Associates,A Great Place to Grow,2018-06-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"CA has some of the smartest and kindest people I've ever worked with. The culture and family like atmosphere has maintained even though the company has grown. If you are looking for a place to grow professionally this is a great place. Professional development and opportunities are available for everyone at the company. LinkedIn Learning is free for all employees, so I've used it to gain additional skills and to continue learning about additional areas. It's great to work for a company that cares.","Work can get a bit busy, but the flexibility to work when its best for you helps to balance that."

We identify areas where we can grow and improve and the research, collaboration and expertise that goes into supporting all initiatives is really incredible.

235,Curriculum Associates,Field Service Team,2018-05-09,3.0,Service Provider,"Great benefits, ample vacation time (three weeks to start), mostly awesome co-workers","Company implements changes that benefit home office workers but make life harder for field people. Field service team members get the short end of the stick when it comes to ""three-legged stool teams"" with account managers getting less incentive pay than sales reps and PD people getting zero incentive pay. Promotions based on perception/brown-nosing as opposed to actual ability. Most products are truly awesome on their own but company continues to try to sell/market them as good fits for other purposes. Greed has definitely overtaken the company since it was sold to investment firm. It no longer feels like a mission-driven company and the pressure is on to sell, sell, sell."
236,Curriculum Associates,Treating people like people,2018-01-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've never worked at a company that actively tries so hard to be transparent and fair. Company leadership genuinely tries to share as much information with employees as possible and do right by them. I feel like I'm being treated like a person here, not a number, which is a feat at a quickly growing company. There's a sense that employee feedback is really heard here.","The hours can get long if you're not protective of your time. Like at any company, it's on you to create your work/life balance. There's enough to do that it will definitely take over your life if you let it - hey, that's education."

241,Curriculum Associates,Curriculum Associates seems to care about their employees,2018-01-18,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"When you start working at a new company it can be difficult to adjust and know how you are doing. At my previous job I almost never met with my manager to get feedback but at CA I've got a great schedule worked out to meet every couple weeks. Not only do I get feedback from my manager but other managers have given me feedback as well. So far I've found this to be really great in helping me figure out where I'm at.

The company is growing fast and it looks like there are always opportunities opening up. Some cool perks include a gym and a cafeteria with subsidized lunches, though they are a bit small and the options are limited. Rob Waldron, the CEO,  shows interests and works directly with employees at multiple levels. He really seems to love the company and gives great engaging presentations.",The company is located in Billerica which isn't the greatest place to commute to. I wish they were a bit closer to the city. There are sometimes options to work from home but I don't feel like there is a clear policy. You get some office politics and people occasionally no following policies put in place that makes our jobs easier. This ends up causing more headaches but doesn't happen that often.

Company also hires the smartest, most qualified people in the industry.  Work/life balance is generally pretty good and the management genuinely cares about your well-being and personal success.  Best company I have ever worked, mostly due to the fact that the people and the company culture are world-class","There can be some micromanaging on teams, and some inter-departmental distrust and competition that occasionally limits the company's ability to evolve and change its product offerings.

Everyone's motivated and passionate to make a difference. No customer question/feedback is too small to oversee. I found everyone to be supportive of my career, professional, and personal development and there's nothing better to ask for from your colleagues. It was a privilege to work with the most talented and passionate individuals.

The company is fast-growing, so there are definitely more growth and career opportunities underway.","Like with any fast-growing company, there are periods of high stress and overwork, but I'm glad that management (and teams that I've worked with) is taking decisions to alleviate the problem for the long-run."

263,Curriculum Associates,Review of CA,2016-05-11,5.0,,"The people here truly care about our mission, as do leaders and managers. We've had a ton of growth over the past few years and that makes things exciting and fast-paced. There's always something to do here! Management does welcome feedback, and actively tries to make our company better. Does that mean that every single person will be happy all the time? No, of course not. It also doesn't mean CA is the right fit for everyone, and that's ok. Having a good attitude, working hard, and understanding that we're growing and changing is very important if you want to be happy here! Also, it's simply not true that people are pressured to write positive reviews on here. In fact, the only thing that's motivated me to a post a review is seeing the false claims on here that people are forced to do so. People are encouraged to write reviews in general, but are NOT told to only say good things.","On the flip side, the rapid growth brings a lot of challenges! Lots of new hiring, changes to processes, and uncertainty. If you're someone who wants the same thing every day and simply wants a 9-5, then you might find things chaotic or stressful - but many people wouldn't consider this a bad thing! It's just a matter of fit."
264,Curriculum Associates,Meh.,2016-05-01,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Good product. Smart coworkers. Renovated space. Fun activities. Catered food.,"Contrived: It's true. They send emails for employees to write fake reviews to balance out the sincere ones.

Bad management: CA seems like a good place to work from the outside but once you're there and see their processes - they need a ton of work. With my department, management was sloppy. They focused on what they needed to get done on their plate but were lousy managers. I knew it wasn't the place for me after the first month.

No clear goals: With every meeting I was in, projects did not have a clear direction or deadline. People who needed to be in office were always sick or on a yacht in Ibiza. Projects often got cancelled or delayed until oblivion. Sure, if you're okay with incompetent work - you can continue to work this way. But I'm not about that."

Culture is fairly laid-back.","It varies from department, but the one I was a member of was managed by someone who was focused on furthering her own career as opposed to helping her employees learn and grow.  There is a lot of favoritism and cronyism.  If you are a yes person and can put on a fake smile for 9 month s to a year, you get promoted.  If you come in, do your job but also tell management how you think things can be done better, you will be punished. Implementation department reeks of this, so do not apply if anything in your prospective job title/duties mentions the word ""implementation."""
269,Curriculum Associates,The Shine is coming off,2016-03-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company has some of the best products on the market (albeit the tech component is falling behind because of management decisions to focus on print).  The compensation is decent, and the benefits are good.","There has been a huge shift in culture in just the last year.  HUGE.  This is not the CA it was 12-15 months ago.  As has been mentioned in nearly every non-gleaming review, this is not a place for you if you aren't a ""Yes!"" man/woman.  Senior Management doesn't really want to hear the issues, they want to be told they are right and have their ego stroked.  Some major attitudes and egos within the Sr echelons.  The cattiness has been mentioned and it's getting worse.  Starting to be more and more cliques which are making doing business the right way more and more difficult.  Friends are being brought in to staff management positions and all it's creating is an environment where doing business and helping teachers/students is getting harder and harder."

My managers and the upper level execs (especially CEO) are wildly transparent and open to feedback (you can literally read the feedback the our CEO receives regarding his leadership).

There's lots of room for growth and professional development, which my manager always encourages me toward, and I appreciate that greatly, especially as someone just entering the workforce.

Perks: There's an awesome, subsidized cafeteria as well as a shuttle for commuters coming from Boston/Cambridge. Besides a small-ish gym, we also have a fitness class being offered onsite now (only once a week, hopefully that increases). Managers understand that you have a life and are fine if you occasionally need to work from home to make an appointment or something.","To the extent that we are a growing tech company, it's unavoidable to have to work with lots of data, and some roles can be very process-heavy. Ultimately, everyone knows this, and the teams are working to integrate this feedback into the future roadmap, which is great; but the work can get repetitive at times.

There is so much energy here- I love it!","The company is in a transition period as far as business systems go (internal processes and software choices are still somewhat behind the times or challenged by the rapid scaling-up to match the company's very rapid growth).

288,Curriculum Associates,Great cause -> Not such a perfect place,2015-05-07,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Some good people and certainly a great cause...who doesn't want to help kids?,"Knowing the people, yeah the posting on Apr 19, 2015 is an obvious plant to buff up the ranks.  Too much focus on hiring people you know....friends over culture.  So the vetting process isn't as up to par as it should be and therefore bringing in folks who probably shouldn't be here.   Plenty of ""yes"" people indeed.  If you aren't a yes person, then you are on the outs.  Some of the other negative reviews are pretty accurate."

290,Curriculum Associates,"Ego Driven, Not Mission Driven",2015-04-28,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some helpful supplemental products for intervention, good legacy products, some highly competent employees.","The current reigning CEO likes to surround himself with yes men and women. Flattery will get you everywhere. There are too many directors, managers, VPs and newly created departments and the company is growing exponentially but product development does not warrant this. Nobody (especially managers and VPs) wants to be seen as less than perfect so there is little risk-taking or innovation. The digital product is behind competitors because too much attention is spent on free apps instead of revenue-generating products."
291,Curriculum Associates,Great place to be,2015-01-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The company has a great mission and vision and due to the hard work of everyone at the company we have seen tremendous growth. The compensation and benefits are very competitive and you see a lot of people staying for many years.,The workload is very high and at times the work/life balance can skew the wrong way.
292,Curriculum Associates,"""Very happy and satisfied that I came to Curriculum Associates...""",2014-12-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been at Curriculum Associates for about 10 months, and have found this organization to be what my research showed.  It is mission oriented, focusing on kids and schools, caring, supportive and forward looking.  When I researched the company before accepting an offer, I literally could not find anyone that was critical of CA. I have found that since joining CA, it is still a postive and energizing place to work.  It is so nice to work with other caring professionals that work hard, but also keep a strong family/life balance.",Can't really find any cons at this time.
