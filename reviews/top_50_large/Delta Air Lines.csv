0,Delta Air Lines,Awesome place to work,2022-03-30,5.0,Red Coat,Everything!!!! Cannot say anything bad about working here,Nothing that I can think of!
1,Delta Air Lines,If you hate a 9-5 and working from a cubicle I say this is the job for you!,2022-02-23,5.0,Flight Attendant,"If you hate a 9-5 and working from a cubicle I say this is the job for you! Coming from someone that's done it, it's definitely refreshing. However, I will say Covid has affected the way I feel about this job. Overall, the aviation industry has taken a hit as a whole which the world has been able to see through the news and social media. With all of this being said, I used to look forward going to work and getting to explore a new city or country but now all I hope for when I step on a plane is to get home without being screamed at or a black eye. The benefits are great and the culture is a very family oriented one, the pay can use some work but it's still competitive to other airlines. Covid is slowly becoming something we're all learning to live with because it doesnt seem to be going away any time soon so I will say that I do have hope things will slowly normalize and passengers will have a less aggressive demeanor towards all staff. Once federal mandates get flexible and airfare rises back up again I would say its worth the shot on joining the team.


Pros- flight benefits, discounted/free perks with partnering companies, health benefits, good retirement plan, profit sharing bonuses","inconsistent & hard/unflexible schedule as a junior in the company, emotionally draining, long work days"
2,Delta Air Lines,"Great work environment, good pay, stable company, excellent benefits",2018-03-19,5.0,Associate Software Developer,"Flight benefits are the standout benefit for sure. Aside from that, the work in the IT department is project based, so very team oriented with steady, predictable work patterns. Positive environment with good management.",Very hard to stand out in such a large company. Promotions are few and very far between. Commute to the main office can be rough being located on the south side next to the airport
3,Delta Air Lines,Flight Attendant,2015-09-18,5.0,Flight Attendant,"Awesome company to work for!  Fun work environment, cares about employees, great uniforms, competitive pay, just an awesome company to work for! They are very flexible, you can live anywhere in the world you want, as long as your able to get to work when you need to be there!","At the end of the day, it is a very large corporation.  So it is very easy to become just a ""number"" in the company.  The flight attendant group is not unionized, so rules can change very often. Make sure your time management is impeccable, because you cannot be late for work AT ALL, and there aren't many acceptable excuses, even rain is not an excuse."
4,Delta Air Lines,No Integrity,2022-03-27,1.0,Flight Attendant,They present themselves good but it's only facade,"I was interested in appliying as a language of destination flight attendant, so I sent a very politely and respectful formulated mail with two questions to the service who treats accommodation for people with disabilities because I am concerned.
They never sent an answer!!! They do not even have the slightest respect to respond!! Where is this integrity they speak about the whole day when they don't even have a minimum of respect? For comparison: I sent the same question to the european leader (and one of the world leaders), the famous L. group, and they responded immediately the next day in a very careful and detailed manner. I understand now why Delta is only a 3 stars company and L. a 5 stars company. So I decided to apply for L. Since this experience I think it's clear that all this talking about integrity, respect, diversity and inclusion are only marketing strategies without a real base."
5,Delta Air Lines,Reservations Agent is My Job,2022-03-22,3.0,Customer Experience Specialist,"Lots of positivity in the environment. When the Company does well, all employees are rewarded.","In my particular area of work, the amount of training that used to be offered to starting employees has been cut by about 2/3rds. Sometimes I feel that there is no way to help a customer because I simply don’t know how."
6,Delta Air Lines,One of the 2020 Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For,2022-03-27,4.0,Sales Account Executive,"Delta has been named one of the 2020 Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For, according to global research and consulting firm Great Place to Work® and Fortune. This is the fourth straight year Delta has earned this honor.","Promotions are hard to come by. 

Getting hired at Delta is about as difficult as it is at any Fortune 500 company. It may take several weeks for the process to be completed. As always, knowing someone inside the company never hurts. As a matter of fact, if you get a referral, it typically guarantees a call from a Delta recruiter."
7,Delta Air Lines,LAX Cargo,2022-02-08,4.0,Cargo Agent,"LAX cargo is a great place to work. Parkings no hassle, good pay, GREAT benefits. A handful of co workers who make the workplace great and make it feel like a family. I love Delta as a company but this department and new management has alot to change.","Management uses fear and lies alot to new employees. They also have a lot of favoritism especially to the ones theyre friends with. LAX has a small circle of friends within so if you complain or fight for something, they will turn on you and make your life miserable. No benefit of the doubt to employees. They will write you up for stupid reasons to make u stay and not able to transfer. Work drama and favoritism is at its best in the morning shifts. Co workers in this shift, talks alot behind other employees back. As co workers and managements are friends in this shift. Delta has a open door policy yet this management in this department will not listen or care. If you wanna complain, talk to Atlanta and not LAX HR."
8,Delta Air Lines,Love DAL,2022-03-21,5.0,CSA Ticketing Agent,"Great benefits, training, opportunities, flights go everywhere, great company to work for.","Because people never leave the company, may not receive a good shift due to so many employees have decades of seniority. Numerous people have several decades of experience, they never retire! Usually have to work weekends due to low seniority"
9,Delta Air Lines,It's a starter job,2022-03-31,3.0,Customer Experience Specialist,"-benefits (401k, health, dental, life, etc)
-flight benefits","-micromanaging

-short training period for a difficult job"
10,Delta Air Lines,Great Company,2022-03-27,5.0,Product Line Manager,"Straight forward, safety conscious, quality driven, data driven",Can be very political with internal politics
11,Delta Air Lines,Delta is worth applying to,2022-03-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great amazing company love it so much,Working scheduled was not the best for family life
12,Delta Air Lines,Great job,2022-03-29,5.0,Reservations Agent,"Flight benefits, health insurance, 401K match, etc.",Low pay but lots of opportunity to grow
13,Delta Air Lines,"Great Company, Great People, Great Travel Perks!",2022-02-08,5.0,Flight Attendant,"Love working at Delta! It's really nice when you tell people which airline you work for (because once you say you're a flight attendant that's always the next question!) and then have the response be: 
Omg, I love Delta! 
That's my favorite airline!
I only fly Delta! 

Coworkers are awesome, lots of internal job opportunities, great bases and you can transfer (based on operational need, usually a 1 or 2 times a year the company awards lots of transfers) if you want to experience life in another city. Really get the sense that company leadership cares, and although it is a corporate company, I would describe my experience of the company culture as being more friendly and encouraging rather than a formal ""cold"" business like environment. 

I hope this helps! Overall, I've had a great experience and am proud to be a Delta employee.","These are not necessarily cons, but just things to be aware of:

Delta does not have a flight attendant union. Do your research and if that is important to you, the other mainline airlines (UA, AA) are unionized. Opinions on this vary within the company, and while I've met many who are pro union, others are ""proud to be union free"".

If considering Delta or another airline I would say to look at the bases and consider if it is important to you to live ""in base"" or if you would be ok either moving or commuting. Schedules are flexible, you will have 6 on call days a month rather than a full reserve schedule (very rare for a new hire, most if not all other airlines put new flight attendants on straight reserve) but keep in mind you will have these 6 on call days for years before you have enough seniority.

Standards at Delta are very high. There is a reason so many ppl love flying on Delta-- but you will work hard during flights to keep customer satisfaction up and maintain that positive company brand. I have flight attendant friends who work for other airlines and sometimes I get the impression that I am working a lot harder than them for similar pay. Something to consider."
14,Delta Air Lines,Amazing Company,2022-03-28,5.0,Pilot Scheduler,Awesome company to work for the culture is amazing and they really do care about you,No cons working at Delta
15,Delta Air Lines,Your Salary is based on How much you want to work and if you really want to get PAID or vacate.,2022-03-21,4.0,Flight Attendant,Make and manipulate your schedule to work best for you. In case you wanna squeeze in a bday celebration or extend your personal vacation days,"Just remember that in doing so, you will be affecting the next pay period's paycheck. so you have to factor in and balance your hours. Work hard one pay period to cover for the hours you won't be working the following pay period. If not you will feel the burn of being broke or kinda living paycheck to paycheck."

Developers have support on call shifts, 24/7 for a week, where they must keep a support phone with them and watch a tedious mailbox. Not mentioned by recruiter.
Profit sharing is dependent on profit, and recruiter will pitch it to you as if it is what you definitely will be making- it is not. It is found money if you get it.

Where does this make sense! Firstly, whomever did the assessment on how long it should take from start to finish to get a flight out in 25-35 minutes. Needs to reassess this process. This assessment must’ve been done when only a selected few were able to afford to fly because in this day and age everyone is flying and some flights have over 180 people getting on with children animals wheelchairs and this is to be done in 35 minutes for a flight to get out on time!!!! Who is this fair to, the customer service is suffering as there is a rush to get people on a flight so there is NO DELAY!!! Who in the world came up with this plan, RETHINK IT AND CHANGE IT, I guarantee you will have a happier staff, second, why are your agents allowed to ride to each other????? Not wanting to help new agents? Where has this ever worked for the greater good? Trust if they can be rude to someone they will see everyday and they don’t even know they are rude to your customers…..this is a fact, if you as delta management think this is what you need YOU DONT!!! align yourselves with agents who are genuine and desire to be customer service driven and value being a giver of happiness to others, granted you have given sky priority passengers carte Blanche to be just down right disgusting to your staff but that does not have to change the heart of a real customer service driven individual, I am able to over look this really bad behavior but some of your younger staff will not.

They promote based on personal relationships, not merit, not work ethic, not ability, training or education. It is a good ol' boys club through and through. TechOps is especially problematic, where these kind of behaviors and cultures can become a safety hazard. 

They did not enforce covid related restrictions when employees refused to adhere to them, putting all their employees at risk. 

Older employees just hang around all day doing nothing, while collecting top-rate pay and piling their work onto younger coworkers."

Close to Atlanta, good food to eat in Hapeville.","401k match, while you as a DFP (Delta Flight Products) Employee get 6% matching, Delta employees get 9%, and usually to do a whole lot less work.

No career growth potential. To become a project engineer (the next step after engineer II) they require 10-15 years industry experience. They will try to tell you that experience outside of aircraft interiors does not count.
Raises? forget about it. Their literal policy is ""Praises not raises"". That is what has been heard from the executive team.

The flight benefits:
They are worthless. DFP (Delta Flight Products) is a subsidiary of Delta. Delta gives employees standby flight privileges. The most common ones are S3, given to Delta Employees. They also get 6 S2 standby tickets per year.
As a DFP employee, you fly S3C. The priority also is subject to your start date, the longer you've worked there, the higher your priority. But because you are the red headed step child, and fly S3C, no matter how long you work there, a fresh out of college hire at Delta will always have a higher priority than you.

It gets worse. Retirees and Delta employee dependents get S3B priority. So someone not working at Delta has better flight benefits than you farm league person (again words of Executive there). 
Co-ops (Paid interns) also get S3 so they will always beat you on a flight.

To summarize the flight benefits:

S2 - Delta Employees get 6 per year

S3 - Delta Employees and Co-ops/Interns, Delta Employee's Dependent Children and spouses/parents

S3A - Some subsidiary, NOT DFP.

S3B - Retired Delta Employee/Non Dependent Children of Delta Employees

*** S3C - This would be your priority as a DFP Employee ****

S4 - Buddy Pass

Hey at least you will beat people flying on a buddy pass...lol

Work From Home Policy:

Its a joke, basically doesn't exist. They require you work majority of your hours in the office for god knows why. You will be lucky to get every other Friday at home.

Bonuses:
Delta Employees have gotten 14% profit sharing equating to a 10-15k for engineers typically.
DFP payout was usually 2-3K."

Their is an automatic 3% contribution, regardless is you contribute. So in reality, they match dollar per dollar up to 6%.

Overall, its a decent entry level job, for someone that would be in college, or a retiree living a second life, or someone just simply looking to make an extra income on the side.","!!! Now time for the elephant in the room !!!
In my professional opinion, the management structure seems to be quite complex, and very inefficient. Just like any other typical large corporation, their is plenty of unfair and unethical things, that takes place, that is way beyond our control. They lack the opportunities for their frontline employees, to progress professionally, which makes any form of upward mobility, seem like a far fetched dream. No training programs in place, no tuition reimbursement, only some small discounts on overpriced online colleges. Pretty much as frontline employee, I professionally feel that, management has been negligent on investing into their human capital. The culture has somewhat changed, in the last couple of years, with the departure of our previous CEO. I professionally feel, that morale is at an all time low, and with that being said, the turnover rate will start to increase if, management fails to address the issues as stated above. Their is too much of an emphasis on metrics, especially from lower level management. Not many corporate or merit positions, outside of Atlanta, which is the headquarters, and the lacking of remote opportunities. I feel that our customers, have better technology through their apps on their phone, than we do as an agent assisting customers. For example, we use computers that have Windows 7 OS, and currently, Windows OS is on its 11th edition. I don't even need to further explain the absurdity which I just mentioned. Keep in mind that this a multi billion dollar corporation. I could keep going on and on, but don't want to appear as a degenerate."

The company is large, so it's easy to fall through the cracks. This can be a pro or con depending on your personal situation.

Long working hours. My shift is 8 hours. However, because I work at a large airport, I have to park offsite and take a shuttle in. That entire process adds an extra 1.5 hours to my commute.

Very stressful going from call to call every shift. Having worked there so long, I feel like I got sucked into thinking they have the best culture etc. they say it so many times you tend to believe. They are good at micromanaging. Flight benefits are not that great! Flights are always full and airport agents are rude to their own.

Sick policy precovid was non-existent, with any more than 3 ""occurances"" per rolling year as grounds for termination. The most common advice from senior crew to junior crew is ""know your rights"", as scheduling and management will often turn a blind eye to violations in minimum rest.

The setup of the business for employees is very poor. You will have a Delta badge, access to the Delta campus, a Delta employee number, etc. However, you will not receive the same profit sharing nor will you be treated as an internal candidate for opportunities at Delta. That’s right, you have to apply as an external even though Delta HR processes your pay and knows your salary. Meanwhile, the leadership at Delta Vacations are considered Delta employees when the rest of the non leadership employees aren’t. This creates a very unfair approach and makes you feel devalued working for Delta Vacations and not Delta."

Being able to travel places for free","The longer you stay, the worse your pay will be relative to new hires. There is a general unwillingness to advance your pay once they get you through the door. If you stay around for 5+ years, undergrads with no experience will get hired at a higher salary than you.

Highly political! Exhibiting a cultish mentality is required to advance your career. 

Two faced leadership. Empty promises of promotions. You will get strung along by your manager to do a ton of extra work then be “rewarded” by being pressured into a lateral move to a neighboring team.

Overworked individual contributors have not been rewarded for their sacrifices during the pandemic. A common theme: you and your coworkers do 150% of your normal work and get paid 75% of your normal salary. Meanwhile, US tax dollars are used to pay large bonuses to General Managers and above. 

Delta is more worried about looking ‘woke’ than actually paying minority front line workers a decent wage. Leaders over-index on talking about social issues because they see it as a marketing tool to win business."

You will stand out if you have an ounce of talent.,"Very low pay. Upper management is very disorganized and many divisions have become very toxic as all the good leaders and talent have started to leave or retired with the COVID package. Due to the mass exodus, many people have been promoted to positions they are obviously not qualified for and the repercussions are now being seen. Insecure leaders making power grabs for territory."

Titles are not given to show the importance of equality amongst one another.
Employer values each employee as well as their life outside of work. If anything comes up in life they encourage you to think about what is best for you and your family first. If it interferes with work, they will find a way to work around it. If this is not possible, they will help you find something to accommodate your situation, even if it is another employer. I have never seen and/or heard of any other company that values each employee to this magnitude.","I have no cons about this employer and/or working with a great, ""well-oiled machine"" type of business."

Travel benefits are awesome when you're able to use them

Internal movement/career advancement is encouraged and supported

Recent focus on DE&I seems genuine and I appreciate how the company has been reporting out on their progress in improving equity for minority employee groups","Compensation is low compared to other industries - it's pretty widely known at Delta that most merit employees could leave and immediately start making significantly more money.

No/limited remote work options. CEO is very against remote or even hybrid work and has been pushing for in-office employees to be back in office 5 days per week since early 2021.

Short paid maternity leave, no paternity leave policy. No adoptive leave policy. No fertility planning benefits.

Gym onsite is great, but costs money to use. 

Flight benefits are great but can be challenging to use when flights are full.

Often long hours are expected, and almost everyone I know has a company phone they check regularly on nights/weekends. Last year, we all had to reduce our schedule (and pay) by 20% due to the pandemic but most employees were expected to continue working 40+ hours each week due to workload/staffing shortages.

Because it's a big company, there are a lot of processes/programs in place that make change very slow or non-existent and can make it hard for managers to do the right thing for their employees."

It's cut throat. I saw a lady get in trouble for having a key chain that was not the right color! 

Unfortunately, I was fired for being associated with a bad egg. He apparently was exposing himself to other flight attendants. I didn't know that and we had just met on a flight and went out on the town because it's rare you meet a flight attendant that actually wants to have fun. Pretty sure he drugged me because I have no recollection of that night after dinner and I ONLY HAD 2 MARTINIS. I ended up missing our first leg the next day and got alcohol screened because of it. 
They fired me because I blew a .02 LOLLLLLL 
Anyway... what I didn't realize is that he was already in big trouble with the company for I guess ""exposing himself"" therefore, I didn't stand a chance. They wouldn't listen to me or hear me out. I was guilty of missing a flight, which is NOT GOOD bc of minimum crew rules. I'm sure that flight got delayed quite a bit, OOPS, and because I blew a measly .02 sooo maybe it was justified?! Lol They sent me home and made me wait a month before they told me I was fired. So I was home for a month without pay... just waiting. Like that's not punishment enough lolll. 
Moral of the story... Join an airline with a UNION. They will fight for you in situations like this and you actually have a chance to defend yourself."

764,Delta Air Lines,"Long hard days, but rewarding in its own way",2021-01-22,5.0,Ramp Agent Seasonal Ready Reserve,"First of all, know what you are getting into: You will be tired, you will be working in the elements, you will have days you hate the idea of looking at another damn plane coming into your gate. You get quality uniforms though. 

However, I knew it was a seasonal job and that I had some of the best flight benefits in the industry. As a college student the summer work and pay were totally worth it. And my family was able to make extensive use of the flying as well. We got our moneys worth, and you get a daily full body workout to boot. 
Additionally you get a yearly profit sharing bonus - unknown if theyre giving out anything for covid, I didnt even get called to work last summer (indefinite standby).","The volume of baggage. I was working international and wondering why i was always tired, so i did the math: 4.5 planes(off load is half, onload is half) each load is about 200 bags, and each bag is about ~30lbs. 

So, 30* 200*4.5 = 27,000lbs or in other words: I stacked, pushed, onload or offloaded 13.5 US Tons PER DAY. 
You are an ""industrial athlete"" and need to watch your health. Do not try to be a hero and bust your *butt for a company paying less than $15 an hour. View it as a decent summer job plus a gym membership and a chance to see the world ( I went to France, Argentina, and a few US places. Some in first class, neat experience)

Also, The elements. You get rained on alot and I worked the winter once > MISERABLE! I remember standing at a gate in full winter gear with the rain gear on top, watching the rain fall sideways in the super strong wind, shivering with soaked gloves near freezing my hands (it was sitting at like 35degrees so no snow) thinking that I had never wanted to quit so badly in my life. Wet, cold, tired and hungry. Great for morale, builds character I guess."

816,Delta Air Lines,"Potentially great place to work, crippled by management",2021-05-19,2.0,CNC Programmer,"-Excellent machine shop equipment (if hindered by a reluctance to properly tool up for production runs)
-Good Safety Practices.
-Pay scales competitive with similar jobs in other industries in Atlanta.","-Support equipment not quite up to the task of running all CNC equipment at once.
-Vacuum systems cannot keep up with CNC router table vacuum requirements as well as the vacuum requirements for the layup chamber.
-Waterjet cleaning system doesn't have enough water flow capacity to keep the reservoir clean (employees had to manually shovel sediment out of waterjet basin when said sediment got too thick to run the machine properly, resulting in protracted downtime for that machine when I worked there). Things may be better now, but since I had to post a review to access Glassdoor I may as well be transparent with how things were at the time I worked there.

-Upper Management regularly required employees to violate workflow standard practice in order to ""get jobs done"" (in spite of the fact that any audit would expose this and result in fines against the company). those pushing for this would also find reasons to write up any employees that complained about this practice. 

-Version Control for CNC programs was broken because the PDM system would not allow CNC programmers to save CAM data with the original 3d models published by Engineering. This was a quirk of the CAM software being used (CAMWorks, which saves CAM data inside the Solidworks 3d models). The upshot is that every time a shipset came through the shop, CNC programmers would have to regenerate programs for every single component to verify that the GCode to be run in the shop matched the current drawing released by Engineering. Including Production CAM work with Engineering models was in process at the time I left, but there were rampant issues with Engineering's 3d models not adhering to ASME Y14.41 (read: 3d models did not accurately match the 2D drawing specifications, and CNC programmers had to make adjustments to models until they matched the prints, then generate CNC programs, etc.--this is why CNC programmers were having to constantly re-do the work on every shipset, this work could not be saved back into the system for future use/reference to have a clear evidence trail from Engineering to the programs posted for previous shipsets).

-Engineering had a terrible habit of referencing industry standards on their released prints that CNC programmers and other shop personnel did not have access to (because they did not have Engineering roles, so the system would not allow us to view those standards for reference). A detailed audit of time spent on various shop operations would reveal an astronomical waste of time spent asking Engineers to tell people at various stages of production what a specific standard meant for the feature in question in terms of dimension/finish/etc."

I never traveled outside of the U.S. until working at Delta made it affordable for me and my mom. I even brought my girlfriend to Amsterdam and Paris for virtually nothing. The potential discount on flight tickets with the benefits include greater than 99% off the overall price of the ticket. Also very easy to pick up shifts.,"Dated vehicles/equipment, lack of communication between different positions, rigid schedule at first but once you get to know the right people, creating a schedule becomes easier. However, I was a full-time college student at a school which was about 2 and half hours away and they would not even begin to assist with the mandatory 24-hour work schedule each week. If you did not know coworkers who would be willing to pick up your shifts or trade shifts with you, then you were out of luck getting days off."

I'd even say we get a little more because we have access to really nice hotels and travel partners that allows us to stay at their properties next to nothing or in some cases completely free. You add free or reduced lodging with Free flights and that's a perk that you just don't see every day. The culture is pretty solid, about what I would expect from an agency. My outlook may be rosier than some but considering where I cam from, I ca not complain about the position I am in now. I work with some fantastic people and we're doing some meaningful work for this brand and I enjoy that. We get two remote-work days a week, any day you choose. I could not be happier with my work-life balance. Also Benefits are the same as Delta employees as well, which are generally top notch. DLV is an underrated place to work!","The pay.

That attitude has created a culture of cooperation and family.","Delta pay, before the pandemic forced temporary pay cuts, was industry-leading as far as I could see...however, in the leadership ranks, each level you climb ultimately means they get a bigger and bigger portion of your life. At a certain point, it became difficult to manage a healthy work-life balance."
917,Delta Air Lines,One of the Best,2021-03-19,4.0,Flight Attendant,"D hires some pretty amazing people, so your crews are generally a diverse group of quality individuals. Many crews become fast friends.
Flexible trips with options for swapping, only a few “on-call” days.
Great benefits, with many major bases to choose from, and relatively easy commuting options depending on your location.","No union, but many options to protect yourself. You just have to be proactive about being knowledgeable of your work rules."
918,Delta Air Lines,Great place to work.,2021-04-25,5.0,Airline Pilot,Very well run airline. Puts it's employees first.,I have to retire and leave the airline at 65.F.A.A. mandatory retirement age.

Back pain"
921,Delta Air Lines,Great Memories,2021-05-10,5.0,Team Lead,The work life balance is great.,Some of my co-workers are unmotivated.
922,Delta Air Lines,Management doesn't walk the walk,2021-05-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The check shows up twice a month,"Delta has a long history of operating by its core values - honesty, integrity, respect, perseverance, and servant leadership. That sounds great, until its actually time to live by them. Management frequently targets employees who they don't like. They will scour the internet trying to dig up dirt on employees, who have done nothing wrong, to bring disciplinary action against the unwanted. As proof, Delta recently lost a whistle blower case where a pilot reported safety concerns and management responded by requiring the pilot to submit to a medical review where they subsequently paid a doctor (who has since lost his license to practice) $73,000 who diagnosed the pilot with bipolar disorder, a diagnosis that would permanently ground a pilot. The pilot went to the Mayo Clinic to dispute the diagnosis and a board unanimously found the pilot did not have bipolar disorder. The diagnosis cost $3200. Delta lost the judgement and is ordered to pay the pilot $500,000. All of the managers and lawyers still work here expect for one. Most have been promoted and the one who doesn't work here is now the head of the FAA.

Still don't believe me. Google ""Labor Dept. rules Delta discriminated against whistleblower pilot"" and you will see the ruling for yourself

-benefits are terrible. You will pay thousands in premiums and deductibles before Delta pays a penny. Walmart of all places has better benefits.
-pay is subpar. Delta likes to talk about ""Total compensation"" which includes profit sharing. Well, a profit sharing of $0 doesn't pay many bills. This year for profit sharing day I was given a king sized Kit Kat candy bar
-management loves to put out propoganda about how much they appreciate everything employees are doing and then turns around and throws any agreements they have made out the window.
-flight benefits are great if you can find an open seat. Delta is in the business of filling airplanes which isnt helpful when you fly stand by.
-they will try to outsource your job to the lowest bidder. Heavy MX checks....outsourced to Mexico and China. Regional jets.....outsourced. Gate agents, ramp agents, ticket agents and catering all over the world.....outsourced. Delta even owns some of the companies they outsource work to so they can pay employees less

Overall, there is simply a lack of respect for employees. Management lacks the integrity and honesty to uphold their side of agreements. Like I said in the Pros.....the check shows up twice a month"
923,Delta Air Lines,Overall Great Company,2021-01-03,5.0,Revenue Management Specialist,"-the benefits (health, retirement, etc) are above average
-the people love the company and are generally helpful and ambitious
-the executive leadership shows that the care about the employees","-the lack of diversity in the leadership team for senior managers and above
-It's extremely network driven, when an internal job is posted 90%+ of the time they already know who they plan to hire
-for health related claims, Sedgwick is a pain to deal with and the company doesn't help much"

Being a Flight Attendant provided me with the opportunity to see the World and provide great customer service to all levels of people.  I grew as a person and gained professional experience which I took to my next profession.  The only reason I left was because I had children.   I chose my secondary career so I could be home in the evenings with my family.","Flight Attendant Travel did not work well for me as a new mom.  Also, Flight Attendants do not get substantial enough pay while boarding the airplanes and in between flights while required to be on duty.  The entire duty required for a workday cuts down your actual hourly pay rate to a much more minuscule pay rate.  I believe at least a minimum wage rate should be paid for all hours required on duty for Flight Attendants in between flights and while boarding the plane.  Per diem is not substantial enough for this time spent on the ground without flight pay."

1076,Delta Air Lines,"Great career, Great people, great destination",2021-02-18,3.0,Flight Attendant,The pay goes up as a sliding scale per years of service. Everything is based on seniority which dictates the route you work to the days you want off. It has a lot of perks and you will get to work international flights and visit places you always dreamed about. It is a rewarding career until something happens to you and then you are not being taken care of.,Pay per flight hours work in a 2 week period so you have to fly in order to get paid during a pay period. You only get paid per flight hour which means when the plane door closes and open back up. All the other hours on the job are not paid. If you are sitting “on call” it is 4.45 hours air port standby getting paid for 2 hours or sitting home on call standby getting paid 4 hours to sit at home on call at a 24 hour basis from 1-6 days depending on the schedule. Before the system change it was Bi weekly pay so you can get sick or take time off For a week or 2 and still will get a pay check. Now it’s not so much and you will need to fly and work every week in order to get a decent pay check. You basically can’t afford to get sick and they kind of discourage you from calling off from being sick. The sick policy is atrocious so you better hope you don’t get sick or else you will get penalized in your record or have a meeting with supervisor. If you are on a multiple day trip you get paid flight hours and time away from base (on layovers) depending On how many day trips you are working. (1-6). Also insurance plan sucks.

They are constantly screwing employees over and then do not take fault for providing wrong information. Document everything from day 1. There is so much favoritism going on in their Minot, ND location. If you’re not in their “favorite list”, forget a promotion or job change. Management doesn’t stand up for their people but rather claim to “try to fix” issues that are clear as day that need to be stopped. They threaten to fire you if you don’t sign to their agreements, and senior employees always want to look down on newer employees. Overall, avoid this place.

1180,Delta Air Lines,World’s greatest airline,2020-01-19,4.0,,"Very fun company to work for if you are enthusiastic about airlines and aviation. 

While base compensation is not remarkable, Delta is rare in that it actually returns a meaningful portion of its earnings to its employees through profit sharing payments in February each year.  This creates incentive alignment with shareholders, who also are receiving generous dividends, which I think is brilliant.  Managerial employees also receive additional annual bonuses in February, which start at around one month’s base pay, so total bonus comp for a manager can easily exceed 2 months’ base pay in these recent years of profitability.

Other benefits are attractive - Including 9% total 401(k) employer contribution if employee is contributing at least 6%, and employer HSA contribution of $700+ annually if completing health tasks (checkups, screenings, etc.).","With high load factors on Delta flights (great for profit sharing), actually using standby travel benefits can be difficult. 

Significant middle management turnover is disruptive to developing and executing on multi-year plans and projects.

Budget process is dysfunctional and poorly understood, and money is sometimes wasted that could be returned to shareholders and employees.

Office environment has been undergoing remodeling to a high-density open floor plan.  Not sure who this is supposed to appeal to, but it has become much harder to focus on individual work.

Compensation methodology for managerial employees is opaque; management bonuses and raises, while not at all bad in recent years, seem to be drawn from a hat, and it’s hard to know where you stand and what to expect from year to year."

Delta is slowly getting rid of benefited employees, when a benefited employee is fired, or retires, or leaves the company Delta will not hire more benefited employees, they will hire ready reserve employees, for every 4 benefited employees that leaves, Delta will replace them with 4 ready reserve employees, or maybe 3 ready reserve and promote one ready reserve employee from within.  To move up quicker you will probably need to relocate. In 2015 on average it took 4 to 5 years to become benefited. It now might take 7 years. Delta gives the airport managers too much power with very little oversight. They have been incredibly hypocritical when it comes to firing an employee, or promotion. I will say that there were a a number of employees I loved working with."

1769,Delta Air Lines,"Amazing company, but limited remote work flexibility",2020-03-20,4.0,Business Analyst,"The company is very much like a family (for employees, much less so for contractors).  Many employees are happy to work as many hours as are needed to support the operation & their co-workers, but (manager-dependent) this isn't broadly expected of employees.  In most areas (again, manager-dependent), employees are frequently reminded that family & personal life come first.  The politics are sometimes difficult to fully ascertain and navigate (as with any company), but with proper coaching & mentoring it is navigable; coaching and mentoring is relatively easy to come by given how friendly & caring most employees are.

The benefits are overall very good.  Health insurance c. 2020 is relatively affordable and definitely provides comprehensive coverage options (including life, dental, eye, etc.).  Flight benefits are nice to have, but have limitations as the company continues to optimize load factor; however, HR has finally started to realign base salaries higher to reflect the flight benefits' decrease in value over time.  The 401k program includes a 6% match & 2% additional DL contribution (so you contribute 6% from your check and your account receives 14% total), as well as provides financial advising/planning opportunities, and many other benefits focused on the overall wellbeing of employees.","Delta's core operation is very much a 24/7 in-person operation (pilots, FAs, mtc, ops control, etc.).  Therefore, most of the divisions supporting Delta's operation do not look kindly upon remote work.  Most operations divisions only allow remote work when the employee cannot come into the office for a specified reason (illness, snow, etc.), and those days are few and far between, and must be arranged day-by-day with your manager.  IT is by far the most flexible with allowing ongoing work-from-home opportunities, but still only allows employees to work from home 2 days per week (these policies are as of March 2020, and before COVID-19 isolation mandated WFH for all nonessential employees).

Additionally, the bureaucracy surrounding any changes (especially technology-related) is highly burdensome (as with any very large company).  Some technology-related processes which should be smooth, automated, and/or quick (e.g. login requests, new hire laptop requests, etc.) take a very long time (when I first started with Delta as an analyst, i.e. needed a computer to do my job, I didn't have a laptop for the first 2 weeks, this was in 2010).

Again, as with any large company, middle/low management is a big problem in some divisions.  executive expectations are very high (as they should be); in some divisions, directors & managers absorb the stress well and direct their teams in a less stress-inducing way, but this is not the norm by-and-large.  Typically directors & managers directly pass the stress onto individual contributors (who don't have sufficient power or influence to fully solve the problems) without sufficiently helping/coaching them on what they can specifically do to help achieve a broader goal up to executive expectations.  This is compounded when divisional goals are not aligned; this is especially problematic with IT focused on project funding & system uptime whereas the rest of the operation is focused on sustainability, reliability, innovation & customer experience.

While the Delta family is great, the way Delta handles the releasing of contractors is abhorrent (in relation to how much we brag about the greatness of the ""Delta family"").  I have been a full time employee for my entire tenure, but have experienced many contractors who were great but may have needed coaching on one small thing who were unceremoniously fired (some over the phone, some just by notifying the contracting company that the person was no longer welcome at Delta, etc.) and escorted off campus immediately (with no advance warning and no opportunities to work on any performance issues they may have had).  This has also been demonstrated by (unfortunately necessary) the immediate laying off of *all* contractors not essential to the operation (about half of the IT division) in the wake of COVID-19 revenue impact.  Understand the need to cut, but I would think Delta would care a little bit more about the health & wellbeing of these people long-term (given that many of their contracting companies do not), especially given that some of these contractors are highly-productive, highly-contributing, members of our workforce, and many of them are SMEs for the work they do."

1978,Delta Air Lines,Contractors keeping secrets and used as pawns in power struggles...,2019-09-30,2.0,Senior User Experience Designer,Delta Airlines itself is a great company with great top-level leadership.,"The project I was working on:
There were two divisions within the company that wanted to own the project.  Their directors used the contractors as pawns as they tried to wrestle power away from each other.

Down to the Director and slightly below levels of management, there was no direction given.  They basically hired a bunch of different contractors from different contracting companies to work on the project.  They provided ZERO leadership to tie the groups together.  They left it up to the contractors to figure out all problems and resolve everything.  Some of us tried.  However, if other contractors essentially take the ""You're not the boss of me"" approach and won't listen to reason and refuse to implement processes that benefit everyone, it becomes a near impossible task.  UX was creating designs and conducting research, and development implemented their own designs, ignoring UX design and research, and even what some of the key stakeholders and users expressly told them they wanted.

When the project ultimately failed and led to one of the contractors getting scolded, everyone, from every contractor, started to take ""me vs everyone else"" approach to circling the wagons and cya, all while looking for scape goats.  And this was just between contractors.  It happened within contracting companies where they ate their own in attempts to point finger and say it was him, not me.

""Leadership"" was nowhere to be found.  

The entire environment was incredibly dysfunctional, to the extent that I have never seen before in decades of working in similarly sized companies."

I quit because I had a newborn at the time and was based in New York which was a doubletter commute. It was tough so I resigned and have regretted it since then. I loved my job! It was my dream job and I was lucky enough to get to do it. I had a little bit of seniority so I was able to make my work schedule a little more flexible. I met some wonderful people and saw some amazing places and learned a lot about other cultures. My benefits were great! I felt like management always had my back and although you rarely flew with the people you still felt like a big family.

1983,Delta Air Lines,"Despite the myriad of world turbulence, Delta leads through with employees first.",2009-01-03,5.0,Flight Attendant,"Delta has seen us through the revolutionary change in the airline industry with top of the line communication and leadership to make tough changes with compassion.  In the end we come out the largest airline poised for success and strong enough to endure fuel prices, finance crisis, and passenger demand.  Our flexible work rules, schedules and pay options keep me on the ground or up in the air on rather nicely negotiated terms and management continues to provide the things I need to get my job done, admits their mistakes and genuinely attempts to do their best, as long as I do my best.","The flexibility I spoke of before also leads to schedules, work rules and job security that tends to flex as well.  I have to keep in motion as much as the airline must keep in motion and sometimes that leads to levels of insecurity not many choose to deal with.  I have to trust in my leadership they see a bigger picture than what I can.  If you travel 3000 miles by car, you'll run into traffic, weather and road issues.  The same goes for flying but at a much faster pace.  I have to keep that in mind that detours on many factors are necessary, just as they are in many businesses."

1988,Delta Air Lines,Consider another company for part time.,2019-07-25,2.0,CSA Above Wing,"There aren't many pros for part time Ready Reserve employees.  It is sold as flexible hours, great flight benefits, ability to have another job (for insurance & living wage).  It is none of these now, though it used to be.  If you are aiming for a full time Delta career, then working as a ready reserve will start you down the path to full time.  But be aware- it could take YEARS (10 plus, at my station).  If you are willing to relocate, it might take less time.  Delta is good to their full time employees.  They get decent benefits, pay and vacations - time off to enjoy their flight benefits.  Unfortunately, much of the full time benefits are paid for by denying a huge part of the workforce any benefits at all.","Ready reserves, Delta's part time un-benefited workers, are the Cinderella's of Delta.  They work more days a year than the full time employees who have all the benefits.  They get 1 week of unpaid vacation a year, while full time employees get paid vacations starting at 2 weeks, after 1 year of employment, 3 weeks after 5 years, etc,....  A ready reserve with 15 years of service still only gets 1 week of un- paid vacation.  It is almost impossible to use the benefits.  Trading shifts is allowed, but it's difficult to cobble enough time to travel very far and stand-by flights are risky.  You have to be able to get back in time for work.  Planning a family vacation is impossible, because trading is only approved 30 days in advance at most, so you can't pay for a cruise, co-ordinate family members vacations, get a deal on a resort, because you won't know if you will get the time off until 30, or usually less days, before.  Full time employees don't have this problem.  Their generous paid vacation weeks allow them to plan up to a year in advance.  Ready reserves work the same schedule as full time 40 hours a week employees.  Their shifts are shorter.  But they work 5 days a week, with no flexibility.  Ready reserves used work 3 or 4 days a week and have some flexibility, which is why workers stayed with the job.  The flexibility made up for the lack of benefits and allowed people to have a second job or time for school or family.  Now that is impossible and most quit within the first year.  Delta has a very low retention rate for ready reserves, which is a disservice to the customers, because there are constantly high numbers of inexperienced employees training.  If you want a part time job and plan to use the flight benefits, go to Southwest or American.  You will get some benefits and be be treated more fairly.   For those wondering why I am still currently employed at Delta;  all airlines are seniority based, for scheduling shift times, etc...   I kept hoping things would get better, but the opposite has happened, except for a  pay scale change.   I have 8 years with Delta and don't want to start all over at the bottom again.  Hindsight is always better than foresight."
