0,Five9,The best place I have ever worked,2022-03-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great Leadership
A lot of growth opportunities",I miss seeing my team member but that will return again
1,Five9,Project Manager Five9,2022-01-30,5.0,Program Manager,"Overall a strategically, well Managed company with fair compensation and one of the best companies in my career. Very good culture with a desire to help each other and clients. Senior management, (CEO/CFO), is very good. Until recently the rapitly rising stock price equated to a very nice bonus over the years.","Some limits exist on advancement, but there is an effort to promote from within. 401 matching is low, although other benefits for healthcare are good. Many if not most employees are remote and can work from home, especially, during COVID.. Some work/life balance issues, but that is department-based and has been better in recent years. All in all, I considered myself lucky to have worked here"
2,Five9,Best Place I Have Worked,2022-01-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been with Five9 for almost 4 years and I absolutely love it here. I feel supported in my role by my coworkers and my boss, and feel like I have an opportunity to grow my career within the organization. I can honestly say I am very proud to work for Five9 and hope to work here for many more years.","The growth can feel like a con at times, because small close teams turn into much bigger teams. But overall the growth has been very positive, and I feel like Five9 does a good job of pursuing a good company culture regardless of how fast we are growing."
3,Five9,Five9 takes care of its employees,2022-03-10,5.0,Account Management,"- Support from management 
- Product functionality 
- Pay 
- Mobility within the organization","- Not always a con, but this is a very busy job"
4,Five9,Special Culture and Exciting Growth At Five9,2021-09-30,5.0,"Director, Customer Success","From the top down, culture is sacred and carefully preserved.
Five9 leadership makes decisions founded in integrity and doing the right thing. CEO Rowan is extremely in-tune with how employees are feeling as a whole and responds to that very directly and effectively.
The CSM team is a group of top tier professionals with a spirit of service, helping one another and focusing on the customer.
The growth since going public in 2014 has been staggering, with every quarter being a record over the year prior. The trajectory continues along this path with a huge available market and a continuing shift to cloud with a focus on the contact center.
Five9 is very understanding and fosters work life balance, encouraging time off to really disconnect by having an ""out of office buddy"" to care for your accounts while you are away.
Pre-Pandemic, events like Sales Kick-off and President's Club at the beach were an all-out blast. Hoping to return to these in-person gatherings very soon.
Sales onboarding and Boot Camps are the best in the industry.","There are no unique cons at Five9 that one wouldn't find at any contact center / CCaaS provider anywhere else around the globe. Growing pains, emerging markets with challenging regulatory landscapes, and the occasional tech hiccups can feel like major setbacks when they are occurring. However Five9 takes all of these situations as lessons, truly internalizes them, and uses them to drive continuous improvement."
5,Five9,ehhh,2022-03-16,3.0,Enterprise Sales Director,"great product, c level executives were great, customer success & implementation teams were outstanding","terrible sales culture and poor inexperienced sales leaders. HR is also non-existent and there to only help management, not employees."

7,Five9,This company is amazing!!!,2022-01-29,5.0,Engineer,"I love this place! My team is small but the work life balance is incredible, the people are great, and the leadership is amazing. Rowan really listens to the employees within this organization.",None that I can think of.
8,Five9,A breath of fresh air,2021-09-30,5.0,Enterprise Sales Director,"I have worked for a number of companies within the contact center and CX space and Five9 is a head above the rest, in my opinion.

-FANTASTIC culture
-Great product
-Reputable and recognizable brand
-Amazing people
-Thorough and digestible onboarding
-Fair territories

Leadership treats you as a seasoned professional, trusting you to take care of your business, and is more than willing to jump in and help, regardless of their seniority. You're provided with all the tools (lots of them) and resources in order to maximize your sales efforts. And the team resources provided to support you are extensive.","My biggest con thus far is the amount of internal processes needed in order to complete a sale. Seemingly small tasks oftentimes need to go through an approval process in order to get done. However, I've come to learn that these processes are in place in order to ensure that we're confident and able to deliver for our customers."
9,Five9,Incredible company!,2021-11-28,5.0,Enterprise Sales Director,Five9 is an incredible company and the leadership team (from the CEO down) truly puts employees first and understand that happy employees mean happy customers. Five9 invests in resources to help ensure you can successfully do your job. And Five9 truly cares about our customers and goes above and beyond to ensure customer success and happiness. The leadership team is 100% invested in employee success and work with you to succeed. The company offers great benefits as well.,I truly have seen no cons. I've worked for several companies in my 20+ yrs and I have never felt so included and supported and have never had so many tools to help me be successful.
10,Five9,All about customer success & doing the right thing,2021-12-15,5.0,"Director, Enterprise Sales","Great company and culture that is focused on helping customers be successful. Very smart, professional and respectful co-workers. I feel supported and always asked what leadership can do to help me be successful. Best company I have ever worked for! Fun, energetic and innovative co-workers that make it a blast to work with each day!","Honestly, I love it here and Five9 does a ton to grow, mature and become a global, thriving, successful company."
11,Five9,Best place to work for,2022-02-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great place to work, friendly team, good benefits too",lots of off hour works and new management trying out too many new things
12,Five9,You will NEVER be bored.,2021-09-24,5.0,Enterprise Solution Consultant,"Let's be concise to not have the whole TLDR...
- Great Culture! What the heck does that mean anyway? Well, a leadership driven culture where LEADERS lead properly to have a positive working environment and open door policy.
- Fantastic CEO - People oriented, honest sometimes brutally honest which is needed in this day and age and has an appropriate level of transparency.
- Great working teams (Professional Services, CSM's, TAM's, Sales, Training, Management)
- Shared goals!","Of course this is subjective...
- Benefits could be a little better with specialized health, 
- Stock purchase limits could be a little higher
- Some managers need to come out of the ""That is how we always did it"" mentality and think more critically into ""We should find a better way to do it""."
13,Five9,Thirteenth Facade,2022-01-31,3.0,Engineer,"A good company, no doubt. Generous compensation, flexible hours, remote work, challenging products. Easy going overall, and people are generally happy.","Five9 received Glassdoor's Employees' Choice Award for 13th best place to work. Happy employees and ballot box stuffing are not mutually exclusive.

Change-averse, risk-averse culture
Siloed teams
Poor inter-team transparency 
Performance bonuses perversely disincentivize change and progress
Some company mottos antithetical to reality"
14,Five9,Growing and fast paced,2021-12-29,5.0,Systems Engineer,Company is growing fast and there are good things to come. Have to be ready to jump in and hit the ground running. Think BIG. Great people to work with. Great benefits,Growing pains like in any other company but if you are focused you will do just fine.
15,Five9,"Awesome company, culture, product and leadership!",2021-09-27,5.0,Director,"- High growth means there is a great work environment
- Leadership is more transparent than I've seen in many other companies
- Very supportive culture where everyone tries to go above and beyond, anticipate your ask and go a great job. High levels of employee engagement!
- You are encouraged to bring ideas and make improvements","- Still can feel a bit like a start-up sometimes - in the sense that the company is run as one business unit with a core product, and everyone is figuring out the way to do things on the fly
- Related to the above, company infrastructure is less mature than at some established companies - in terms of team structure, support services, staffing.
- PTO is much smaller than competitors"
16,Five9,Great place to be!,2022-01-19,5.0,Senior Strategy Manager,"Leadership, Colleagues, Work-Life Balance and Compensation",I haven't found any cons so far
17,Five9,"Customer, Partner and Employee-Centric Company",2021-09-24,5.0,Vice President Sales Operations,"Company culture from top down and bottoms up encourages everyone to do the right thing for Customers, Partners and teammates.

Employees are encouraged end empowered to improve processes and approach to deliver the best experiences. C-level leadership is very transparent, sharing their perspective and strategy and very accessible (you can ask estaff questions at any time and they will get right back to you).","May not be for you if you don't like a high growth, fast-paced environment and autonomy/accountability."
18,Five9,Absolutely the best corporate culture,2021-09-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's so rare for a company to grow for years and keep a strong, positive corporate culture. The management team at Five9 has done an exceptional job of doing just that. Every employee is valued, everyone helps each other and we are all focused on doing what's right for our customers. Truly an exceptional place to work.","No company is perfect. No matter where you work there will always be issues to work through and Five9 is no different. What makes the challenges easier and address and keeps things moving forward is a culture of inclusion, engagement and doing the right thing. Hard to call this a ""con"" at all."
19,Five9,Grateful to be acquired by Five9,2021-09-24,5.0,Partner Marketing Director,Five9 has an exceptional culture. The people are great to work with and supportive. I am impressed with leadership especially during this pandemic. They ensure that we are taking care of ourselves and also provide extra care with the occasional surprise mental health days off or just to recognize all the hard work everyone is doing. There are great programs for us all to get involved in that supports diversity and inclusion as well as fitness and well-being.,"My previous company was acquired during the pandemic so I haven't been able to meet a lot of coworkers in person yet so that is a con that is out of everyone's control but, thus far, I'm not finding any cons to working at Five9."

I've been impressed by the smart and seasoned professionals at all levels.
There are many opportunities to get involved and meet others, based on personal and professional interests. 
Everyone I have met has been willing to help, upbeat and positive.",Joined during pandemic and haven't had much opportunity to meet people in person...but that's about it
22,Five9,Always looking out for employees,2021-10-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,They are always looking for ways to make their employees happy. This is not limited to compensation only. They take strides to make sure extraordinary personal goals and work life balance can be achieved. Of course they cannot say 'yes' to everything but the balance they achieve is commendable.,The opposite of the Pros. Trying to make everyone happy can create its own issues. This is not bad in and of itself but can seem distracting at times. But nothing to stop anyone from enjoying the great environment.

25,Five9,Still Amazing After 1 Year,2021-11-02,5.0,Sales Director,The people and the culture are unmatched. I haven't met a single a-hole in my first year which is impressive in a company of our size. Everything is about TEAM and shared success. The e-staff is incredibly thoughtful and proactive to constantly nurture the culture.,"There are no cons to working at Five9, period!"
26,Five9,One of the best places I have worked for,2021-09-24,5.0,Enterprise Solutions Consultant,The culture and learning and opportunities for growth at the Company are better that any I have had.

Even with everyone being remote, Five9 has found ways to keep the teams connected and possibly more productive than ever before. I couldn't think of a better place to work!","While a very short term issue, the possible Zoom acquisition has provided a distraction to employees. Communication from the CEO down has been frequent but team members are feeling the uncertainty of what the future of the organization will look like."

197,Five9,It's like an extended family,2015-01-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been at Five9 going on five years.  I have never been so  happy.  I feel extremely comfortable with everyone on my team.  We all seem to pull together to make it happen and help each other succeed. VP of SMB is awesome.  He will push you if he think your slipping, but you know he wants you to succeed.  My director is great,  always ready to help me close a deal and take care of the fires when needed.  I come from the dotcom era where it was not uncommon to change jobs every couple of years.  I do not plan on leaving Five9 anytime soon.",It is far from my home.  I travel almost 100 miles a day just to get back and forth to work.  It would be great if they had better work from home options.
198,Five9,Compared to the competitors I've worked for in the Contact Center Industry....Five9 ROCKS!,2015-01-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Five9 is Agile, Nimble, Quick, Forward-Thinking, and Fast-Paced.  The general atmosphere is very comfortable and supportive.  Because Five9 is smaller and on the growth up-swing, there is a lot of flexibility to influence changes and make a difference, whereas with larger companies, that's not possible.  The Executive Management Team is very focused and engaged. When they say they are going to do something....it happens. They are also VERY forthcoming with the entire organization as to challenges, goals, plans ,etc. WAY more-so than any other company I've worked for. It's refreshing because you feel as though you are part of the Vision and the Operational Agenda.","The biggest challenges are the usual challenges any company who is growing faces. As we bring on a ton of new customers, we need to scale."
199,Five9,I like my job for the first time in years!,2016-02-25,5.0,Operations,"- Senior Management cares about its employees and their customers
- Even though it can be a high stress environment their is not much infighting or back room deal making between the departments and teams.
- Good benefits, great employee perks
- Leveraging new technology to improve the product and the customer experience","- Not always waiting until a product is ready before its released
- Internal communications need to be more open too many silos between different teams leads to poor messaging to the customer"
200,Five9,Hit or miss,2015-02-23,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"With Five9, it's a hit-or-miss situation. Depending on the team you join and your professional goals, you may love or hate it. If you are not extremely ambitious and just want an okay place that earns you some cash, Five9 is a decent option. Bishop Ranch location is awesome, nice environment, whole foods nearby, food trucks a few times a week. Also, company has some nice events, like the annual ski day held at Kirkwood.","The company doesn't seem to do all that well on the market, that's a concern for the future and it also reflects potential internal issues that are not being resolved. Lack of competence and proper leadership in some teams and areas is a source of frustration. Also, the company is not very generous when it comes to promotions and yearly salary adjustments. The overall attitude towards employees sometimes falls short, especially in tough situations when someone has to leave the company."
201,Five9,Five9 is Family!,2019-05-28,5.0,Program Manager,"This is only my 4th full-time job out of college but by FAR the best workplace environment I have ever been apart of. The moment I started at Five9, I just felt like this place is one big family.

Sure, things are busy, but that is a good problem to have. I have never had a colleague tell me that they couldn't help me when I had a question or tell me ""that's not my problem"".

Everyone is willing to step in and help out and that makes the work environment top notch.

This is also a great place where I feel like PS and Sales get along with each other, unlike previous companies where it was always a battle between the two.","No 401k match

Lots of moving parts, don't forget about the core product and keeping it as stable as possible."
202,Five9,Happily Employed,2017-06-07,5.0,Manager,"Management is open to questions and feedback
People are Flexible, help each other and work as a team
Many individuals can work remotely
Salaries are quite reasonable (Average+), and the stock and our grants  are moving skyward
Depending upon your responsibilities, you may have some flexibility in terms of your schedule
It is nice to work for a company, in the Valley, that is growing, stable, and that has revenue and profits","Management is considering 401k match, but does not exist today (Stock grants and the ESPP help ameliorate the deficiency)
The company is growing clients and certain departments can use more staff.  Good and bad...the company is focused on hiring based upon need, but they are conservative and do not want to hire too many during a boom cycle.
There is plenty of work to keep one busy - But, management is good with time off and work / life balance"
203,Five9,If only they followed through on what they say,2017-09-18,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Ability to interact with customers on a daily basis, whether it's to solve, resolve, and/or collaborate on questions, comments, and/or concerns.","Many leaders that were less than stellar.  Leaders that didn't take time to teach, train, give constructive criticism, nor work together to find a way to resolve an issue.  There were no processes put in place.  Each time an issue arose it was like starting all over again.  Outcomes were never repeatable so it was as though you were re-inventing the wheel over and over and over again.  Onboarding/training a new employee was atrocious.  There was never a defined process written up for this very important step.  New employees constantly felt inferior vs. confident and always worried when ""they were going to lose their job""."
204,Five9,"Five9 - Great culture, solid trajectory and significant upside",2016-05-12,5.0,Finance Team Member,"Five9 has a great culture that trickles down from the very top. Everyone works extremely hard but equally appreciates the importance of maintaining a good work / life balance and having fun along the way. 

Additionally, the company still has a start-up feel to it with people at all levels rolling up their sleeves to get things done effectively and efficiently, and senior management truly recognizes and rewards talent based on meritocracy.

Leadership quality and business execution capabilities are top notch in the industry. Overall, I believe Five9 is on a very solid trajectory with significant upside potential.","Five9 is expanding rapidly, so, naturally, there are growing pains (e.g., using systems that are more appropriate for smaller sized organizations, ongoing refinement of processes, etc.). However, these are common issues that all fast-growing tech companies struggle with temporarily, so I'm confident that these will be resolved in the not-too-distant future."
205,Five9,Enterprise Sales Director,2016-12-19,5.0,Enterprise Sales Director,"Lots of companies talk culture, but what does that really mean?  To me it means you respect the people you work with, and they respect you.  It means you're given the resources to be successful and trusted to do so.  Five9 does more than just talk about having a strong culture.  They deliver it.

This is a company that is well positioned to succeed as more and more companies move towards the cloud.  The product is solid and the execution even more so.  

Lots of career growth opportunity.

Very strong leadership, deep experience and continuing to hire top talent.","Compensation and benefits are average compared to industry peers.

This is a very fast paced environment, which isn't for everyone, but the upside is there is lots of opportunity.

Office space is ok, but the investments are being made towards customers, products and growth, rather than having the prettiest building."
206,Five9,"Great Start, Promising Future",2017-05-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have the privilege of working with quality professionals and people. The company is at a stage where it's growing, but flexible enough to implement change in process when needed. I look forward to coming to the office, sharing ideas, and feeling rewarded for the efforts in helping the team and Five9.","The company is lacking process, and change does not happen overnight. Most people are open to change, but others need more convincing. There is currently no 401K match, but outside of that the benefits package is great!"
207,Five9,"Great Executive Staff, Company, Culture, and People!",2014-11-18,5.0,Senior Product Manager,"A great company starts with great leadership and Mike is an amazing CEO that cares about his people and ensuring we have a great culture and all else follows when this foundation is set for people to do amazing things. I am a product manager and work with every group and team throughout the company. The one common trait I have discovered is that everybody cares and wants Five9 to succeed because they believe in the leadership and the people in the company.
Company events are amazing and fun. The catered lunches are always fantastic!","Just wish they would bring the catered lunch to the 5th floor since the lines get long on the 4th floor for Friday catered lunches. Other than that, I love it here!"
208,Five9,"Five9 has the energy of a start-up, the expertise of a legacy, and the growth potential of Starbucks circa 1990.",2013-12-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Five9 is growing at an extremely quick pace, and employment is growing with it to a very corollary degree. Everyone here is attempting to increase productivity and improve the product and company. Management recognizes that sheer manpower is necessary to do so. Upper management is also extremely involved and concerned with lower level work capabilities and strives to create a seamless environment (ie ensuring projects do not bottleneck at the top).","There are some standard growing pains with Five9. As a rapidly growing company, it is difficult to ensure that every voice is heard, and that the total company culture truly exemplifies what individual departments are putting forward."
209,Five9,"Good company, normal growing pains",2014-12-08,5.0,Sales,"The company has a great product and roadmap, and is poised to be a serious competitor. IMO, we are an underdog that is still climbing our way up, based on our strong market potential. To me, this is a great time to be here and watch the success unfold. The company and management team values work-life balance, and does a lot to foster that culture through activities, free friday lunches, etc.","As with any fast growing company, we do have growing pains. Processes need optimizing, and we could use some training and development plans for the existing teams."
