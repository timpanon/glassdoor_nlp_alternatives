After I learned my role, my managers do not hover and let me do what I do best. I've accrued more time off than I know what to do with every year and I'm attempting to take more ""health & wellness"" days to rest in the future since these reset every calendar year. From my experience, Hilti management does care a ton about employees and hearing our feedback. I get to take part in many peer council teams with our management to express concerns and vocalize the feelings from my immediate coworkers. While not every headache is solved, many of the biggest issues are heard, researched, and move towards resolution.","Sometimes, it does not feel like I have direct control of my bonus since it relies heavily on the actual account managers to sell for me to hit my target.

“Possibility” of promotion and/or international experiences","I have been at Hilti for over 5 years. To sum it up: This organization hardly resembles what it used to be, and it’s truly sad. I had the intention of staying for life, but it feels that the current environment is just like every other corporate culture, if not worse. 

I’ve made repeated attempts at promotion, but lost to an external candidate or because I wasn’t good enough, even though I met and exceeded the criteria. Folks have been blocked by managers who are bad apples and have been lied to about promotions.

Compensation has gotten lower over time, and it’s not competitive to the market. They seem to disregard their seasoned employees, and instead have a focus on bringing in new talent who they can pay less.

Ideas will sometimes be accepted, but often times brushed off. Too many meetings that are causing paralysis, instead of streamlined decision making in order to define processes.

Their software investments are not going well, and our Global counterparts are difficult to work with, and the customer is the one bearing the weight. They’re essentially paying for beta software.

Hilti has grown out of touch with its own people, and customers.

Favoritism is real here. Promotion by merit sometimes happens, but it’s not the rule."

Layoffs are seen as a last resort and the company is very stable financially. Great culture from top down. Fully transparent in their strategy and leading brand in construction. Excellent products.,Base pay could be better but the total benefits package offsets this somewhat. High volume and fast paced environment can be hard if you’re not used to it. Promotion is extremely difficult if you don’t agree to become a field sales rep for minimum two years in a major city. Mobility is critical if you want to promote fast.

The team makes an effort to cross train all team members so all team members can fill as back-up in case of vacations/sick days.
The PTO and benefits are great at Hilti! 
I never feel I am drowning in work and work 40-45 hours a week, out of choice to work extra because I love my job!","Advancement can be difficult if you can’t relocate because of the global attitude of the company. In hand with that, favor is definitely given to those from European countries for advancement before anyone else. 
Many people sit in their positions for 5+ YEARS with their outdated processes. It hinders the advancement of technology and efficiency at Hilti and many large processes are still handled with excel which is a major disappointment.
Opportunity in Finance is very limited by what finance team you are on (given to feeder positions) and if you are lucky enough to have visibility with the leaders. Many people are looked over for projects and find It hard to get development opportunities in areas they want to learn."

There is a negative effect of a hiring surge going on where so many lower level people are pursuing promotions that are very limited in numbers, so advancement opportunities lie on whether or not customers in area can afford Hilti or if they buy from someone cheaper.

The tuition reimbursement was also good.,"The company culture is absolutely horrendous. The management being the worst! They operate based on clicks and who they like the most, not based on who is doing their job and doing it well. Management has favorites, so if you're not one of those favorites too bad for you. You will usually end up with the short end of the stick every time,  you'll get no promotional opportunities or no additional benefits, and they might try to ice you out of your role. My manager in particular was absolutely awful! She had no idea what she was doing, the only way to get around her behavioral narcissistic disorder it's the kiss her butt on a daily basis, none stop, which I was unwilling to do! Keep in mind that most of them are old as well, including my manager, so they have a really hard time knowing how to get along with and manage the younger generation. They're borderline discriminatory based on age and gender.

They are extremely old school in their mentality, and very inflexible. Hence, they set out the path that you will go, as opposed to you as the employee setting out your own path as to where you would like to grow into. If you try to set up your own path and it does not align with what they have set up for you, they will block you and stop you at every step of the way and might even try to get you fired. You also can't even THINK of exploring  other opportunities internally without your current managers consent, otherwise they will blacklist you and you will never be able to advance and no one will ever be honest to you about why that is.

The politics is horrible! And the HR department is a hot mess! They don't have anything that is set, so the gray area is a lot wider than it should be. Hence, they can make the rules whatever they want it to be depending on how they feel on any given day and who the manager is. This makes it so difficult and almost impossible to get anything done, because there's no clear path and everyone in management (including thier parents) wants to be unnecessarily included in the approval process to every little thing.

They also don't pay! They are so stingy, and do not and will not pay you for your experience. they will not give you the title that you might deserve if you didn't grow to that title from within the company. It's truly is exactly like a cult in there, absolutely horrible.

I've literally did my time, graduated with my graduate degree, and then ran away from there as quickly and efficiently as I could!"

- Fantastic for professionals to start their career, if interested in sales or marketing
- Internal promotions are very high; Field leadership roles are good development grounds
- Global / Headquarters team is strategic and long-term oriented
- Good benefits, especially for early career professionals","- Culture is accepting if you start in the field; the company is terrible at integrating management and senior management candidates who were brought in for fresh ideas
- Career advancement opportunities are very limited if you join externally; the same rules used to promote someone who started with the company as an Account Manager or Engineer don't apply if you started at a senior management level; the skills and work experience from your previous employer don't count
- It's a matrix organization which equates to directors and managers being held accountable for results while they don't have the authority to take the right actions
- The time tested leadership rule of 'praise in public, criticize in private' doesn't apply; it feels like the executive team relishes shaming people publicly"

325,Hilti North America,Good company but still needs to improve culture. It’s not the same company it used to be,2019-11-04,3.0,,The people are very helpful and want to be the best. The company makes great products and top notch quality.,The culture is still very political and the top leadership do not really understand the people and what really needs to get done in order to be a happy environment. They put pressure on regional managers and account managers.
326,Hilti North America,When living core values is important to you.,2019-10-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Visible leadership, competitive benefits, work-life balance, education/career development support, diverse team members from around the world, strong core values, great community partner",A bit too conservative in some aspects of how we do business. Could be more agile.
327,Hilti North America,Great Benefits and Opportunities,2019-10-11,4.0,Account Manager,"Overall, working for Hilti has been great. The PTO and benefits are awesome, and that’s a priority for me. Hilti is all over the country and the world, so they will do what they can do get you where you want to be geographically. However, if you don’t want to be in sales, your options are pretty much limited to Tulsa or Plano, so keep that in mind.

It’s truly great selling a product that is exceptional. Nothing is worse than trying to get people to buy something that doesn’t perform! I’m thankful to be confident in the Hilti product. It isn’t necessarily easy to sell, but they give you many tools to be an effective salesperson. Training is very intensive (4 weeks in Tulsa, home for the weekend halfway through), and while some of it goes in one ear and out the other when you’re brand new to the industry, if you’re a quick learner, you’ll catch on. 

Hilti also promotes gender and racial equality. Even though we work in a predominantly male industry, my team of nine people is comprised of six women and a female regional manager, as well as some women of color. Many women also hold upper management positions. At the level of GM and global executives, however, it is still mostly dominated by men. 

I find it is hard to leave Hilti primarily due to the benefits as so few companies offer more than 2 weeks vacation and one week sick leave. But take Hilti’s amazing PTO of 3 weeks vacation, 2 weeks health and wellness, 4 personal days, and two community service days, and add to that family leave, student loan compensation, educational assistance, medical and financial advice services, coverage for infertility treatments and acupuncture (new in 2020), dependent daycare FSA, $5000 for adoption assistance, and on top of that, we get discounts to concert tickets, hotels, theme parks, even movie tickets! The list goes on and on.","One of my major issues with the company is their unwillingness to NOT go by the book. They like to stick to their hard and fast rules without looking at the entire situation sometimes. While Hilti really does value promotion from within, they often do not show that they value those promoting from inside to outside sales. If you start as a Level One employee, for example, they are adamant that you can only advance one level, even though you are transferring to a far more expensive region of the country, AND, outside hires automatically get hired at a Level Three. It is extremely unfair to those that have a commitment to the company and who cost the company very little to promote. As they say, it costs much less to retain an employee than to hire a new one. Hilti REALLY needs to work on valuing their internal transfers and promotions. I will always have a problem with the way this is handled.

Additionally, and perhaps this is limited to certain situations and not a Hilti exclusive problem, their is a certain level of buddy-buddiness when it comes to management that makes it difficult to solve conflicts and problems when you feel there is no one above who truly has your back in a situation. If the people causing the problem are friends with the higher ups, why would they? At least this has sometimes been my experience. I hope it is simply limited to my situation and not a cultural problem. 

Lastly, Hilti isn’t particularly comfortable when you want to change your path for growth outside of what is typically laid out for you. If you want to completely change departments, they often are confused and thrown off by such a “dramatic” change. They literally document the typical path options for growth depending on where you start, and they get thrown if you don’t want to go that direction. Not to say it can’t be done, I’ve done it, but there should be no reason the company shouldn’t be open minded to something that to them seems out of the ordinary or off their path."

334,Hilti North America,Plano Software Team (Global Application Software),2019-10-11,1.0,Software,"Hilti is the best company to work for. amazing culture and values, stable no matter what is the market status, respected brand all across the world and they strive to take care of their employees.

With that being said, I have to say that none of this applies to the software team, if you are considering any opportunity with the software team in PLANO then continue reading this review.","Please note that this is my opinion in the Global Application Software team only  after working more than 5 years with different teams in Hilti:

1-Stabiltiy: it is rare to see someone who survived in Plano for more than 2 years.
2-The blame game: for me, some of the managers tend to throw their employees under the bus and blame them for everything wrong in the team.
3-Public shaming:  Some of the PSM meetings turned into an ugly arena of managers throwing their employees under the bus to save themselves.
4-Politics:basically there is a group of old Hilti Veterans in Schaan that even the head of Global Application Software can't touch them, it is their way or the highway.
5-Bullying: in 2016 or 2017 the management decided to fire the entire team of one project and announced that in a vicious way in an all hands meeting. Some managers use this incident to threaten employees of the same fate, I started to look for a new job right after I witnessed one case by myself.
6-HR: it is appalling that HR doesn't investigate why almost 90% of employees whom where hired in the last 4 years in Plano have left Hilti while the group ""of the same team""  in Schaan is almost intact.
7-Nepotism: if the old German veterans in Schann like you then you are safe no matter what you do, otherwise, your chances of staying more than two years are little to none.
8-Work load: I believe some employees has 3-4 projects while others are just sitting there. it is funny that one SME said to everyone days before retiring that no one knew what he is doing in Hilti.
9-Budget: it seemed to me that the last all hands meeting of the yearused to be  centered about budget concerns and the need to defer some projects while excessive travelling and lavish events continued to happen.
10-Bad reputation: Hilti's Global Application Software failed to deliver in several occasions and dragged Hilti into various problems with some customers, the confidence in this team is decreasing which puts its existence in jeopardy if you ask me."
335,Hilti North America,Talks the talk but doesn’t walk the walk,2019-10-10,1.0,Warehouse Worker III,They have decent pay and benefits.,"Hours, micromanaging, you’re just a nobody. They have all these great buzzwords they use like integrity, teamwork, courage, and commitment and it sounds really good. Until you find out that all they are are just words. Their is no teamwork if you’re not a management favorite or you fall out of favor with them. Your ideas are never good enough to be used or if they are they are stolen and brought back later by management as if they were their own. A lot of disrespectful talk to and about employees. There is no set schedule. You basically start your shift and you’re there until whenever, usually about 12-13 hours. There is no work life balance. If your not all company all the time you’re look at as if you don’t care. In the beginning everything was great and then the cracks in their shiny veneer started to show. You are micromanaged to death by an inconsiderate and abusive manager. And god forbid you can’t stay for 13 hours and have a family problem or commitments outside of work you’d think the world was going to end. I’ve heard people referred to as stupid, useless, worthless by management on quite a few occasions in front of other employees. I’ve seen people cry because of the way they were talked to or flat out ignored when they were trying to discuss an issue or present an idea that was immediately deemed not worthy within 5 seconds of hearing it. If you’re not in the inner circle forget about trying to advance. No training programs in place to help people advance. You are expected to know your job perfectly without training or coaching if you make a mistake. You’ll be promised all the help and training in the world but don’t expect it to happen even when you ask for it repeatedly. I saw a lot of good people forced out or leave because of management destroying their spirit. If you can handle being treated like a second class citizen then by all means apply. I would stay far away."

347,Hilti North America,Good Place to start,2019-08-01,2.0,Account Manager III,Good Benefits- health and 401K. The maternity leave is great if you are in corporate or in management though very hard if you are in sales. If you are young 22-28 the money is not bad but you need to be in a good territory to take advantage.  If you are senior or have a family you will not make the money for the hours you work.,"There is a very Corporate vs Sales Staff mentality. If you are in corporate you can take advantage of the great benefits but out in the field you are punished to take time off. You take a week off for vacation the next week they want you to see twice as many customers. Hilti is also losing a lot of great upper management and experience sales personnel, hence why I said it was great for a person who is young. The constantly rising quotas and the objective promotion criteria is crippling. You can hit your sale goal by 200%.(don’t because they cap your bonus) but if you don’t sell one product that a marketing manager think is important you get a below expectation rating. You have to sell what your customer want, not what Hilti thinks they should use."

There seems to be privileged classes of employees at the company. If they identify someone as a potential leader, that person gets preferential treatment, therefore, if you're not identified as such, you are left feeling like a second class citizen. 

When I started with the company several years ago, I felt appreciated and enjoyed working here. In the past year, however, I have had a continually heavier work load placed upon me and I have been passed up for promotions I deserved. I'm not feeling the love so much anymore."

I was pretty much forced to learn everything on my own, then once my manger was hired, they assumed that I was fully trained and set up in my territory (which I wasn't because nobody took the time to help me get started).

The amount of development they tell you about only exists for the certain few.  You never know what upper management is thinking because as an AM you are not in the know, yet you make the company a lot of money and should be in the know.  Performance is based on spreadsheets — and large opportunity territories will do well irregardless of the person in the territory which results in promotions of people who are fortunate enough to hold down those territories.  Construction performance is largely based on the market which does not exist year after year typically ( considering the forecast ). The company began taking a turn downward and competitors started to and continued to take back market share with no ability to compete on price."
372,Hilti North America,Yikes,2019-04-10,2.0,Account Manager,Bonus is great when you make it.,"Your experience as an account manage will mostly be related to the territory that you inherit as well as the skill of your boss. Hilti is a great company but you should ask what the outlook of your territory is and if your coming from outside the industry find out how your manager trains his team. You will go through a month of training in Tulsa OK with a group of people whom you will find out either walked into territories with a lot of projects and do amazing or people who have to work incredibly hard to just barely hit their number. The salary is very low so if you don’t hit your number whether you are awful at your job or if you just get a territory where there are no jobs happening you will feel it quickly. Every year they as 15% to your yearly goal if you hit your number.

My manager was a joke of a boss and as a human being, he complained constantly and would rather be on the golf course collecting a pay check than doing anything that resembled leadership or even resembled being employed. He would not be able to get a job anywhere else and luckily for him he probably will never have to. Glaring incompetence and lack of intelligence as well as any skills seems to go unnoticed as long as you have been with the company long enough.

Question what your territory looks like and how your manager will support you. Hilti is not an industry leader in any category so you’ll have your work cut out for you."

399,Hilti North America,Follow up Review,2018-12-29,4.0,Senior Account Manager,The work life balance was the best after you learned the processes. Great relationships with a number of other account managers developed over a lengthy tenure. The products are great and fun to demonstrate.,Integrity is absent. Three core values remain. I read the responses about the tenured employment and the lack of turnover.  The last team that I was part of lost 4 members out of 8 within a year's time. Only 1 of the 4 left to follow his spouse's job. Perhaps the tenure statistic is manipulated by posting global numbers. Maybe an employee's departure is not recorded properly if that position is filled internally...IDK. What I do know is that the DM position for a certain division has been vacated by 3 different people within the last 5 years. All 3 DM's left for different companies. This is undeniable regardless of the response that this post will solicit. The turnover at the DM level should be as concerning as the account manager turnover. Obviously the Culture isn't working for everyone.

Forecast is a predetermined growth percentage thrown on top of sales from the previous year without regard to large projects ending or other market changes. Annual performance targets for promotion within the account manager (level 1, level 2, etc) change every year. Saw multiple account managers hit the requirements for their promotion as set forth in January only to be denied in the ""interview"".  Corporate wants to shift business online, this has made the account manager a turnkey position. Lots of senior employees being pushed out for cheaper, younger salesmen that stay 2-3 years.

Advancement opportunities – Hilti has seen double digit growth for several years in a row. To accommodate we are continually hiring and then aggressively developing from within.   
Great management – I have had 5 different managers in my time here at Hilti, and all of them have been incredible.
They really care – Having worked at several other companies throughout my career, one the first things I noticed about the leadership group is that they are not only approachable they care about your personal life as well as your professional development. I have had the pleasure of having dinner twice with the VP of Sales and both times he has asked primarily about how my family is doing.
Compensation – Hilti takes care of its sales force. Your base salary as well as bonus will vary depending on your level of experience. Generally, as a new account manager you can expect a base of mid 40’s to mid 50’s with a bonus potential of around $20K. There are other incentives year-to-year but those are the basics.
With that said we have some tenured account managers who make low six figures.","If you want to promote quickly Hilti is the place to be. However, you will be given sometime extensive projects and will have to move every 2-4 year. Depending on how quickly you want to move up. 
For me this is not a con, but for some it can be. We have a very positive, strong company culture and for some the “cool-aid” can be a little too strong.

Which is great for the company - except they disregard their sales employees as a result.    Core values of Teamwork and Integrity seem to be just words now.  You can now step on others, swindle sales from others and still have opportunities to grow. There is a great deal of nepotism in this company, which has become more apparent over the years.

There are opportunities for everyone as long as you're willing to travel and relocate. 

The pay is good. Bonuses are also good. They do like to find reasons to pay you if you're in the field.

The benefits are hands down some of the best I've had.  They also continue to evolve and have changes since the years I've been here.

Managers do seem to care about your well being and drive home a ""family first"" mentality. 

They do promote well from within and it's one of the more diverse workforces I've had opportunity to work with.","It's not a consistent experience from manager to manager. Some managers are definitely better than others at developing their people.

They do take feedback from everyone annually, but a lot of changes seem to be short lived. This could be an outlying response in my region.

They have very aggressive targets as a company, so sometimes variable income or performance metrics may seem tough to achieve for most people.

Depending on direct management, you may have a harder time moving within the company. Being ""blocked"" is a common term throughout the organization. 

If you don't drink the ""koolaid"" and accept the culture, you don't last long.

My first impression of Hilti was their emphasis on company culture. Additionally, the company and employees have a real sense of pride that their organization is creating some of the best products in the construction industry. 

Hilti recently expanded their scope beyond products and service to software, applications, and other digital efforts. I liked that the company didn’t just tip-toe into this endeavor. The company invested heavily by opening a third floor at their Plano North American headquarters solely dedicated just to software and other digital departments. 

The “9th floor” has some features I have not seen at any other company I have worked for. Meeting rooms can be reserved for months at a time for long projects. These meeting rooms have expo boards around the whole meeting room with temporary desks. Moreover, they have phone rooms, huddle rooms, and meeting/conference rooms that have TVs for presenting or video conferencing.

677,Hilti North America,Account Manager III,2015-05-29,1.0,Account Manager III,"One of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the construction industry. Selling Hilti can be fun with a good manager and a good team. A true sales organization. Lots of resources to help. Most tools are higher quality than the competitive brands but differentiation gap is narrowing, commoditization has arrived. Average medical benefits. Long term strategy of customer engagement and segmentation is causing steady growth but there are no true innovative products or product lines on the horizon. Sales planning is hyper-process oriented that benefits new salespeople but clearly creates daily “speedbumps” that slows down otherwise productive salespeople to a crawl.","Market share has always been historically very low and will not improve with a 20th century distribution model and a centralized customer service department. I left Hilti for several reasons. At the top of the list was they could not understand a very basic concept that in the construction business time is money. One, two, and often three day shipping will never allow customers to truly bond to the outside sales reps. Hilti products are too far away from the projects and that is causing the costs to buy from Hilti to rise. Customers will buy what they must but customers will establish better relationships with other distributors that don’t charge as much for freight or will drive within a few miles and buy comparable quality off a shelf. After an order is sold, the sales rep has to beg the customer to wait for up to 3 days for the product. That’s ok for shoes and other commodities but contractors’ livelihood depends on their supplies. Shipping charges and sur-charges added to an already higher price product is a major obstacle to growing the account base. Salaries were well below average and the potential to earn bonus never materialized. It was clear early that Hilti doesn’t like to pay bonus or promote salespeople (AM 2-5) because it’s practically impossible to hit targets. The way sales targets and forecasts are established needs a major overhaul. This is an excellent company to start in a career but then leave for a much better company."

It's easy to get blamed for not performing when you took over a territory and all the construction projects ended. There are also some major product gaps depending on your trade and geography. Health care plan is terrible."

I came in as management with lots of promises to move into bigger roles quickly.  The only thing that was quick was the realization that you either are from Hilti or you are an outsider.
