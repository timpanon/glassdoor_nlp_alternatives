0,HubSpot,The investment in culture is real,2021-07-20,5.0,Vice President,"When I joined HubSpot, I wondered if the marketing around their culture was real... a healthy skepticism I maintained for probably my first whole year. Now that I've been there for a while, I can attest that it is indeed real and everyone works hard to hold the bar high.

I really like how we keep the focus on customer impact & spend less time trying to emulate competition or react to short term market trends. The focus on the customer also makes it easy to make the hard internal decisions - we do whats best for customer when at all possible.

As for how they take care of employees, I specifically like how they do consistent employee net promoter scores and then review as a management team (director and above) to take action on any pain we find.","There are sometimes competing priorities that make it hard to know what's ideal to focus on. If we're launching a new Hub, is it important to grow that Hub or more important to make the rest of the platform (5 hubs) more valuable? Some leaders would say the latter, but rate you on the former. Probably just life in the big city, but a single unified go to market engine can create fiction with an org that serves 4+ personas with 5+ hubs in 7 major markets spread across Small / Mid / Corp segments. Whew!"

2,HubSpot,Absolutely loving it!,2022-03-01,5.0,Senior Customer Onboarding Specialist,"Community in a remote world. I feel very connected to my team scattered all throughout the country and have had great experiences with others around the world. The humbleness of everyone and the ease of communicating either for fun coffee chats or more direct work strategies has been phenomenal. Everybody is so willing to help and never judges if you have a ""silly"" question. We all collectively feel like we're helping one another grow better so that we can help our customers grow better. I was so excited to join the team and now I'm even more excited to share and help this team grow! The unlimited time off is no joke either. It's hard to promote that and follow it up - but physical & mental health are prioritized here and we're encouraged to take time off to rest up and heal so we can show up perfectly for everyone else. I could go on and on with the pros.","Honestly very hard to think of a con, but I want to so that I'm not entirely biased. But I think this comes with a rapidly growing company and especially one that remains at the top of the industry and that con (is secretly a pro) is that we are moving FAST! Things change, there's a lot to learn, and a lot to keep up with. As long as you pace yourself, breathe and remember that everyone here is willing to help you out - this will be a con that you don't think of all that often."
3,HubSpot,Amazing Culture & People with some Temporary Downsides,2022-01-13,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- The best people I’ve worked with. Especially for those who strive on friendly competition. 
- Wonderful growth opportunities. They really encourage (and expect) you to get better which is amazing for those looking to grow. 
- I feel connected to the executive team. I may not agree with everything they do, but I00% believe they’ll listen to and act on my feedback.","- The company growth pace is crazy. Designing and maintaining systems that are already enormous and expected to double in traffic every 2-4 years is a challenging problem. This is also a pro if you like the challenge! But no doubt it can get exhausting. 
- Pay & benefits are mediocre compared to the expectations of performance. Engineers are expected to perform very near to those at FAANG companies while receiving significantly less total comp. The work-life-balance does help. At least we’re not expected to work 60 hour weeks. This is the only reason I’d consider leaving. If I’m going to be working crazy hard, why not get paid more for it. To be clear though, I’m still not currently considering leaving but this weighs on the back of my mind."
4,HubSpot,"Talks a big game about culture, not living up to the hype lately",2022-02-02,2.0,Product Manager,"When I first joined HubSpot they were a growing company and you could tell that they walked the walk when it came to culture, vision, and mission. 

I felt a very strong sense of belonging and that much of what HubSpot says about itself was true.

I worked with many incredibly smart and kind people that pushed me to be better and bring my best every day.","As HubSpot grew, and went remote, it could not keep up with the pace of growth. 

It became expected that because you were home and had your laptop you would be online. This ""always on"" culture led to many repeated slack messages and emails all hours of the day. 

The product team especially suffered from severe burnout and bloat. The entire product org scaled at an incredible rate in the last few years while ambitious and aggressive initiatives were placed across teams with little direction or management. I often found myself tasked with a new massive initiative while in the middle of the current one at the time. This led to teams constantly rushing out work to keep up with the pace of what was expected for Inbound.

It often felt like middle management did nothing but rubber stamp these initiatives putting the teams below them in the uncomfortable position of sprinting through deadline after deadline barely keeping up with demand.

Compensation outside of engineering was not great. 401k match was not great either. HubSpot relied heavily on the in-office benefits, but with those all gone thanks to being remote the (very) small remote stipend was not enough to replace them."
5,HubSpot,Very Excited to Be Here!,2022-01-18,5.0,Technical Recruiter,"The more time I'm in seat with HubSpot the more thankful I am to be here! Love the culture and people - there is a kindness and empathy that exists here at HubSpot that I truly haven't experienced anywhere else. For example, one of the best things I ever heard from my manager, ""slack should be treated as a voicemail, you shouldn't expect an immediate response"" -- THAT WAS LIFE CHANGING. To know we all support each other and we know we're all working hard but give each other the space to breathe. It's just different here, in the best way. I'm so glad I had the courage to apply and hope to be with HubSpot for a very long time.","In Recruiting we have a outreach/prospecting number we have to hit monthly - which I am totally okay with - but the tools in place to measure this number are buggy and inaccurate. It's a bit frustrating/time consuming that I constantly have to be putting in tickets and double checking my numbers instead of just focusing on my work. It takes up time and when management is asked about our tool Looker, etc. you're given the answer to just kind of deal with it. Not very proactive in fixing or problem solving. So a bit of a bummer there."
6,HubSpot,"Good company, but beware",2022-01-06,2.0,Channel Account Manager,"-best product on the market
-solid leadership team
-culture is a pro and a con. It's a pro because everyone is extremely helpful and management genuinely wants you to succeed. I'll explain why it's a con below
-pay is decent","-Culture is also a con because it's extremely ""cult-like"". If you work here, be prepared to not question anything and mindlessly chant the company catchphrases in unison with your coworkers. If you're not 100% bought in to the idea that hubspot is the best thing since sliced bread, you won't fit in. Hubspot also makes it clear that they strongly value diversity, but certainly not of thought.. Even in regards to politics, which they intertwine into the workplace too much for comfort.
There is still something of a ""boy's club"" here, but to hubspot's credit, they are trying to change that.

-Because of the CAM comp structure (and direct seller collaboration system), your success entirely depends on the book of partners you're given. You can be the greatest sales rep in the world, channel or otherwise, but if you don't have partners who are motivated, know how to collaborate with the direct sellers, and know how to sell the software itself, you are SOL. And if this is the case, hubspot simply tells you to do better instead of looking inward at the structural problems within the CAM org. Monthly quota exacerbates this

TL;DR: hubspot is a fast-growing, innovative company with an amazing product and leadership team. I'm sure other roles have less (or different) problems, but if you are considering the CAM role, I'd recommend proceeding with caution and preparing yourself for a lot of work/effort that may not pay off."
7,HubSpot,Absolutely the best interview & onboarding experience,2022-01-05,5.0,Senior Program Manager,"I've never felt so respected and valued throughout the interviewing process - the recruiters I worked with (I applied for a handful of roles and interviewed for two) were kind, responsive, and provided lots of helpful context. With each stage of the interview process, they provided information on the people I'd be meeting with, advice on the types of questions to prepare for, and any feedback from interviewers from the previous round. The salary range was also shared in the very first interview, without any awkward back-and-forth. 

I'm still new to the organization, but from day one I've felt supported by my supervisor and colleagues, and have been warmly welcomed onto the team. There are systems and practices in place that prioritize engagement, team bonding, and providing feedback in all directions.","Health insurance options for employees on the West Coast of the US. Blue Cross Blue Shield is the only primary care provider (though there are of course separate programs for dental, mental health, etc), and it just doesn't compare to the ease of use and access that I had with Kaiser, through my previous employer. When I shared this concern with the benefits team, however, they replied quickly and thoughtfully, sharing that they revisit options each year and would consider Kaiser again as West Coast employee numbers grow.

I've heard that sometimes employees struggle with toxic positivity, since there's such a strong culture of celebrating wins and encouraging colleagues, but I much prefer this to the dysfunctional, negative work environments I've experienced in the past."
8,HubSpot,Poor mid level management,2022-02-25,2.0,People Operations,"The CEO is great and the company strives to create an inclusive environment, growing company and strong business performance, unlimited pto, great people and teammates.","HubSpot definitely grew way too quickly without enough resources and unfortunately this led to employees being burnt consistently. Compensation is definitely a lot lower than what the market rate is and it is no equitable across the board. Leadership has a plan to be more transparent around compensation but there doesn't seem to be clear expectations on the improvements they are making. Work life balance is ok for some roles but for some departments teams are understaffed and overworking is indirectly encouraged. As much as I believe diversity and inclusion is prioritized, there is definitely a TON of nepotism and favoritism in terms of who gets promoted at the management and director level, and bad managers are not held accountable since many of them have been at the company for 5+ years. This has led to very bad and problematic outcomes. I am also deeply concerned about attrition of BIPOC employees. There is a strong sentiment across the board that leadership will not respond to employee feedback and concerns."
9,HubSpot,"Great for benefits, hit or miss managers, not great for pay or internal mobility",2022-03-23,2.0,Senior Customer Support Specialist,"Great benefits

Great for working parents who need flexibility

HubSpot name looks good on a resume","Support is the lowest paid department and is treated differently than the other orgs at hubspot. 

Pay is a slap in the face

As a support rep, you know everything about the product however the pay doesn't reflect that, and neither does the attitude of other departments toward support. 

Internal mobility is a nightmare unless you know the right people or know exactly what keywords to say in an internal interview

I don't want swag, I want a raise"
10,HubSpot,Good in general but performance metrics don't align with company culture code,2021-12-03,3.0,Customer Support Specialist,"- Most people I work with are great, supportive. My manager and team lead do make me feel that they care about me as a person. In general, positive environment
- Love the free book program
- Love that I actually can use the unlimited vacation benefit and my manager encourages me to use it","METRICS
- Having to reach 14 web tickets or 23 chats per day + all follow-up cases is very unrealistic to be able to have the mindset to Solve For The Customer.
- Our performance metrics go against the CORE value of the company SFTC. I can't go above and beyond for the customer with the mindset: I still have this many tickets/chats to complete, are you done so I can move on to the next customer? And how can we not have that mindset when we can only reach the metrics if we spend a minimum amount of time on each ticket, as short as possible.
- With the stress of having to meet the metrics, you can't even enjoy team events because doesn't matter if that's team events or meetings, you're still expected to meet that metric."
11,HubSpot,"Awful WLB, low pay. Diverse execs, Good Macbook",2022-02-21,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"* Good tools (new top of line macbook, slack, etc)
* Company will mail you sweatpants
* Occasional fun event every three months or so (trivia, etc), I usually skip these due to workload but your experience may be different
* Top level executives seem approachable, lots of AMA's. Unfortunately I usually have to skip these too
* Diversity in senior leadership including lots of women which is refreshing in the tech industry","* Ratings are inflated by sending out review requests to employees shortly after the initial fun one month bootcamp
* Really Bad WLB, frequently stack ranking you against your coworkers. Comparable WLB to MAANG but at 1/3 the comp 
* Deep prior Java expertise (with Google guice and lots of inheritance) is required. Learning from a different language background will be challenging in the limited allowed ramp up time (approx 1 month) 
* Tasks are not sized beforehand per usual agile methods but rather lines of code are counted afterward by Team Lead to gauge productivity. This tradeoff lets you move faster in the average case but can be easily biased or even unfair (harder problem, favoritism, etc) in the worst case
* Tech stack is about a decade old and primarily Mesos based with complicated java inheritance and messy heap dumps"
12,HubSpot,Great place to start,2022-03-21,4.0,Customer Support Specialist,"HubSpot is a great place for young professionals who are eager to learn and have ambition.
The training process makes it easier to make friends
You will learn a lot, even if you don't want to
They're tuition reimbursement program is fantastic
People are usually very nice and open to hwlp","Moving out of your role, especially if it's an entry level role is INCREDIBLY challenging. Most people apply to at least 3-4 internal positions before they can move up or our of a department
If you're not competitive, this might not be the place for you
Sales mentality and expectations will end up leaking into any role
Compensation depends on your role and background but Support does not pay very well for what it asks of you
Most other roles have a better pay-work ratio"
13,HubSpot,The best place I’ve ever worked. I’m here for the long term!,2021-11-06,5.0,Mid-Market Account Executive,"I get to sell the best product in our market. Amazing culture and smart, compassionate coworkers. Incredible leadership from the top down. Unlimited PTO and sabbatical every 5 years for all employees. 4 months full pay maternity AND paternity leave. Incredible office in Cambridge. High quota attainment is the norm. Stock purchase plan and stock given away for high performers which is amazing!! Tons of contests to win stock which has gone up 4x in value since I joined the company only 1.5 years ago. Also I get to expense my professional coaching which is a huge benefit!",Low base salaries. Easy to make up for if you perform well. The company is growing tremendously which is exciting but I wish they would grow people and not keep increasing quotas. The last increase has been a little challenging.
14,HubSpot,"I feel so supported, and like I am making a difference.",2022-02-16,5.0,Onboarding Specialist,"-My manager is incredible...so supportive, encouraging, and honest. Identifies areas where I can improve but always is positive and praises when I do things right
-Company listens to feedback from employees, is transparent about implementing it and cares about employee wellbeing
- I truly feel that the work I do makes a difference and helps customers, so empowering to feel that I am making an impact and not just going through the motions
-Lots of benefits, room to take days off and refresh
-Diversity and inclusion is a huge focus. I feel like I can be my true authentic self working at HubSpot.",Not many! During the remote shift it sometimes it easy to feel isolated.
15,HubSpot,"Breakneck growth, but at what cost?",2022-02-15,3.0,Technical Lead,- Company still walks the walk on work-life balance and DI&B,"The company is hiring new engineers at a breakneck pace and putting a huge amount of stress on our onboarding, mentorship, and management capabilities. There are simply not enough qualified managers to oversee these new teams, and existing ones are overburdened and burnt out. 

We are still waiting to see what changes the company makes to compensation in March, but the lack of communication and transparency throughout the process has shown a lack of concern for employees who are on the fence about whether this is all worth it. I can only imagine how it is for those not fortunate enough to be paid as highly as engineers and don't know whether they'll be paid a livable wage in light of ever increasing cost of living."
16,HubSpot,10/10 - would highly recommend,2022-03-06,5.0,,"HubSpot takes it's culture and values very seriously and it shows up in the way they treat their employees, customers and partners. I feel trusted, appreciated and valued as an employee.

 I believe that leadership at HubSpot from the top down believe that they get the best work from employees who are empowered, encouraged and well-rested. It's tough to battle burnout in a world as wild as ours this past two years, but they do a wonderful job of walking the walk and ensuring employees are able to fill our own cup so that we can show up for others. Work-life balance is highly respected and theres a focus on asynchronous communication to help protect and maintain that balance.  The unlimited PTO supports this and gives me the ability to manage my time in a way that allows me to be at my best.

All employees are asked to use good judgment and are then trusted to do so. I can't speak for anyone else, but this trust is sacred to me and pushes me to do my very best and to operate in a way that is deserving of so much autonomy.  I feel energized to make a positive impact and do remarkable things.

The people I work with are communicative, warm, and people-centric. I feel a strong sense of belonging despite being relatively new and a fully remote employee.","We are growing FAST! As a result, we are shifting from a start up to scale up approach and feeling some of the growing pains associated to making that switch. 

 This shows up in little ways, like not knowing if someone will contact you via  document comment tag, Asana tag, email, slack DM, slack tag, etc. and sometimes duplicating comms as a result.

It also shows up in bigger ways like not always having a clear idea of what success looks like in your role as we tend to prioritize responsiveness and agility over clear, defined swim lanes and expectations.

These are less ""cons"" and more of an acknowledgement that we are a work in progress."
17,HubSpot,Great place to grow!,2022-01-23,5.0,Manager,"HubSpot walks the walk. I've been here for 5+ years and still am learning something new every day. One of the reasons I stay at HubSpot is because of the growth opportunities. It is definitely a fast-paced environment and the only constant is change. But if you are looking for a place to learn a ton, grow a lot and meet some amazing people and customers then you are in the right place!","As I mentioned, it is really fast-paced. Also, most roles are very metric-based, so the pro is that it is easy to know how you are performing and where you can grow. On the other hand, being so metric-focused can be difficult."
18,HubSpot,2 months in and already hoping to retire here,2022-01-12,5.0,"Manager, Customer Success","This company is really walking the walk. They do the right thing on all accounts, and they are focused on making life better for its employees who, in return, help their customers grow better. I feel really proud being here, and I know that I'm going to grow both personally and professionally simply by absorbing the amazingness of the talent that works here. 

I really hope I can stay here for a long time, and that says something coming from a Millennial ;)","No company is perfect, let's not set unrealistic expectations. But cons are subjective - for someone who likes office culture, the remote-only option in some locations may not be ideal; someone who's not comfortable in a fast-paced environment may not do their best work in an ever-changing, ever-growing organization; for someone who wants to move up the ranks quickly, the many layers of leadership may be discouraging. I, personally, accept that nothing will ever be perfect. But if you find something that makes sense for your situation, then the pros will typically outweigh the cons."
19,HubSpot,Fast growing & exciting company!,2022-03-10,5.0,Solutions Engineer,"- Coworkers & management are genuinely helpful and invested in one another's success
- There are plenty of opportunities to move vertically and laterally
- Process improvement ideas are encouraged by management and quickly implemented, rather than being delayed due to red tape
- HubSpot provides equipment for a comfortable and effective work from home setup","- HubSpot has a rapidly developing product & frequent changes to the organization's structure, so it's important to keep up with changes in both regards"
20,HubSpot,Toxic Culture,2022-02-27,1.0,Software Engineer,"- Good and plentiful engineer tooling. Makes very high engineering productivity possible
- Decent benefits","Depending on what part of the company you land in, the codebase may be quite legacy, unstable, and loaded with messy inheritance. Company culture expects you to be constantly eager to go the extra mile for every little thing and that plus the ""always-on"" expectations from being remote/flexible can have you consistently working long hours and having to be available on weekends, in the evenings, middle of the night, etc.

I got stuck working on something I really didn't enjoy, but I didn't feel comfortable expressing that I hated that work due to aforementioned points about company culture and that made it miserable to show up to work and be productive. Eventually was terminated without notice. No PIP and no conversations with my skip-level manager leading up to it even. Was never communicated to me clearly that my employment was at stake and was let go with minimal severance."

There are 3 things that really set Hubspot apart (1) Fantastic management team that puts people - both customers and employees - first. Empathy is a core Hubspot value and the leadership team truly walks the walk. Especially during COVID, all decisions have prioritized employee and customer wellbeing, and I feel so grateful to be in such a supportive work environment. (2) World-class place to learn. Hubspot is a fast-growing leader in the SaaS space and therefore has almost endless opportunities to learn and take on new responsibility. Further, leadership has invested heavily in formal training programs to upskill employees in oth technical skills and leadership. (3) Openness to new ideas and perspectives. Even though Hubspot is a sizeable public company, it still has the nimbleness of a startup. If you have a way to do something better, people will listen and you will be given the autonomy to create change. Such a breath of fresh air coming from larger, more hierarchical organizations.","Because Hubspot is scaling fast, sometimes things feel like they are moving at the speed of light.

29,HubSpot,HubSpot's culture lives up to the hype,2021-12-06,5.0,Strategy & Operations Senior Analyst,"HubSpot lives its values in an authentic, not-fake and cringe-worthy way.

As an employee, you are celebrated for who you are, people respect your time (and time away), and you're consistently shown how much HubSpot cares about you. We aren't often overworked, we're provided with extra learning opportunities and speaker series, and we get more days for rest and mental health/rejuvenation than anywhere I've heard of.

On top of that, most people are genuinely excited about the work they're doing. They're invested in HubSpot's long-term future and want to make sure we're moving the right direction, quickly. It's an exciting place to work because the people care about what they're doing.","There's a lot to learn and sometimes it's hard finding the resources to help. 

Because HubSpot has grown so quickly, the business has changed dramatically during the company's lifetime, meaning internal processes and initiatives change often and documentation is only completed when people have capacity (infrequently). So when you need information about a specific project or initiative, it can be hard to find the right learning resource, aside from word-of-mouth."

No company is perfect, but I must say that HubSpot comes pretty darn close (based on my own personal experience).

60,HubSpot,The HEART has disappeared,2022-02-17,2.0,Tech Lead,"* Genuine focus on diversity, inclusion & belonging (DI&B) at all levels.
* Solid platform infrastructure; most teams can focus on delivering customer value, not writing k8s manifests or how to deploy JVMs.
* Generally friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful engineering community.
* Solid growth opportunities for early career engineers.","* The culture has taken a nose dive since the pandemic started. This is less about events (product experience has done a good job here) and more that people seem to forget there's a human being on the other side of the zoom call. Every interaction is transactional and cold. HEART has disappeared at HubSpot. 
* The company is growing fast and failing to scale. Leadership pushes complex initiatives onto teams without considering all the implications. It feels like they're just trying to pump up the stock price which obviously isn't sustainable in the long term.
* Burnout continues to be a problem. There's more discussion about it but very little concrete action beyond no meeting Fridays and the extra week of rest. Executive leadership encourages us to talk about burnout openly with our managers but since doing so I've started receiving critical feedback. 
* Pockets of middle management in engineering lack management and people skills, but are exceptionally skilled at gaslighting.
* There's been an exodus of senior talent in engineering, leadership doesn't appear to want to retain them (even dismissing the idea that we're seeing increased attrition).
* The hiring bar in product and engineering has been lowered. In an attempt to get more people in the door, we're not assessing technical ability as closely or screening as thoroughly for culture-add. We've hired some toxic people recently simply because they had impressive company names on their resume.
* Politics runs rampant: the best ideas don't win anymore and promotions are handed out to the most visible and connected individuals, not the ones who are most qualified.
* The Tech Lead role is a trap. On paper there is upward mobility to Engineering Lead, but the fact is you'll be so overworked that you'll never develop skills and meet the bar for promotion. There is no mentorship available for Tech Leads."
61,HubSpot,Undervalued and Overworked,2022-03-01,1.0,Talent Sourcer,"Unlimited PTO 
OK Benefits
Can work fully remote
CEO is great","Overall, HubSpot has failed to treat their current employees with respect. There is no internal growth aside from 'lifers' who have been with HubSpot for over 4 years. The turnover is extremely high with 1/5 of the companies current employees open to new opportunities (majority of these people women and POC). 

They promote people based on personal relationships with leaders instead of qualifications. You have to 'drink the koolaid' and continuously post inflated reviews of the company culture on LinkedIn to even start getting recognition.

Compensation is no where near comparable to other companies in the market. They hire new employees doing the same work as current employees at significantly higher rates (~25-50k above in some cases).

They have people taking on responsibilities which go far outside of original role responsibilities and refuse to promote or increase comp. This is something I specifically went through, more information below.

For sourcing specifically, there is a lack of clarity around career growth plans. While management was building this out I was 'kept in the loop' and was given the opportunity to give suggestions and feedback on these plans. However, when the already finalized plans were shared with me, I noticed that it was copied word for word from the recruiting career path. I set up time with my manager to discuss feedback. I had built out a document highlighting similarities and offered suggestions which would be more aligned with the role of a sourcer vs. a recruiter and was told they would take it into consideration. No changes were made. Given I was their most tenured Sourcer on the team and had even been recognized by higher leadership as the reason they decided to build out the sourcing role at HubSpot, I hoped they would be more open to ideas around making this career path reflect the duties and expectations of this role more accurately. This led to many sourcers joining and quickly realizing the role itself was not what they had expected during the interview process. 

**Additional Context**

I started at HubSpot as a contract worker on a one month contract which was extended out month by month for about 5 months. Through this time I was the only one out of 7 other sourcers that came and went who, consistently performing above the bar. I frequently expressed interest in being a full time employee and was told every time that it would happen the next month. It never did. I began interviewing and was finally offered a FT position when I brought this offer to leaders. 

Following this, they hired 4 new FT sourcers which was great given we were able to build out stronger sourcing capacity. When these sourcers joined, I was responsible for training and onboarding them all, getting them set up for success around internal tooling, best practices and metrics. In addition, I had taken on two New Hire Trainings which I gave weekly, if not more, to incoming employees on the recruiting team as a whole. Then we added another sourcer coming from a non recruitment background and was given the task to mentor them 3x a week on top of general onboarding and training. I had no problem with these tasks as I am always open to help our team grow and continued to maintain above average metrics. 

My issue comes in when I attempted to have growth conversations with my manager. I felt as though I was taking on the responsibilities of a sourcing team lead. I was told we could discuss promotions but then was met with my manager continuously canceling our 1:1s and shortening them to 15 minutes. I gave my manager feedback on this and while I know she was busy with many new new hires, I think this is unacceptable behavior from a direct manager. 

I finally decided to cut my losses with HubSpot. While it saddened me because I had been there for 2.5 years and would have preferred to stay, I felt undervalued and overworked."
62,HubSpot,Don’t believe RepVue hype,2022-03-03,1.0,Account Executive,"+ Good sales enablement stack 
+ Remote work 
+ WLB can be good depending on your manager 
+ Very inclusive corporate team 
+ WFH stipend for new hires (but this may have gone away)","- A LOT of luck. Your territories are assigned by managers and as such there’s not a guarantee that you’ll get the inbound opps that the tenured reps 

- High hiring rate, chopped our workable accounts by 33%, new hires get scraps for install base. The belief by tenured reps is that “things just happen” but truthfully it won’t. Tenured reps are hitting quota and work 15hr weeks while acting as account managers. New reps won’t have that luxury and will be absolutely burned. It’s gotten so bad with new hire turnover that they actually extended the ramping period because so many either leave or get put on a PIP 

- Subpar salary bands 

- 0 culture. Notice a lot of 5 star reviews are skewed towards other roles. Sales culture is non-existent

- Because you have set accounts your prospecting efforts are super limited. You will call and email blindly and pray something works. The company talks a lot about its “inbound methodology” but you will absolutely grind out outbound everyday 

- High quotas, segments aren’t really based on opportunities and instead your segment (SMB, MM, ENT) is just your salary band. SMB might get assigned enterprise accounts, it’s all luck 

- Managers don’t care about anything but a number. Since ramping here not a single leader asked how things are going with work and life, etc. it’s just constant pipeline reviews, and hat you’re working, and critiquing everything you do 

- If you ask for help or guidance you will not get a single actionable takeaway 

- Training is truthfully a joke."

Biggest noticeable pro is the culture of autonomy and trust - highly dependent on your team, as with most orgs, but generally a high focus on mental health and work life balance (no koolaid here). Little things like blocking lunch in the cal and flexibility to step away for appointments and kids is a benefit I haven’t been afforded in my past 10 years at other companies. People seem genuinely happier here because they are able to take time off when they genuinely need it. There isn’t a culture of working just for the sake of looking like you’re working.","Equity is arguably slightly below market. No annual bonuses.

There are some rockstar tech leads and engineering managers here.

Lots of opportunity to work with senior engineers.

High mobility + flexibility. Engineers are encouraged to work on new projects/teams and to continue learning.

Not very stressful, at least in my experience as a Software Engineer. I pretty much work 9-5 and don't feel pressured to work more than that.

The company is experiencing a ton of growth and seems to be scaling well.","A handful of engineers have poor communication skills. There could be more training for engineers to not come across so arrogant, condescending, or harsh in their speech.

It seems some senior engineers get promoted to tech lead too quickly. I have noticed some tech leads are better at being engineers than they are at empathizing with people.

Not all tech leads will check in with you on a regular basis. This is hard when working in a remote world. Anyone in a leadership position should be trained to check in on new hires more often. Better to be over-communicative.

Base compensation seems fair, but I think HubSpot could bump up the stock reward and signing bonus values to attract more talent."

I did not feel like it was safe for me to speak up or even voice what I thought in that environment. I was also afraid of retaliation from leadership if I said anything about this situation, preventing me from doing my best work and leading to multiple instances of burnout and unnecessary stress.

Addressing inappropriate behavior: in the office when we worked in-person, a line was crossed and I felt uncomfortable. Whether this person had good intentions or not, it was an inappropriate action that was taken and I didn't feel safe enough to speak up. What made this situation worse was that I didn't have the resources, tools, or sense of safety to know what to do with this, so I suffered in silence.

- The company works remarkably hard to create an inclusive community where every single person is able to bring their best, whole self to work. They also invest in their employees, and you feel the impact.

It’s an exciting time to be a part of the journey of a company that is growing as quickly as HubSpot.","HubSpot is growing and with that more and more responsibilities are put on our plate. Our base pay has not grown in relation to product growth and I feel that we’ve surpassed the threshold where the work no longer correlates with the pay. In my role in particular the diversity and subscription level of the customers you work with does not equate to a higher pay.  Promotions may take a few years to get and require you to be firing on all cylinders to catch the eye of management, even still the pay increase with these promotions is small.

- Flexibility: Just be sure to communicate with your team and managers and flexibility of schedule is offered to you if you need it. It makes you feel like you're in charge of your schedule as long as you're producing the expected amount of work.

- Autonomy: At first, coming from a different company/culture, this was an adjustment. But, I can honestly say that I love being in charge of making my own day to day priorities while driving towards an overall set goal. It makes me feel empowered and I take pride and ownership over the work I'm doing each day.

- Great People Work Here: Amazing people ready to welcome anyone that is new and help with any questions.

- Creative Freedom/Everyone's Opinion Matters",The only con I have would be the sense of being overwhelmed a bit at the beginning of my career here.

-Diversity and inclusion regarding religion, medical status, race/ethnicity, and age is severely lacking.

-Customer Support Specialists are responsible for every single part of the product, including all the hundreds of product updates put out in a short period of time.

-The product changes overnight, during the day, with little to no notice or training. Yes this causes backend issues that CSSs then have to deal with and communicate to angry customers. Bugs are often complained about in NPS surveys, which hurts CSSs are their ability to be promoted. 

-There are metrics for everything. It feels like one is being micro-managed. I've heard that being off by a few points in NPS can prevent one from being promoted. Cue feeling like you're walking on egg shells all day long. Even an NPS 8 (out of 10) can lower the score below the goal for promotion.

-Customer Support Specialists are expected to troubleshoot design/code/javascript/HTML/CSS/JASON on live support channels, but the salary is not commensurate with this responsibility.

-Customer Support Specialists are expected to be able to troubleshoot every single third-party application that connects to HubSpot, even if we- the CSS- have not ever downloaded or used the app and can't test it if it's behind a paywall."
104,HubSpot,It has lost its luster,2021-12-14,3.0,Technical Lead,"HubSpot continues to be a great transparent company that really strives to listen to what their employees have to say and work to make changes.

I've grown so much during my time at HubSpot, and because of that experience I would strongly recommend the company to someone who is just starting out as a software engineer.","I've been at HubSpot for over 5 years.

HubSpot has been focusing so much on growing the engineering team that they spend little time figuring out how to value their more senior engineers.

HubSpot has not been scaling salaries with the new remote market. Additionally, they don't really factor in tenure when considering total comp, in effect I get the same comp if not less than a technical lead that just joined the org. This has lead to many tenured engineers leaving the company to work for remote companies that give them 20% raises and better benefits, and I'm strongly considering doing that myself.

The culture has also been hit very hard by the pandemic. I respect what the team has been trying to do, but I can't take another awkward zoom culture event. The fun parties and off sites are mostly gone in favor of the socially distanced corporate office party.

My last con is the workload. Given the growth we've had recently we've been hiring new engineers and spinning up new projects and teams left and right. This, along with the recent high turnover of more tenured engineers, has resulted in teams that formed with a majority new members. On top of that, every team has on average two ""business critical"" projects they are working on that involve multiple teams. As a result I'm juggling way too many things."
105,HubSpot,Marketing Manager,2022-01-07,5.0,Marketing Manager,"Great progressive culture, really great for remote workers","I honestly have not had a better work situation. I believe in our business as a whole, and that we're getting there in a fantastic way"

- autonomy and trust from management to do my job
- fun work environment (more applicable to the in-office experience)
- everyone I work with is amazing and super helpful
- good work has never gone unnoticed
- I truly believe in this product
- work feels like is has an actual impact","- compensation is a huge issue that gets “addressed” every time we have a company meeting but nothing seems to be done about it and is the primary reason of writing my review. Wages, from my view in customer success, are consistently below market. Our maximum Annual raises every year are just on par with the threshold for general annual inflation, meaning the annual bonuses doesn’t really improve the standard of living of employees year after year. The max annual Raise is also only attainable if you are a super top performer who has contributed much to your team. No other bonuses or raises other than promotions (which isn’t much more). But what you’re already in a senior level of your dream job at HubSpot? Best bet would be to change roles. This is part of the culture here now. This should be changed. HubSpot is joining the billion dollar club and companies at this level do their employees better. If you want to retain us, start here. It’s a conversation I have with my manager often and I’m often assured change is coming; but when?
- no annual bonuses
- remote culture has kind of dragged and the culture of the company lost its spark for me
- my position is often referred to as a stepping stone to enable people on my team to grow their careers in HubSpot but I like this position. If it were more sustainable, I’d like to work it for the long haul. This compensation thing is making me thing lots of things. The whole vibe I’m getting here right now is “you want more money? Change jobs but internally. Growth!”"
109,HubSpot,Can’t beat the culture,2021-12-27,4.0,Project Manager,Everything you hear about the Hubspot culture is great. From the CEO down everyone is nice and welcoming and great to work with. The work life balance is amazing.,There’s no growth plans set in place and you get judged in your 360 review for process issues that start from way higher up in your management structure. So you’re usually being reactive and stuck trying to please your manager. Nobody talks about realistic growth and people have been leaving due to it
110,HubSpot,Great place to work,2022-01-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,True autonomy and flexibility. Great pay,"Challenging sales goals, ever increasing quotas"
111,HubSpot,Challenging work but compensated with good culture and WLB,2021-10-11,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Remote first which is exactly what I wanted
- I use and love the product and the fact that we get an enterprise level account for personal use is fantastic. I feel very invested to make a good product as a customer.
- WLB is fantastic. I am encouraged to take time off and I don't feel bad about doing it. 4-week sabbatical every 5 years is huge. Product team also gets 2 weeks of rest a year, one week during first week of July and one week during last week of December.
- A lot of growth opportunities. Teams are kept small (5-6 max) so that there's a lot of chances to grow in skills and lead to help grow your career. If you're looking to advance, this is the place for you.
- Company actually tries to embody the values. For example, upper management was Transparent about ways they fell short in particular areas and are taking employee feedback seriously to make a change
- Pay is good for the company size and market (at least in Product Eng)
- Internal tooling is great. They built their own CI/CD so that devs can focus on writing code rather than fixing a DevOps system. And they have great UIs","- Work is challenging and can feel like a treadmill increasing in speed. If you're not ready for it, it can be tough. BUT there's a lot of things that are changing to help that like the weeks of rest, unlimited PTO, and more
- Homogenous tech stack (can be both a pro and a con). All back end runs on Java 8/11, Dropwizard framework, and the same CI/CD. This is great if you want to move teams but it's hard to pioneer a new technology.
- No cost of living raises or annual bonuses. You can get stock refreshers if you perform well but I personally would prefer an annual bonus determined by company and individual goals."

-Leaders gossip and power-trip a lot. (like saying certain people aren't ""fun enough"" or ""likeable"")

-HubSpotters who've worked at the company 5+ years were like the cliquey popular kids in Highschool who get rewarded just for being popular and make everyone feel left out. 

-Instead of providing actionable, constructive feedback, Leadership plays favorites and gives feedback based in emotion, typically tied to how much they like you or not.

- If you challenge Leadership, even on appropriate matters like operating models or direction, you're labeled as someone who takes feedback poorly or called a ""bad apple"" (which a colleague of mine was actually called speaking up too much).

Company-hosted parties.","Open concept office for engineering team. No 401k matching. ""Unlimited"" PTO instead of a generous concrete amount of vacation time. You're expected to spend free time outside of work doing work. No QA. There are a lot of all-hands meetings where upper management spits out propaganda about how great the company is.

Overall, it's a very fast-paced high-stress environment, where an engineer is essentially expected to perform the job of an engineer, QA, DevOps, L3 support, and a product manager, and be as efficient as if you were just an engineer. You'll randomly get assigned responsibility for supporting other teams' code running in production without being given any time to actually understand it."
131,HubSpot,Great Culture,2021-09-28,5.0,Senior Growth Marketing Manager,"HubSpot has prioritized its culture and the wellbeing of its employees, unlike anything I have ever seen.

133,HubSpot,"Eight years of growth, innovation, and happiness.",2020-10-19,5.0,Channel Account Manager,"I started my career at HubSpot right out of college and haven't looked back since. Believing in our product and our mission is easy, but it's the people that make my job meaningful. HubSpot is filled with a diverse range of employees from all around the world working towards a single goal. As we've grown and scaled one of the areas we have continued to thrive is hiring top talent. Not only do we hire top performers and leaders we hire people that are kind, trustworthy, and empathetic. The feeling of camaraderie and belonging is authentic and represents the values that are important to me outside of work. 

I'm most proud of our focus on LGBTQ+ initiatives. The HubSpot LGBTQ Alliance celebrates Pride year-round with a variety of global initiatives for both employees and strangers. These programs create a more inclusive work environment, hiring pool and make me proud to call HubSpot my employer.","We're mostly working from home these days, I really miss our office. I've been day dreaming about the candy wall."

Amazing culture and talented coworkers, management is transparent and cares (and provides time off to prevent burn out), and flexibility is unparalleled. Very inclusive and ahead of its time compared to majority of the companies out there. A breath of fresh air in corporate America. The perks are also unique with free monthly books, tuition reimbursement and fitness reimbursement.","If you like to meet in the office and only work synchronously, may not be the place for you. I enjoy working from home and in this hybrid-remote environment but sometimes lacks the same camaraderie- however HubSpot combats this with an awesome line up of events and opportunities to meet other remote employees in your area. Really can't think of any cons aside from personal preference for personality types."

Decent pay","Any positive review you see from anyone in sales either started prior to the pandemic (and be Yamani came to HubSpot) or is too new to understand what they signed on to. 

Quota will go up twice a year. Your territory will decrease twice a year. Demand will never increase. Saturated market. 80% of your day as an account executive will be doing BDR type job functions, but you will be required to sell mid market sized deals. 

HubSpot offer a FREE suite of tools. People will book time on your calendar to talk about FREE tools. Remember you are in sales… so you will have to delete these invites and make a lot of people mad. 

The sales culture here is ATROCIOUS. Zero work life balance. You will be consumed with HubSpot and hitting a monthly quota. If you are married or have a kid- do not even consider working here."
137,HubSpot,Couldn't be happier!,2021-06-07,5.0,Email Deliverability Consultant,"HubSpot takes their culture very seriously- which means they tend to walk the walk and stand by what they say. 

HubSpot also provides amazing befits like unlimited time off, free books, and hosts amazing events and speakers. The benefits are endless. 

I've always been WFH so I am very impressed with their remote culture- though I understand those who went from office to WFH had a harder time.

It's easy to feel welcomed. So much so, that I cannot image every wanting to leave HubSpot.","There are always areas of improvement - like their understanding of Disability Awareness. There is not an ERG for people with disabilities and they did not have basic accommodations for those with disabilities set up - like captions at meetings - until recently. They are improving this.

It is a very fast paced job and you are surrounded by amazing and smart people, so it can sometimes feel like you're getting left behind. However- this can also be combatted via their development programs and a really great boss!"

They scale leaders and train new hires.","My only comment from a people perspective would be that sometimes the people making decisions about what programs are necessary are more technical minded and don’t have the development experience and hands-on knowledge needed to make the best choice, and don’t lean on the people that do you enough.

I love all the autonomy and support I get to try new things and take on large, vague projects. I'm constantly learning, and if something isn't working out or I've stopped learning, switching teams is easy and even encouraged (I've been on 5 teams, and have tried out tech leadership as well as individual contributor roles). My peers support me, and I feel like they also care a lot about the team and our success. There's physiological safety to voice your opinions and try out new things, even if you're wrong and you fail. There are a few teams where this is not true, but you can easily move off or avoid them altogether by asking around.

There is a lot of emphasis placed on mental health, and taking the time you need to live your life as well as work, which is wonderful. Primary and secondary parental leave are both now 4 months, which is incredible!","There exist teams where there isn't physiological safety and they seem to operate contradictory to the HubSpot way.

Transparency in company communication from top to bottom. I’ve honestly never worked for a company that is so open and honest in what they’re doing and where they’re headed.
A company culture that values the customer AND the employee very highly. They are the shining example that showed when you value the employee, you’re also valuing the customer. Both drive each other.
Great benefits and true opportunities for growth. But keep in mind, your growth is the result of what you put in. All the tools and avenues are available at HubSpot, but you can’t expect to just sit and wait for it to be given to you. You have to take the initiative set your goals and utilize what HubSpot provides to help achieve them.
I really could go on and on, but there are so many reviews out there that do such a better job at articulating the pros of working here!","The only con at the moment is having to see bad reviews of HubSpot that were clearly written by the same person.

I can understand leaving a poor review that provides honest feedback on one’s experience at a company, but submitting multiple poor reviews out of bitterness to artificially downgrade HubSpot’s score is a bit childish and extremely unprofessional. If you have valid gripes about your experience and how you were treated, I’m 100% positive Katie Burke would set aside time to personally listen to them and work to make any necessary changes. That, at least, would be more productive than the method this person has currently chosen to use."

It's also clear that the decision-makers care about the things they're talking about, whether it's business-related, social, or anything in between. Nothing is given lip service without the action to back it up, which is refreshing and needed.","As a remote employee, it takes a bit more effort and intentionality to feel connected to the company mission and my team.

For example the leaders invite real customers to each quarterly company all hands meeting to tell the whole company what they really think - the good, the 'need it to be better', and how that affects HubSpot's customer's own businesses/growth. Those lessons are not just 'curated opinions' telling the whole company fluffy feel good things, but keep the company very close to reality about how to grow better to help HubSpot's customers grow better themselves.",Scaling so fast with empathy and humility requires a lot of emotional labor as a leader.

I quit HubSpot without another offer as my mental health was at an all time low, and no I was not new to Saas sales, AE life, or upset about the lack of work/life balance. 

My best advice is to read the HubSpot tell all - Disrupted - before joining this company in sales. I have never been more gaslit in my entire career, months after quitting I realized ""complaints"" people were making about me to my manager were in fact very likely fake and used as a mechanism for fear. I was told for months I would get fired, put on performance plan, etc and when I asked for the plan in writing, I was told my metrics were actually not poor enough to be put on plan. It was all fear mongering and gaslighting. 

Hubspot will come across as ""woke"", but it couldn't be further from the truth. I was told as a woman I was too aggressive (it's sales), and people were uncomfortable with my energy and my participation in group sales training as I was without tenure and not at 100% attainment. The day I decided to quit HubSpot, my manager said something to me I can't put in writing, but it was so grossly inappropriate as it related to male private areas. HubSpot is sexist, if not also racist (there are a few token people of color on the sales floor). HubSpot will also pretend to care about mental health and unplugging - the only time I was told to take time off was to ""consider medical leave if I wasn't going to hit quota."" 

If you're reading this and thinking about quitting HubSpot, do it. Most of the people I started with quit within a year (once a fat chunk of their stock vested), and we've all come out the other side and commiserate often on how brainwashed we were to think HubSpot was the golden goose of tech, when nothing could be further from the truth."

Empathetic: Leaders at HubSpot really care about their teams. There is no finger pointing when things go wrong, instead everyone just jumps in together and solves the problem. 

Adaptable: The company's response to COVID has been amazing. Tons of communication, flexibility and rapid evolution. How many other companies hired teachers to teach multiple classes almost every day from March-June? 

Remarkable: I have never felt like I have been surrounded with so much talent in my career. I am honestly floored by the quality of people that I work with every day at every level of the company. The people here are not only amazing already, but everyone is pushing to be better every day.

Transparent: Everything is shared with the whole company. EVERYTHING. Board slides, sales results, financial data, etc. It's all there because HubSpot leadership trusts employees can handle knowing the truth and because they know that this transparency is how we all can succeed together.",HubSpot does not pay top of market on salaries. I believe that is intentional because it pulls in people who believe in the mission vs those who are purely financially motivated. It also gives everyone an incentive to maximize enterprise value and increase the stock price (every employee is a shareholder).

240,HubSpot,Doesn’t get any better than HubSpot!,2021-08-17,5.0,Account Executive,Best product. Best people. Best culture.,Pay could be better for tenured sales reps.
241,HubSpot,Not a good experience,2021-07-30,1.0,Sales,Interesting products. Work with many different clients.,"One of the worst companies I’ve ever had the misfortune of working for. Don’t let the Glassdoor reviews fool you, it’s not all lollipops and rainbows. Different sales divisions constantly gaming the system and stabbing each other in the back to steal leads. Massive amounts of red tape and bureaucracy to get paid out your commission on deals. Most people have drank the Kool-Aide and believe HubSpot is somehow changing/saving the world and the amount of self congratulatory nonsense going around is ridiculous. You sell software for businesses, you’re not curing world hunger."
242,HubSpot,Growing Better,2021-09-20,4.0,Team Lead,"Growth is top of mind. Not just for the company but also for the employees. I appreciate the creative ways that HubSpot engages its employees through culture initiatives, training, and transparency in company goals.",We are growing and scale is hard. You have to enjoy a fast-paced environment.
243,HubSpot,HubSpot gives me faith in business and in humanity,2021-04-27,5.0,Marketing Manager,"This company truly walks the walk. They aren't getting these awards for no reason — they really do earn them.
I've never worked for a company that's more honest and upfront than HubSpot. I have faith that people will do what they say they will. I have faith that businesses don't have to be cutthroat to get ahead in the market. HubSpot is the epitome of good sportsmanship with customers, employees, investors, competition, and leadership. 
I feel like my role and my work matters for the bottom line of the company. I feel connected and important to our overall mission.
The pay is fair and equitable for the work that I do. I haven't once thought ""I don't get paid enough for this."" and that's a true testament to psychological safety and job security here at HubSpot.
People are truly respectful and considerate. When things go well we celebrate the wins and call out what we did right. When things could be better, we address them without pointing to faults in people. I've never seen this in a workplace before. 
There's so much trust here. It takes some getting used to if you've always had to watch your back at work and walk on eggshells. Nobody is breathing down your back about anything or looking to fire you. You're trusted to deliver and everyone wants you to succeed.","Working remotely is great, but it does have its pitfalls when it's forced rather than chosen. I'd love to visit the office once a quarter, but because of the pandemic, that hasn't been an option. I wish I could see my coworkers more and really connect with them. But I'm sure those opportunities will come soon.
Some processes are hard to work around, like getting access to internal systems."
244,HubSpot,Amazing place to work,2021-06-27,5.0,Senior Customer Success Manager,"The people are incredible, as is the work/life balance. HubSpot is an incredible place to work.",Major ambiguity around the role and very little control over your own metrics. Lacking innovation/creativity and there's a lot of red tape to do/try anything now in a meaningful way given the size of the organization.
245,HubSpot,As Good As You Would Expect,2021-07-22,5.0,Senior Marketing Manager,"Leadership regularly listens to feedback and employee surveys, ensuring they are taking care of the needs of their team.",I don't have any at this time.
246,HubSpot,Decent company,2021-10-04,4.0,Software Engineer,"Work life balance
Well established platform to build upon for product teams","Pay is low compared to other companies
401k match is terrible
Transition from startup to enterprise level company has major growing pains"
247,HubSpot,Very Close to being the shining example of corporate America,2021-06-24,4.0,Program Manager,"HubSpot really walks the walks in so many ways with their values and follow through. I particularly appreciate and adore the DI&B efforts at this company. I find that top down transparency is better than anywhere else I have worked. I have psychological safety in the workplace with my team. There is really not much that HubSpot does wrong. Unlimited Paid Time Off is a perk that workers actually use, with the exception of Sales, really. The flexibility to work remotely is wonderful and modernizing with the times. My VERY favorite thing about HubSpot is their focus on mental health and their willingness to put their employees first in much more tangible ways. In 2021, they announced their first ever week of rest in which the entire company will take a week off to combat the burnout we have felt from the pandemic.

Moving around this company once you are in is incredibly easy to do and nearly everyone does it. This is a huge bonus. Get your foot in the door and move around!","The biggest let down of HubSpot has been discovering some gender pay gap issues. The lack of salary transparency has proven to be because there are equity differences they are not proud of- not just by gender gap but amongst people with the same roles. With all of the values and follow through that HubSpot gets right, this feels like a massive and important miss. I think that there is an opportunity for HubSpot to get radical with their salary transparency and become an industry trend setter. The core values of HubSpot don't agree with this issue being allowed to continue. 

There is also a shocking amount of disorganization that was acceptable as such a small company, but with this huge and rapid growth, the systems needed to keep up. I will say they are absolutely doing the work to make improvements across all departments, but anyone who comes from equally large companies over to HubSpot WILL be shocked."
248,HubSpot,Great company,2021-07-26,5.0,Channel Account Manager,"Great leadership, with a really great product that works. Really great benefits as well.","I think for a more senior sales role, the pay is a bit low."

- Timely compensation reviews (they increase your compensation per market basis, in addition to per performance basis)
- No doors policy
- You'll feel like a person, not a number
- You're valued as you are, and feel like you belong

- This role is hard, so it's not for everyone. Don't expect to slide by doing the minimum. If you take pride in your work, you'll succeed here.
- As of spring 2020, starting salary is 40k a year, which some people don't like.
- The product knowledge can be exhausting. You're not expected to know everything, but it's still a challenge. Just remember to relax, breathe, and do your best. Management understands and sees you as a human."
255,HubSpot,A dream,2021-07-25,5.0,Inbound Success Coach,The company really lives its values - HubSpot is a dream.,Literally none - keep it up. I love it here.
256,HubSpot,Amazing place to work that walks the walk,2020-07-21,5.0,Assistant General Counsel,"I can't say enough about how proud I am to be a HubSpotter...and that's even more true now after management's transparent and thoughtful responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and the current events involving Black Lives Matter. We have a executive leadership team that truly cares about the company and puts a ton of time and energy into making HubSpot a great place to work, a great place to be a customer, a great place to partner, etc. During the pandemic, the executive leadership team hosted ongoing ""Ask Me Anything"" sessions for the whole company to literally ask them anything. It ranges from daily exercise habits to tough questions on how we're handling certain situations...and it's just amazing to see a leadership team this transparent and honest with its employees. It makes so many of us proud to work here and to be a part of a company that will truly leave its mark in the tech landscape. I'm also endlessly proud to have a CEO that truly understands the importance of having strong women on his executive leadership team and on his board of directors. This is all on top of the usual perks that come with a tech company (coffee bar, smoothie bar, on-site gym, glorious, stocked kitchens, etc...)...but those perks pale in comparison to the real heart underlying HubSpot.",Every company has some things that could be better...but those are largely outweighed by all the pros at HubSpot.
257,HubSpot,"Wonderful people, strong culture, lovely place",2020-10-23,5.0,Software Engineer,"HubSpot is renowned for its culture. The great reviews on here may seem somewhat forced, but they're truly evidence of years of hard work by an amazing People Ops team led by Katie Burke. I was skeptical coming in that it would not live up to its hype, but I've been very surprised that even during Covid-19 and the subsequent shift in our working environment, I still feel excited and happy to ""come in"" to work every day. I feel like my work is valued, and I feel like my time is respected (my hours are flexible and I don't feel forced to work when it isn't necessary). I'm working with some amazing people and I can't wait to see what the next few years are like!","Onboarding was a bit difficult during Covid-19 and I was disappointed by it. I didn't feel like it necessarily helped prepare me for the job, and it was more focused on Marketing & Sales values and concepts rather than the granular parts of the company (i.e. engineering, finance, etc.)"
258,HubSpot,Company is set up well for the next phase,2020-08-25,5.0,Strategy,"HubSpot is set up well for it's next chapter of growth. 

The company has been able to evolve from a Marketing hub + fully inside sales model to a full growth suite + freemium go-to-market that sets a strong foundation for the next 5 to 10 years. To get there, HubSpot has taken a strong build-oriented approach that stands in stark contrast to some of its peers. It's exciting to watch the pace and quality of the innovation coming from that group. 

Adding Yamini as the Chief Customer Officer has been a great fit both in terms of leadership style and experience. 

Finally, Katie Burke as our Chief People Office has navigated us through the pandemic and shift to remote work better and more smoothly than I could have imagined. She's an inspirational leader for HubSpot and we're lucky to have her. 

Exciting times ahead.","As with any company, as HubSpot grows and scales it needs to reinvent itself and its operating system. Sometimes those changes come with speedbumps -- either because there is fog around a specific decision, or the systems aren't read to handle a change. HubSpot has been good at owning those, and course-correcting quickly -- but it will happen."
259,HubSpot,Great company with tons more room for growth!,2021-07-21,5.0,Sales,Great culture and leadership team,None that I could think of
260,HubSpot,Build resilience,2021-06-10,5.0,Customer Support Specialist,"The culture, the people, unlimited time off",Very weak training. It is a huge platform and the new hires start taking cases with very little training.
261,HubSpot,After 3 months at HubSpot,2021-06-07,5.0,Software Engineer,"Hubspot values its employees the same way it values its customers. They are always on top of making employees life better.

Their response to everything in 2020 (Covid, BLM, etc) has been quick and extremely empathetic. They truly recognize that their employees are human beings at the end of the day - and in doing so, we're able to do our best to produce our best work.","The job itself can be a grind, but if you're willing to be open and honest with your manager, they will always listen and do what they can to make sure you're supported."

265,HubSpot,"HubSpot is what you make of it, with a high floor and an even higher ceiling",2021-03-01,5.0,Senior Product Analyst,"HubSpot is great. HubSpot is weird. HubSpot is great because it is weird. You're afforded more responsibility and potential for career growth than perhaps is reasonable, but it's what you make of it. You, the employee, will be afforded numerous opportunities to excel. I get to work with extremely qualified yet approachable leadership at an extremely successful company (and I might even make an impact from time to time). I'm just some rando. I don't get it, but I'll roll with it. All of which is to say, ""I feel lucky I work at HubSpot,"" and ""I enjoy my job."" It's been and still is an incredible ride.","You get out what you put in. HubSpot is flexible. If you want to focus on yourself and maintain strong barriers between yourself and work - you can do that. If you want to go all-in and work all the time - well, you can do that too. That said, the example set by leadership definitely points toward the latter as the preferred employee behavior.

HubSpot's culture is great, but it's also all sorts of idiosyncratic. I find it endearing and I enjoy navigating it. I can understand how others might want something more structured or quote-unquote ""normal."""
266,HubSpot,So impressed with Onboarding!,2020-06-15,5.0,Sales Enablement,"Culture is taken more seriously than anything else. Day one, we were told unequivocally that Black Lives Matter, that they understand they have work to do internally and need to do better at helping externally, and they are amplifying the voices of their BIPOC consistently. They take Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging extremely seriously as both a part of their culture as well as their business model. I've never been so impressed with a company's transparency and I am only one week in. The benefits are largely standard, but their unlimited paid time off policy is not a trap like many companies. I've heard several leaders say things like ""you should try to make sure you take AT LEAST a week total per quarter"" or ""we have mandatory mental health days."" They pay much more fairly than several prominent tech companies in the area. They have incredible remote capabilities that have made them very versatile and ready for Covid-19. I have no doubts that they will be at the front of leading the world into the new normal of corporate business and saas.","I don't know of any at this time. I know that it's not perfect, but I love that they will say that and are actively working to adapt themselves. Onboarding is exhausting, but it should be calmer after that period."

- HubSpot's internal resources are impressive (Diversity trainings, product trainings) 
- A fun software with a lot of possibilities to use internally and with your clients 
- Internal software process is CLEAN - they continue to put a lot of thought in logging just enough data to measure you but not slow you down too much. 
- Great job communicating company roadmap and decisions from top level management
- An amazing place to glean some leadership best practices at all levels 
- HubSpot handled setting up its employees for remote work really well
- They say there's a “a lot of autonomy"" but you'll be so busy you need not worry about this","- The people are amazing, but this role / team does not have a lot of bandwidth to connect across the team. It's easy to feel isolated.
- Onboarding specialists are overworked and underpaid. You can make more money at smaller tech companies - this job is a great way to get your foot in the door in saas implementation and learn a bunch of different business processes. 
- Calls 6-7 hours a day with customers, staying up to date on products in your 'spare time', and contributing to the ""hubspot community"" or else you don't get to be a part of it
- There were so many amazing ERGs at HubSpot but I was so exhausted and frustrated from my day to day I couldn't take advantage of them
- This experience reminded me way too much of college ie. take responsibility for all of your own work, get assigned more than is realistic, participate, make connections as much as you can, but you will be only be rewarded if you're tan extremely high achiever
- There's not enough bandwidth to go above and beyond for most or even half of your customers
- Big company that demands small start up grit without the small start up perks (compensation, internal growth, independent projects, connecting deeply with your customers)
- Lack of support for troubleshooting questions about the product"
281,HubSpot,Lives Up To The Hype,2020-09-08,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"HubSpot has a fantastic reputation that is well-deserved. Having worked at a few companies (both in and out of the tech space) prior to coming to HubSpot, I can truly say I hope to never leave. 

A few standouts for me:

- Transparency. From the C-Suite down, everyone at HubSpot is open to sharing information, collecting and actioning feedback, and owning up to growth opportunities. 
- Customers. As a CSM, much of my time is spent working directly with HubSpot. My customers are fun and challenging to work with, and I've grown as a consultant in my time here.
- Work-Life Balance. I'm encouraged to take time when I need to, and leadership practices what they preach here. It's helpful to see everyone take time when they need it, as that reinforces the intention behind benefits like unlimited vacation.
- COVID-19 Response. You can't leave a review in 2020 without mentioning COVID, right? The support leadership has shown through thoughtful programs, WFH reimbursement, and flexibility has been next level.",Internal mobility within the CSM org can feel rigid at times.

There seems to be an expectation of excellence without any guidance for growth, and in some product teams, the product managers have all the power. Design leaders will side with them in conflicts and didn't seem to listen to feedback. The worst part was the condescending attitude from some higher up design leaders. It does not allow for growth in a design career on some teams. There doesn't seem to be a sense of psychological safety.

I was a little nervous when we all started working from home, but I've been so pleasantly surprised at how mindful and amazing our leadership team has been. From all the precautions they took right away, to how quickly they have been able to adapt and shift given the circumstances, to the fact that no matter what our well being has been top of mind. I'm really excited about the new remote options, and grateful for the flex option that is being provided.",The main con being in sales is the monthly quota vs. a quarterly quota.

There's an interesting slack channel there called ""politispot"", which became fueled by emotional rage/hate. You'll see comments in there like ""Alabama shouldn't even be a state"". ""All Trump supporters are racist"", or ""My cousin/sister/dad is a Trump supporter, I don't know how to react..."" with everyone agreeing or not objecting to them. Most of the articles that were posted were essentially click-bait headlines that just riled up everyone's emotions even more. 

Hubspot brought the outside political environment into work. Oddly enough, most if not all of the folks there are totally fine with blanket statements calling a group of people racist, re-training for white people, and other concerning behaviors. Unfortunately, Hubspot still retains its cult-like reputation that was highlighted in the book ""Disrupted"". Perhaps, even more disturbingly so."
302,HubSpot,Best Company to Work For!,2021-04-27,5.0,Customer Support Specialist,"Great culture that is based around diversity, inclusion, and work-life balance","I'm writing this con because it is required to complete the review, in truth there are no cons to working here."
303,HubSpot,"Super welcoming, makes you feel like you found your people",2020-01-15,5.0,User Experience Researcher,"No pressure to ""know everything"" - I was eased into my product area and my skill area with a ton of resources.
You wonder if everyone is a happiness droid and realize very quickly - no, everyone is just super nice and smart and willing to listen to you and help you
Flexibility - You are in control of yourself and if you need the morning to get some personal stuff done, do it. If you need to work remote b/c you miss your dog, do it. It's very liberating to work in an environment that values your independence and doesn't ask questions about it - you are responsible to get your own work done and b/c I don't have people questioning my work habits, I feel more empowered and energized to deliver better work for the team and our customers.
It's a vibrant place to work and interact. There's an energy here.","It can be chaotic at times but honestly, I think this shows that there's a lot happening here. People are open to reflection and if you have an idea, you can run with it. That is empowering. But b/c everyone has ideas and can run with them - it can be challenging to figure out which thing to dive into - choice paradox... That being said, I will gladly take on this challenge to get the pros"
304,HubSpot,A culture of learning,2020-10-28,5.0,Product Expert,"HubSpot has truly allowed me to learn on the job. I started in customer support (entry level HubSpotter) with a liberal arts degree and no tech knowledge. The job had its stress--answering customer calls without even knowing the platform--but there are great processes and resources set up to make sure you get the help you need. Now, I truly enjoy the troubleshooting I get to do, have time to take the free coding classes, and work with incredible people.","The onboarding process for support specialists feels like building the airplane while flying it. You learn on the job, which can be stressful at times, but after ~5 months you get to the other side of the curve and can really invest in learning how software works."

- Ability to get involved in projects outside of your direct team.","Not much of a con since it's not out of the norm office politics. It can be tough to grow into a role unless you have an advocate in the company. Some can move quickly into higher impact roles depending on the mentor they can find that takes them under their wing (outside of direct manager). However, a lot of this has to do with good timing which is outside of the control of the individual."

1) A larger number of long term employees than most tech companies. Shows up by way of limited experience and perspective outside of HubSpot. 
2) Diversity is not where it needs to be but HubSpot is working hard everyday to improve this.
3) Lots of Wiki pages and maybe too reliant on Wiki for communicating"

- Supportive of different people's work-life balance. 
- Frequent company and team AMAs, especially since COVID
- Lots of support, merit, and acknowledgement if you're an engineer, PM, or designer within the product org. Other roles, not at all.
- People do care about movements such as BLM, mental health, COVID","- Prides themselves on the HubSpot culture code (HEART), but HubSpot really isn't ""Humble"". The product team has a very marketing-esque (with cheering) monthly meeting. And there's a lot of hype to promote HubSpot. Humble? Not the slightest.
- No visibility into salary bands and career growth. (Hint - not Transparent; re: T in the culture code). Other tech companies do this better. 
- Promotions and seniority is inconsistent throughout the organization. Product org keeps changing and they promote unqualified people to management roles, but are slow to promote others.
- WAY TOO much change. 
- Benefits don't match up to other tech companies (pre-COVID)
- Product teams often don't communicate, or do so after the fact.
- Performance review cycle is inconsistent for roles. It's not ""peer"" feedback when that feedback is optional."

The product is getting really good, and the people are great to work with. 

Additionally, it’s a company that generally encourages you to just be a better person - from the Culture Code to recent programming teaching how to be anti-racist - cultural initiatives arent just standard corporate lip service.","There’s recently been a lot of external management hiring, focusing on ‘those who have seen the movie’. This works for executive hiring, but there’s been less of a focus on upward promotion as many orgs have stayed quite flat, while externally hired managers have had mixed success."

315,HubSpot,Worst job I could ever imagine,2020-12-08,2.0,Sales,Great company and great product that everyone wants. Supported employees with $1000 each during Covid to work from home,"I took a 50% pay cut from my last two sales roles to take this job, because they completely sold me on this job being fun, exciting, low stress, and a great atmosphere. None of that is remotely true. 

This job is a constant marathon that you can't ever finish. I wake up every day miserable, wake up all throughout the night in anxiety sweats and panicking about work the next morning. I haven't had a minute where I have felt good or confident about this job since I started. The numbers are too high, and the expectations are ridiculous. Starting this job remotely has been a nightmare. 

If I stay in this role I will have a heart attack in the next year or two. It is absolutely ruining my relationship. I am so stressed out that I snap at my loved ones who are just trying to help. 

I feel completely trapped here because of COVID, and would love nothing more an another option. Any other option. I would gladly cut my pay in half AGAIN to have any semblance of quality of life. One of these days I will drop dead at this desk, and HubSpot will fill my seat with another.

I refuse to refer anyone to HubSpot as I firmly believe taking a role at HubSpot is the worst move anyone in sales could make for their careers. Before HubSpot, I lived every day with joy and energy and passion. My life has been utterly awful since starting this job. HubSpot has sucked every last ounce of life out of me."

317,HubSpot,The Gold Standard,2020-07-22,5.0,Marketing Director,"Since the day that I started at HubSpot I have been both challenged and trusted to do my job well. Leaders across the organization have consistently invested in me and my career, allowing me to become more confident in myself and my ability to run a successful team.

I have worked in tech for years, and I have never seen the type of transparency that HubSpot celebrates every day. The company will not shy away from addressing topics of concern, and does the work to support our employees through employee resource groups, external resources and beyond.

Tech can be known for job hopping, but I am definitely not leaving anytime soon. I have never doubted my ability to continue to grow and learn at HubSpot.","Being an external candidate, hired directly into a management role was intimidating. Often times in decks & internal resources acronyms and historical references make it hard to get onboarded independently without having to ask for clarity.

I'd encourage employees to think back to their first day, and create internal resources that are digestible no matter how long you have been working at HubSpot."
318,HubSpot,"Stimulating, fun work environment with great work-life balance",2019-12-11,5.0,Senior Product Designer,"Working at HubSpot has been a challenging, fun, and rewarding experience. I can honestly say I've learned so much in just the 1.5 years I've been here, and I've met some great people along the way.

Management really listens to you and gives you honest, constructive feedback that you can put into action to grow your career. They've put a lot of energy into building out their IC track for designers—which is much appreciated since not everyone wants to grow into a management role. 

They also care a lot about work-life balance and are always ready to revisit priorities when things get a little too busy. From day one, I've seen this commitment from leadership when they hired me as a remote employee after I expressed a desire to stay near family. They care about their employees and have invested in technology that makes it easy to stay connected, even when you're far away.

If you want to work for a company where you can travel, meet amazing people (I'm literally wowed by how talented my coworkers are on a regular basis), have a lot of good laughs and make some really great software, this is the place for you.","HubSpot values and empowers individual teams to have autonomy in how they approach their work. This is awesome, but as we continue to scale, has resulted in some challenges. We need more systems in place to help teams maintain a level of autonomy, but also stay aligned with other teams."

Still a market leader (although gap is narrowing).,"Don't let Glassdoor reviews fool you, this is a corporate sales environment and you are just another book of business. Wish the company showed the same level of compassion to their employees that they did to their customers and prospects during COVID. 

If you want to drive change within a company and truly stand out, this is not the place. Tenured AE's are there for a reason - they got in when HubSpot was still a scrappy startup and they've made a truckload of money after the IPO.

I’m so thrilled I got hired here, it’s finally a company that doesn’t treat you like just another number. My on boarding process was great, and I’m impressed with the organization and resources available to employees. With that being said, it’s not an easy job and you will feel overwhelmed with the product knowledge and tons of information you need to get accustomed to.

Depending on your previous skills you might have an advantage if you know design and css well, SEO, worked with analytics before , have ever run a blog and know about networking (DNS, domain management, redirects etc). These are all possible cases you have to troubleshoot and prior knowledge will make life easier for you.

My own portal to test features and use the product is a definite Pro - how awesome is that?

Tip: Take advantage of the courses in the academy, these are free for everyone. Continue to grow your knowledge and don’t let the pressure get to you. Don’t sacrifice your work life balance, cut your lunch short etc. even if you may not reach your goal.

- Absolute micro-management
- Since they try to show off that they have the best culture, the only way they can do the opposite is by being passive-aggressive. Leads retract on their own statements and have partial and targeted behavior. Giving a code review at midnight and expecting it to be addressed the next day before 8 am meeting. Since they are easily replaceable, they have an incentive in setting you up for a failure.
- Doing the same work every day (this is true for most teams). You cannot change the teams until a year if you do not like the work. And even after a year, you are at the mercy of the reviews of the same people you are trying to get away from to change the team.
- If you are smarter than your superiors, you are absolutely screwed (when I say seniors, they can be the same age as you or even younger, since they can make anyone a TL)
- WFH is a joke. I am scrutinized even if I take lunch break more than half hour, or fail to reply to slack within 5 minutes. Really wish we were in office because I can at least go to the bathroom and may not be perceived as underperforming or just not attentive to work.
- Adhering to best software practices is a forgotten thing

I have survived for some time now but under absolute torture. No use reaching out to higher level management because the person higher up the food chain always wins. You cannot show the truth, if everyone hates it. Do not know when they will fire me, but expecting it sooner rather than later because this has happened to numerous other people., in the same way."

HubSpot has been accommodating as a remote employee, my manager has encouraged me to focus on my family when I need to, and the planning from an executive level has provided me comfort during an uncomfortable time.

I have felt for a long time that HubSpot has been the best thing to happen to my career, but 2020 has solidified that in ways that I couldn't imagine.","Some might view this as a pro, but things move FAST.

Although we have the opportunity to work from home as much as we want, I find that coming to work reenergizes me because we are all focused on a central vision, to make the customer happy. Shoutout to our leaders for maintaining the culture even as we continue to grow at a fast pace. 

The company is at a stage where it is really able to invest in systems to help alleviate pain points that could be solved with automation. It helps make the work we do more impactful instead of making us feel like we're toiling away on administrative tasks. 

Management practices what it preaches in terms of unlimited vacation and work/life balance. It really makes a difference when your director tells you that unless you have extremely critical work (which my team rarely does) you should be taking at least 2 weeks off at the end of the year in addition to time off during the rest of the year. They are also very flexible and understanding that there is a life outside of work. I appreciate the encouragement to make work fit around your life instead of the other way around.","There are some growing pains since the company is growing so quickly. Management is used to moving very quickly, but it might be time to slow down and invest in systems and processes instead of barreling forward and troubleshooting later."

357,HubSpot,Amazing culture and leadership,2020-10-13,5.0,User Experience Researcher,"I cannot say enough about HubSpot's culture & leadership. I am continously impressed and feel grateful to work here. 
 
- Customer centric: leadership and product truly care about customers and making the best experiences for them. Leadership (CEO, CTO etc) constantly appreciate engineering as well as UX efforts and trust employees/teams to design the tools for our customers. Leadership makes an effort to highlight customers and learn from them 

- Amazing leadership: Leadership treats you as a human first, an employee second. Obviously they want you to get your work done, but they are empathetic (especially in these times) and build out a culture that invests in employees and gives them the support, education & programming they need to be successful 

- Transparent/Thoughtful crisis response: It's no secret that 2020 has been an insanely hard year for many. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, leadership has given regular updates and kept employees in the know about what is happening. That's no small feat, given we are a global organization and countries are all making different decisions. They did not shy away from tough conversations, and were transparent with us in all of their plans on how to move through this time. They are ahead of the curve in announcing what the future of work will look like post-pandemic, and giving multiple options to employees so each person can freely choose what is best for them. On top of that, with the social justice issues we are facing specifically in the US, leadership has taken a strong and necessary stance on investing in DI&B efforts (not just saying they will, but highlighting their action plan, reporting on diversity hiring etc) and standing by Black employees during these painful times. We have a new required training around racism in the US, they have made donations to the Equal Justice Initiative and more. HubSpot is actively trying to help employees be better people and make our communities better for everyone. They acknowledge that they still have more work to do. 

I was at a previous company for a number of years, that I had loved, but it was my first job out of college. Coming to HubSpot opened my eyes to what true leadership is, what it looks like when companies actively invest in employees, and what it means to be a socially conscious company.","HubSpot is a large company and our Product team is enormous (which is also a good thing!). Sometimes things move quickly, or change, and it can be easy to be siloed or not have all of the information. This is a challenge, but honestly does not impact my feeling on HubSpot overall. I also think this is something our teams can be equipped to work through"

It's the only company I've worked for that has a surprising lack of jerks--that has to do with a carefully cultivated culture and the way that the founders/executive team think and the company is structured. The benefits are significant, but the most important, in my mind, is the unlimited vacation, flexible work possibilities, free books, great medical, and the perk of being able to use the software for personal use--which is super powerful if you have a side hustle. And that side hustle? It's supported and encouraged. Having happy, fulfilled employees make for better employees, and they get that.  Oh, and it's a phenomenal tech company for women with over 50% of their workforce identifies as female.","Salaries trend lower than at other tech companies. This has happened because most employees are hired at a young age and work their way up through the company so they don't need to be as competitive. In particular, salaries may be difficult to swallow for older Boston high tech workers (and it may be harder to compete with younger candidates for jobs for that reason--most of the managers are not that long in their careers), but it's worth a shot, because the cool work, great managers/colleagues and the benefits DEFINITELY may offset that con for you."

- Very accommodating to various work/lifestyles.
- If something is important it’ll get done quickly and by the best of the best.","- HubSpot is *constantly* changing.
— It often feels weird to celebrate milestones because everyone outside of your team already forgot what you were doing and why it was important... onto the next thing.
— Leadership team is pretty ruthless about who they have in what position at a given stage of growth. If you’ve grown with the company for a while and you’re a Director or above and you’re not networking and doing homework on how the last company that successfully navigated this upcoming growth phase figured it out for your area of responsibility, you had better watch out."

367,HubSpot,Culture,2019-10-11,5.0,Software Engineer,"I really like the emphasis HubSpot has made on making an inclusive and belonging environment. Compared to everywhere else I've worked, the company seems so much more accepting of people with a variety of expressions, backgrounds, and experiences. Management also acknowledges that there is always room for improvement (and continues to take action to improve). There are many opportunities to get involved in DI&B initiatives.

There are a lot of perks like free food, dogs in the office, an onsite gym, working from home, and expensed team outings. I also view my coworkers as friends.

My manager keeps my career growth in mind, and I receive clear and actionable feedback to work towards an eventual promotion. I also have a lot of independence to determine my own schedule/hours and the projects I would like to work on.

Initially, I was skeptical of the Unlimited Vacation policy, but I have had no difficulty taking time off. My manager suggested taking off about 4 weeks per year + holidays which is more than what other companies I looked at offer for my role. I can also extend holidays by working remotely.","As HubSpot has grown, the culture and hubspotlife has not fully scaled. For example, the new office expansions (1C and 10C) have substantially fewer amenities and a much less social atmosphere than the main buildings. It's also been harder to sign up for traditions like Mystery Dinner and company outings.

For software engineers, the work-life balance and burden of being on call can very greatly depending on the team. For example, some teams are almost never paged, while others are paged multiple times a day."

412,HubSpot,Supporting of employees during  uncertain times,2020-07-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've never been more proud to work at HubSpot than the last six months. In a time when the world is wildly uncertain and scary, HubSpot has gone above and beyond to communicate, be transparent, and support not only employees, but their families, our customers, partners and larger community. It's pretty rare you find an employer of this size able to adapt to the times, and be so understanding and empathetic of people's situations.","There's some lack of clarity around career growth, but I do know that it's in the works to better map it out for our department so people have a clear idea of what it takes to get to the next level."
413,HubSpot,A rare company that goes above and beyond for employees and customers,2020-08-21,5.0,Product Design Manager,"When I first came to HubSpot, I worked as a Product Designer on a team with a Product Manager who had been at HubSpot for five years. I couldn't believe how excited they were about the team and company mission. I was skeptical that someone who'd been at a company for five years could still be so animated about it. After all, it's only a matter of time before cynicism creeps in at every company, right? HubSpot is different. The culture they preach is one everyone truly lives by. Not just in the good times, but also the bad. The times I've seen HubSpot's integrity on display is during times of crisis, where tough decisions had to be made with real tradeoffs. Time and again, HubSpot's leaders have always come back to the core values of being humble, empathetic, adaptable, remarkable, and transparent. HubSpot's executives think for the long term, and it shows in every decision they make.

For me, HubSpot has been a place to learn and grow more than any place I've been. I've benefited enormously from so many opportunities to shape various parts of the product as the company has grown. Because autonomy is so core to HubSpot, I've always felt I can make a difference, even as we've grown larger.

I have two young kids, and HubSpot has been an ideal balance between an energizing pace of work, and the flexibility to be present with my family now - not later when they're all grown up.

I'm a big believer that impact at work isn't dependent on your physical location. Thankfully that aligns with HubSpot's believes as well, which allowed me to move from Boston to Orlando, FL, to be closer to family while continuing to grow my career. I'm grateful to HubSpot's commitment to remote work, not as just an option, but as a way of life that HubSpot fully embraces. That commitment benefits me personally, but is also good for diversity, inclusion, and internal mobility.

After two years of beginning a remote manager, managing up to 10 people with a mix of folks in the US headquarters, our Dublin office, and remote locations, I can say I've been able to have just as much of an impact as I would have in the Cambridge office. The company has invested heavily in the technology to make global work a smooth experience. Recently, they've also doubled down on the culture of remote work to make sure its the norm, not an afterthought that privileges hallway conversations at HQ.  Our approach has been thoughtful - accomodating a range of needs folks have and avoiding a dogmatic position on either extreme of office-only or remote-only policies.

As a UXer at HubSpot, you'll meet folks with a range of incredible talents, all with a humble attitude. Everyone wants to do their best work, solve real problems for customers, and enjoy working with each other while they do it.

Being at HubSpot is the best thing that's happened in my career and has been a huge benefit to my family. I'm grateful for the experience and see a lot of promise still ahead. HubSpot is just getting started with a strong strategy and thoughtful leadership at the helm. It's the people that make it so special, so you should come along for the ride.","At our size, we're a little behind on scaling our systems and operations. This creates friction and can take away time from focusing on customers and product strategy. That said, I see signs we'll continue to invest here and we'll catch up as the company matures.

Our DNA of small-autonomous teams has kept us nimble. The tradeoff is a structure that makes the execution of a smooth, cross-platform UX a challenge.

We have a ways to go on hiring a more diverse team and retaining those we hire. However, I'm continually impressed by the long term thinking and deep commitment of everyone in the company to make systemic changes that will last over the long haul. We're not looking for PR, we're looking for real durable changes we can make."

424,HubSpot,Grow with HubSpot,2020-08-22,5.0,Senior Engineering Manager,"It is an incredible feeling to work for a company with a true growth mindset. There will always be growth opportunities for the company and its engineering organization, but the company has great leadership, especially in people ops, to ensure we smartly grow from those opportunities. Even the company culture code has changed in my time at HubSpot to put greater weight on empathy.

The product/engineering values, like the culture code, are powerful and accurately reflect the technical culture and how to be successful within it. There are high expectations for the performance and growth of engineers. The result of those high expectations is a group of very smart people working together to solve hard customer problems with a large amount of autonomy. There is autonomy at the team level to decide what customer problems to solve and at the individual level for how to best solve for the problems. Everyone has a lot of flexibility over when and where they do their best work or to take a break using the unlimited vacation.

The company seamlessly made the transition to full-time remote during the quarantine. They provide resources and requested lots of feedback to ensure that management and onboarding can be as successful in this new environment. Once the pandemic ends, I am thankful for the ability to choose to work full-time remote or be ""flexible"" and only go in a few times a week without any pressure on which option to choose, and instead be able to make the decision that works best for myself and my family.","The technical culture will not be a great fit for everyone. There is intentionally no dedicated QA or ops teams. That requires engineers to take full ownership of their code and have a solid understanding of our customers. Writing code can be the easiest part of the development lifecycle for customer-focused engineering teams. Because of the company's size, fewer problems can be solved by engineers in isolation. It is hard to be successful with poor communication skills. The small, autonomous team model can hit friction when coordinating across teams or groups."

Orders don't come down from executives -- the teams decide what they want to do and how to do it, start to finish, on their own terms. You of course get direction and insight from people higher up, but engineers, product managers, designers, and business stakeholders all work together in autonomous teams to make things happen. As a software engineer, your work is always high impact, and you get to shape how your team operates.","Especially now, certain parts of the org are feeling some growing pains that come from scaling up.

443,HubSpot,Can't imagine a better place to learn and grow...,2020-07-21,5.0,Customer Success,"I joined HubSpot ~2 years ago. I was doing a weekly M-F commute from Boston to Seattle and finally decided I couldn't stomach being away from my family and two young daughters anymore. A mutual friend connected me with the leadership team, I got to know folks, and went to Inbound 2017 --- when customers started chest bumping at the product announcements I knew it was something to pay attention to. I took the role and have never (ever) been happier. It's truly a very special place. During the ""interview process"" (which felt more like meeting new, really interesting and smart friends), outsiders commented that 'people make HubSpot great.' With two years under my belt, I'd say that's very true. Don't get me wrong, the tech is amazing too. But, HubSpot's magic is in the culture and community that the founders, leadership team, and every HubSpotter has created. It's an extremely supportive environment and there's an ever-present focus on learning and growing. While past roles have helped me develop my technical and/or functional expertise, my time at HubSpot has taught me about *real* people leadership -- not just in a textbook sense, but in a real world, practical sense. Putting people first, truly VALUING diversity and the unique backgrounds and perspectives that each HubSpotter brings to work every day, leading with HEART.... these are invaluable lessons not just about work, but about people, about life. I'm extremely grateful every day for the opportunity to work with such an amazing team, amazing customers, and an amazing network of partners. Thank you, HubSpot!","HubSpotters are very eager to help millions of organizations grow better (our mission). Add to that everyone's commitment to professional development -- to doing and being better -- and there's usually a fair amount going on. Overall, this is good but can sometimes feel like there's a lot going on."

However, your teams want you to succeed so don't hesitate asking for guidance and tips on getting organized when starting."
445,HubSpot,"Super strong product and engineering, scale-up organizational challenges",2019-10-16,4.0,Software Engineering Manager,"Strong and inclusive culture, very smart people, lots of autonomy and trust granted instantly across all roles in the organization. If you are looking for your next technical challenge, HubSpot is a great place to be, and the challenges are getting bigger and bigger as the company scales up.

Fabulous platform support. You'll probably never work anywhere else that has bespoke CI/CD tools that are as polished and reliable as HubSpot's. Developing software at HubSpot is a truly fulfilling experience... If you like Java.

Top notch executive team. Brian Halligan is probably one of the most customer-centric CEOs in Boston, and Dharmesh Shah is a CTO able to operate at every level from dreaming the big dreams to writing the SQL queries himself.","Not unusual to scale-up organizations, HubSpot has some rough edges around role alignment when hiring externally, promotion paths across the technical and leadership boundary, and sometimes suffers from the downsides of a massively decoupled product org consisting of hundreds of small teams empowered to run fast in the direction they choose.

By and large it is working for them, and there are alignment processes in place that get the job done where it matters, but be on the lookout for pockets of unchecked chaos, or unexpected feedback."
446,HubSpot,It's All About That Balance,2019-10-24,5.0,People Operations,"I joined HubSpot when we were a small startup and have been here to see the company flourish and scale while still remaining committed to elevating culture (it's been a LONG time since I wrote a Glassdoor review!). Culture at HS goes far beyond the benefits and perks and is truly about the people. – One aspect of the culture that has been meaningful to me most recently is how much the company supports working parents and the flexibility needed to make your personal and professional life work. - We welcomed our first baby to our family last year and going out on leave and completely disconnecting is a really scary feeling. My colleagues, manager and broader People Ops team were overwhelmingly supportive in helping me prepare and even more so leading up to my return.  

Don’t get me wrong – you’ll work hard at HubSpot, REALLY hard. – This place is demanding, but the work you do will be fulfilling and you can create your own career path (within reason) if you are a consistently strong performer and seek out the right mentorship. The company also fosters continuous learning and will never be complacent in building balanced teams that align with the company’s customer centric mission.","no more unblended fruit offered*

If you give too much of yourself to your customers and your work, you'll risk stretching yourself thin & left carrying the workload of others who are working the system. 

There's a swath of middle-management (across the company) who tripped upwards in the early growth and are difficult to take seriously.

I have truly never felt like there was a more inclusive, comfortable, and supportive environment to do your best work in. 

I think my favorite part is that all new hires, regardless of their department or title, complete a week-and-a-half of company and product training. It truly bonds your new hire class together and makes sure that everyone is on the same page for why HubSpot works like it does and how they are solving for their mission.

Obviously, all of the other reviews will talk about the benefits, perks, flexibility, etc. The best part is that it's all true and using the flexibility to work remotely or take time as you need it is not only allowed but actively encouraged.

As a backend SWE straight out of college working for HubSpot for about 8 months now I want to point out my most important pros so far so I can help other college students make an informed decision

1. You will learn, and you will learn a lot. HubSpot doesn't just have a great culture, it has an advanced technology stack. The code base is very new (even at its oldest points) and we utilize a vast array of technology.  Your resume will be very impressive after being here for just a year. Your bosses are very supportive, and will make sure you are learning from every pull request, and every mistake. You're encouraged to take your time and develop your skills, I have never felt like I wasn't being supported by my team during my ramp up process. Everyone around you is very intelligent, and you're able to just absorb information and knowledge. You'll get a bunch of different opinions (HubSpot engineers are very passionate), and it'll be up to you to draw conclusions and decide what the best path forward is. You learn by doing, and you do a lot here. 

2. The infrastructure is state of the art. Unless you're on the dev ops/infra team (bless them), you won't have to worry about deploying/scaling/monitoring your teams' service, it just happens automagically. Your team has a mission that is well defined, and you will pretty much only be writing code that adds direct value to that mission. This allows teams to iterate very quickly, and is honestly one of my favorite things about working here.

3. Autonomy. You will absolutely not be micro managed. Do you think this new technology that just came out will help the team? You have the freedom  to pursue that.  There is no set work schedule, nobody to track your hours, if you're executing and doing your work effectively, how you manage your time is up to you (meetings are generally from 11 AM - 3 PM from what I've seen).

4. The relationships between product managers and software engineers is absolutely phenomenal. All product managers I've worked with are surprisingly technical, and understand that what may seems simple to the lay man, may actually not be quite so simple, and will respect our estimates and feedback. The product managers also do a great job communicating what the customer pains are, and are a great bridge between us and the customers. I always feel like the work I'm doing has a purpose, and is directly adding value to the company, and this is largely thanks to the wonderful PMs we have. 

5. Wide variety of roles. We have backend/front end teams. Within those teams we have dev ops, infrastructure, platform teams etc etc. You have the freedom to pursue what you're most interested in and where you take your career is really up to you.","Experiences may vary from team to team. Sometimes the infrastructure is too ""magical"", meaning it can be tricky to grasp and understand."
476,HubSpot,H-E-A-R-T,2020-07-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"HubSpot truly embodies the appreciation and execution of ""HEART"" qualities:

- The flexibility. I have the freedom to work from home or take days off whenever needed. The unlimited vacation policy isn't unique to HubSpot, but it is a differentiator in the way it is truly embraced. 
- The autonomy. Even as an individual contributor, I own my projects and am involved in all aspects of their strategy and execution. Even though we're a growing company, there is still the startup culture where we all do what we can to improve the parts of the business we control.","- The systems and processes.

493,HubSpot,great company to work for,2020-08-27,5.0,Senior Customer Support Specialist,extremely inclusive and transparent environment; growth-oriented; great leadership; paid time off,lower Support Specialist salary than others in field; recently increased
494,HubSpot,Know what you're getting in for,2020-06-14,2.0,Software Engineer,"Benefits are excellent. This is a standard mid-sized tech company that's performing well. You'll get excellent medical , dental, & vision, excellent stock options, above-average base salary, a beautiful office, unlimited PTO, and more.

The company has done an excellent job of becoming a best place to work for women, and this shows, from the high number of women in top management positions. The company hasn't achieved this by taking a radical feminist stance of trying to encourage women to be more like men and then driving them away in the process, but rather, by valuing women for who they are and creating special benefits that women will enjoy. On site you'll find manicures and pedicures available, and the company offers flexible hours and other benefits so that women with children won't feel they have to choose between their children and their careers.

The managers have created a positive environment by genuinely listening to their employees (en masse). This is a company that understands how to hire developers. Developers are given freedom to suggest and implement new projects, attention is given the removing processes which can impede developers, and so on.

You really will be working with the best of the best. Your colleagues will be alumni from the best names in the industry, such as Google.

Having this company on your resume will improve your job prospects. The company is recognized as being one that hires the best of the best. However, this comes with a caveat that if the job doesn't work out, it can also hurt your prospects because many employers assume that if it didn't work out for you at HubSpot, you must not be a good developer. This is especially concerning given the above-average chance of it not working out for you, which is something I will cover in the cons.","The company has done an excellent job of creating a positive environment for women, but this can lead to double standards. In the office, women make sex jokes of the same nature that you'd expect most women only to make in private with their female friends. It's generally understood that if a male employee were to make similar jokes, he'd be fired.

Most tech companies err on the side of not hiring an employee they're on the fence about, in the belief that it's more detrimental to the company to make a bad hire, than it is beneficial to make a good one. HubSpot wants to ensure it doesn't miss out on a rockstar developer. The way it reconciles these two competing interests is by hiring anyone the company could go either way on, but also firing them if, for any reason, it isn't working out after 3-6 months. What this means is it's possible to be hired by the company, placed in a situation in which it's impossible for you to succeed through no fault of your own, and fired three months later. In my case, I was placed on a team in which the tech lead was out recovering from surgery and the person who was supposed to be helping me was unavailable. After six months I was fired without the company ever trying me on a different team.

What Dan Lyons wrote about the company only caring about the bottom line is very true. The managers do listen, but only to large numbers. As an individual, you matter very little. I worked 10 hour days and on weekends to compensate for the absence of management I was given. I suggested pairing me to work with someone from another team for just a few days and it was ignored. People knew I was struggling, but not a single one ever offered to help me. The only management I was given was being told that anonymous members of my team had assumed I wasn't doing work, and because the team is more important than the individual, it was my job to figure out how to get them to stop. When I was fired, I saw a very different side of one of my managers. This was someone who was largely respected in the company and regarded as a sensitive, helpful manager. I was told I didn't have common sense and that I didn't belong in the field. I've since gone on to lead projects at major companies and be courted by some of the biggest names in tech, but once the company decides it doesn't need you, you see its real side. 

The company's approach to management is very passive aggressive. They might hold a meeting telling everyone they don't want them to feel they have to work too long, but privately you'll be told you're underperforming and you need to get your productivity up.

Even though the company does take steps to create a feeling that you're around friends, the truth is many of the people will show a different side of themselves once you're no longer with the company. Only one person from the company has kept in touch.

The reputation about being the best place to work in Boston is largely hype that the company has created. During the years I've worked in Boston, the only people I've met who wanted to work for HubSpot were college students who bought into the hype. By contrast, I know several seasoned developers who know about this company's reputation and don't want to work here. Everyone in Boston knows someone who knows someone who got overworked by the company and either was fired, or quit.

Once you leave the company you'll meet multiple people who tell you they felt the same way as Dan Lyons but were less vocal about it, etc."

They don't know how to solve problems many of times, and focus on unimportant and trivia stuff. I would imagine Hubspot is probably the first  job for them out of their colleges, and ironically they hold some bad-practice (software design anti-patterns) as golden rules for them."

500,HubSpot,lighthearted and great,2019-09-25,5.0,Marketing,"You will work with young people, which is a fantastic source of energy and inspiration. If you are a Millennial, you may feel old, but embrace it. Always free food around, fabulous benefits, gym, amenities, activities, fabulous work environment with all the latest technology and a push for always being better. Plenty of women, plenty of safe spaces.","They have acknowledge their own need for more diversity and are actively working to make the workforce more diverse. I don't feel like it's any different than most places in that respect, but I anticipate in years to come they will be a leader in this too. For this reason, I believe some staff are still learning how to deal with diversity and don't realize when their statements might be alienating to people of color."
501,HubSpot,Specific Growth Opportunities,2020-06-21,3.0,Customer Support Representative,"Hubspot has undeniably poured money into developing a fantastic facility with many tech amenities. The people are all friendly and there's a genuine camaraderie within departments. 

The benefits were up to par with a scaling mid-sized tech company and the location was accessible. 

I really believed in the vision of the leadership team, and the north star of the company influenced each business unit, resulting in a strong combined effort!","The customer support rep job is an entry level job and the only clear pathways available are into customer success and backline support via the product expert role. People successfully transition to other roles, but compared to success and backline support, other transitions are much less direct and have a lower probability, meaning you might be forced to stay in customer support for much longer than you desire. Timing is a huge limiting factor with regards to non-traditional internal transfers -- you might be waiting for the perfect opportunity that you ultimately get passed over on. More on this below, but this is a greater risk because support reps are not paid well. 

Depending on your background, customer support can be a fantastic entry point into a strong company. But for some, the choice will be between taking a support role for 40k instead of a position that pays a non-negligible amount more at a non-tech company. I believed that I would be able to ascend quickly based on working harder than other support reps, but the internal structures do not incentive outperformers, they reward time in seat. Despite being able to complete cases with rapidity while maintaining a high NPS score, I was not able to take on stretch projects due to my manager tracking ""availability"". While the operation justification for tracking availability made some sense, practically it meant that I was not allowed to work towards my next desired role during my work day despite exceeding the core KPIs of case count and NPS. This is not how a salaried role should be structured. Becoming more efficient at your current role is how you stretch into the next role at any other company. My development was throttled due to this dynamic.

Finally, you'll be paid below national market rates at every step of the way at Hubspot. For some people the pros mentioned above are worth being underpaid and experiencing stagnation, but I didn't believe it was a prudent early career decision -- although it might be a valid choice at a more senior position within the company."

The ""cult-like"" culture rumors are completely true. While the culture claims to be the ""best"", I have seen managers padding results with fake posts on Glassdoor, and I reported this internally only to find nothing was done. 

The culture is extremely liberal. It is very closed minded in terms of opinions that aren't in line with the company bureaucracy. I'm liberal, but I'd prefer to leave my political opinions and religious beliefs at the door. 

The work-life balance is somewhat hit or miss. Some teams have more challenging work than others, but the expectations aren't adjusted accordingly. Managers tend to play favorites, allowing personal feelings to impact productivity. 

Management is a bit underhanded at times. There was a RIF during covid. It wasn't announced, and it was carried out in an extremely underhanded way. 

The interview process is ok, but they've let a lot of good talent slip through the cracks based on a process that is weighted towards college graduates and being restrictive in terms of compensation."

It is rewarding to know that we are enabling individuals to have a better workday, bigger pay check, and aspirational goals through our platform and services. In return, employees are rewarded with a truly remarkable culture and work experience.

Between trainings that come up almost weekly, to interactions with peers and executive stakeholders, and the transparency into where the business stands I have many opportunities to grow my own career and have a direct view into how I am helping HubSpot grow better.   The executive team makes hiring a priority and I have a manager who is kind, empathetic, and pushes herself and her team to constantly set the bar higher.",Our business is ever-evolving - it's one of the reasons I love working at HubSpot.

I’m sure this sounds redundant, but the people at this company are absolutely incredible. Never have I felt so welcomed at a place, and I never feel judged or like I can’t be anything but myself.

Along with the people, the culture is also amazing. I’ve gained so much from working from this company.","I will be fully transparent in that when they first hire you, they hype up how much internal growth is possible.

That said, they brush over the fact that while they do open applications internally to everyone (no matter your position or team), the Hiring Managers/Recruiters don’t emphasize exactly what level or tier they’re looking for. As of yet, I’ve applied to 3 internal positions and have yet to land any of them. The process is smooth and they even give you feedback afterwards, but I feel as if the feedback is just for show, as I’ve acted on the feedback by doing various things to “up my skills”, but nada. I’m not the only one in my current role (Support), that feels this way.

Because of this, I’m currently seeking other job opportunities outside of HubSpot to continue my career growth—because sadly as of right now I feel like I’m stuck in a dead-end in my position. I’ve met with countless people, made connections with, and asked questions to the people on the team I’m looking to join, but it still doesn’t allow me to get hired on the other team. Many reps in my position have left the company in the past for the same reason."

- Great support for internal mobility - there are lots of opportunities for lateral movements internally and HR supports them
- Improving very rapidly in the diversity, inclusion and belonging space. Leadership has this as a top priority and I feel that HubSpot has made great process in the last 12 months.
- Perks are great. A lot of flexibility with unlimited vacation and ability to work remote policies.

538,HubSpot,Amazing Experience,2019-11-29,5.0,Onboarding Specialist,"I can confidently say that all the great things that you read about HubSpot are indeed true. I've been at HubSpot less than a year, but long enough to be able to get the entire experience (post new-hire honeymoon phase).

1. The best part about HubSpot are the people. HubSpot puts immense weight during the interview process to hire people that are smart, driven, and most importantly kind. I've made some great relationships during the time I've been here, and it makes work that much more enjoyable. Everyone here is motivated to succeed and advance their careers, and it fosters an exciting environment.

2. Company values. HubSpot is a company looking to be profitable like all others, but it strives to do so in partnership with its customers. You've most likely heard all about the inbound methodology, but HubSpot truly does strive to do business holistically and in a way that makes the world a better place. This not only applies to the way HubSpot goes about business, but also the way it treats its employees. You work hard, but I've never worked somewhere that invests so much in individual growth as well as transparency.

3. Benefits and perks. Benefits are great compared to where I've worked in the past. The coffee is fantastic, snacks are good, and beer on tap is great. 

4. Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. HubSpot puts soooo much into becoming a diverse and inclusive company, and strives to foster an environment of belonging. It admits that it's got some more work to do in this department, but it's truly steadfast in eventually becoming a leader in this category. 

I can go on and on about my experience at HubSpot. I can't genuinely say how grateful I am for the opportunity to work here.","I don't really consider this a con, but more of a disclaimer to potential applicants:

Prepare to work hard. If you want to coast in an easy 9-5 then HubSpot is not for you. If you are coming from another industry, then prepare to put in even more hours learning the ropes and becoming familiar with tech, marketing, sales, and general business acumen. You can quickly become overwhelmed (especially in the beginning). Every employee is here to grow and make a name for themselves, so if you don't give it 100%, you will be left in the dust. 

This isn't to say that the work-life balance is bad (it isn't). You just need to work hard and hit your metrics in order to succeed."

While it is possible to find a job internally, support reps aren't taken seriously in most other parts of the company, and have to re-start at a different entry level position after knowing the technical side of the project inside and out. HubSpot pays far below industry standard in all roles, and internal reps are frequently lowballed when being promoted. The atmosphere and goals have become more authoritarian and less encouraging and certainly more rigid and have a misaligned ideal of what it takes to actually leave support, which is widely recognized as the only reason for joining support in the first place≥"
543,HubSpot,Best place to grow,2019-11-15,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"The ""Use Good Judgement"" policy enables a fantastic work environment. It removes layers of bureaucracy that typically creates friction for employees. Want to go to Greece for a week? Okay just use good judgement. Want to work from a treehouse? Go for it as long as you use good judgement (aka get your work done).

Besides the great policies, HubSpot's best perk is the people. Diversity of experience is vital to self-improvement and HubSpot provides this through all of the incredible people you get to work with. Most HubSpotters have experienced something in their life that makes them ""Shiny"".  Our mystery dinners align us with people and an executive host that we usually wouldn't run into; after a few minutes you may learn that the colleague to your right had played professional baseball player and the women sitting in front of you was a detective in a past life.

1. Waffle Wednesday
2. Best nitro cold brew coffee ever
3. Silos of Cashews
4. Stock plan

HubSpotters are empowered to be autonomous and are constantly given opportunities to learn and grow, from the free books program to almost weekly events focused on DI&B. There are several programs geared toward internal mobility and career growth. Our phrase ""grow better"" applies as much to employees (professionally and personally) as it does to customers.",401(K) match could be improved
547,HubSpot,Make an impact,2019-11-07,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"As an engineer at HubSpot, I have a ton of freedom and a ton of responsibility to make our product better. It can be daunting to own a project when it is just an idea to start, but we are given the development tools and the resources to do our jobs well. It is a great feeling to see something is wrong, fix it, test it, and get it out to our customers the same day.","As the company has gotten bigger, sometimes it is hard to know what’s going on in other parts of the organization like the marketing team or security team."

No management getting in the way of getting stuff done.
All the engineers seem to be both incredibly talented, and humble. Which can be a tough combo to find.

554,HubSpot,Great internship opportunity,2019-08-29,5.0,Software Engineer(Internship),"Came in for a full-time 6 month internship as a front end developer and shipped code into production in my first week on the team. I constantly feel like I'm learning and growing - and not only in my coding abilities. The opportunities that they offer for their interns (tech talks, Q&As with upper leadership, bonding experiences, etc.) are extensive and incredible. I couldn't rave enough about the opportunities for growth throughout the experience.","As an intern, it's great to work at HubSpot. I don't have many complaints in that regard, but I can see how the obsessive and very intense culture might be a challenge as a full time engineer - although you can also see it for how much pride everyone takes in their work."
555,HubSpot,"Amazing place to work, you'll be hard-pressed to find better.",2019-08-09,5.0,Marketing Manager,"I really mean that - I've been at HubSpot for over 3 years on multiple teams, and it is remarkable to see how much the company has grown and focused on continuous improvement for employees, customers, partners, and developers.  On a personal level, I greatly value the work-life flexibility, unlimited paid time off, strong executive leadership, fantastic co-workers, empowering management, diversity and inclusion efforts, employee resource groups, international growth, leadership talks from folks outside of HubSpot, supportive facilities staff...I could go on.","None really. There's always room for improvement at any company, and it's important to stay humble, but I think HubSpot takes and actions feedback better than most from what I've seen."
556,HubSpot,Growing better together!,2019-09-09,5.0,Director of Engineering,I love working at HubSpot. I get to work with smart energetic passionate people who want to solve problems and aren't afraid to speak up. Autonomy is real as is impact.,HubSpot is growing so fast so once you've figured out how to solve a particular scaling challenge you'll need to turn around and think about it at 10x . So don't get too comfortable and be ready to scale your own growth quickly. Personally I love that but it can be quite a stretch to your own growth to solve challenges at one level of scale only to  grow quickly to the next level in a short amount of time!

558,HubSpot,Career Growth - Joining a Rocketship,2015-02-17,5.0,Inside Sales,"It's not really about the beer and ping pong it's about the people you get to work with everyday, training to build skills in sales you get to experience, and the potential for long term career growth that comes from working at a rocket-ship company like this. The sales team is well compensated and offered lots of bonus/contest opportunities throughout the course of the year and ensuring sales people are treated fairly is often top of mind for the executives.

Anyone at any level can take on additional responsibility, step up to solve big problems, and be a part of a extremely transparent culture where you can learn the ins and outs of a SaaS business.  Hard to beat that in today's work environment especially in a successful business.","It's a demanding environment which may not be for everyone, but as hard as it is it's often found to be one of the most fun places to work due to the people and career opportunities."
559,HubSpot,Voted #1 For A Reason,2020-01-15,5.0,Customer Support Representative,"-They hire a variety of people with different background levels and train you

- Office perks such as food, snacks etc
- Hubtalks: A meeting where some industry leaders in the world come to interview with our CPO and you get insights on how they got to where they got and the amount effort, work they put into it.
- Dogs around the office :)
- Industry leading tech stack and support for it",- (not really a con) As HubSpot is growing we may need to go into new territory and there are no set procedures or strategic planning on how to get there. We have to work through new projects and figure it out as we go.

562,HubSpot,"Great company, better people!",2019-09-12,5.0,Marketing Manager,"HubSpot is an incredible place to work! Not only do I feel challenged everyday, but I also feel empowered to do my job well. HubSpotters deeply care for one another outside the workplace and are passionate about their work. It's rare to find someone who isn't willing to go above and beyond for another HubSpotter. Some other highlights:
- Flexible work policy (unlimited PTO)
- Commitment to DI&B initiatives
- Autonomous environment","HubSpot moves and changes very quickly. This can be good/bad, and isn't for everyone. You're constantly challenged and expected to try new things!"

564,HubSpot,A Soulless Cult For The Braindead,2019-12-13,1.0,Software Engineer,"There was lots of free stuff, I guess.","When people tell you this place is a cult, they aren't kidding. It's a glorified adware company that's convinced it's changing the world. Everyone is a ladder-climbing, two-faced snake who will rat you out to management the second you aren't acting ""hubspotty"" (a word they actually regularly use which at its core means showing up to work smiling and happy to take whatever they give you). They consistently underpay their support workers, and when tasked with brutal overtime, compensate them with pizza. They act like they care about progressive issues but don't actually care about anything other than the bottom line; it's all a PR stunt."

-people: you meet a lot of wonderful people who aren't afraid to be vulnerable, empathetic but that are also incredibly intelligent, driven & dedicated",-work/life balance can be difficult when trying to progress your career
568,HubSpot,Great place to be an engineer,2019-10-17,5.0,Principal Software Engineer,"Our engineering org gets the important stuff right. It's built around small, autonomous teams with a big mission that move fast and iterate. There is very little top-down anything, each team determines their own destiny.","As we've grown, we've added more and more engineering teams that have narrower and narrower scope. We try to make sure each team has a huge mountain to attack, but for some teams it can feel like you don't have the opportunity to make a massive impact on the business anymore."

571,HubSpot,"No company's perfect, but this one's really, really, really good!",2019-10-02,5.0,Associate Product Manager,"- Flexible schedule; take care of your work, contribute value, and have the flexibility to decide when you take vacation. You're an adult, nobody's here to keep tabs on your every move.

- Supportive colleagues; the people who work here are pretty great! I've been on many teams over the years and it's always been a net positive experience. Perks like good coffee and snack are nice and all, but they're not going to make you happy at work if your colleagues bring you down. Fortunately, the people at HubSpot are our best assets.

- Option to work from home; more efforts lately to make remote work better for everyone! I am local to the Boston area and like to come into the office, but I love having the option to work from home if I need to.","- Demanding; you'll be challenged in your job. Hopefully that appeals to you! If not, you should probably look elsewhere. Personally, there have been times when I feel overwhelmed with the amount of work I feel I need to do, but I've always found my manager(s) and team mates to be supportive.

- Opportunities for career growth exist, but it takes a lot of work an patience to move into different roles; I don't think this is inherently bad, but it seems to me that as the company gets bigger, it also gets harder to change trajectories in your career. People are always willing to speak with you and there are lots of resources to explore, but it can certainly be hard to find the time outside of the regular day to day."
572,HubSpot,"Outstandingly environment, good tech, minor growing pains",2020-01-23,4.0,Software Engineer,"What companies call ""culture"" is really about norms. Norms cause people who otherwise might act differently to act in a way that the norms encourage. The norms at Hubspot are to make people feel welcome and supported, to assume best intent, to be patient and solicitous in helping people grow and learn. One of the most impressive things is that the management relationship is not the kind that makes you feel watched or judged, but managers seem to go out of their way, whether or not sacrifices are necessary, to make sure that you feel comfortable, are not stressed, and most importantly are growing in your role and toward your next promotion.

Tech-wise, I have been extremely impressed with the platform tooling at HubSpot. It always ""just works"". I would even put it at contrast with a lot of commercial cloud computing software for its reliability, ease of use, and overall reasonable-ness. And the people who build and maintain it are always solicitous with their assistance if you're having trouble.","HubSpot's systems have grown very rapidly, and they're now quite complex. In some areas there are archeological layers of legacy stuff that has to be understood and worked with, but could and probably should be much simpler. Also associated with the level of growth is a possible lag in onboarding. Currently there is a quick burst of onboarding on some basic tools like Maven and our deployment platform. But after that you're kind of on your own to acquaint yourself with the intricate and often unintuitive product-specific systems that you need to work with. Under the banner of autonomy, engineers are expected to drive the rest of the process by asking questions and giving feedback on how they're doing. For various reasons I think that kind of guidance should be more structured and should mostly come from others, not be solicited by the new hire.  Another recent hire and I were talking about this recently and a choice line was ""it's hard when the onus is on you to connect,
and you're new so you don't necessarily know what to say, but you have a nagging sense that you need some guidance."""
573,HubSpot,Great company with awesome people and growth!,2019-09-18,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"HubSpot is a fantastic place to work! It is a fast-paced environment with driven people working on solving a lot of different problems for our customers. One of the best things is seeing the growth of HubSpot. The company is remarkably transparent from the top down about how things are going for the business. 

There are so many reasons why HubSpot is a great place to be. The flexibility is awesome as well as many of the fun perks (unlimited vacation, free coffee, a gym, cool free events to attend, etc). Having worked at a few companies beforehand, I know that it is remarkable to be somewhere that cares about its employees as much as HubSpot does. 

Finally, HubSpot is a great place to be because you can really grow your career here. There are some many opportunities to grow and gain new skills. If you are interested in trying a totally different job (say you are in sales but then want to become a product manager) you can do it! It requires extra work but the fact that the opportunity exists and that people are willing to just meet with you and let you take on special projects is awesome.","HubSpot is still a young company with some growing pains. There is a lack of diversity (which is a priority for the company but still an issue) as well as some pain around scaling as we grow. There are times that your team will be working on an issue for a few months only to discover that another team is ALSO working on the same problem but the teams didn't speak to each other so no one knew. 

There is a feeling that HubSpot's salaries are on the lower end of the spectrum compared to our peers. Some of this is true, but I would also point out that HubSpot employees have stock options which is very valuable. That being said, it would be great if HubSpot made public salaries for every role."
574,HubSpot,Don't count this company out,2019-08-01,5.0,"Corporate Sales, Account Executive","Remote Workforce - and not the remote workforce where you feel forgotten about at home. There are some MAJOR initiatives that this company does to make remote workers feel included. Managers have the tools they need to know how to lead a remote sales team and you feel that everyday

Training - The training at Hubspot as a new employee is amazing. They really want to make sure you know the products, inbound methodology, and the company inside and out. 

Clear promotion metrics - all of this is company wide and transparent so there is no guessing games on how to get promoted",I work remote so I can enjoy their beautiful office in Cambridge!!

576,HubSpot,Couldn't be happier!,2019-07-31,5.0,Program Coordinator,"HubSpot is truly transparent - I never feel like I am surrounded by closed-door meetings. I feel like I know as much information as everyone around me and that we value and enable this transparency so that we can do our job better. This brings me to my second point that we believe there is always more to learn and encourage people at all levels within the organization to continue to learn and grow. I've not seen that modeled to such an extent with other employers. The organization is fairly flat, which gives folks a lot of autonomy and leverage to bring great ideas to the table and it helps us to better elevate the voice of the customer and truly be understanding our customers' needs by hearing from them directly as well as hearing valued feedback from employees who are customer-facing.","I have left this blank for the last 10 minutes while I am trying to think of something... I don't have many cons, if any. I think there are learning curves along the way as any company grows quickly, but even that has been positive since HubSpot realizes its areas that it needs to improve (increasing diversity, for an example) and has proactively worked towards getting better with this."
577,HubSpot,Great Company For Remote Employees,2019-10-11,5.0,Marketing Manager,"I joined HubSpot as a fully remote employee just over a month ago. So far it has been a fantastic experience.

580,HubSpot,Renewal Manager - Awesome Position at a Great Company,2019-08-29,5.0,Renewals Account Manager,"As a company, we have a great culture and awesome perks. There's a big emphasis on diversity, inclusion, and belonging which HubSpot truly cares about and keeps top of mind. I haven't seen other companies put as big of an emphasis on DI&B as HubSpot, which is awesome and helps you feel welcome and valued as a teammate.

Our perks are awesome as well - stand-up desks, meditation room, nap rooms, fully stocked kitchen, smoothie bar, coffee bar, beer garden, etc. (the list goes on and on). These perks are all wonderful and helps build a fun and creative work environment that I enjoy quite a bit.

For the Renewal Manager role specifically, I've really enjoyed my ~1.5-year tenure thus far. There is an amazing group of folks that work in the department and everyone has been super helpful for my growth in the position as well as my long-term career picture.

The Renewal Manager job is mentally stimulating and rewarding, as a good bulk of our role is collaborating with customers and internal teammates to help customers with their renewal. There is a big piece of problem-solving that's involved that I personally love. This position will also sharpen your customer-facing soft-skills, which is great as communication is such a key part of almost any job. Being able to effectively communicate will help drive success for this role and future positions as well.","There aren't many downsides in my opinion, but I will call out one. The Renewal Manager organization is constantly looking for ways to make our day-to-day responsibilities more efficient and better which is awesome. At this point though, I don't feel as though we have the appropriate technical infrastructure/resources to help build out some of the efficient process/changes we're looking to implement. It's been a bit of an inconvenience and something I hope we can improve upon in the future."

585,HubSpot,An incredible place to work!,2019-07-31,5.0,Program Manager,"I could list a lot of pros - the benefits, the technology, the mission, the transparency - but two things stand out:

The flexibility: As employees, we work hard to meet high expectations, but we're also encouraged to leverage flexibility to accommodate a work/life balance.  As long as the work gets done, they trust you to work where and when you need to work, which has been so impactful on my work and life and will keep me loyal to the company for years to come. The company also allows remote work, which is an incredible option for those of us who prefer to work from home, are not located close to an office, or may be looking to make a physical move in the future for various reasons.

The community: The company is full of empathetic, helpful, and energizing people, which makes it a really great place to work and learn. From the very top level to individual contributors, I've always felt welcome and comfortable reaching out, collaborating, and asking for help when needed. This type of environment also fosters opportunities to branch out of your own role and explore other functions and possibilities, which has been really helpful to my career growth.

In the three years I've been at HubSpot, I've been able to transition my career into a new space,  pursue a graduate degree thanks to the flexibility in HubSpot's schedule (and their tuition reimbursement!), and grow both personally and professionally in so many ways. It's been the best career move I've made so far and I couldn't be happier.","This isn't  a con, but more setting context - HubSpot is what you make of it.

596,HubSpot,HubSpot review,2017-04-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Management team that truly cares about the happiness of employees
- Surrounded by bright, hard working and motivated people. 
- Very flexible work environment.  Mentality is come in, get your work done, and leave.  Managers never expect their people do be at their desks just for face time.
- People are encouraged to think outside of the box and if there is a better way to do something you are encouraged to speak up and recommend/implement change.  You never hear anyone say ""well that's how we've always done it so we can't change""","- Company is growing very quickly and is in scale up mode.  Always a lot to do, pace can be very hectic and you have to expect and be comfortable with constant change.  This kind of environment definitely isn't for everyone.
- There is a decent amount of ""group think"" on various topics given the young demographic of employees and the company's front line leaders.  If you don't feel the same way about certain topics there is a tendency for the ""group"" to dismiss your opinion - you'll need to be comfortable speaking up and challenging people if you want your voice to be heard and you're not aligned with the vocal few that are passionate about the topic at hand."

Emphasis on getting things done (so highly engaged and active teams)
Overall supportive culture
Lots of autonomy
Support of remote work","Some growing pains around balancing the scrappier model with the needs of a fastly growing and diversifying business (especially when it comes to planning). Just more corporate ops stuff as the company continues to grow and transition, especially globally and remotely."
601,HubSpot,"Truly lives by their core values of flexibility, autonomy, and transparency",2019-08-21,5.0,Culture PR Manager,"I've been at HubSpot over a year and have never worked at a company that truly lives by what they say. The culture encourages you to build your work around your life, rather than the typical other way around and managers work with to reach your career goals.","Like with any fast-growing company, there are some growing pains, but leadership is transparent about what those are and how they plan to fix them."
602,HubSpot,Best place to start your career,2019-11-11,5.0,Associate Product Manager,"The people are the biggest pro.  The people are smart, motivated and innovative helping the company scale at an incredible rate.",Difficult to scale culture sometimes.
603,HubSpot,Great Company to work for,2020-05-27,4.0,Customer Support Specialist,unlimited paid time off. Overall benefits,Difficult to find promotion opportunities; salary
604,HubSpot,Great place to work!,2020-01-08,5.0,Marketing Manager,"Great people, Flexibility, Ability to work remotely",Not many cons I can think of
605,HubSpot,just ok,2020-07-16,1.0,Technical Lead,you can get lucky and end up on a great team,or you can end up in a sweatshop
606,HubSpot,Dream Job,2019-10-11,5.0,Customer Support Specialist,"All of the snack and assorted drinks available, management actually cares about your wellbeing and career, access to excellent classes and activities, PTO, the culter at HubSpot is truly what makes my job at HubSpot the best.",some perks at HQ are not available to other offices.... aka dogs.
607,HubSpot,The engineering focused culture here is amazing. Great place to work if you want to learn from experienced engineers!,2019-09-15,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,Work life balance is great. Recently HubSpot has really opened up to allowing employees to work remotely full time as well which is a really nice option.,Because engineering is so fast moving and there are a lot of teams it can sometimes be hard to work with other teams.
608,HubSpot,I love HubSpot!!,2019-08-21,5.0,Business Development Representative,"All of HubSpot leaders give you the autonomy to work despite your position. This creates a very supportive culture and makes you feel safe to make mistakes and quickly learn on the job. The company also invests a ton in the culture, making sure everybody feels welcome and creating a sense of belonging regardless of your culture, race, gender, backgrounds, etc.",There's not enough time during the day to attend all events and seminars!
609,HubSpot,Autonomy and trust to succeed,2019-08-28,5.0,Account Executive,"Company truly cares about you, the product is world class and they continue to hire intelligent, driven people.","Like any company you have your growing pains and as we continue to scale there will be things that will take time to get right, nothing is perfect.  There's a lot of different things being thrown at you at once, if you can juggle all of these you'll succeed."
610,HubSpot,"Great job if 23, bad job if 33",2019-09-28,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Really successful business, smart and dedicated leadership and teams, not afraid of change.","Company caters to professionals early in their career. Career progression stops once you pass a senior IC role. There is literally no plan in most roles. If you want career progression you need to be in product or on a new team. Teams in marketing that are well established are ignored and don't get resources. The message if you have feedback is ""that's great you can always leave the company if you want."""
611,HubSpot,Great Time so Far,2020-01-07,5.0,BDR,Great workplace environment. Lot's of benifits,Not any that I can think of
612,HubSpot,A phenomenal culture and place to work,2019-12-11,5.0,Igs,"- Dogs, coffee barista, smoothie bar, snacks
- Freedom - plan you're own success
- People",- Work-Life Balance is tough sometimes
613,HubSpot,Great place to work,2019-08-29,5.0,Renewals Account Manager,"- Hubspot has a great culture and amazing benefits (unlimited PTO, stock options, tuition reimbursement, snacks, coffee  barista, dog-friendly) 
- Big emphasis on D&I which is great to see.
- Managers that are there to support you and who actually care about your personal growth.",- HubSpot moves fast to expect changes almost daily. Sometimes this is good but it can be challenging at times.
614,HubSpot,"Wonderful Culture, Team and Product",2019-10-11,5.0,Customer Support Specialist,HubSpot is a wonderful place to work. You will not work for another company that cares more about their employees than HubSpot does.,HubSpot grows at such a fast pace its tough to get a full understanding of the tool.
615,HubSpot,Finance function,2015-06-01,5.0,,"- The management team is passionate about the product and the Company and their positive energy rubs off on the rest of the Company.
- Company is serious about hiring the best and brightest people.  
- The Company is growing at a 50% clip quarter over quarter and the rapid growth provides so many opportunities for people to expand their careers in either their current function or explore opportunities in other departments.
- The vast majority of employees will drop whatever they are doing and help a fellow hubspotter out with an issue or question - very collaborative environment.
- People genuinely enjoy working with each other 
- The vast menu of employee benefits are second to none
- Management is very transparent with the employee base.  Everything from board of directors presentations to detail employee survey results are shared on a consistent basis.
- Employees are encouraged to challenge the way thing are done.  If there is a better way to accomplish something the change is embraced by management.","With the rapid growth of the Company comes increased workload from time to time and surprises that come up on a daily basis that need quick turnaround times to solve.  The fast paced, fluid work day isn't for everyone.  Someone with a ""9-5 punch the clock"" mentality will not last very long.  To me this is a good thing though because the people that work here are highly motivated and will roll up their sleeves and do whatever it takes to get the job done."
616,HubSpot,HubSpot Cares About YOU - Professionally and Personally,2019-09-10,5.0,People Operations Manager,The support I received from HubSpot returning from maternity leave after 16 weeks is indescribable . I am so grateful to my team and organization for providing such incredible resources to set me up for success as I transition back to work!,"No cons to note, super excited to be back at HubSpot full-time!"
617,HubSpot,Not paid enough to do this job,2019-10-24,3.0,Customer Support Representative,"Unlimited vacation time. Use it!
Free snacks but all fairly junk food related besides rice crackers and raw veggies that people stick their hands all over.","You are 100% NOT paid fairly for the work they ask of you.
I have been repeatedly been told that the first 6 months of training to be an entry level customer support rep is like ""a firehouse to the face"" with information.
Too comfortable with blurry lines between management and team. I am going to a job to be there and better my job career not to socialize."
618,HubSpot,Great place for Software Engineers,2017-09-29,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- HubSpot doesn't just hire geniuses (like Google), they hire people who can and do talk to one another and make work fun. I hang out with my coworkers outside of work, because I actually like them.

- There is so much opportunity to make an impact

- Being B2B means that our users are using this software day in and day out and running their businesses on HubSpot, which gives you a lot more reason to care about the customers vs working someplace like Facebook

- People are generally automonous with the right level of communication

- Meetings are kept to be as few as possible, as few people as possible, as little time as possible, as productive as possible, so there is plenty of developer time and no time spent in unneccessary meetings

- People work around 40 hours a week, NOT 50-60

- No the unlimited vacation doesn't mean you can just not come to work, but it also doesn't mean you can't take time off. People take more time off on average than companies with a fixed amount of PTO. I'd rather not have to save up time off just in case I need it than have my leftover PTO paid out when I leave.

- Working from home is not frowned upon

- Upper management is transparent

- It never gets boring because we never get complacent, everything is always changing, growing, moving forward

- No deductible on health insurance","Everything I can think of to put here is things other people might not like, like all the change and fast pace, but I don't see that as a con myself"
619,HubSpot,Love working at HubSpot,2019-08-02,5.0,People Operations Specialist,"Job Autonomy
Excellent Culture
Outstanding Co-Workers

I am always excited to come into work- I love the people I work with and feel like I am learning something new every single day.","All-in-all not much to call out here. I think we need to train mid-level leadership better. But I know this is already on leaderships radar, so I am excited about the future!"
620,HubSpot,"Incredible opportunity to work with smart, passionate people and have an impact",2013-04-08,5.0,Marketing,"HubSpot has the most amazing group of people I could ask to work with - across all departments, from interns to executives. Everyone works incredibly hard, is excited to come into work every day, and is constantly pushing themselves and the company to the next step. I've learned so much from the people here and it's one of the main reasons I've stayed at the company.

On top of that, the culture is fantastic - from the transparency to the flat meritocracy to the fun events. Plus the company truly has an exciting mission and gives employees crazy goals and the freedom to figure out how to achieve them.

For any challenges we face - whether it's our aggressive growth goals or internal growing pains - employees are truly in control of our fate. Everyone's ideas are heard and encouraged, and it feels like it's up to us to create this awesome company.","HubSpot does have a very intense culture. The goals are aggressive and everyone is very ambitious. It's easy to get burnt out, but the company does encourage vacations and taking breaks and offers a flexible working environment. In addition, the company didn't have a lot of experience among its leadership regarding management or other more traditional skills. Thankfully, we're investing a lot in such team development initiatives and we can already see progress in that area."
621,HubSpot,HubSpotters,2017-09-20,5.0,Senior Marketing Manager,"- Health insurance coverage has been the best I've had - lowest of costs and the company takes care of the deductibles.
- The pay is fair or above market value - the employee reserved stock units is often what makes your pay exceed the market value
- New hires are pliable and extremely coachable, experienced hires are people who are ""remarkable"" at their prior roles; I've learned a lot from my peer.
- Work-life balance is real here, same with unlimited vacation. You take what is needed and the team absorbs your absence with a plan. 
- People care about other people - so much that we'll often sacrifice our own goals to work on someone else's project that requires our expertise so that it succeeds. 
- If someone spills coffee in a meeting, the following will happen without fail: the closest people will drop their surroundings to help, the people on the outer ring will look for paper towels, and then the hive mind solves the problem. 
- The company structure changes every year, to best facilitate problems that need to be solved in the near future.","- Free waffles on Wednesdays occasionally gets cancelled
- Boardgame nights start way too late in the day
- Mystery Dinners (eat with a C-suite, chat, paid by HubSpot) favors a younger crowd without family commitments
- HubSpotters feeling ""entitled"" to company perks (like all three mentioned points mentioned above)
- On a more serious note, the company structure will occasionally make employees lose morale. Turnover tends to occur during those times, but it is still way below the industry average."
622,HubSpot,Great place to work for,2019-09-27,5.0,Senior Product Designer,"Best UX peeps I've worked with, growing up and setting trends, humbled, smart, super motivated to do the right thing for the customers",Growing rapidly can challenge the communication and vision alignment within the teams
623,HubSpot,"The most Caring, Flexible and Supportive Company I Have Ever Worked For",2019-10-11,4.0,Senior HelpDesk Technician,"HubSpot is hands down the best company I have ever worked for.  Walking in the door in 2016, I immediately felt comfortable and at home with my team. I was able to ask questions, be myself and learn everything I needed to learn how to GSD at my role.  I was tossed into a fast pace environment and able to give input on how things could be better.  
My voice was not only heard, but valued. 

I was able to move up in my role within my first year, have been given accolades for work well done.  

Now, almost four years later, I am still feeling fulfilled, challenged and happy to get up and work for this company everyday. 

I have been able to move my working site to remote in order to better address my mental health and to better figure out my life plans.  And I, again, was supported in every step of that process.

As a remote worker, I am given opportunities to spend time with a whole new community of people.  I have the support of a remote program manager who makes sure that we are included in events and opportunities that all the other sites get. And I am able to do the things I need to do to gain a good work/ life balance. 

So, if you like a job that allows you to get up, live out your morning routine the way you would like, work on projects that are fast paced and exciting, and supports anytime you need... you will probably like it here. (oh, and the unlimited vacation time isn't the worst, either)","The only even remotely small con I have to list would be around definition of roles. But, even then, I feel like if I want to learn something, I can just ask.  If I want to try to tackle a new opportunity, I just ask.  I have learned that titles do not define the human, the work and the compassion and all that other human stuff does.  

And I know from a clarity side, this is being worked on and will continue to be worked on as we grow."
