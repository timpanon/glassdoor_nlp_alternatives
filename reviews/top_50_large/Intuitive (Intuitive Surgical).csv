The long hours are often not sustainable, there is a true sense of burnout, and the systems and processes can sometimes take a while to get up to speed with the actual growth. More recent management additions to our team haven't aligned with the culture we've always valued, and this is concerning that we're hiring the ""wrong"" people because we're moving much too fast."

You get to interact with high-performing and intelligent surgeons on a daily basis if you’re in the Field. 

Lots of opportunities to jump to different divisions from Commercial organization aka “Jungle Gym”.

Generous ESPP.","Medical Device company that wants to transition into Medical Technology, but still has many of the outdated mindsets and practices of typical Med Device. Executive leaders CEO, COO are very impressive, but middle management is a hit or miss. Clear that there’s a diversity gap in the Recruitment, Commercial, and Commercial Learning teams. Awkward for high-performing BIPOCs/ Minorities -You will feel left out, but be patient as you will find support from others who are also going through the same experience. To thrive here, you will likely have to conform to the typical Med Device successful profile (very stepford wife/husband). It’s not quite as bad as Stryker’s sales reps’ lack of diversity , but definitely has a lot of room for improvement. They hired a new I&D VP, perhaps she will focus more on improving the diversity at the FRONT LINE level (Reps, Managers, Etc). It all starts with recruitment … don’t think the current employees don’t notice your last CAST class being 98% Caucasian, or that your surgeons and staff are a diverse group of people and your reps aren’t? Very strange and definitely not representative of the population.

With Intuitive over 5 years, always made my quota, even during COVID, still targeted and bullied. Company changed comp plan, began harassing me, if you do not agree with their decisions and challenge them, they will lie and get what they want. Many of these people forgot where they came from. Managers were hired in as reps from outside company and had a clear motive and path from beginning. Morally questionable. 

The guy that hired me never called to thank me for the accomplishments and how far I took the market and business. He continues to move up and put others down. Good ol boy network.

In group discussions only you will be insulted in front of your teammates and you will figure out pretty soon that only you get treated this way as a female. Some male teammates won’t miss a chance to take advantage of this situation and throw you under the bus at every possible opportunity to make themselves look better. The manager will talk with other teammates in their 1:1s about you and loves to talk bad about others. Had to ask to be treated fairly and it was implemented just for 5 days and then bullying continued. My mental health is in the worst possible state. My confidence is all the way down. Great work Intuitive on gender equality!!!! I pray you pay for it."

You'll enjoy your time if that's what your job function lets you do most of the time, but do not expect career growth or any investment in your development outside of whatever the current leadership instructs. You will work more and earn less over time.","Everything else about working for Intuitive is miserable. Leadership is incompetent and so dysfunctional with an openly-embraced lack of diversity. Sexism and harassment is prolific and built into promotional and hiring processes. The work environment is much like a cult, where you cannot express any different opinion to the leaders and if you do, expect to be shunned, targeted, and bullied. You will be expected to give 100% of yourself to the job with nothing left for anyone or anything else in your life. Aggressive and arrogant white men, who lie and steal credit for accomplishments to promote themselves and other men dominate the director and VP levels and protect each other. If you are asked to share your opinion on how things can improve, beware, it's just a tactic to determine who needs to be weeded out or isolated. There are so many other companies with better opportunities, it's not worth the stress and psychological torture at Intuitive. Competition is coming, and I will be jumping ship as soon as I can. There are many others feeling the same way, so any new employees will immediately find they are drowning in work that high-performers who left were already overwhelmed with and leadership is so incompetent and uninspiring most of them cant even actually do the job they are leading, which is why you will get ZERO useful development from your leader. You'll be on your own."

You’ll be disrespected, insulted and thrown under the bus at the first opportunity. Absolutely no transparency whatsoever. Organizational changes happen almost on a monthly basis if not more, but even if it impacts your job you get no information about it. There’s no communication, like everything is a secret and you just need to go with it and be happy about it. Expect to do a completely different job that you were hired for.  You spend more time dealing with hostility and trying to make people happy than actually getting work done.  If you’re seen as an outsider you’ll be completely ostracized before you even have a chance to prove yourself."

Intelligent and talented people abound – it’s not difficult to surround yourself with smart people who care. The holy grail is to find these people and stay highly motivated and engaged by being in their company and not becoming jaded by the negative forces that drag down even the best people. 

Decent benefits.","Work-life balance is discussed at the corporate level as being a priority (typical HR “obligation”). In practice, it does not exist much, unless you happen to work for a highly tiered organization that is top heavy director level or above (and you’re the director or above), and there are lower level individual contributors performing all the tasks.

Poor management, rampant nepotism at the middle management level. Micromanagement by the ranking officer of certain functions, down to dictating the fate of each individual contributor. How does an executive even have the time? Or more importantly, why? Why not focus on what to do to slow down the quarter over quarter turnover rate? Why not let people do the jobs they are hired to do rather than insecurely obsessing over micromanaging the responsibilities that are held by direct reports, and incessantly criticizing individual contributor-level execution? Why not recognize, value, and retain good talent? Too many spineless, delusional middle managers lacking integrity yet expressing fear of this tyrannical environment and rolling over, perpetuating an environment that lacks trust. It looks nice & shiny on the outside, but smells bad on the inside. Two-faced management.

No people development, but certainly a good heaping of oppression and suppression. Typical diversity talk at the corporate level, no follow through. Cookie cutter demographic characteristics – if you fit the characteristics and the profiling targets, you’re likely a shoe-in to fit the story line. Knowledge or experience does not get one promoted or retained. 

401K annual contribution of $1500 is a joke. Although the employee stock plan is a good benefit, not every employee has the ability to take advantage of the opportunity to buy stock. The company assumes since the stock has performed so well, that having a 401K is peanuts, and therefore places a low priority on providing a meaningful retirement contribution. Stop the elitist mentality! Not everyone has the means to trade stock to make bank and buy an Audi and Tesla SUV, or whatever is the flavour of the day, while being less concerned about retirement planning."

I appreciate their commitment to evidence-based medicine and transparency, and their investment in excellence at the employee and company levels. Supervisors are encouraged to listen and grow, and lateral transfers are available to give everyone more flexibility to find their path. I work with a lot of talented people and there's little turnover. Intuitive's COVID response, both internally and for communities, has been heart-warming and thoughtful, and I trust management more after seeing their emphasis on health and well-being in times of crisis. The new Employee Resource Groups celebrating inclusion and diversity are wonderful to see - I'm a member of several - and they have good facilities (at least one room in every building) for new parents who are still nursing and need to pump. A lot of training and enrichment is available to employees: I've taken software-specific courses, training on emotional intelligence and a course on project management. We get stock and options as part of compensation and that's great.","The pace can get exhausting, even if for the most part, employees are passionate about what they do. New hires should have a clear vision of what work-life balance means to them from the start - without those boundaries defined, the work will grow into evenings and weekends since Intuitive has teams world-wide. COVID has changed a lot of the workspaces (understandably) so most of us now work from home - this has dampened some of the camaraderie I've enjoyed - so candidates should be aware that they will likely not work on-site for a while. This also means less access to at-work perks, unfortunately."

There seem to always be opportunities to expand my skill set and try new things.","Like most places, the work load can sometimes get a bit much and project deadlines can seem arbitrarily and hopelessly close, although the team often pulls through and if not, management is understanding and willing to move the posts when needed. And I don't know if this is a con, but you honestly might not want to leave this company when other opportunities come along.

The resources to get the job done right, and management that is willing to invest for the long term in good people and ideas.

It's a very rational, adult place to work - lots of movement and progress for relatively little drama. The way Intuitive has coped with Covid is an example - we're given real information, called on to bring creative energy to support our colleagues, customers and communities, and it's amazing how much we all can accomplish that way.

People here are really supportive and caring. I've seen time and again how teams pull together when someone is out for a while, needs a flexible schedule, or is having a tough time in some way.

Execs and senior management really pay attention to culture, and not in a superficial way, either. No fluffy stuff (lavish perks and offices), but people you respect and can learn from; trust up, down and around; and clear goals and a focus on our customers and the patients they treat every day.","There's nowhere to hide: if you're looking for a job where you can phone it in, look elsewhere.

Work-life balance: if you see those two things as separate, and somewhat opposed, you may find yourself working a lot harder and longer at something than you have ever done before."

The company invests in the people they hire - the tools for professional and personal development are made available to everyone in the organization regardless of role or seniority. 

Additionally, the culture fostered at the company is unlike anything I have seen at a large, publicly traded company. Transparency, honesty in all things, and personal accountability are of the utmost importance to Intuitive - which is also expected of each individual. Everyone is treated with respect, and input from all members/levels of teams is encouraged and heard.

As a relatively new person to Intuitive, there are many different ways for you to meet people outside of your own department and build your network, even in a virtual environment.","The only real drawback is that Intuitive runs lean, which has both upsides and downsides. Many folks are working across many different programs or projects concurrently, which can lead to bandwidth challenges. That's really the only Con I've encountered so far, and if you have the proper teams and leadership in place, something that can be overcome."

Leadership is the best I've worked for: caring, focused, transparent with a desire to empower and promote their staff. Excellent benefits and pay. Perks are not as outstanding in regional facilities as they are in the headquarters but still good.","Policies and perks can often be headquarter-focused and leave out staff from regional facilities. Despite that, leadership does an exemplary job of trying to provide these peripheral benefits and locally-focused policies for regional facilities."
272,Intuitive (Intuitive Surgical),Challenging Projects with Fantastic People,2020-08-17,5.0,Engineering Manager,"Intuitive works on incredibly challenging projects while developing cutting-edge medical devices.

Recent restructuring has pitted groups against each other.   Head of operations is aloof, doesn’t seem to have time or care. 
Managers poach employees rather than hiring from outside, training and mentoring. Out of space for workers... cubes have shrunk from 8 x 10’ to doubling up two to a 6 x 6 cube.  One can hardly hear themselves think. There’s no parking.    Once in a while they will toss cheap Costco snacks at you. Pretty interesting for a company with $5 billion in the bank.

The 401k plan is very weak (matching 200% on first $1500).

Unless you're part of the project ""du jour"", teams are almost always under-resourced, and it can be frustrating to have so many high-value projects parked indefinitely.

Changing priorities from management, lead to delays and wasted resources, then getting penalized for it

Unwarranted criticism from management

No reward for doing good work

Many stressful meetings in which people interrupt each other, fighting the changes and improvement we are trying to implement

Unforgiving attitude about meetings-- if you're 5 minutes late it's treated as a big deal

Limited flex time, and no remote work allowed, yet managers work from home as they please

HR doesn't provide a  forum to settle a disagreement with your manager

Dated work environment considering all the money flowing in. Our building looks like an insurance office from the 1980's. Many people have very small cubicles.

Dated technology stack. Microsoft IIS web servers, Microsoft SQL, Microsoft .NET middleware. They're slowing adopting Linux for new applications but data and middleware layers still hampered by dated Windows tech.

No healthy snacks, but vending machines with candy bars are provided

No Caltrain pass

No gym"

Management was also great - people of integrity dedicated to doing what is right for patients.  They also made great efforts to reduce bureaucratic BS, although they were losing ground on this battle as the company grew.  The technology was also so fun to work on.  Very cool to work with robotic technology.  The company shared profits generously with employees while I was there, offering great ISO plan and ESPP plan.  Later, the ISO plan was replaced with RSUs.  I especially loved that I worked there during periods of rapid growth when there were great career growth opportunities, so I was able to learn, grow, and be challenged.","Very high pressure and intense.  The company regularly set performance goals with inflexible due dates due on Dec 31st.  Bonuses were tied to these goals, so there was a strong disincentive  to take days off over the holidays.  I nearly always experienced strong pressure against taking vacation, and any vacation meant working extra upon returning to make up for lost time.  The company also adhered to a traditional and outdated management philosophy that does not incorporate recent decades of knowledge on human psychology and health.  For example, the walls, carpets and cubicles were all beige.  There was no art, except in reception areas, and no windows, except in conference rooms where all blinds were pulled over windows.  This aesthetic was chosen to prevent people from being distracted from their work.  This was also a very difficult place to work when I was pregnant and upon return from maternity leave."

Intuitive is committed to the development of their employees to work towards their career aspirations. I can attest to this as over the years, I've had multiple growth opportunities personally and professionally from the partnership and support of my leaders.",Environment is fast-paced and expectations are high to perform in the role you are in

My manager doesn't care when I come in/leave work, he just wants me to get my work done. Sometimes I work a 5 hour day, sometimes I work a 10 hour day. As a female manufacturing engineer, I feel treated fairly, respectfully, and I've spoken to a few of my male colleagues and I actually make more than they do with the same experience. Fair pay here, no complaints.","No downsides, I still love my job even after 2 years."
504,Intuitive (Intuitive Surgical),Intuitive Surgical,2018-06-12,5.0,Mechanical Engineering Manager,We make a meaningful solution for our patients. The group of people I work with are by far the most self-motivated group of people I have ever had the opportunity to work with. This does not account for just my direct group but almost across the board for all people I have interacted with. I feel that I can accomplish more at this company than any of my five previous companies since the entire team finds ways to support solutions rather than creating roadblocks. Our executive teams points the business in the right direction and provides us honest updates while setting clear expectations. We also provide stock options to every employee which I feel helps with the sense of ownership.,Parking has been getting harder and harder to find.  As the company grows I find it can be harder to get to know well everyone who I interact with. As a medical company the regulated bodies do put a lot of requirements  on our plate.
505,Intuitive (Intuitive Surgical),A Company I Can Trust My Life With,2018-06-13,5.0,Engineer,"The culture understands the importance of work life balance.
Coworkers are super fun, super smart, and super hard working.

508,Intuitive (Intuitive Surgical),Happy 2 Years,2018-06-18,4.0,Financial Analyst,"I have been at Intuitive for almost 2 years. I greatly value the company culture that allows for collaboration and creativity across different departments. Most employees at Intuitive believe in knowledge sharing and willing to drop their tasks to help you. I have only had positive experiences working with my co-workers. 

Intuitive is a rapidly growing and innovative company with a lot of opportunities to grow your career and develop yourself. With in the past 1 1/2 I have worked at Intuitive, I have already been offered other positions in different areas of the business. The company encourages internal transfers to other departments, if it is going to help you grow your career. In my experience, my managers were willing to have this dialogue openly with me.",The company is growing at an unbelievably fast rate which doesn't allow for a formal onboarding process. Intuitive should work on a formal onboarding process that is beyond a few hour Orientation on day 1. Individual teams and their managers should create a formal onboarding process so quickly bring the new employees up to speed. This will allow Intuitive to continue to grow at the rate they are without sacrificing quality.

While I am a part of Intuitive's finance organization (i.e., I do not make or sell robots), I feel deeply connected to the Company's mission and priority of putting patients first. During any executive presentation, we're reminded of this mission; it's not the employees who are put first, rather we are called to put others before ourselves, a mission I'm not sure exists in too many other companies, and one I think will drive our future success. Additionally, the organization has made and continues to make improvements in the areas of diversity and work / life balance. These changes are happening as a result of the leadership team's apparent commitment to greater transparency and open-door policies.","While improving, opportunities appear to be harder to come by for certain individuals v others. I have specifically pointed this out to members of my organization over the years, and have begun noticing positive changes.

While work / life balance is also improving, there are still areas within finance that seem understaffed. While this is not unique to Intuitive, this can feel like undo pressure at times. I have seen an increased level of concern from management around work / life balance; while this is really challenging to improve ""over night,"" I've noticed management's dialogue changing to adopt a softer tone that is more empowering."

The benefits package including health insurance and stock grants is fantastic.",The culture from 2008-2013ish was terrible in that management didn’t have any emotional intelligence in dealing with people (customers and employees). There were some real jerks who had a turn and burn mentality. I had some terrible interviewing experiences trying to get into this company. The good news is that most of those management personnel have left or were terminated. Any remaining were forced to change and that behavior would not be tolerated in 2018.

Small enough to make a true difference as an individual employee (with incredible trust placed upon junior employees as well as opportunities to move across different parts of the organization).

Marketing is now divided among three departments (engineering, corp comms and marketing), with ZERO alignment or communication at the top, and the most unethical management I have ever worked under. This company is fast paced, but employees are expected to execute without having visibility or insight into a larger strategy. If you're not a director here, you're a nobody. Front-line employees are not appreciated or even acknowledged. While the company pays a great deal of lip service to how much it values its employees, compensation and recognition does not reflect this value. For example, when the company took a financial hit in 2013, front-line employees did not receive their annual bonuses, which are a significant (15%!) part of the compensation package. Our execs were more concerned about pleasing Wall Street than taking care of employees, and this has been a repeating theme in my time at the company."

Good valuable employees are easily let go. Mostly everyone is not happy at work except those 'favorite' employees. I see them stuck there for money and stock options. 

IT management thinks they are geniuses so never gets the buy-in from the employees. So unhappy people are end up  working with/managing the services and products we never liked. 

Management is trying to make them look good on paper on accomplishments and successes, employees are gets used to do least minimum work. There is no motivation to do any good work or takes responsibilities. They thought firing few employees motivates the others.

The executive leadership is top-tier, and the engineering-minded CEO feels appropriate for a heavily technically-focused company (although I am biased as an engineer).  The leadership is also very transparent compared to most as they will (despite some of these other reviews) correct their path and discuss the reasons for their decisions openly.  I think 5+ years ago the mentality was more like a start-up, and is shifting towards that of a larger corporation, but that transition is natural for a growing company.

Because the company is faster-paced, it's good to know you have quality talent around you. People on the whole are more accountable here because they do have a greater sense of ownership.
The product is great and the company really focuses on how the product really helps people. The executive management team is very good and has the company moving in the right direction. ISI is the unquestioned market leader and has positioned itself to stay that way for a long time.","The company is now too mature to be considered a start-up, so it's having a lot of new growing pains as it attempts to fight off pending competition. Managers who were good at pushing to get MORE productivity at any cost, just to keep up with explosive growth, are now struggling when having to introduce processes that maintain productivity while improving operational efficiency for long-term growth. 
While the executive management team inspires great confidence in the direction of the company, an alarmingly growing segment of middle-management is being exposed as ill-equipped and unready to transition this company to the next phase of maturation. Too many of these folks are there because of tenure, being rewarded after having survived very busy periods, and it's very apparent that they lack the skill set to match the changing requirements of the business. We've seen a mini-exodus where many of the good individual contributors who have grown the company, have decided to take their gains and start fresh elsewhere instead of suffering along."

It's hard to work and get things done when requirements are being changed over and over and management and HR are biased toward certain few people."
