0,LinkedIn,Good,2022-03-30,5.0,Developer,Amazing and Good Employer :),Nothing at all to complain about.
1,LinkedIn,Generation X and Boomers need not apply,2016-02-24,4.0,Manager,"Excellent product, world-class benefits, above average pay, relaxed dress code, growth opportunities, and friendly atmosphere. I love the management philosophy of Leadership, Leverage, Results. Early on in every position, the employee is asked ""what is your next play."" The company is always looking to determine your next role and opportunity.","LinkedIn hires on pedigree and age. Most managers are under 30, directors are under 40, and anyone over 40 is a rarity. Important positions will be staffed based on the university the employee graduated from, rather than work experience. Sales process is being created by recent Ivy League grads who have never sold. Some sales and service director positions have been filled with individuals who are extremely smart but have limited to no experience selling and retaining. The attitude is if you are smart, you can lead any team no matter if you have zero experience doing your staff's actual trade. 

The millennial focus is highlighted in many aspects of the culture. At the 2016 global sales organization meeting, messaging was all about ""you are the best-of-the-best"" and that LinkedIn would not be successful without the individual job you do. Top performers were highlighted in front of thousands of employees. As the employee came to the stage to receive their well deserved award, videos of colleagues commending them were shown. Interspersed among work-centric kudos, the awardee's parents were shown in the videos congratulating their child and stating how proud they were of them. For a non-millennial, it was weird to see their parents congratulating their kid in a work setting. But this is also a company who holds Bring Your Parents to Work Day."
2,LinkedIn,Rest and Vest,2022-02-28,4.0,Recruiter,"1. Great WLB - if you're a parent/caretaker and need boundaries, someone who is burnt out, or someone who likes doing the bare minimum, this is the company for you
2. Truly the BEST benefits out there - best food in the Bay Area, best 401K match, amazing perks and discounts, etc.
3. People are really nice and friendly. Genuinely all people you'd enjoy grabbing coffee with","1. Low pay - if you're looking for the highest offer, this won't be it. And once you're here, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get decent raises
2. There are two types of employees: really amazing star employees that work their butts off and the deadweight. It's about 50/50. The dead weight are not smart or motivated, and drag us all down
3. ""Rest and vest"" is the motto, which is great for some and not for others. Working here can be a bit boring, and you may not grow as much as you would in other companies. Your career can plateau if you spend too long here. 
4. Leadership. Yikes. Ask anyone who has been here since pre-2020 when Jeff was CEO and watch them heavy sigh or grimace"
3,LinkedIn,Transformational,2022-03-29,5.0,Human Resources Business Partner HRBP,"The culture is real. I miss it very much. It is rare and special - enjoy it, add to it, and keep it alive.",Most of the roles are highly specialized and it can be a challenge to get visibility on your work day to day.

6,LinkedIn,Great work life balance and top notch people,2022-03-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"LinkedIn has great work life balance and cares for its employees by giving us benefits, days off, and company events. At the same time, the people who work here are good at what they do and take pride in doing a good job.",Sometimes processes can take longer due to LinkedIn being a larger company.

*People are really smart and nice, you don't run into a lot of jerks. 
*Teams are generally happy and love the company culture 
*Employees are passionate about the company brand, its mission, and doing the right thing for its members.
*The campus, cafe, and workplace support is the best - truly world class.
*Though they're owned by Microsoft, they do run independently from them.","*The company size is growing, which means that it's harder to get alignment on things. It does feel like organizations/leaders are getting more ""political""
*Given the amazing perks, some people stay at the company longer than they should - and for the wrong reasons. 
* They're almost too nice , which means people aren't always held accountable and exceptions are always being made. 
*It's been harder to find growth opportunities past a certain level. In some ways, it's easier to leave the company than to stay and get promoted/find an internal move."
13,LinkedIn,Used to be a great company,2022-03-04,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good wlb in some teams, some really talented and nice colleagues, good perks, Msft stock","Ur growth, wlb, general happiness is very team dependent. A lot of bad managers and engineers get away with things because they r favored. Company is not giving refreshers regularly like other places and always tell u to not mention getting one if u do, showing that it’s not a common practice. Comp too low for the amount and level of work I do."

20,LinkedIn,"Great culture, benefits and product, but recruiters are over worked.",2021-12-08,4.0,Technical Recruiter,"- Competitive pay (for recruiters)
- Great culture. This starts with great transparency from almost every level. Management gives us opportunities to create impact and make a name for ourselves constantly. 
- There are tons of benefits and employee groups that really show a focus on employees well being. 
- Colleagues are great people who work hard, and will help you.
- Lots of holidays, including the week between Xmas and new year, and week of July 4th.
- A great focus on diversity that has paid off - diverse group of people who work here
- Great product.
- A mission that's easy to get behind, and really drives most of the decisions it would seem.","-We are heavily over worked in recruiting. This is very common nowadays across most companies I am sure, but it can be a weight when you feel like you didn't accomplish nearly enough after a 10 hour day. This also leads to (at least myself) feeling reluctant to take any vacation time.
- Technology in recruiting. The tools we have amount to not much more than Excel and LI Recruiter. There are lots of areas where recruiting could be more efficient but there are missed opportunities because of poor systems."
21,LinkedIn,Great company to work for,2022-03-09,5.0,Senior Consultant,"Working over the pandemic, it was incredible to see how they stepped up to take care of their employees.

22,LinkedIn,A place where people lead with compassion,2022-03-09,5.0,Technical Recruiter,The people are amazing. The processes for Talent are relatively organized and robust enough to be successful.,Nothing specific to LinkedIn. I run across the same challenges I would with hiring candidates at any employer within the current job market.
23,LinkedIn,serious about diversity,2022-03-21,4.0,Product Operations Manager,"LinkedIn really cares about diversity and celebrates cultural differences, and the benefits of having a workforce with varying backgrounds, beliefs, and life experiences.",The startup feel within a bit company is fading into proper large company bureaucracy. it's hard to get around committees that oversee tiger teams that plan for a finish lines no sooner than a quarter that turns into two. The agility is fading into metrics paralysis.

There is a compete to survive culture. Teams are online well after midnight constantly (these aren't just short spurts, it's the norm). People needs do not come first. They are actually ignored for fear of further disruption to the business and the insane amount of hours you're expected to put in just to survive. I'm also positive I'm being severely underpaid compared to my peers. Oh, and diversity where??!"

43,LinkedIn,Best Company I Have Worked For,2022-01-04,5.0,Staff Software Engineer,"LinkedIn cared about the well-being of its employees. We had two weeks of shutdown every year, one around the July 4th holiday and the other between Christmas and New Year. There's an ""In Day"" every month for employees to participate in activities other than work and to learn new things. The executives were transparent during all-hands and no questions were off limit. I felt that my feedback was valued and acted upon.",The bar was very high for Sr. Staff Software Engineer position. One would have to be well known across multiple teams and upper management.

58,LinkedIn,"A toxic, career-destroying mistake",2022-02-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are some smart people, and apparently the cafeteria food is good. Above-average benefits.","These are just the highlights:

1) My recruitment was a straight-up bait and switch. I was promised a role that did not actually exist, both in formal and practical terms.
2) LinkedIn does not have teams so much as it has reporting structures. IC work is strictly solo -- there's no pairing, there's no collaboration, there's rarely even code review. You will not have any opportunity to learn from your colleagues or build meaningful things. I cannot stress this enough -- LinkedIn is by far the most isolating, disempowering place I have ever worked.
3) Decision making is strictly top-down. Your work is assigned by your manager. Initiative is not rewarded. Credit is not given.
4) You will not build transferable skills. All the internal data infrastructure is proprietary and outdated. Skills you bring from prior roles will have little value here, and skills you gain here will have no, or even negative, value when seeking your next role.

It was clear within a week or two after joining that I had made a terrible mistake, and I left within a few months. I feel terrible for my colleagues that are still stuck there. At the IC level, many people feel trapped, and some don't even realize how bad they have it because they are so walled off from what the profession can achieve. I have had a heartbreaking number of colleagues reach out after I left just to hear stories about what it's like to collaborate in DS, because they've literally never even been told that is a thing. Many have been with LinkedIn for years.

Additionally, it has been brought to my attention in confidence that there are very credible and widespread allegations of abuse and discrimination on my former team. It is not clear that they are being addressed."

LinkedIn would rather you spend 90% of your time fighting internally to get order forms created than hustling to create new pipeline. Do you like tickets? You’ll be creating and responding to tickets from 9am to 8pm each and every day. The process is out of control. It’s is incomprehensible how hard it is to get pricing and a final order form. Something that should take 15 mins takes 3-7 days because rep autonomy & access has been taken away. There has been so much change that it’s causing mental health issues for the majority in Enterprise Sales. Executive leadership clearly thinks our products sell themselves. We’ve moved our post sale customer support model to self serve. This puts insane pressure on the AD’s to find ways to help our customers, yet we don’t have full access to their accounts. I cannot recommend making a career change into LinkedIn sales with so many issues standing in the way of helping your would be customers."

You spend most your time trying to figure out issues around tools, wait ridiculous times to build your code, with some teams you wait forever to get your code reviewed. It's 2021 and this company is just switching to git. Gives an idea.

Career track: super slow unless you have a manager that will fight for you. Most staff engineers are bad engineers, they will never find jobs outside or never find a staff role. However inside linkedin it will take forever to get to staff.

Refreshers: The worst. And I say that one more time, the worst refreshers ever. Your manager will give you a 100k refresher that will vest in 4 years for killing it at work and tell you ""nobody ever received this much"". Don't believe the HR when joining, they are not telling the truth."

122,LinkedIn,Don't believe the hype,2022-01-25,1.0,Sales Operations Manager,"Global company, tech culture, free food, flexible working, generous parental leave, DEI efforts/emphasis","Linkedin has a habit of hiring people into roles they're overqualified for and then keeping them there.

In my case, I flagged to Linkedin that I'm overqualified for the role that they offered me but HR and the hiring manager insisted that I was coming in at the right level and over time convinced me to join.

Shortly after joining my hypothesis was confirmed: I am indeed overqualified for the role that I have. I bring this up to my manager who then agrees and says that I should have been brought in at a higher level. 

But then he refuses to make any changes as he chooses to hide behind ""HR rules"". He suggests that he will advocate for my promotion instead based on the fact that I was brought in on the wrong level and have been performing at a higher level (something that is widely acknowledged by all my Sales partners).

But then a few weeks later he got back to me saying that there is no accelerated promotion timeline for Linkedin to correct their leveling mistake. Which is infuriating because the company has acknowledged their mistake and agreed that I should be paid more.

This is a common problem at Linkedin - from talking to coworkers I know that I'm not the first person that this has happened to.

Half of the Sales team is being poached by competitors who offer 50%+ more in pay. HR doesn't care - they just shrug and say ""we have a good culture"". But how good is the culture really if you're not paying people properly?

Due to long hours and low pay, there is high turnover which is very disruptive to the business, which then means that anyone who remains on the staff has to work longer hours. It's a vicious cycle."

The leadership team deeply cares about guiding the associates to be their best professional self and present ample opportunities to hone your leadership skills. I'm quite confident I will learn a ton as I transition into a full-time sales development role.

Compensation for a rotational program straight out of school is generous and above market (nothing outrageously competitive, but quite decent). You're given a base salary and a variable component, and the quota is completely fair and achievable. Your total compensation package (401k, PerkUp, signing bonus, time off) is outstanding.","What's cool about BLP is that you have an opportunity to choose 1 of 4 pathways (SaaS Sales, Media Sales, Sales Analytics, Non-Quota). While you don't have full control over which path you pursue due to business needs, you certainly have the capacity to make your luck happen by demonstrating your interest in a specific pathway.

That said, the one downside to BLP is that you don't necessarily get job exposure to these pathways prior to choosing. Instead, everyone goes through customer operations (which has been beyond fruitful to learning the products) before selecting their path. While there are plenty of guest speakers from different parts of the business and opportunities to learn what a day-in-the-life is like, it would be SUPER cool to actually have exposure to these pathways as part of rotations to just get a taste of what something like, say, analytics would be."

Listen to your very small pool of diverse employees... they want opportunity equally and equitably, not just because they are from a minority group. They/we deserve that. Leadership made it uncomfortable for all. 

Additionally, the lack of compassion from the c-suite and senior leadership regarding the layoffs was honestly quite shocking. It was inevitable and understandable that it happened, but Jeff would have never allowed it to be done the way it was. Why did we all wake up to a middle of the night email and a post on LinkedIn to the public from our CEO? You respect our employees but not enough to handle it inernally first. Do better. And then to share that it was not based on performance. So tell me... what was it based on? Favoritism by the Director level... that is it.

- Hiring Managers are true partnerships rather than order taking like an agency or other companies 
- For any recruiter, you will grow in how you think with data driven decisions and how to leverage information for closing candidates/Hiring Manager relationships, and opportunities to join projects for the LinkedIn Recruiter tool 
- Your teammates will be your best friends","This is hard to say, but needs to be addressed:

LinkedIn is a company that prides itself on being compassionate, to use Jeff Weiner’s word specifically. Unfortunately, for the recruiting org, there has been a mass exodus after the 2020 layoffs. The main culprit being the culture shift. 

Ex: getting promoted is extremely difficult. This last year after lay-offs not one recruiter was promoted, but a Manager was promoted. Anyone who was targeting to get promoted has to wait another full year.  Favoritism is a real issue here. 
 
Ex: While you will be told it’s unlimited vacation, any time off outside of the company shutdowns is not encouraged. 

Ex: there are quarterly surveys asking how to be better, how your Managers can be better. Despite feedback, nothing is ever done to rectify any alarming issue. But you will always be told how to be better, no matter what. 

Overall issue: LinkedIn started out as a welcoming company with a start up mentality. Now it’s more of a grind company with a “clique” energy and you’ll find yourself saying how great it is, but also feeling like you’re never enough. Personally, I’d rather work for a company that is honest about the work expectations and long term agenda."

318,LinkedIn,Great place to work,2021-06-25,5.0,Solutions Specialist,Challenging work and great company culture.,Limited room for growth and upward mobility after a certain point
319,LinkedIn,"Great culture, exciting work and great leadership",2021-02-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Compared to many other companies in the bay area, LinkedIn is one of the few that deeply cares about the people who work here. There is a strong focus on employee well being and talent within the company. This is now the hallmark in the industry for being talent first.

With the public announcement of LinkedIn moving to Azure, there is an exciting pace in the infrastructure and the product domains. The company is also constantly innovating with the product, and there is so much more they can do.

Linkedin's portfolio is growing to multiple new areas as the social engagements for professionals become more and more focused on online interactions. This means that there are amazing opportunities, that only LI can offer.

Leadership at LinkedIn (managers, sr managers, directors and above), are drilled with empathy. There is a relentless focus on talent and people, and sometimes this can be hard on the management, but they enjoy the fruits of it all: trust, loyalty and excellent relationships with their teams. Big names like G and F aren't able to do what the leaders at LI have been able to. The commitment to diversity is real in all aspects. You are heard for your thoughts and ideas, and not for who you are or where you come from. Respect and humility flow through the veins and arteries of the company. To everyone outside of the company, this almost seems like a weakness, but this is one of the magical strengths of LinkedIn. It all begins with the right leadership.

Individual engineers and others contributors like program managers, finance managers, and so many others (no disrespect to anyone not mentioned here), are the secret sauce of the company. People are extremely smart, and driven. Everyone is ""in"" it together, which is a very LinkedIn way to put it. Career progression is fun when even peers are invested in you because there isn't a notion of 'me' or 'you.' Mentorship is promoted across the company, and structured sponsorships are becoming available as a new means to enhance prospects and not just skills.

Overall, an excellent culture, great people and good challenging work.","The largest flaw in the company has been the overly conservative approach. Like the entire engineering organisation slowed hiring last year, which was a knee jerk reaction. Some prioritization helped, but leaders from different organizations still couldn't see how to help other areas and partners. The silver lining is, that people listen and do something about what's being said, but it needs to be more proactively approached. Being conservative with spend is good business sense, but not all the time.

There are many more minor flaws, but the only other challenge for an individual joining the company is to be able to get used to the technology and systems. There's a lot of technical debt, and while there is an organization focusing on the base platforms and tech, the velocity to reduce technical debt to be able to get new individuals productive has been slow. This has crept into almost all areas of the product, and is not a unique challenge for the company. Once again, the industry in general has this problem, but LinkedIn can certainly do better."

Felt more like a number after the 2020 layoffs. No food and snacks while remote. Overall salary and pay should be increased without many of the perks we used to get.
325,LinkedIn,Be prepared to do 100% toil and 0% engineering,2021-06-03,2.0,SRE Engineer,"The company has good benefits, lots of perks, and really goes out of its way to try to ensure employees are happy.","* If you're going into SRE, you might land on a team where everything is toil and there is no real coding/project/engineering work.
* There is a culture of ""build everything in-house,"" so the tools-related skills you learn here won't be useful in the rest of your career. Imagine you work as a carpenter and suddenly after changing the company you work for, they tell you that they don't use hammers or nails, they use combobulators and whizbangs, and every standard tool you've acquired skill in has a unique replacement in this organization. So you spend 2 years or more of your life getting good at combobulators, whizbangs, and whatchamacalits, then you leave the company to resume your career as a carpenter elsewhere. What do you think you gained from your time at that company? Atrophy. Atrophy is what you gained. You are now less skilled at using a hammer and nails. What's more, the world of carpentry has since developed new techniques and industry-standard tools that your peers are pros in and you've never heard of them.
* Learning these internal tools is painful. There is no standard to documentation. It's all kept unversioned, outdated, with low discoverability in old wiki pages. The only way to confidently learn the tool is brute force -- asking on Slack channels or email lists, inquiring if a snippet you read on the outdated documentation is still current, mixed with actually checking out the tool or project and just reading the code.
* There are two kinds of SRE teams at LinkedIn. Those that engineer tools and those that use these custom-engineered tools. If you are on the latter kind of team, expect to spend all your time configuring these custom combobulators and whizbangs, or doing migrations from OS to OS, kernel to kernel, java version to java version (yeah, they're still transitioning off on-premise infrastructure that's managed like pets, not cattle)."

There is not a lot of room to move between stacks often times (backend, frontend, ML).

The culture also strongly encourages craftsmanship so you get to build things the right way without hacking around to meet deadlines.","Because LinkedIn is already such a big player, it faces similar problem as other big companies. Things are slower because there are more process and almost everything you touch affects a bunch of other teams so migration efforts become super challenging.

Was I shocked? Nah, not really. I get it and we all know about Doug Jones and the Alabama senate race, so I wasn't expecting the last of conservative bastions here at LinkedIn. I also did not expect that I should have to hide my political or religious beliefs and I was a little surprised that I was warned about it. I mean, isn't that what being inclusive means? Doesn't that mean that I can worship Buddha or Allah or a golden calf in my backyard, naked and howling at the moon and be comfortable with people at work knowing that? I asked that of my co-worker, the guy who warned me about LInkedIn's diversity, another conservative in hiding. He sighed and said, ""you could pick any of those to worship. Just don't say anything about Jesus."" If you are a minority, particularly a gay minority, LinkedIn will welcome you. If you vote for Trump and you still like Billy Graham.....not so much.",Lot of time wasted on snowflake BS.

By spending about 6 months in the rotational program, you are able to ease into sales by learning about the different business lines and teams before jumping right in. The rotations also set you up for success in terms of learning the products that you will be selling and getting exposure to different departments. The BLP Cohort becomes like a family and you are able to grow with a diverse and impressive group of individuals. The day to day work of the role is not stressful, and you should not have any problems attaining your quota. The work/life balance is amazing - fun activities every week and only 40 hrs/week of work allowed.","Some of the work in the rotational program is very tedious. When it is time to transition into Sales Development, you are chosen to be on a team without much opportunity for input on which teams you prefer. 
Not a Con for me, but everyone should know that this program is a sales funnel meant to grow talent for the sales organization. It is not encouraged to look at other roles outside of sales at LinkedIn. 
There is no encouragement to exceed your quotas for your day to day in-role; only to take on leadership opportunities outside of the role."

448,LinkedIn,"Great place to learn and cut your teeth, but don't expect any career transitions",2021-02-13,4.0,Relationship Manager,"Best in class training. Managers really do prioritize you and want to develop you. They set our quotas too high one year and people weren't hitting, so they dropped them down for the reps, but had to keep them high to hit the company goals for the VP's, so the management literally took a hit on our behalf. My VP also didn't have an assigned desk and would just pick a random desk to sit at and when he wasn't at meetings, would talk to us and get our honest opinions about the product and would talk to us about what was working and what wasn't. Very awesome guy. Awesome pay and benefits. Quotas are fair and there's built in relief if some completely out of your control doesn't go your way (like a merger). Great processes in place to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and we're incentivized to work with other business lines so all of LinkedIn benefits. Also lots of learning opportunities in terms of classes to take and ERG's you can join. I have never met anyone who isn't willing to sit down with you for lunch if you asked to schedule something. That being said, it was hard for my team to leave their computers at lunch and they'd often worked through lunch which sucked for team bonding. But also really fun team bonding every quarters pre-covid. LinkedIn also does a great job living it's culture and values to an extent. You're measured not just on how well you do the job you're hired to do, but also if you're contributing to the larger success by creating leverage and acting like a leader. I love that there's an expectation that you will contribute more than just showing up, doing your job and leaving, and instead are expected to help those around you and you're held accountable for that.","RM is a really tough role though. The AE's go home early, but you're inundated with emails and you're constantly having to straddle between acting like a CSM and acting like a sales rep. Unless your account is big enough to get assigned a dedicated CSM, you're on your own, so you really need to figure out how to scale things and only focus on the clients that will get you to your number. There's also a lot of rules in place when it comes to moving around, unless you can get a manager to really champion you (I have seen one person skip a level and jump straight from SMB to Enterprise, and I don't know how they got to do that). You can only move laterally if you want to switch business lines and you need to be in seat for at least a year. Which means if your business line has no openings for a promotion, you can't interview for a promotion in another business line. You can to move over to that other business line in your same position (SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise), be there a year, hopefully perform well and then if there are openings, you'll be able to promote. Additionally, while the company touts transformation, it's a giant behemoth now. Unless you've spent a year proving yourself to a manager in a sales-adjacent role, most people aren't willing to take a chance on you. Don't think that by getting your foot in the door by getting a job at LinkedIn, you'll be able to move around. Because LinkedIn has become a top employer, they can get top candidates for low level roles. For example, for an entry level data science role, despite extensive knowledge on the product and having taken some data science classes, I was told ""why would we hire you when we can get someone with a Masters degree in this?"" when I knew multiple people on the team had started with my same background merely two years before. They also had an entry-level Product Manager position that was specifically for internal employees and specifically for people with non-typical backgrounds, so I applied. I did not get an interview because ""there were people with more relevant experience."" They ended up hiring an engineer. Wasn't the whole point that you were looking for people with non-typical backgrounds (ie, not engineers)? If you want to do something sales adjacent, you could do CSM or Sales Readiness, but that's about it. If you want to move over to marketing, you'll need a filler job in between and probably a year before that working on marketing roles. You will get best in class training at LinkedIn, but don't expect to get an opportunity to do something you're not already doing. Come for a cushy job and nice people. Also had a bit of a toxic sales team thanks to a few personalities and a manager that played favorites. But from my understanding, my team was unique in that experience, so I was just unlucky. Could have switched to another team, but didn't want to start the potential promotion cycle all over again. LinkedIn's also trying to walk the walk when it comes to diversity, but honestly leadership is still old white men at the senior level. My manager all the way up to the global head was all white men. There is some diversity sprouted here and there and they were working on it, but I'd love to see the actual numbers because just looking around it didn't seem to be a huge difference."
449,LinkedIn,Great benefits not a supportive community,2021-05-12,1.0,Support Consultant,You get unreal benefits. Never worked for a company that offers so much to their employees,The benefits are a smokey mirror. You become reliant on them and feel like you have to stick around because most companies don't offer them. The company doesn't have your best interest in mind.

- The cafeteria and coffee bars are great (pre-covid)
- Compensation is good – not the best but definitely in that top tier of bay area employers. It might be the best value though, if you consider the culture and work/life balance. I'd rather work at LinkedIn than get paid a little more to work in a snake pit. :)","- From a career development perspective, try to get on a team doing infrastructure work, especially backend work. Even as a top performer with big projects under your belt, the job responsibilities of a front-end feature developer just don't check the right boxes for a promo.
- From a day-to-day perspective, the development tools just aren't great. Mobile infra doesn't meet the needs of developers, working with them can be challenging and certain areas are notably buggy. Even company-wide infrastructure like crash reporting and continuous integration is slow and unreliable.
- If you are considering offers, know that LinkedIn doesn't do big stock refreshes like some other big companies in the area.
- The on-call process is stressful. The apps are just too big and have too many contributors to put a single developer in charge of everything for a week. There are enough developers that you aren't on call very often but the flip side of that is that you never really get the hang of it and things are slightly different by the time you do it again."

527,LinkedIn,Best company in the Bay Area to work with,2020-10-05,5.0,Staff Software Engineer,"– Amazing culture, probably the best (– I have worked at Amazon, Apple, Intuit, Adobe, WalmartLabs, Google. Also interned at Facebook. Facebook culture is second best)

– LinkedIn lives by its values. Specially “members first”, that applies to employees too. For example if you plan to build a system that gave points to how frequently someone responds to queries - one may think this will increase productivity. But in LinkedIn’s ecosystem, you can’t build this. Because it shows “someone is better than someone else on something (responding queries)”. This is not allowed and promotional evaluation are purely positive, without comparison

– You cannot even accidentally prove someone else wrong, or bring them down. People from Amazon/Apple joining LinkedIn may take time to adjust to this

– Consistently Best food in Bay area. And good variety

– Unlimited time off. If taking more than 3 weeks at a stretch, only then you need approval. 3 months Pat.

– Amazing Open Source aptitude

– People trying to micromanage, and/or play politics, are automatically corrected and tuned in by strong Company culture, in less than an year. Some may try escaping by changing teams every year, but that becomes evident soon

– Lots of T-Shirts.","– Subjective: Your contribution to open source and product, both, will be rewarded more if working exclusively on the product (i.e., in the Apps team). But if working exclusively on the infrastructure, you really have to go the long mile. Because Open Source contributors are in abundance and they are all super skilled. Literally 1 Principal engineer on frontend infra in the whole company. 

– Company wide Rest.li (API) and Ember framework (Frontend) pretty much standard. You can choose different tech. But limelight projects build on these only. Although, that is changing slowly, but verrrry slowly."

541,LinkedIn,Couldn't have been happier in sales!,2020-09-10,5.0,Account Executive,"LinkedIn has a knack for hiring brilliant, motivated and mission-driven people. I've loved the relationships I've built since day 1, and am so grateful for my time in seat. Every decision the leadership team makes considers and reflects LinkedIn's core values, which everyone respects and takes pride in.

LinkedIn makes you feel so supported in your endeavors, whether it be starting a side project for your team or employee resource group, or wanting to find a path for yourself outside of sales (e.g. moving over to Customer Success), and the level of training and resources offerred is unparalleled. 

Sales quotas are quarterly and tough but fair, and though results matter, you're also measured on leadership and leverage (meaning how you take your successes and skills and extend them out to your greater team or org to drive impact).

You are not micromanaged on your metrics, hours worked or sales process, and can be very autonomous if you prove your success. With this, finding the right manager and team is essential to your happiness, as teams tend to be close and love to build their own team culture.

If you are looking for a great strategic sales role that is focused on the customer and you can be surrounded by talented and kind people and feel rewarded for your work, LinkedIn could be just the place for you!","There is a degree of nepotism in the hiring process, whether it be internal or external candidates. 

For externals, LinkedIn loves referrals so if you are applying, it is highly recommend you get referred in! 

As for the internal hiring process, the best way to get promoted is to spend time getting to know the teams and manager - Without this, it is hard to succeed in getting promoted or hired onto a new team. It helps you find the right team and culture fit which is a plus, but it also can lead to bias, making it harder for a more qualified candidate to get the job at times."

In addition to adapting and accommodating, they have launched several things to help the world at large (re-purposing all of their recruiting for free for hospitals and such, direct money donations, increasing charity matching, providing many free memberships for displaced employees, and others)","The only con I have so seen so far is an over-emphasis on doing everything ourselves.

Great perks, competitive pay, and is respectful of people's personal/family life. Able to work remotely when needed.","Very dynamic work environment that takes time to adjust if you've worked with more mature companies in the past. Petty politicking and nepotism depending on your team as middle-management tries to empire build. Lack of experience in middle management as they try to handle business changes and growth. Hard for someone who is seasoned in their area to learn from inexperienced managers. In that respect, growth is limited because managers don't know how to grow their high-performers which will eventually leave because if you can't learn from your manager, then perks and good comp and benefits will not be enough to stay. Alot of time spent hand-holding younger employees who don't know how to problem-solve."

622,LinkedIn,Not the company it use to be,2020-03-07,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Work with talented and driven people. Pay used to be great and can have 400k plus years.  Get lunch catered.,Middle line managers are inexperienced and for the most part yes people. They are continually raising quotas and lowering kickers resulting in many tenured experienced reps leaving. Pay is average. The company is run by sales ops and sales leaders have little impact on numbers and do not push back. Morale is bad at least in the Chicago office as majority of the teams are not hitting. Cross-functional and sales managers have no accountability and reps are the ones to go. I use to recommend people at LinkedIn but no longer think its a place to make money.

The company offers great benefits.,"WLB DOES NOT exist as many people have mentioned here. Maybe it's org specific but in my org people work 12 hours a day.

The managers are among the most incompetent ones I've seen in the industry. Because of how the promo process is structured, many people can tick the boxes and become a manager. The managers aren't helpful to their direct reports and constantly expect ICs to do everything by themselves with no support.

Access to global network 
Culture (for the most part)","- Lack of product diversity (Marketing / Media business) — about 5-10 years behind the industry curve 
- Go-to-market pace: product releases are slow as molasses and those that do launch are feature and functionality based vs tangible new products to market. 
- Internal systems and sales productivity tools are underutilized. Be prepared to work out of a lot of manual spreadsheets instead of a CRM for running and forecasting your business. 
- Overemphasis on operational process and underemphasis on actual selling and selling tactics 
- Sales Management. Many of the managers in the LinkedIn Marketing Solutions business are not sales managers. Former Ops and management consultants are hired to be “sales managers” and do not have field selling experience.  They will force operational process down your throat to the point where you forget how to sell because you spend 75% of your selling time writing the book on it. 
- Lack of hiring diversity and exclusivity. LMS senior leaders brand themselves as diversity and inclusion advocates when in actuality they will keep hiring internal candidates from their inner circle who walk, talk, and look, and think just like them. If you make one mistake, it will stay with you throughout your time with Linkedin marketing and you will be branded as such until you suck up to the next shiny new manager in line who submits to group think because that is in fact the only way you will get promoted. They will use Leadership, Leverage and Results as “performance evaluators” but the truth is these “levers” are subject to your manager and how they think about you or have been forced to think about you at a certain moment in time.  These metrics could push you out or spun up to promote you. 
- Takes years to get promoted if you are not part of the “inner circle”"

Generally collaborative culture and people trying to do what is right....Some of the smartest and high calibre talent I have worked with.","For a company that prides itself People are #1 Priority, HR process/framework sorely lacking.  People who get promoted to people manager, not the most well trained or coached themselves.  In my particular department, if you were someone who spoke your mind (Open, Honest, Constructive), potential retaliation ~ i.e. you need to toe the company line message.  It came to a point that for Employee Opinion Survey, many people will either lie/falsify their results or opt out to not take the survey."
748,LinkedIn,It's true - this is a dream job at a dream company,2020-04-06,5.0,Relationship Manager,"I am writing this review because I am bursting with gratitude for LinkedIn and this job. I have been in sales for almost 10 years now and this is by far the best job I have ever had. Here are a few reasons why: 

-As cliche as this may sound, the culture is the number one reason. From top-down, every day I see leadership and people below be genuinely good people. I have never had so much trust in leadership. They set the tone for the rest of us and it's a good tone. I especially see this during the pandemic and the incredible, people-first mentality everyone has 
-Incredibly generous benefits from compensation to everything else. The OTE may seem much lower than some other tenured sales positions but if you're good at your job, you can make a lot. Good behavior is very much rewarded
-The product - I feel so passionate about what we are doing, how we are doing it, and it makes me feel like I am actually helpful clients by selling. It's such a good feeling to have that. We have so many different solutions we can offer clients that make our job truly consultative. I am sure there is more to come!!
-I am currently reporting to the manager I have ever had. I don't think this is unique. LinkedIn is incredibly selective in who they hire and promote to leadership roles. I know I would feel similarly with other managers 
-A stable company owned by Microsoft. Feels nice to be here when the world feels unstable; the even better part is our company is doing everything  possible to help clients and the rest of the world during the pandemic 


I could probably write a novel on here but if you hear positive things, it's because it's true. Most of the reviews before me say really similar things. Before accepting the job I talked to a lot of people and they all confirmed what I had read. I can now say the same",I have never worked for a really large company before and didn't realize all of the red tape and inefficiencies that may come with it. An example of this is how we handle renewal protection.  No place is perfect

It's difficult in many orgs to get promoted. Lots of work to do, but little reward.

The recruiting and hiring process is SO LACKING. I've applied to several internal positions, and each recruiter I've dealt with knew absolutely nothing about me before speaking - and I mean nothing.

851,LinkedIn,LTS High Growth Relationship Manager Review,2020-02-27,2.0,Relationship Manager,"The people from the executive team down to entry level employees are, for the most part, very nice and exceptionally bright.  

LinkedIn is very gracious in how it treats its people and they prove this real time given the generous work life balance, on site food services, plentiful company paid holidays along with unlimited PTO.  

As someone who has a financially dependent family member for healthcare, I am incredibly grateful for LinkedIn's stance on medical coverage options and what they cover.  While most assume healthcare is standard these days, LinkedIn truly does care for its employees and helps take the burden off those that have special health circumstances within their family.","I should preface this with the general headline that I was misled during my interview process which created a negative first experience with my management team.

The interview process seemed standard: role play, 1 on 1 interviews and panel interviews.  I was rather surprised when I was lucky enough to reach the offer stage, that I would be reporting to a manager I had very little interaction with throughout my interview process.  I should have pushed back further on this but I truly valued the company itself as an employer I want to work for and figured I could make the situation work.  

The challenging part for me is trying to balance a long term career path at a company where I am fully support the vision and love the people, but have come to resent my manager and organization for the position I have been put in.  Some operate well in an environment of fear based management, I am not one of those.  Again, had this been clearly communicated in my interview process I would have rejected the offer but was misled on the culture along with who my direct manager was.

Additionally, I have grown increasingly disappointed at the lack of career interest from my manager and working with me to put a success plan in place to progress my career in a way that aligns with my goals.  Instead, I have to fight for time with my manager who would prefer to live out of salesforce all day and doesn't value the concept of human interaction which is strange given I am a sales rep who interacts with people (externally and internally) as part of my core job on a daily basis.  

Somewhat comforting is that I am not alone in this belief.  In 1 year at the company and this organization, I have witnessed a handful of people leave who have started after me because they too were lied to as to what the job entails and who the manager is.  This does not impact me directly, but I am sitting here puzzled as to how I was ""lucky"" enough to end up on a team where morale is near 0 while we're at a company where everyone seems so happy and grateful to be part of.

I would highly encourage anyone considering the opportunity to join this team or company to truly push your recruiter to confirm upfront who the hiring manager is for sure.  I understand that unknown circumstances can pop up and organization changes happen frequently; but I also know I am not the only one getting tricked into working for a manager that no one wants to work for because they cannot lead by example or bring the best out of their people.  

I was also sold on the tenure of leadership, only to find that my manager, and those on the same management team are comprised of first time managers who barely have more experience than the actual reps; some have less relevant experience yet still found a way into management.


Lastly, in the 4.5 quarters I've been part of the team, they haven't hit once.  While most sales leaders probably inflate the team's performance to candidates, this team is definitely not achieving 110%+ as was told to me during my interview process.  What's worse is that management does not shy away from hanging performance based plans over your head if you don't conform, even though 70% plus of reps are not even close to reaching plan.  Perhaps a revaluation of quota, accounts and go to market approach is needed prior to ruling by fear."

The leadership team does a great job of keeping the employees informed of what is going on including opportunities to keep learning and growing in your career. I feel I have the space to make decisions and improve things. I'm extremely grateful to be at such a great company that values investing in employees. 

Learning is an important aspect here. Offering us free access to LinkedIn Learning, teacher led courses and InDays, days give back to employees participate in company sponsored events or to take the day and spend it as you wish. 

During my time here, it's tough to find any cons. The benefits package was competitive and includes ""wellness"" money for reimbursement for gym memberships, massages, dog care or childcare. The offices offer breakfast, lunch, dinner (at some locations), snack, coffee, gyms, happy hours, game rooms, band rooms and I'm sure plenty of others that I am forgetting or have yet to explore.","This being the largest company I have worked for, as I have ramped, it's still challenging to navigate who does what, who you need to connect with to move projects, etc. There's a lot of process to get up to speed with, but I have seen my manager and others give new hires time to digest all the information and continue asking questions to process it all. 

Getting things done and clarifying roles and responsibilities can be slower, but again makes sense for a larger company.

It's a glorified corporate summer camp, full of bonding activities and events.","The BLP leadership team wants to attract top talent around the country. However, they do little to retain that talent. The BLP program scams college students every year, promising interesting projects and career development. This program is glorified sales funnel. The recruiters will tell you that you have the career mobility to work for a non-sales team and even convert full-time to marketing, operations, or talent strategy. However, this is less than 10% of each class. You'll be pressured to move into a sales team for a full-time offer as well as threatened to be moved unwillingly to Chicago (their sales hub). In Sales Development, you'll do the same thing over and over, 100+ times a day, every day. All the Sales Dev associates are extremely burnt out, bored, and unengaged. The only thing that keeps the sales machine going is LinkedIn's larger company culture. The compensation reflects how much the company values you... and most associates are supported by their parents because they cannot afford SF rent on the salary. If you want to keep great, top talent... give them interesting projects and the opportunity to have a meaningful impact on the company. BLP knows they can no longer recruit from top universities because these graduates almost always find better opportunities elsewhere. They've started to look at lower tier universities to increase their retention."

LinkedIn is at a great place where it can be selective and attract very smart people, but it doesn't have the arrogance in its culture that is commonplace at Google. I think a lot of this has to do with the company's leaders. There is not doubt that LinkedIn leadership wants to hire smart people, but the culture fit aspect is just as important. I also think our leadership team does a great job of keeping everyone excited about our mission. Connecting the world's professionals to make them more productive and successful is a pretty cool cause to get behind.","Every stranger you meet has an opinion about what LinkedIn should be doing with its product strategy and is more than willing to lecture you about it once they find out you work there. It's not that I don't care, I just have zero input to product strategy and don't like being attacked when someone doesn't like a new feature."

There is the good, the bad, and the okay.",2008-11-06,3.0,Software Engineer,"Great location, sport facilities, gym, people. You get free food as well.  Now that they have cutbacks, I'm not sure how much food is being minimized due to the recession.  It's mainly a Java shop with the exception of two other teams that work on Ruby on Rails and Grails/Groovy.  The build system definitely improved a lot.  It used to take 1 hour to build, but now about 10 minutes.  There is a lot of features and work to be done so no shortage of work or challenges.  Design patterns, coding styles, and performance awareness is standardized and upheld.   Most managers advocate quality code rather than hacked code.  CEO/Founder holds weekly, company-wide meetings open to Q & A.  It's really a great opportunity to ask hard-hitting questions.  Management cares about employees, but it might take time to realize things are going awry.  Most engineers that you talk to will help answer your questions.","Most managers are technical and lack management skills (soft skills). No bonuses as of 2008 and probably won't be until the recession is over.  It's growing bigger so there are politics going on.  Power struggles between managers and product managers.  Lack of documentation.  In order to learn existing frameworks, you would need to read the wiki (which may be poorly documented), reverse engineer code, or talk to another engineer from another team to find out how a framework or component works."
937,LinkedIn,Absolutely the best career decision I've ever made,2016-01-21,5.0,Manager,"The culture and values of the company are real. They aren't just posted on the wall, they are the fabric of the way we do business, engage with one another, and assess potential hires.

Employee opportunity and growth is a major focus of leadership and management. You are empowered to be open and honest about your career goals, what you like to do, what you don't like to do and where you want to go. If you aspire to be in a certain role, management will help you get there. 

Leadership is incredible. On the few occasions I have engaged with C-level leadership in a small group setting, I have never felt a sense of hierarchy. They are warm, they listen, and they truly care about the happiness of their employees and the altruistic vision of the company. 

We as a company aspire to do things that better economic opportunity across the world. It's a grand vision that each and every employee feels passionate about contributing towards. You can see it in the decisions that are made, the conversations that are had and in the way people here approach their roles. 

I can't say enough about how proud I am to work here.","Depending on what group you are in, stock options may not be as generous as other tech companies. 
Compensation is viewed as a full package, so be sure to consider the added benefits the company provides in addition to your salary."
938,LinkedIn,Incredible Company to Work For,2013-10-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I cannot stress enough how wonderful LinkedIn is to work for.  Each team acts rather independently of each other, and the motto ""Act like an owner"" is truly enforced.  

Incredible perks and benefits, including but not limited to a giant cafe built at the Mountain View headquarters that has incredible food everyday, breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  We also have a gym on site, and classes offered throughout the day, like yoga, crossfit, zumba, morning boot camps, and running trails.  We have bikes on campus, can work from home whenever you want, work whatever hours you want, take as many days off as you want, free massages once a month, beanbag lounge, video games, ping pong and foosball tables, guitar hero, and rock band for entertainment.  We also get full insurance benefits paid for, and 401k matching as well. 

Once a month, we get ""IN"" days where we work on something other than our regular job that helps our career advancement.  

I can't stress enough how incredible it is, my team and boss are really great too, which always helps.  Even though we can work from home as much as we want, I prefer going into the office to see everyone and experience the LinkedIn culture.  

LinkedIn is super organized and efficient, it really is a great place to work.",The ONLY con I have is traffic coming into work at the Shoreline exit off of 101 North.  I know this has nothing to do with LinkedIn nor is it their fault in any way.

The benefits are phenomenal, and the free food taste great.",Lack of diversity. LinkedIn's engineering is mainly asian.
