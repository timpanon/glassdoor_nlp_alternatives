1,MathWorks,Great place to work!,2022-03-31,5.0,Senior Program Manager,"We have a positive values based culture with open communication and collaboration. Our pursuit of excellence encourages new ideas, innovation, and process improvement. We are encouraged and there are systems in place to support staff driven initiatives and social responsibility. Our healthcare benefits are incredible, the investment in learning and training is superior, our home office headquarters in Natick is state of art , the people are genuinely good hearted people, and our pursuit of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging is a company priority.","We have two Natick campus', it would be nice to have everyone in Natick under one roof. Not really anything we can do here, but that would be nice. On the bright side, we have access to both campus' and MathWorks offers free bicycles during the warmer months to take a quick stroll in between campus'."
2,MathWorks,Not a diverse company,2022-03-17,3.0,Marketing Specialist,"At the individual contributor level, you work with some really great people.
Offering hybrid work moving forward
Product is very strong","This company has taken some hits in terms of turnover and overall lack of diversity, particularly in the last year or so. Leadership is a core group of the same people who have been in those roles for 20+years. Their culture is then strongly entrenched in the company, making it difficult to fit in.
The product is still very strong. It's more of the one way of thinking, particularly around culture, that needs to be more closely examined by people outside this core leadership team."
3,MathWorks,Retirement home for people with any initiative,2022-03-12,2.0,Product Manager,"Nice offices. Everyone gets an office.
Great food in the cafeteria.
Some good people.","Work is challenging, mostly because of how process-heavy everything is. Nothing is simple. You have an idea you want to pursue? Follow up with 10-12 meetings with committee after committee. You do something new? you may get your hand slapped. Everything feels set in stone. 
Pay is mediocre at best. 66% percentile is the goal.
Stingy is the rule: Everyone gets a Lenovo Thinkpad. Want a Mac? buy one out of your own pocket.
Lots of people punching a clock and doing 9-5, waiting for retirement.
Despite products that have potential, marketing is stuck is aging leadership.
Leadership overall is a cadre of 20+ year lifers who block any upward mobility.
The job you get can likely be the job you keep for years. No room for growth."
4,MathWorks,Lives by the core values,2022-03-26,5.0,Director,"MathWorks lives by its core values - particularly respect and invest, and continuous improvement. Jack (the CEO) has consistently put employees ahead of customers and short term profits",It sometimes feels like a process heavy environment.

7,MathWorks,Great company that cares!,2022-03-11,5.0,Marketing,"MathWorks is a very well run company with a wonderful social mission.

9,MathWorks,Offers a Stable Job.  Doesn't Innovate.,2021-10-04,3.0,Software Developer,"I was hired straight out of university and did technical support for 1.5 years. Made some lifelong friends and gained a breadth of knowledge in practical mathematics/analysis. Next 4.5 years was spent with a math-centric software team. 

I would recommend MathWorks for either starting a career in numerical computing or supporting a family. It is very difficult to move up or down the corporate ladder. You learn 95% of everything you'll ever need to know in the first 2-3 years.","While a job at MathWorks work is very stable, it comes at the price of long-term stagnation. Understand that MathWorks is a private company and has been run by the same person for 40 years. Most managers have been with the company for 15+ years and there is an emphasis on the ""slow and steady"" mantra. Both salary increase and career advancement are slow. After 6 years, I left as a junior developer -- the same position as when I started."

14,MathWorks,Good Place to work,2022-01-16,5.0,Software Engineer,"MathWorks has a lot of interesting products with massive amount of engineering requirements. There is always more work than the employee number. Engineering employees are highly qualified with almost everyone having a Masters degree or above. 

There is a lot of internal decision making and prioritization involved making before taking an action. Work life balance is also highly valued.","Almost every product has a massive engineering requirement but engineering innovation and improvement is not valued so much. 

Teams are now getting focused on improving developer experience but it still lacks as compared to standard software engineering firms.

Overemphasis on meetings causes a lot of employee fatigue. Employees are expected to work according to a spec."

22,MathWorks,A Great Place to Start and Stay,2021-07-05,5.0,Applications Support Engineer,"* Good Salary and benefits
* Everyone I met was great to work with
* The work feels important 
* The CEO is great and it feels like the company really tries to do things ""the right way"".
* There's a cafeteria right inside the building (for Lakeside and Apple Hill campuses)","If you want to be a developer, note that ASEs do development work only about half of the time with a team of their choosing, more or less. You do technical support during the other half (taking phone calls with customers, answering emails, and troubleshooting issues). However, there is an expectation that you will transfer to another team within about a year, whether that's a development team, sales, application engineering, education/training, or whatnot. Transferring out can take longer if you don't mesh well with the teams you work with or if the team you want to work with has few/no open positions. 

A whole bunch of ASEs were let go all around the same time as I was. We all had a similar experience; we were given a ""performance improvement plan"" and if we did not meet the improvement goals after 2 weeks, we could either try one more time for another 2 weeks or take a severance package. I heard that *nobody* passed the performance improvement plan. In retrospect, it seems that it was really a layoff but they just didn't want to call it a layoff for some reason. I wish they were more upfront about it. I consider this the one black mark in an otherwise great experience I had at the company."

Soul-crushing perfectionism — and I say this as a self admitted perfectionist.
Slow decision making processes. Trust has no place at MathWorks. No leaps of faith.
Long tenure of people means they often lack outside perspective or fresh thinking.

More than 50% of your time is wasted in call centre work dealing with customers who do not know programming and want you to debug their code.

 EDG engineers are pushed into testing roles(QE) if they do not find an opening. 

The pay and bonus is peanuts compared to other companies."
70,MathWorks,Mostly Great,2021-10-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The work-life balance is generally very manageable and colleagues have great attitude and are pleasant to work with.,"The benefits and compensation are slowly sliding downwards on competitiveness. Review process appears well laid out on paper per company policy but in practice it is very archaic and not transparent. Essentially the managers direct and skip level pre-determine the performance review well ahead of time despite what is stated on the review policy. 

Managers also have limited control over raises. After they predetermine the rating (which is not always necessarily unfairly rated), HR takes the rating and runs some algo to determine the raise. Despite good performance ratings that raise can be somewhat underwhelming and there is little transparency to the raise process as well. 

For such an otherwise great company there is little mobility to switch teams internally and the underwhelming raises cause some folks to jump ship for a better raise. This is a common problem in the industry but I think the company can try harder to be the exception to this norm. 

Lastly the company seems to be very hesitant on WFH policies and makes last minute decisions especially during the pandemic based on what other companies are doing. For a SW company already with a lot of collaborative remote work across global teams, I think there is a missed opportunity to be proactive and a trend setter in being innovative and flexible with WFH."

73,MathWorks,Great work-life balance,2020-11-02,5.0,Applications Engineer,"The company, starting with the CEO, treats employees as its core stakeholders. This belief flows down into everything the company does: the work-life balance, the benefits and facilities, the annual meetings, anniversary celebrations, etc. They've succeeded in making the company feel smaller than it actually is.

Good products and a very stable profit model. The company has continued growing through the recent recessions.

The company actually practices its Core Values on a daily basis and hires people who exemplify them. As a result, you end up working with people who are not only brilliant, but also great to be around.

If you love engineering and science, you'll get to work on great technology and feel like you're making a difference.","Base salaries are relatively low for the software industry (profit sharing and work-life balance make up for this in my opinion). The company does not adjust compensation for location within the U.S., which is a pretty good deal if you're in the Novi (Michigan) office - not so much if you're in the Bay Area.

(The observations below would be considered ""cons"" by some)

The company is relatively slow to move in the marketplace, taking ""measure twice and cut once"" to the extreme. They will intentionally make conservative choices to limit growth.

Promotions are entirely based on seniority, so don't expect to move quickly up the ranks. Note that annual raises are pretty good for high performers even if your job title doesn't change."

Mathworks has a lot of benefits and are trying to promote interns to get to know each other during work time for remote interns","No guanratee on the team you get placed on or work performed as an intern, could code new features or just make code tests"

97,MathWorks,The most amazing work culture been a part of,2021-04-02,5.0,Quality Engineer,"I have worked at 3 different companies and without a doubt Mathworks stands out. Right from the interview process and onboarding, it was a pleasant experience. In a world with low retention rates across companies, there is a reason Mathworkers stay here. My manager will constantly check with me if I like my work or not or how am I feeling which is more important that you think. Health and family are important to the company and that shows in their leadership meetings and how your coworkers talk to you. The compensation bundled with other benefits is definitely a competitive edge over $10k and toxic work culture at other companies",The use legacy tools and technologies can drive more ambitious people outside
98,MathWorks,"Good Work-Life balance, but less scope for growth",2021-10-04,3.0,Software Engineer,Good Work-Life balance and good perks.,"You can expect less/slow career growth in this company.

99,MathWorks,"Still a great company, but they need to evolve with the industry",2021-06-10,3.0,Program Manager,"When I first joined MW I gave a glowing review as this company was truly a breath of fresh air compared to the extremely high stress environment at most public tech companies.



Pros:
- Great products that really do make a difference in the world. I am proud every day of the work I do 
- More rational approach to growth
- Far better long range planning
- Process oriented culture (when its not overused) helps the organization execute better
- Management treats you like a person, not a number on the expense ledger
- Lots of great people and genuinely friendly environment
- Much better job stability than average for tech industry. This is one of the few companies in the sector that you don't have to constantly look over your shoulder for the next restructuring/RIF
- Annual merit increases are not bad for high performers
- Fringe benefits (retirement/health)_ etc very competetive
- fabulous facilities (but this hasn't been of much benefit for the last 18 months)","- Work/life balance took a massive turn for the worse during COVID. Management talks about taking time out, but the reality is all your peers work around the clock, emailing all hours of hte day and night and fill your calendar with non-stop meetings and you get glued to your chair worse than when we where in office. 
- Individual workload is very inconsistent. High performers experience the stress I noted above while other team members seem to just coast along and not be busy. But there doesn't appear to be a big difference in opportunities and benefits presented to high vs. low performers.
- Most of the tech industry has announced flexible/hybrid return to work plans but nothing but lip service here.
- Process is taken to an extreme here. measure twice cut once becomes ""measure 20 times, maybe cut someday if the right boss says its ok""... 
- Many of the great people that make this place fun are leaving due to burnout. I'm not sure what we are going back to in September.
- Base salaries are still very low for the industry.
- All the hype about the stakeholder bonus is mostly that - hype. Even with stellar reviews your annual rating growth is capped and hence bonus payouts never get much better than a single digit % of salary for 90% of employees. Similar performance at the FAANGs etc. earn equity bonuses that are a multiple of salary.
- Not handling global growth as well as they could. To much confusion over responsibility sharing across US, Europe and Asia development sites.
- Very complicated legacy internal tools slow us down and make it harder to move to industry standard DevOPS stack."

107,MathWorks,Couldn’t Be Better!,2020-10-09,5.0,Information Technology,"- Amazing, inspiring, bright campuses 
- Fantastic leadership 
- Well organized onboarding program even during Covid

Above are some quick points on what makes MathWorks a fantastic place to work. From the minute I started, you get the feeling that you belong. The company and campus body is so warm and inviting. You don’t feel like a number here, you feel like a valuable asset to the organization. Because of this, you always want to do what is best for the organization. 

Leadership, top to bottom is very well structured. You will get positive feedback on achievements and feedback on certain tasks you can improve on. This is so important because there is no “sugar” coating and really helps drive accountability which is displayed across the whole organization. 

If you are researching a potential job opportunity here during the pandemic, I will have you know - the onboarding process was INCREDIBLE (even remotely) it was very organized and it felt like it was a normal practice that has been in place for years. 

All in all, there is nothing but great energy, great ideas and great people found at MathWorks.",There really aren’t any I can think of currently. It’s just so lovely!

The market and technology are evolving in challenging ways. But I have no doubt MathWorks will evolve with them (even if a little slow) and continue to deliver value to it's customers in one form or another.

127,MathWorks,"Come for the opportunities, leave for better pay",2020-04-13,3.0,Finance,"Lots of non-monetary benefits (fresh fruit every morning, modern office space, relaxed culture, nice gym). Very deliberate planning (some complain this causes long delays in decision making). Easy to get involved in new opportunities, communication is clear and the company invests in good applications i.e. Teams, Workday. If you can stand to put in a couple years at low pay you'll likely be set up to get a much better paying job elsewhere. Benefits are great if you are already making a decent wage, but do not compensate from the lack of pay and raises.","Pay. For recent grads saddled with student debt pay is often the bottom line and you will not get it here. You'll get ""promotional"" raises while in a role, but if you transition to a role requiring more experience you will not get a raise and won't be told what you can expect to get. They get around this by not accurately classifying the role level. E.G. a role requiring 0 years experience is the same level as a role requiring 3 years of experience. The company can definitely afford to pay more but doesn't for unknown reasons. There are multiple managers in finance who put little to no effort into their job and there are no consequences because they've been there for 15+ years. You won't get to work your way up because no one wants to leave a cushy manager job with no deliverables. The CEO is very nice but no one understands the inflexibility on the work from home policy."

2. as a QE, you will only know how features work, once you find a bug, transfer to developers to fix. This will limit your skills as well.
3. overall, if you are passionate with coding and development, QE is not a good fit for you

Jack, the CEO, is humble and steers the ship with an expert and nuanced hand.","The documentation group diverges significantly from the values, culture, and technical quality of the rest of the company: management seems to have confused fear with respect. It is the patent toxic environment described in Forbes article ""The Real Reason Great Employees Quit -- And Bad Employees Get Promoted"".

Should your manager fear that your activities or questions relating to your job, the content of your work, or your product documentation's needs will threaten his or her status quo, you will be considered a threat, and will likely be targeted at a later point. 

You should not expect transparency or rational conversations; in management's perspective, you are replaceable, because your job description is to say yes to what they say, and then publish it to the web. This is likely because management fears that it is fundamentally replaceable, and in the group's self-definition, you cannot have a quality that your boss does not have.

Regardless of what's said in the job description, your experience does not matter, and colleagues in other departments will assume that you have no technical experience to draw on. Management won't help; showing respect or explaining ""why"" also threatens the hierarchical balance.

The work you do will never be assessed. The conversations you have with management will never touch on the content of your work. Any yearly measure of ""quality"" or ""performance"" will mean ""compliance"", or, loyalty. Ultimately, you will only be assessed on whether your personality resembles the personalities of the management team. Did you ever wish you were  a mean girl? Now's your chance.

If you value teamwork, creativity, and critical thinking, this position is not for you."

181,MathWorks,Great work life balance with extreme focus on micro-management and process orientation,2021-01-09,3.0,Anonymous Employee,This is a great workplace to get work life balance. One enjoys their own personal cabin. Fellow employees are friendly and easy to get along when working in cross-team collaboration. Extreme focus on process orientation helps in little to no surprises during feature rollout.,"Process orientation becomes a double edge sword. With the need to get approvals from senior management and processes involved during software development make the turnaround time from idea to feature rollout very high.

Salary is reasonable but not aligned with industry standards. It also varies based on product one contributes to. There is about a 10-15% difference between Engineers who contribute to Simulink (primary product) vs those to work on internal  and customer facing web applications 

Growth opportunities are very limited. Promotions are limited by yearly caps and usually provided heavily based in tenure and less on performance 

With a general low risk taking mentality, product innovations are limited and technology adoptions lags behind current industry standards 

Micro-management is a common theme across the company which limits the freedom and responsibility on the employees

There is a stark difference in how the EDG program is marketed vs the reality. Although its a great platform to get hands dirty into different tools, technology and business domains for fresh graduates, Besides a few teams, Internal engineering teams treat EDG employees with little to no importance; providing projects on legacy applications that none of their teams members are willing to take"

- Good work-life balance. You can put in extra work, but it's really up to you. This is true at least in my department. The story seems different in development.
- Good company culture. People are mostly down-to-earth and friendly with the exception of some senior folks who carry a bit of ""inner circle"" hubris.
- Another culture thing: You can always find help.","- Slow moving product that is losing traction to open-source and programming becoming more ubiquitous in science and engineering fields.
- Hiring mentality that everyone is replaceable, which leads to lower salaries for tech and a critical mass of mediocre hires who are largely not independent and motivated.
- Development mentality to use as little resources as possible to deliver minimum viable product that checks a box. For example, ""yes, we do deep learning. Here's *a* solution"".
- Marketing departments specifically lacking in ""doers"". People constantly looking to defend old-school standpoints and justify slow development action to avoid doing any significant work.
- The praise I have received from management has always been on small one-off projects unrelated to my main job rather than what I consider to be my most significant and rewarding contributions.
- Location is in the suburbs, a little ways out of the city."
202,MathWorks,Best place to work,2021-01-17,5.0,Quality Engineer,Awesome work life balance. Get to learn a lot. Have plenty of opportunities in the company itself to learn and grow more in your career,Cannot think of any cons
203,MathWorks,Engineering Development Group,2020-10-13,3.0,Applications Support Engineer,MathWorkers are friendly people and outstanding engineers. You will learn a lot working here and many of your coworkers will become friends.,"The MathWorks is a great company but the Engineering Development Group is seriously flawed. These cons apply only to EDG and not MathWorks overall.

In EDG you are in a technical support role. On a typical day you log in to the phone queue at 8:30am sharp. You can't sign off until 5:30pm. Sometimes your manager will listen to your calls. You have a scheduled lunch hour. You message your coworkers to tell them you are going to the bathroom. About once a month you get late shift, meaning you answer calls until 8pm. None of this is explained during the recruitment process.

Each day you are either ""on support"" or not. You will quickly grow very tired of technical support and time away from it is precious. There is a shadow economy where engineers swap shifts so that they can focus on professional development or take bit of personal time.

When you are in EDG you are laser-focused on transferring out, which often happens after a year or more. Transferring entails applying for any of the non-EDG openings that are listed on the MathWorks careers site. You have to interview for a permanent role and you will compete with both internal and external candidates.

Your EDG manager gives final approval on your transfer. Occasionally, a hiring manager will make a job offer that is shot down by an EDG manager. Engineers feel pressured to take any opportunity that presents itself because they are afraid of being forced out by management and because they have been exhausted by the tech. support schedule.

EDG engineers are too talented to sit this low on the totem pole. They need to be given the whole story before they join."

Even though the company has good goals and objectives, it is enshrouded by their 2 release cycles a year. Simulink is their cash cow. There is lot of pressure to get things done in a less time but with great quality and in the way they demand. 

There is lot of focus and emphasis to learn MATLAB LANGUAGE which is good for nothing if you plan to leave the company. I had decent skills and C++ and I had to loose everything I know.

Management doesn’t like any new ideas and if you say anything against your boss be prepared for a PIP, which is a legal process to kick you out.I got a PIP  and I just quit on the same day. Now I work for a Fortune 46 company. I feel I wasted 1 year of my life. Don’t join simulink groups at all. 

Last but not the least. They boast about Glassdoor reviews and all but the fact is your career progression is not based on your talent rather it is based on the number of years of experience. 

I strongly suggest don’t waste your time if you want to grow in your life. After all it is a good for nothing company and is going to have a tough time in the future to come because of AI."

236,MathWorks,The ugly shadow world of MathWorks documentation,2020-10-27,2.0,Technical Writer,"Product teams are generally great. Smart engineers, everyone highly educated, not much politics, focus on making great products. They understand the importance of documentation, because some of them worked in EDG (tech support). They make the job of a writer fairly easy.

There are lots of great writers who take responsibility and want to help you with your work.

I would rate the company four out of five stars, but the documentation group two out of five stars.","The technical writing and documentation (doc) management and organization have some serious issues, which outweighed the positives for me at the company. 

Although you work with a product team for all of your writing work, you are managed by a doc manager from outside the product team, who has little expertise in your subject matter. Talking to them in weekly meetings can feel incredibly pointless and unhelpful, depending on your manager. These weekly meetings, and most of your interactions with your manager, are about enforcement, not support: making sure you are doing your job. 

Management insists that new documentation projects have a requirements analysis process that is far too heavyweight. Management constantly emphasizes the need for requirements analysis, aiming to create better documentation, but they wind up obsessing far more over the process than they do over the product. Basically, to write new documentation, you have to fill out a huge amount of paperwork first. Much, much more than the software engineers even do, which is downright silly. Your productivity can feel incredibly stifled by the paperwork. This process probably saves the bottom 10% of writers, who need the paperwork to know what they're doing, but for the other 90%, it makes your job probably two or three times as tedious and provides little value. 

Most of the emphasis of the doc group, outside of your day to day tasks, is on following processes and guidelines .. and creating new guidelines. There are endless guidelines for endless different tasks, with the stated aim of bringing consistency and high quality to the writing. In reality, if you're already a capable and competent writer, than these guidelines and processes wind up fostering a culture of intense micromanagement and control. There are guidelines for the most basic of tasks, like writing examples (does someone need to know guidelines for how to write and document a hello world example?) There is an enormous database of policies, procedures, and guidelines, and writers are given special projects to constantly expand and develop new guidelines. 

The way that first-line managers treat their writers is wildly inconsistent. Some of them let their writers mostly do their own thing, whereas other managers are control freaks and want things done exactly their way.

There are good managers and bad managers. Some of them are friendly, supportive, and helpful. Others seem to mainly be self-serving, looking to further their own career, squash disagreement, minimize time investment, and make sure you are a good horse for their work cart.

There are endless tiers of doc managers, who often seem to contribute little as they have basically no writing duties. The number of new managers is constantly growing, and there are many, many managers with many different sub-managers. All this makes the key staff, the writers, seem grossly undervalued and underappreciated. Great writing and documentation product is rarely if ever singled out for praise. The emphasis is all on following processes and guidelines and making your (multiple) managers happy. 

Many of the more senior doc writers have little to no technical background. Which is not a problem in and of itself, but shows that the culture has had a strange evolution. Jack the CEO or someone higher up clearly let go of the doc infrastructure at some point and handed it off to somebody else and (mostly) forgot about it. 

Working at doc at MathWorks can be like working in a strange shadow world, supposedly paired with the product teams but shackled to an huge and dominating, extremely bureaucratic organization."

For reference, I supported over 30 developers and owned over 200 unique doc pages, a project to shift our presentation of the doc in our space, and several side projects.

2. Documentation is one of the positions where you form closer relationships with the development team you support than your own manager. Because your manager is not embedded in the work with you, it can be a challenge to convey the impact you have on a daily basis. I found it hard to adequately impress upon my manager the value I added day-to-day. 

3. I would have liked to stay at MathWorks for many many years, however when I requested a transfer to a satellite office, it was denied (satellite offices are almost exclusively for customer-facing folks). Needing to make the move for family reasons, I gave my notice in February before COVID. My last two weeks I successfully worked remotely due to COVID stay-home orders and the company continues to do so 4 months later as of the time of this post.  

There are writers in Natick, MA that support teams overseas. The difference in having a development team in Natick and a writer in elsewhere in the U.S. is lost on me.

I wish more consideration or discussion had evolved around the transfer."

Ignore the positive reviews and read the moderate-to-negative ones.

In my experience:

- The culture is corporate, cut-throat, and pretentious (e.g. coworkers are ""colleagues"")
- High pressure, low pay
- Lots of code (20 million+ LOC), very little documentation
- High micromanagement, low autonomy
- Managers will scold you for talking with your teammates about anything not related to your immediate task
- Managers treat your estimates as commitments
- It is improper to suggest new ideas unless you've been there several years
- You'll leave with few transferrable skills because all of their tools are custom-made
- Despite claims to diversity, the workforce is largely Indian"

2. Huge technical debt and things move very slow. 
3. It's sometimes difficult to understand what's going on as it's still under process to decide which methodologies to follow and which technology to stay with.
4. Don't expect a quarterly bonus in the first year. It's either a zero paycheck or very minimal.

345,MathWorks,Self motivated and self driven but still chill,2019-10-10,5.0,Engineer Developer,"Self-motivated: MathWorks is a company ran by a lot of self motivated people who just want to do more for themselves and for the company. To me it feels like a lot of the main work we do are chosen by the ourselves rather than being ordered from top-down. This could be more so because I am in the Engineering Development Group. 
Chill and helpful colleagues: But at the same time, the people here are pretty chill. I think it is because MathWorks is doing a pretty good job in the market and has a strong foundation; and probably also because the company is rather conservative and slower paced. (Definitely not as fast paced as Tesla or other younger companies out there) I also want to mention we have a open door policy of helping others out. I often go to other colleagues office to get some help and vice versa for things I am good at.  
Learning: I think learning was also one of the core values our company hold. We are encouraged to better ourselves by taking courses, self paced learning, book clubs, et cetera. 
Own office / self paced: Everyone gets own office! And things are done at your own pace.  
Impact the world: And last but not least, MathWorks products are pretty popular around the engineering/science community. Feels good to know our work has a big impact for making the world better.","Salary: The pay is not bad really, but I think it can be better! 
Chill: MathWorks is a pretty firm company that has been around for some time. So it is not fast paced as the other young companies. So this can be a con for some people who want more aggressive and sprint-type work culture."

Profit sharing that has paid out for decades. Challenging Work. Great colleagues, intelligent, educated, driven. Diverse culture. Flexible dress code (i.e. silicon valley casual).

Although we all sit in our own offices, we have an open door policy. Whenever I am stuck on a problem I know I can always go to my coworkers for help or advise.",One of the main downsides I have experienced is is there is no work from home policy. While it has its pluses since the office is always full of staff. It can become a pain when you have to use time of because you need to stay for some reason but are healthy to work.

I love coming to work and facing challenges together. It's a rational work environment and a culture of respect for one another.,MathWorks can move slowly at times. Measure twice and cut once.
367,MathWorks,Fantastic place to work,2016-09-27,5.0,Principal Programmer/Analyst,"I've been with MathWorks for over 15 years, and have never seriously considered leaving.  While many companies espouse guiding principles and core values, I've never seen a company that actually lives them the way MathWorks does.  Management is both responsive and open-minded.  The atmosphere is relaxed but the work expectation is top-notch.",Consensus-based decision-making can be frustrating on occasion.
368,MathWorks,Great company with integrity,2019-09-24,5.0,Marketing,"The company values, culture and outlook are all great - they really seem to care about their employees and the business is strong.","It takes a long time to get things done. Sometimes this is intentional and other times it's because people are comfortable doing things the way they are used to doing them. Not a major con, but definitely something to get used to when coming from somewhere with a faster pace."
369,MathWorks,Too slow,2019-07-20,2.0,Senior Engineer,"The company gives a lot of nice perks, free breakfast and cookies, annual weekend outings, random celebration events.","The company moves so slow letting process get in the way of progress and losing ground to open source. They dominate a few industries, but try and cover too much ground with tew few resources. 
Company has a very top down approach which slows things down further and prevents any innovation. Even the office chairs need owner approval. Company has almost 5k people and only 1 makes any decisions, simply inneficient.
No career growth to be had unless you are a fresh grad.
Many people seem to be here for the ease of life, but if you want to challenge yourself and grow look elsewhere. If you want to simply cruise mode your career and are willing to sacrifice growth, this is the place for you."

Everything you create will be reviewed by others, which is both a plus and a minus. The upside is that you will do better work because of that review.
The interview process can be demanding. I am an experienced worker and put 40 hours into prep for the many interviews I had @ MathWorks. Extreme? Maybe, but I knew a great opportunity when I saw one. Being very well prepared for a job interview here is a very good thing.

Great culture, great food, a very caring organization to work for. Working here is akin to the culture I've seen when visiting Google. Work pace is very measured. This is not a start-up culture where people drink ten Red Bulls and work till midnight,  then trash half of what they did the following day because they were up late grinding stuff out.

If you want that manic culture, (which hey, it can be fun), this is not a place for you. MathWorks wants more heat than light if you get my drift.

Just come here knowing you'll be asked to do your best- this isn't a good place to coast, it ain't possible.","Not much to complain about. If you saw the benefits, the work /life balance, beautiful offices, etc, you would count your lucky stars, like I do. Seriously. People here complain when the latte machine is broken, boohoo. Those people simply do not remember what the real world is like outside these doors. There's no reason not to work here, unless you would prefer an insane start-up culture."

Over the dozen or so years I have been here, I have pretty much written my own job description.  Small side projects became larger projects, become job requirements.  I have not had a manager give me 'an assignment' in the last 8-9 years.  It is a very self-directed environment.

That said, I think people come in with weird expectations:  It is not high school, you don't get a promotion every year.
