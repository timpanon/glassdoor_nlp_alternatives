0,Meta,Best employer so far,2021-11-09,5.0,Software Engineer,"I’m still a bit new, but I have very good impressions so far. I have 10 years exp at 5+ other companies (although no other tech companies) and this is the best by a good margin. 

First off, everyone is nice here! Yes, folks are ambitious, but there is a shockingly small percentage of jerks here… not sure exactly how they are weeded out, but I’m grateful for it!

Lots of small benefits and well-run systems give the overwhelming feeling that this company just generally has its sh*t together. Shuttles, good food, good internal chat and groups system, not too many meetings or emails (much better than other companies!), great tech stack and automation, etc etc. 

Pretty good transparency and communication with leadership (e.g., weekly CEO/CTO Q&As). They are open to feedback and change when needed, without too much unnecessary reorg-ing and pivoting. Good examples recently are moving to annual performance reviews after years of complaints with 6-month cycle, decoupling Oculus and FB accounts, and killing facial recognition. 

Comp is fantastic, and relatively standardized within levels. Engineers don’t have different titles between levels, we’re all just software engineers. This was weird at first, but is a really cool feature that discourages dumb hierarchies. 

Work life balance is totally reasonable in my experience, but might be different on other teams. 

Mark is great, I don’t really understand why folks dislike him externally.","Some risk with new company direction. The metaverse shift is gutsy. It seems like a reasonable move, but if it doesn’t pan out, Meta might not be the same tech giant in 10-15 years. 

Like any big company, it has its share of internal koolaid/propaganda (but criticism/feedback is still welcomed and discussed openly) 

The (largely overblown) negative media coverage can lead to some family and friends judging you a bit for where you work, if you care about that sort of thing."

Meta (Facebook) has so many strengths in being able to impact billions of people across the world, and it builds amazing products that are changing the landscape of computing with Quest and future products.","Outside of Instagram, Whatsapp, and Reality Labs Research, there is still a lot of skill gaps in deep product conviction and craftsmanship. There are so many leaders, Engineers, Product Managers, and designers doing things to make a metric, a revenue/retention/growth number, or move up in their careers and personal success. This means that sometimes, solving deep product problems on the behalf of customers, with 100% focus on making their lives better and building something great is hard to get through leaders and build. This creates pockets of politics that feel disconnected from making our customers happy. It also makes it feel like we'll do anything to maintain growth and numbers against competitors taking share from us rather than asking if a fast follow copying of features is good for the heart and soul of what we're good at as a company and what will make the job our customers hire us to do in their lives fulfilled even better."

The greatest aspect of working at Facebook is that everyone is very motivated and very smart. The problem with this is that they all expect the very same of you.

94,Meta,Career-Changing Opportunity,2022-01-25,5.0,Project Manager,"• Meta is an incredible place to gain experience, work (and network!) with people who are at the top of their fields, and grow your own skill set—IF you invest the effort and time to make it happen. 
• Many employees have the chance to work with people from all over the world, in an environment that encourages different perspectives. 
• I never thought someone like me would belong at a company like this—but I feel welcomed and encouraged, and I'm grateful to have learned so much (personally and professionally) from my coworkers. Never would've believed I'd feel this way while starting remotely during COVID, either!
• Most managers at Meta really want to be managers; folks aren't promoted just because it's the next most logical step in their career. In my experience, this means most managers are supportive, want to see you succeed, and are invested in helping you grow your career, not just in furthering their own agenda.
• Comp & benefits are amazing. WHY DID MY GUIDANCE COUNSELORS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE NOT TELL ME ABOUT RSUs??? That is all. 
• Having Meta on your resumé will open doors in a way that name dropping few other companies would.
• The support Meta provided throughout COVID has been exceptional, with flexibility and leave options that have helped me deal with remote learning, childcare gaps, and more. I've repeatedly told friends how lucky I have been to have joined Meta just before the pandemic.","• There are high expectations. ""Move fast"" isn't just a value — it's a description of how we work. If you like rigid work structures and aligning to predefined goals without questioning or re-assessing them as you progress, you probably won't thrive in the Meta environment. 
• Because of this constant flux, it can be hard to take PTO or maintain a consistently good work/life balance. This honestly depends on your team and manager, as well as how good you are at prioritizing. (Hint: Get comfortable saying no.)
• Constant press leaks continue to threaten the previously ""open by default"" culture, complicating some teams' jobs (as they react to announcements vs. prepare for announcements)."

Diversity & Inclusion: They are struggling in this arena like the rest of the tech industry. Many teams & leaders are trying to push this forward across recruiting & different functions in the business. As much as we improve the numbers, there isn't much movement higher than the VP level, and we're losing as many folks as we're bringing in.

Code quality tends to be poor. To be fair the product isn't exactly critical to the day to day operations of the world and FB being down for a few hours isn't going to kill anyone.

It is apparent that there is no management support for this role in any form. The role was created in an attempt to fool regulators and stockholders into thinking that things are changing at facebook. The mission of facebook is to misuse private data and the role is an attempt to distract the public from that fact. I am an h1b, much like most facebook employees, and i am threatened with being booted from the program whenever i attempt to protect customer data from being exposed. If anyone from management is reading this i sincerely believe facebook is the proverbial boulder rolling down a hill with too much momentum to stop the downward slide.

Coverage for leaves falls on existing team with little to no empathy or support.  You're expected to just make it work and figure it out. There are no tradeoffs or prioritization with goals. Because nothing drops off the laundry list of priorities, few things actually get accomplished and the cycle repeats year after year. Meta is turning into a corporate behemoth that's too insular to accept and act on feedback from users, employees, etc...

Facebook’s cafeteria provides employees gourmet meals to indulge. Are you ready to fill your stomach with incredible delicacies such as roasted chicken with garlic lemon butter, beef surgo with pappardelle pasta, and spicy mushroom broth?

The Disneyland-like Main Street
When you’re not in the mood for gourmet, your destination is Main Street. Here, you’ll find outlets and food trucks that serve burgers, ice cream, Tex-Mex, and barbecue. You could experience the cozy ambiance and nice features when you hang out with colleagues.

Almost Everything is FREE
The company provides incredible employment benefits such as healthcare services (medical and dental), laundry service, salon, bike repair hub, company shuttle, and twenty-one paid days off. It includes generous parental leave, by-popular-demand-to-expand gym, and a bank.

Creative Distraction
If an employee needs time for a creative and fun distraction, the company has a woodworking workshop, and a print shop for them to extract their creative juices.

If you want to join big happy companies, such as working at Facebook, offer it all you have. Get the most effective and efficient executive resume writing service to ensure success in your career. Check our website to view our process.","Open Workspace
Facebook encourages you to be yourself. Ironically, the company designed the office as a no-wall workspace policy, which you may find uncomfortable and lacking privacy.

Buffet-at-Work
The open workspace provides picnic-style tables, where you can sit shoulder-to-shoulder, with limited space, and gives no privacy. You will be rubbing elbows with colleagues… literally!

The Facebook Employee Stereotype
Most people expect Facebook employees to know everything on the site. You may still receive questions and hear complaints from people even outside the workplace.

Executives Who Discriminate
An anonymous former Facebook employee claimed he had his worst working experience in the company. He said higher-ups treats him like trash, gives him minimal guidance, and hands him inappropriate tasks such as sorting the director’s laundry.

The “Holier-Than-Thou” Attitude
One source complains that CEO and Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg and COO, Sheryl Sandberg are both self-righteous. He claims they spend too much time on “extracurricular activities.” The said source also accused the two of copying-off competition; for instance, the poke that resembles the one on Snapchat"

The perks are amazing, free food, free healthcare and the resources you have are the best.","Being a white male with a African American wife.....during my time at Facebook I was called racist, insensitive and bias. It was frustrating to go home and tell my wife instances at Facebook and then get her opinion saying I said or did nothing wrong. Over and over again I was looked at as the enemy when I had no intention of hurting anyone. 

Being a white male at Facebook you are looked at as the problem and reason that is bringing a certain race or ethnicity down. During my bi annual review I was told by my Asian manager to work on toning down ""Your White privilege"" during meetings. Excuse me? If my wife had a manager that asked or accused her of taking advantage of the fact she's black there would be lawsuit. 

I am not a racist, I or my parents, grandparents or great grandparents have never enslaved anyone. In my eyes everyone is the same and deserves a fair shot, but at the end of the day all white people are not bad and allowing people to blatantly accuse you of being racist without repercussion is what Facebook 100% supports and at times promotes though the classes you have to take as a employee.

Facebook has a policy that someone of color should be interviewed for every position, which is fine but I witnessed several times Asian and African American managers completely ignore someone who was white and more qualified and gave the job to someone of their own ethnicity. Out of the 10 times I saw that happen, 7 of those people were eventually fired cause they just couldn't do the job.

In summary, this attitude that white people are the root reason why every other ethnicity experiences problems is just flat out sad. Then it is taught and supported by companies like Facebook, which only separates us further. Out of any group there are bad apples, but that is no reason to come up with a blanket opinion and then teach that from generation to generation, that is the exact opposite of progression and being united.

A direct quote from my father in law (Who is black) ""Above being just black, more importantly I am an American, where you can make anything of yourself if you stop coming up with excuses and just get to work, white people are not the problem and we need to stop teaching our kids that they are""."

- From the git-go, there wasn't even honesty about the job description, or even title, during the job interview. On my second day I learned that the position had a different name and dept than what I had been told. 
- There was absolutely no training for a highly complex role. We were just told to read the wikis. Except that a lot of things didn't exist in the wikis and you just had to go at it and hope it worked, and that any mistakes wouldn't set your projects back too much. 
- Despite the above, there was absolutely no leniency for taking a bit longer on your first projects. You were held to the same timelines as other team members that had been there months or years. 
- You were also held to the same timelines despite rapid changes being implemented to the system that caused weeks-long delays (e.g. longer review processes.) Somehow you were just supposed to compensate for them. 
- Expectations were not made clear at all - you didn't know you were failing at something until you were being told you could loose your job. 
- Rabid management that provided no support to you. The only purpose of my weekly meeting with my team lead was to be reminded that I could loose my job if I didn't produce enough. The manager would routinely flip out during team meetings and put a team members' position in question - in front of the entire team - for the smallest of mistakes. 
It was one of the most hostile work environments I've ever experienced. I literally ended up coaching multiple team members on how they too could leave their roles during my last week."

433,Meta,Lives up to the hype,2021-09-21,5.0,Technical Sourcer,"• Great people. Humble, collaborative, and passionate. Just working alongside my colleagues brings me joy

• Autonomy. Fb gives employees the freedom to make impact with very few (if any) bureaucratic guardrails. They trust their employees to make impact, so if I feel passionate about something I do it -- instead of first having to ask permission like I've been used to. 

• Diversity & Inclusion. FB doesn't just talk about the importance of DEI, they put the resources in place to actually make it happen. They have clear goals for the company to achieve diversity across the board (including within Leadership) and the provide proactive updates for how we're tracking. 

• Perks. The legends are true, but after more than a year still finding out about new benefits. Wellness award is my favorite and can be used to reimburse expenses for whatever helps you recover -- whether it's Spa Days, Ski Trips, or even an Apple Watch for tracking fitness.

• Career Growth. With the hyper growth opportunities for professional growth are abundant. 

• Too many others to include, but wanted to highlight some of the things beyond the normal 'glitz' you hear about (#Freefood #FacebookForty)","• Fast-paced, constant changes. While I personally love this about FB, I recognize there's a 'comfort' in knowing how your systems will operate day-to-day / week-to-week. With innovation there will be some misses, and if you don't have patience you will get frustrated.

• With the fast pace, you need to be proactive to expect career growth."

- Lots of flexibility and autonomy
- Good COVID policies
- Great people in the Boston office","-Work/life balance can be an issue, although that is very team and Org dependent
-It can be difficult to find good work. As a senior engineer, you are mostly responsible yourself to find the right work and projects to forward your team's goals. If you choose poorly, effort and execution won't matter.

Product Design Pros:
Robust design systems, design expertise/protocols, and many new inspriring ways of working

There are some of the most amazing women there and some very good humans. Key word is some though.","Where can I start...the list is mega long. Should I start with the horrible recruitmentli/team placement mistake that caused major setback after setback. Yes, they put me on the type of team that they swore they never would. The really bad manager accountability, who prefers to be more of a boss vs. a leader. Or could I address some of the most ruthless and two-faced narcisstic coworkers with the most severe case of unconscious bias and fat egos you will ever encounter? Or is it really their fault or the company culture that made them that way? 

Its kind of like Squid games, but then you remember that the people you work with don't actually come from the most desperate lives who need to be fighting for their lives, just people with severe personality disorders/power trip and ego issues. I've talked to several designers on my team who were not happy, severely stressed, and felt super disparaged."

Free food was better before covid but still not too bad.,Toxic management and work environment. Constant shuffle of contractors leaving so lots of time spent training people that could be spent doing productive work. Most of the actual work is done by contractors because all the FTEs just sit at home and pretend they are working. Heavy workload because of the high turnover and lazy coworkers. You are given work goals that are physically impossible because the management just made them up then you are held responsible because you didn't change the laws of physics to meet their whims. Zero career opportunities given to you by management. Don't dare try taking time off for personal reasons. You are owned by the management and your only reason to exist is to work hard to make them look good.

- Highly collaborative culture
- Excellent internal tools

- Lots of flexibility for defining your own growth path.","- A small group of vocal employees are creating a lot of internal pressure for more and more speech censorship on the platform.

- Virtually infinite learning opportunities. There is always some new technology to learn. You will never be bored.
- Compensation is excellent. There are few places that would pay an engineer more.
- Perks are amazing. And I haven't even tried the free food yet. (We're still working from home.)
- Fast paced.
- Engineers have extremely high autonomy. Engineers usually decide for themselves what projects to work on.
- Employees are very optimistic and regard most problems to be solve-able. We are always trying to innovate and improve.
- The middle-managers are some of the best I've ever seen at any company. They respect people and seem to really care about their well-being and career goals.","- Expectations are very high. You have to be strategic about how you spend your time because there are so many expectations that it's hard to satisfy them all if you just do random work without thinking about how it matches the expectations list. This is kind of an annoying cognitive burden to constantly deal with because no one will directly tell you what to do. (See the point about autonomy, above.)
- If you like to be methodical or process-oriented, it can be frustrating at times because Facebook is the opposite of that. Most activities are ad-hoc and documentation is usually terrible or non-existent. Tools and infrastructure randomly break and you frequently have to troubleshoot them yourself.
- Software reliability is not the best, which means you frequently will be pulled into putting out some fire or preventing a crisis, rather than working on the thing you would prefer to work on."

- Constantly have to walk on eggshells. They have an internal anonymized micro aggression reporting tool. If you end up on it you can be fired. You can be reported by anyone, for anything they feel hurt their feelings in any way.
- People will pretend to get offended by something you did as a means of politically attacking you or trying to discredit your work. If someone claims to be offended you don't find out about it, they go straight to your boss or to HR."

- Feedback and Transparency - We have a very open and transparent culture here. This allows us to work quickly and efficiently. Being able to drive important conversations with each other has been key in driving healthy collaboration and workplace relationships. 

- Employee Value - FB Leadership really values their employees. This is demonstrated not only through all of the amazing benefits and work; but also the care and thought that goes into making Facebook and our work culture healthy and exciting. At the end of the day, I feel valued as an employee which makes me show up to work each day wanting to work hard and make positive impact for the people we build products for and the company itself.","Large public companies always seem to be in the spotlight.

- Compensation is hard to beat
- Really good free food in office
- Cool offices with fun amenities
- Vast majority of people are very empathetic and smart
- Ability to change teams fairly easily","- Super toxic high achiever culture (there tends to be an attitude of ""Facebook isn't for everyone"" if you don't meet the absurdly high and intentionally ambiguous standards, even if it was for reasons outside your control)
- So much saying one thing but literally everything pointing the opposite direction (e.g. ""we're a strengths based company! just focus on your strengths!"" but performance evaluations are designed to evaluate uniformly and will hyper-focus onto the smallest weakness while ignoring strengths that balance it out)
- Facebook's idea of diversity is only skin deep (i.e. race and gender). They completely turn a blind eye to other forms of diversity like disabilities, neurodiversity, age, culture, etc when it means that any action needs to be done to address unfairness and implicit bias.
- Expectation to promote within specific timelines until E5 but the timelines are fairly short and don't take into account different learning speeds
- The higher level software engineer you are, the less you get to code and the more you're expected to project manage. Honestly I'm not sure why Facebook bothers to hire PMs if they just force engineers to project manage anyway.
- Performance evaluation system was designed to be as ""fair"" as possible by evaluating against uniform standards, which ironically makes it extremely unfair if you don't conform to the average, even if your coworkers and manager chain think you're delivering impact and providing unique value that would be hard to replace
- Talks a big game about work/life balance but there really isn't much because of how much it invades into your personal life
- Your success is almost entirely based on your manager because that's how it was designed. If you have a bad manager, you're SOL and your only options are switching teams or dealing with it. It's also common to have many manager changes and it's not that unusual if they only stick around for a half, leave, and then you're ""managed"" by an overwhelmed skip who probably won't be able to represent you accurately at performance reviews or make much time for you.
- So many damn re-orgs and it scrambles everyone except directors so much but they don't care because that's their impact for the half"

* Most of them are friendly and respectful enough despite you may disagree with them politically or culturally or on work matters
* Extremely good amenities, perks and compensation. Google is the only one that can match FB on most perks
* Pretty much everything is built in-house. so there is some way to get people help you/fix bugs instead of bugging an open source community which may never want you patch","* WLB is not great if you come in not knowing a particular language, say, C++, because debugging through any codebase can be very tough
* Many things to fix at FB, so you will be easily distracted and can put risks on achieving impacts on your primary goals for the half
* While in-house tools are great from a ""please fix it"" approach, it's also usually come at the cost of usability and stability. We really could use more help in making tooling accessible and useful
* Impacts is go big or go home. Everyone is obsessed and measured by impacts. This could be cpu win or engagement metric move or power reduction or productivity. But ultimately we are chasing the big stuff in the name of promotion, and forget we need to grind through the small stuff that are actually most important to a healthier WLB and relaibility."

Lies are horrible. Facebook taught all wrong lessons in life: for example, everything the upper management says should be interpreted as the opposite. 

There is a stack ranking, where 10-18 percent of employees are slated to not meet expectations at the review cycle. Facebook officially denies doing this, however it is in every management training and most managers are admitting it. It is in management tooling! 18% - it's like triple the Amazon's.

For mid-career professionals (L5-L6 in particular), advancement is tougher as the company gets bigger/evolves; seems like there are more growth opportunities for junior levels (in terms of promo: L2/L3) and senior levels (in terms of new areas of learning/expansion: L8/D1+). For SOME people, the high ambiguity, fast pace, and 99% self-determination of one's career will not fit their personal preferences. For me personally, it works well. But I have friends at the company who are quite frustrated/unhappy due to the lack of tops-down order and seemingly chaotic shifting of priorities and strategies.

- healthcare is one of the best I have seen 
- majority of the people I worked with were amazing and fun to be around","- FB knows they are on the line to create a diverse workforce and have been struggling for a while with it. With all the ""effort"" going into mass hiring of BIPOC, there is little to no consideration for how to retain. There is constant censorship on the intra-Workplace conversations, discrimination during PSC, and worst the silent exiting of employees that frame BIPOCs to be resigning. All the hush money they offer exiting employees help keep up the facade
- With such rapid growth, inept individual contributors were forced into management positions and now they spend all their time trying to keep their friends at the top and everyone else in desperation to advance. This also means there are far too many bad managers 
- HR is a hot mess of incompetence whether it was related to PSC, career growth, everyday issues
- The Kool-Aid FB forces through their infrastructure keeps many brilliant employees blinded from their true potential of getting competitive pay elsewhere."

It is very difficult to get selected for this job, so this is one of my most memorable accomplishments. You're not really in until you've trained and passed a mock call. Definitely not an easy mock call. Not alot of my training class went on to continue working there. The work environment was relaxed, business casual dresscode required, but it just felt easygoing on the floor, not all high stress, high powered call floor where everyone is yelling sales stats and talking crazy to a potential client to get the sale. They continued on the job trainings as necessary. There were many opportunities for lateral moves, and promotions. Sadly, the reason I had to leave was because of a family emergency, that became an ongoing issue.","What was offered to potential clients may have been a bit too costly.

- Metrics driven culture
- Global impact
- Lots of teams to choose from","- Terrible WLB: This depends on the team but generally FB hires less people per product compared to peers, so the amount of work is always high for PMs. Privacy, compliance, integrity, policy and similar regulatory stuff, albeit much needed, has added a ton of work, but the expectation of shipping fast is still there. Which means no WLB. Many 15+ hour days in a month are common.
- Low growth: Hard to become a people manager in this company unless you’re really lucky.
- Leveling is a total mystery. People who advance are usually those whose managers are willing to give them a great review at any cost.
- Middle management is filled with old timers who've never worked anywhere else, or some people who probably got in because they knew someone. Decision making is horrible leading to a lot of teams with tons of churn and low morale.
- No patience to build lasting products. Projects that need nurturing are shelved and the only ones that continue are those that Zuck personally cares about. You have 6 months to show massive progress, or else your product is done. 
- Reorgs are as common as oxygen at FB. This causes a ton of headache to have to re-start every so often.

FB fosters quite a friendly culture. At least, on the level of engineers. Semiannual reviews partially evaluate how good your relationships with the colleagues.

FB is very good at employee retention. Management will try hard to find interesting projects for you. Lots of projects that may bring a great impact. Quite unique projects at scale. 

Lots of pocket communities with interesting activities.

Good compensation.","Lots of big politics around the company. There is always pressure from the government, society, the media, and even from own employees represented by a vocal left-leaning group. You will also get the part of this pressure as an employee. 

Noisy environment. Sometimes it's good to have people around, but often you'll find yourself distracted. The company likes open spaces, MPK 20 is a living nightmare, though MPK 21 was designed better.

No digital nomad options, except big work-from-home mode right now.

Code quality is diverse. Some open-source libraries/frameworks are brilliant. Check folly or react. The non-public part totally depends on the team.

Proper architecture and code quality can be big problems.

There's a strong emphasis on social networking as a means of getting things done.

Creative teams across the company are very white, and mostly male. While I'm excited to see more roles open up in Facebook for creatives, I worry that it affords teams and management opportunities to hire more white people. Instead of bringing in someone with a different experience that is talented and deserving of an opportunity. Sadly, I've seen BIPOC candidates get shortlisted, only to not make the cut for arbitrary reasons. 'Not a good fit' is a poor reason for someone who spent the time interviewing with us with a stella portfolio. I worry that teams are only bringing in certain candidates to meet some sort of quota or to appear ""exhaustive"" in their search, just so that they can hire another white person. I'm tried of observing these performative acts of diversity from creative leaders across teams and hope that this changes. We can do better, we should do better."

Make no mistake, however, working at Facebook is not easy, and it's not for everyone. In my mind, these things are still pros, but definitely need to be called out - super fast-paced, high bar for excellence, a ton of autonomy and freedom, and huge opportunity for impact. The opportunity is there to do amazing things at Facebook, you just have to grab it.","Although we are a very large tech company, sometimes we still think we are a start-up. There are processes that one would think should be in place by now that are not. Ways of working can be complex with lots of gray areas that can sometimes slow work down.

The company is very unprofessional in its working style where there is little teamwork and many people who try to dump the hard work on you while they chase revenue gains for the review cycle. There is no real career progression and management will do musical chairs and swap your role. I only got to do what I thought I was hired for 18 months.

No matter how big of a fish you have been in previous ponds, you will be a small fish here and have incredible space to grow. There is incredible freedom to pursue the projects you want in the way that you want as long as you can defend why they are important to the company. While less than it was in the past, there is incredible transparency and accountability from leadership internally. Your manager will support and promote you in a way that is unprecedented at most other companies. Most importantly, the work you do affects millions or billions of people - even seemingly tiny tasks like making the app update 1 second faster or tweaking a model to deliver 1% more interesting content can have a large positive impact on the world. While it doesn't always succeed, the company takes diversity and social justice seriously and it shows in project initiatives and hiring.","It's a big company with entrenched (if sometimes informal) power structures. As much as people try to be transparent, there are backdoor politics that affect your role and career that you might not learn about until much later, if ever. There will be constant pressure to specialize - many of the new skills I've developed here would transfer well to other big tech companies, but be wasted at a startup. Work life balance can go sideways quickly unless you protect yourself zealously. Even in the ""move fast (and we no longer say 'break things')"" culture there is a lot of pressure to not mess up in ways that affect the public negatively - even small mistakes in privacy or integrity have terrible negative effects on potentially millions of people."

2. Top pay for DE among the world and top promotion speed.

3. Good company culture. Very open and free inside the company. Managers are nice. They are helping you and your career, not manipulating you.",Strong infrastructure and data tools solved most tech problems for you. You only need to perform business logic at most time in SQL.

There is also a drastic lack of diversity in leadership, everyone above me was a white guy, and they all thought very highly of themselves. 

Facebook is not a good place to work if you're a parent, there was no empathy for having to take time to deal with kid things during COVID when my partner and I were both working full time. My manager stated that Facebook might not be a great place for me as a parent. I was also penalized for taking time to pump. Leadership doesn't care about issues parents are facing, or issues people of color are facing."
1602,Meta,Best place to work at,2020-09-14,5.0,Product Marketing Manager,"- Lots of autonomy
- Amazing benefits. 
- Individual goals are well-defined and strong performance is well-awarded. Big investments in reviewing performance of employees minimizes the bias and politics. 
- You will be challenged on a regular basis so you need to continue up-leveling your game.","- Bottom's up culture gives a ton of autonomy to teams and individuals but on the flip side projects that require collaboration across multiple teams are quite difficult to prioritize and execute.

Salary, benefits, and perks are incredibly generous. Facebook employees will complain about things that most employees elsewhere couldn't dream of getting.","Work can sometimes be monotonous, a lot of people have the same issues.

In addition to your work helping others, you are given projects each half to work on- which sometimes feels like you have two jobs (Support Techs are hourly and while overtime is allowed, you sometimes feel you don't have enough time)

Watch the episode of the Simpsons where Homer goes to work for Hank Scorpio. Sometimes it feels a bit like that- would you be comfortable working there?

Our experience shows us that new uses of interactive technologies have the capacity to expand and strengthen relationships. We continue to make progress engaging the expanding population that lives online, through social media and the increased use of mobile audio and video conferencing technologies. Today’s collaborative tools deliver tailored content and messaging that is available and accessible to Department employees, and shareable to members of the public and foreign audiences.","he Department produces and stores vast amounts of knowledge and data every day. Managing these elements requires centralized knowledge repositories and standard data elements to reduce duplication, facilitate sharing, improve accessibility, and automate workflows among bureaus and offices. Not only will these repositories serve as a portal to shared knowledge, they will expedite our ability to reduce the number of paper-based processes and records. Improving knowledge management will increase our capacity to enable faster retrieval and more accurate results."

1637,Meta,Amazing,2020-09-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Leadership is phenomenal. They truly care about people and have an incredibly strong ethos and value system. 
- The candor and openness of culture (which can be con in trying times - see note below)
- Caliber of talent. I have truly never worked at a company where there is such a high minimum bar for both competence and kindness.","Given Facebook's historical ""move fast"" and autonomous culture, there are a lot of byproducts that make it more difficult to work here than you would expect at this size of company:
- Disparate tooling ecosystem and preference for homegrown tools over enterprise tools (which has lots of positives, but in many regards it means reinventing the wheel and bugs)
- Siloed teams working on similar things, but not knowing of or talking to each other

The other main con is information overwhelm. As a social media company, Facebook is in a unique position to influence and have a stake in social issues that have global impact. For better or worse, that means divisive opinions in the world coexist and are surfaced within the walls of the company and all over our internal workplace. It's hard not to get caught up in this and ""focus on work"" when a lot of what's been surfaced is so deeply engrained in what our product does and/or how our culture should be."
1638,Meta,Bureaucracy and politics galore,2020-10-01,1.0,Data Science Manager,"Salary is top of the industry 
Benefits, food, amenities are top-notch","Endless bureaucracy - the amount of time spent convincing leadership and XFNs that something is worth doing far exceeds the amount of time spent doing it.

Politics and turf wars - multiple teams are competing for ownership over the same decisions. Directors will employ their teams as pawns to gain turf and evaluate them on their ability to do so.

People treated as competition, not partners - FB will intentionally pit peers to out-do each other, seeing this as a motivational tactic.

Churn and turnover - as priorities, ownership, and methodologies change, those part of the prior regime are cast aside.

Contractor (ab)use - tens of thousands of contractors doing work indistinguishable from FTEs, being paid less and without benefits and fired at the drop of a hat."

1643,Meta,Big Tech company that's still learning what that means,2020-09-07,4.0,Software Engineer,"- The engineering culture is still very bottom-up: teams generally have a lot of power and responsibility to determine what they work on.
- Internal developer tools are a huge focus. Anything which slows developers down is fixed if possible.
- Very good internal mobility: bootcamp means you have a good deal of leeway in finding a team, and, after a year internal mobility is encouraged.
- Tons of opportunities to make millions of peoples' lives just a little bit better. Like it or not, Facebook's products are used by over a billion people worldwide. There are few places where improvements and fixes can have such a broad reach.
- Lots of intellectual challenges: There are many types of challenges in building products for billions of people: technical (scaling and perf), product (how do you make it useful for everyone), regulatory (how to not fall afoul of privacy regulations), security (how to minimize badness that happens due to the products), and more.","The biggest challenge facing Facebook right now is that it is simultaneously too big to run the way it runs now (with teams trying to fight for impact and all hacking on the same products), and too small to fit with the well-intentioned goals that Mark has for all of the ways that Facebook can help people.

A company without any strong sense of unifying purpose tends toward bloat and stagnation. It feels like this is the direction Facebook is heading. The amount of infighting between teams around responsibility and ownership of new features is growing and will only keep accelerating."

It's tough leaving one job for another and but the support that you get, the inclusiveness, and the overall willingness of everyone to help you onboard is honestly a great feeling. It feels like everyone wants you to succeed and that everyone buys into the idea that there's enough sunshine to go around. I've never been at a company with those values.","Onboarding is tough.

It almost doesn't matter what products you work on. Whether you agree or not with what's in the media - you have to be strong and focused in order to do your best work. Bottom line - it's easy to get distracted with it being a company in the middle of so many worldly issues - but this right here is the place to do your most impactful work.

Pay scales are based on your geographic location as well as experience so you are able to afford to live where you live. 
The health benefits and perks are the better than any other company I have found. 
Promotions are based on ones impact, not tenure, so everyone is hard working and cross functional relationships contribute to your efforts rather than hinder them.","If not in product development or engineering at times your team can feel like an after thought for issues like mental health concerns when dealing with graphic content and adequate headcount to get the job done.

1720,Meta,"A great place to work, but a lot of moving fast for no good reason",2020-07-01,4.0,Program Manager,"Pretty good/ competitive salary 
Excellent health insurance 
Solid name recognition for future jobs
Top notch perks","Leadership moves from crisis to crisis to crisis. The attention focus is relatively short on the hot issue of the moment and that trickles down to every org. You can be working on the number 1 goal or project from Jan - June and knock it out of the park. Then by July everyone's attention has shifted and your work is no longer relevant. A lot of institutional knowledge is lost this way. 

The company skews young as well, so there are a lot of inexperienced people who want to make their mark/get their promotions and they work hard but don't get the guidance that would help them work smarter. The result is that some teams take ""done is better than perfect"" and ""ask for forgiveness rather than permission"" to another level, which can make work tedious. Almost everyone comes from elite schools and has great stats so some really lean in extra hard into making themselves stand out, sometimes in ways that aren't the most useful or healthy. 

There's also a hierarchy Technical people on top, then Business people (cause they make the money) then lawyers then everyone else. People in ops often are at the bottom of the totem pole.

Transferring internally can be especially challenging, as there are no extra considerations for internal hires."

- They place a huge emphasis on doing recruiting projects. If you're not doing a recruiting project, forget about being promoted. Doing excellent recruiting and closing lots of roles is NOT enough.

1780,Meta,Is FB the standard?,2020-05-11,5.0,Employee Relations Partner,"The compensation is good but you'll spend most of it paying for housing in and around the Bay area. Also helps that you can offset your food expenses at home if you eat on campus. I'm based in MPK so the on/off campus perks are a plenty. You got gyms, an onsite dental / eye clinic, a massage therapist, an acupuncturist, access to campus Ubers and shuttles, the many many food cafes, sweet shops, food trucks, dry cleaning, Ship-It, a nail salon and barber shop, a bike rental/bike repair shop, and if you need to learn how to bike lessons, you can get that too. AR/VR, a print shop, ERO groups, life-style sessions, micro-kitchens - God I miss the micro-kitchens, the numerous off-site perks and discounts, the Dogs@FB Workplace group, the Tiger King@FB Workplace group, the Sad Meals WFH@FB Workplace group, no formal dress code, a park on the roof, ginger shots, Mark's weekly Q&A, other Q&As with various leaders and world experts, work from your desk or work from some random spot, the library, the product vending machine, the FB 15+ cause of how much you'll eat, the health benefits for a single person with no dependents, company stock and 401K, company products (Portal, IG, etc.), and company swag. Yes this is a real review and no I'm not being paid to vomit sweet nothings. In truth, I've never worked for anything like FB and I've worked for some top notch companies at different phases in my life. I love my team, my peers, my org, my leaders. I know it's going to be hard for me to find a replacement should I, someday, decide to leave FB. And while I realize FB isn't rainbows and unicorns cause it has issues, anytime you have people of different ages, genders, nationalities, political leanings, etc. in one place you're going to have issues but its pretty damn close to perfect. I'm over 40 (I feel 20) so I understand that for others my outlook may be a bit different and hell who knows in a few years I may feel different about the company. One thing though, I don't regret the interview loops nor my decision to leave another top tech org in the Bay area. I look forward to FB's evolution and seeing it continue to be successful.","PTO is alright. The Performance Review process is stressful, feels like I'm prepping to take the SATs, GREs, LSAT or MCAT every 4 months. I'm saddened by the prospect that one day I may no longer view FB as a glorious place and like others pursue other shiny objects in hopes of making more money with less effort."

To give you a sense of the problem, most economy class airline seats are wider and more plush!"
1861,Meta,DS review,2020-03-31,4.0,Data Scientist,"Great work culture 
Great people 
Work on why you like - you will be judged on impact of the work",The company and its people have a highly left political bias and it shows up in conversation around the workplace.  so how are we supposed to be impartial when treating content or views from the other side.
1862,Meta,Horrible terrible company with worst culture,2020-03-23,1.0,Software Engineer,"Free food, good salary, hype","At Facebook I got to know what ""gaslighting"" really means. Gaslighting is exactly what is the culture that is imposed top-down by management. It starts at the bootcamp. There, you'll be properly brainwashed how cute and cuddly Facebook is, how unfairly it is being treated by everybody, how great and kind the Czar and his ruling gang is, and how grateful and privileged you (a despicable useless worm) should feel to be here! Right there, in the bootcamp, they will start the abusive treatment by telling you ""why on Earth did we hire you? You do not submit any code during last 24 hours!"" This abuse and fostering of your impostor syndrome will keep going on. Typical Facebook-style management is when you are being repeatedly told ""I have no idea how did you got here, and if how come you were not fired yesterday - but OK, we'll give you one more chance"".  This is part of this culture! 
There is a STACK RANKING! It's in tooling, in manager training materials! The fact that Facebook officially denies doing it is a yet-another confirmation that this company doesn't shy away from crime. Stack ranking means that all colleagues see each other as a competition. When I started my job at Facebook, my closest colleague didn't want to talk to me, because he knew that the better I succeed, the worse is for him. This is very profound and affects everybody: it's a hostile work environment. 
Performance reviews is a complete sham. There is one ""axis"" which is related to your actual performance. The other 3 (three!) axes (direction, etc.) is a complete baloney, and can be used to justify ANY rating for anyone. All managers are deeply ignorant schmoozers. 

Cult means there are plenty of taboo topics for which you'll be fired. There are, for example, internal ""non-managers"" groups, which are patrolled for any signs of dissent. If a person posts anything out of line there, this gets straight to his manager and HR. 
HR is the worst people I've met. They enforce the authoritarian rule ruthlessly and with cynicism. 

Working at Facebook has permanently damaged my faith in humanity. I realized that people can still do horrible crimes, given enough brainwashing. That people can treat each other like animals, given stack ranking.  I wish I never joined this scam of a company, a lousy swamp filled with ghosts who pretend to be humans!"

- Deadlines can be tight depending on business needs

One of the great things I love is being able to work on software engineering projects in Austin for Facebook.

That is no different than any other company but it can be night and day here.

Generally here are the Pros
- People: Majority of the other Facebookers are of high quality and surrounding yourself with other smart people can only up your own game.

- Benefits: Positive package here overall. They take care of your health, make some life task much easier and try to make life more comfortable.

- Technology: Innovative mindset is a big plus but recent years have been more mirror moves with competition to gain an advantage. Good move but for those that want to break the glass into new frontiers, you got to pick the right team.

Impact: The opportunity is there for you to embrace.","Generally here are the Cons:
- People / Culture: There is a small minority of leftist that can be loud and push activist agenda's that are in your face. While my own goals can align (leftist) I don't like their approach. This is just society creeping into the corporate world and is seen across Tech in general. It can be toxic and extremely disrespectful. You might find more of this at Facebook due to the nature of the product. Imagine the rest... Pick your team wisely.

- Weak Leadership: Lot of new leaders... Experienced leaders may not have much experience with trouble shooting negative situations and come in with a bias. Another point here is the number of Re-Orgs. You might experience multiple changes within a quarter / half and this can drag on for years.  

- Negative news cycle ... it can be draining but it should be a wake up call to further innovate for a product for today. However... this news cycle is long... I mean looooooong and can be intense at times."

- Looks great on a résumé","- Performance evaluations (PSCs): We talked about PSCs year-round, and it felt like every little thing I did (positive or negative) would show up on a PSC. Employees are technically assessed on many aspects of performance, but the only one my manager focused on was lines of code.
- Competitive culture: Constantly talking about PSCs meant everyone on the team was afraid of any appearance that they did something wrong, which created a culture of blaming others and never admitting mistakes. Managers either stayed out of it or made it worse.
- Workload: My tech lead set deadlines that were too aggressive and didn’t listen when my teammates and I pushed back, so we were constantly behind schedule. Working late at night and on the weekends consistently was required just to remain a few months behind schedule.
- Asking for Help: Several members of my team had to ask for help writing code many times per day. Most of their questions could be quickly solved by typing a few words into a search bar and looking at the first result, but they still asked another engineer any time they encountered something they didn’t already know how to do. They would intentionally not ask managers and avoid asking for help while managers were within earshot."

1947,Meta,Excellent Place to Work,2020-01-10,5.0,Production Engineer,"The opportunity that Facebook offers for autonomy and career growth is incredible; coming in as a new grad PE I have the opportunity to grow based on merit and performance, not time in the role. 

Flexibility in when I work, how I prioritize my projects, and the scope of my work is invigorating and makes me excited to come to work each day. The company is mission-driven to a great extent, and I have been impressed with the way we have owned up to prior mistakes and fixed them head on. 

The Production Engineering role is well respected within the company, and the importance of reliability and scaling increases as our services reach more of the world. As a PE you will gain the knowledge necessary to build and operate real hyperscale systems capable of providing services to billions of people.

My team is comprised of some of the smartest, experienced engineers I have ever met - some of which have been building Linux services since 0.01. Even though sometimes working at Facebook feels like drinking from the proverbial fire hose, I am grateful I have the opportunity to learn from some of the top people in their field. For example, in bootcamp I took a command-line efficiency class from Jim Meyering, one of the maintainers of coreutils and also a Facebook employee.

Many other people have commented on this, but the perks and compensation are still top-notch. The company helps take care of your life so you can focus on work while you're working.","Facebook hires the kind of people that expect a lot from themselves. Despite some reports, you do not need to work long hours in order to succeed at Facebook. Bootcamp gives you the chance to find a team that matches you well, and new hires should come in intending to join a team where they can both find balance and grow in their career.

The company is growing and there is some sentiment around slowing down, but most engineering teams are still bottom-up driven and innovating in their space. The things we are doing around privacy and AR/VR are on the bleeding edge and we are strong leaders in these areas.

On the other hand, ironically, there is also sentiment around moving too fast as a company. Since we are people- and product-focused (as opposed to engineering-focused, like at Google), our primary goal is to impact the lives of people for good. Sometimes this means we opt for rapid prototyping over beautifully designed code. However, we are doing much better at recognizing better engineering work such as cleaning up code and improving monitoring, especially in the PE role."

1950,Meta,Know what you are getting yourself into,2019-08-18,2.0,Production Engineer,"Facebook is a good company to work for. They pay well. They have great perks. At the beginning, life is good.

Facebook rewards ambition.","The appeal quickly wears off. Your experience at Facebook highly depends on the team you join.

Facebook does not have the best people managers. If you join a team with a good manager who knows the system, you will be more likely to have a productive, prosperous time at Facebook. If you join a team with a bad manager, your work-life balance will be horrible. You will feel extreme pressure with the Performance cycle review every six months. Worse yet, you may even blame yourself for what's happening, not realizing the role your manager plays until it is too late.

Facebook is a good company for new college graduates. Even with a bad experience, you can learn so much about practical, applied technology here. For those with several years of experience, or with family commitments, be careful. Come into Facebook with a clear sense of what you need from Facebook that you cannot get anywhere else. Be prepared to leave when that is delayed, or not a possibility, or comes at a cost to your family or external commitments.

For most people, Facebook is not a company that you join and happily work at for the rest of your life. Facebook is a temporary stop that will squeeze as much productivity out of you as it can. When that stops, it forces you out or makes you want to leave."

An experience at this company will open many many doors for you, it will be much easier to get phone interviews. You will also learn a lot.","The culture is pretty bad and the performance review system is a joke. 

Unless you abide 100% by their culture, you can't be happy. This means you are not allowed to even question their principles. If you think something needs to be fixed at the root cause, you are in trouble, because you need to Move Fast! The company over-focuses on the short term speed rather than long term. 

I was lied to multiple time by management. I was told my rating depended on the reviews from my peers, but then when the perf came, I realized it is 100% up to the manager regardless of what your peers say. My manager told me constantly I was doing great, then perf came and because I questioned the principles, I had a bad rating. The 360 was useless, management can use if they want to promote you, but if you are not in great terms with your manager, the 360 will be ignored. 

I was also told multiple times, the company is impact-based and that what matters is impact. After working on a project with another manager, I was told I could not get any credit, since it was not 100% my idea."

I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the ""Pros"" as I see them...

- Leadership:  Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.
- The Culture:  The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.
- The People:  Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.
- Management:  Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.
- Benefits:  Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.

Granted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.","Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.

Being able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue."

Rampant hostile political atmosphere
Team leadership and IC's will undermine and berate service team members to push their agendas forward.  This is often overlooked by leaderhip and results in burnout and lack of empathy from everyone.  This in turn produces subpar results and half-baked solutions.  No one wins.

Sloppy processes
It's a benefit of a doubt to even say there are processes.  Most of the internal processes are poorly documented and no one has or wants to give time to onboard new hires (see comment below on the culture driving self-absorbed motives).  Getting anything done is 60% figuring out the best way forward, 20% fighting off the political backlash from making said decision and not the one the loudest stakeholder in the room wanted, and 20% is actually spent doing the work.  So much waste.  No concept of agile or the fundamentals of development practices in parts of Community Operations.

No humanity in the human facing part of the org
Working in Community Operations often felt like working in a call center.  People often don't care about their work and they don't care to look beyond the ""what's in it for me"" philosophy running the show to see the people that the organization is supposed to help.  We're talking about posts around some of the worst stuff out there- and the lack of empathy around it is nauseating and explains alot of the trouble Facebook has been getting into.

Custom everything means sloppy everything
So many of the internal tools are custom- even the ones that don't need to be!  Often the tools are under supported (or supported by a staff that isn't willing to take feedback) so you end up with subpar tools supporting a massive company that is in desperate need of some tools that are built with intent and full functionality behind them.

Culture breeds self-absorbed motives within people
Facebook's culture is oriented around ""impact""- what impact did YOU have this performance evaluation period.  It's not enough to say that you helped remove content that was harmful to minors (as an example unrelated to my direct experience).  The impact needs to tie back to numbers- how many lines of code, how much money was saved, how many productive hours were saved-- not one of the questions asked is about how it helps the PEOPLE that use Facebook.  It is all inward focused on the individual contributor- and as such the individual contributors act accordingly.  There is not team oriented thought or conduct in my experience across Community Ops.  There is only ""What's in it for me?"" 

HRBP are often ill informed on processes and policies and rotate like the second hand on a clock
You never know what you're going to get with the HRBP group- some are warm and empathetic others are very clearly only there to protect the company (meaning they'll pigeon hole you into a defensive position).  I didn't have a great experience with them and even in my exit process they got details wrong- like really important details.  Kind of disappointing. 

Middle management is hijacking the company for personal gain and Upper Management hasn't caught on yet
When I hear Mark talk- I see someone who really does believe in the mission behind the company- to make the world a more connected place.  But I'm not sure that he or his team see the snakes in the grass that are not aligned to that mission and only looking for ways to achieve their personal gain.  It's frightening given how much power and authority Facebook has and I really hope that this issue is sorted before things go to far."

- switching teams is low-barrier; hackamonth concept allows for a two way try out (team/you)","- constant negative press associated with the company 
- mandatory promotion to E5 with a “you’ll be fired after 36 months if you’re not on track to get promoted” policy
- data oriented to a fault, at times. everything has to be proven to others; experience and believability weighting is lacking 
- tricky to achieve work life balance since expectations are high and the pace is fast"

Fast promotion if you can work long hours. 

Fast paced environment, you'll get to learn new stuff all the time. Lot of smart engineers around.","With fast promotion comes fast firing. It's up or out policy up to a certain level. 

Not a good place for senior engineers joining. Too much stress in the team driven by performance reviews, which is the most aggressive that I've ever known. Emphasis is on individual impact, due to which there's lot of distrust within the team. No stack ranking, but a curve is implemented a org level. This is not a big deal in other companies but here it means 'out'. Managers main job is to write performance reviews, and this often leads to micro management that can be extremely frustrating to senior engineers. 

There's lot of work duplication, most managers (even directors) ignore it as performance reviews is all about impact. Most engineers know that everyone wants to write code and make impact, so ignore the code duplication.

Some teams are hiring just for the head count, not much impactful work. This becomes a problem for senior engineers as they have to invent work or get out. Before joining a team check out their roadmap for at least a year.

This is a good place if you want make money at the cost of WLB. Not a  place to be innovative, which inherently carries risk and takes time. It's a risk because if there's no impact you'll be fired. Most of the engineers work to satisfy performance reviews. My work is determined keeping performance review as the guideline.

But company will be fine, lot of good engineers capable of quickly delivering a fix or hack a feature."

I was given amazing tools and resources to do my best job, and allowed a LOT of freedom right off the bat to work the best way I knew how. If you come from work environments where you're used to people directing you at every turn, I have found that Facebook is not like this at all. You are expected to take the initiative and dive on in. It's sink-or-swim at times, but if that's what motivates you, you're in the right place. The good thing is that you are surrounded by so many intelligent people, the vast majority of whom are willing to help, especially when you're new.

Benefits are out of this world, from healthy meals to gym and wellness reimbursement, resources for mental health/therapy and much, much more.

2022,Meta,Great company to work at - do not believe to different news,2019-09-12,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I work in company for 6 months, but I like how company works and operates. One of policies is an openness  - this includes famous weekly Q&As. Senior management tries to explain the background behind decisions, so you know why one or another thing had to be done. 

In general everything focuses on making product which would be better for customers. There were a number of mistakes makes with privacy perspective, but there is a trend to improve this. This is very good approach - instead of hiding mistakes, company focuses on fixing them. After getting an offer I was not sure to join the company because of its reputation, but being inside I figured out most of this is an exaggerations to make a hype in news.

Work style is very flexible - you want to deliver new things, to make an impact, but from another perspective, it is not demanding and it is far from sweat factory in some other companies. It left time to learn something, you can attend many meeting remotely. Work life balance is very good - it is difficult to improve it without affecting the work (someone should do the work, right?). 

There are a lot of young people around (ex-students, but usually with great knowledge), but also there are still a number of experienced people - so aging doesn't seems to be a problem at FB.","Work style is open space. Many new buildings are awesome, while a number of old buildings are depressing - dimmed lighting, gray ceilings. Some buildings have a quiet policy, but for others it is not so good.  I'd recommend remodel old buildings (hack, paint ceiling to a white, so it will reflect the light, install better lighting, work with designers!),  split large rooms into smaller, team-sized rooms, add more VC rooms so people could easier get on conference call without disturbing others.

Another minus is hyper-concentrated campus in Menlo Park. It is difficult to find a good, reasonable-priced rent in that area. It works well for young people, but for families with kids there are a lot of other factors to be taken into account, so Menlo Park area just doesn't work."

-Facebook says they care about employees and they truly mean it.
-The company is testing a social experiment, in which they harness the benefit of you being your ""true"" self at work (no dress code, relaxed and fun atmosphere, freedom of thought/expression, etc.) Instead of reducing your personality to fit a workplace standard, you are encouraged to be yourself. By allowing you to be ""100% you"", Facebook believes that the energy harnessed from this as opposed to ""80% You"" will lead to better overall company success long term. I completely agree with them!","-Freedom of Thought/Expression and the platform in which to share it, leads to scattered ideas spread EVERYWHERE.

- beautiful campus, good snacks, foods, and benefits","If you are a data scientist, you need to really care about two things:

- Impact. Unlike SWE, who can prove their impacts by finishing pre-planned coding projects and rolling out pre-planned features, data scientist does not automatically get credit if you only finish beautiful analyses. You have to suggest eng team to apply your suggestion from analysis, and prove how much of the product growth are from your analysis. So sometimes your impact can be subjective.

- Skillset. You may be asked to do a lot of ad-hoc analyses from eng team, which I am sure are very important and can guide engineers whether to implement certain features, but that will prevent you from doing some deep dive analyses and learning some new techniques in data analysis. Maybe after a year or two, you will find that you did not build any statistical models or haven't touched any machine learning. But that's the skillset what other companies will ask for when you apply new job. Who cares you did how many ad-hoc analyses or AB test or wrote how many data pipelines. It's the fancy machine learning model that will earn you respect.

* The decaf coffee actually tastes good - seriously, I miss Facebook coffee so much","* Your job satisfaction (and your salary) can change greatly depending on where you are in the company. My technical title was substituted with a non-technical ""specialist"" equivalent that paid less, resulting in a 20% bump in my salary when left, despite downgrading from a ""lead"" level position at Facebook to a ""senior"" level position at my current job.
* Management is often promoted based on seniority rather than competence.
* ""Most fast"" mentality leads to duplicated work, lack of documentation, and general confusion. Senior ICs are expected to spend much of their time project managing to make up for the failure in organization. I often found during requirements gathering for a project that part or all of it had already been done elsewhere and everyone had simply forgotten about it.
* The culture of open communication makes it seem like employee feedback is valued and encouraged, but actions are rarely taken on that feedback.

The above issues weren't as bad when I first joined, but my last year there was a nightmare filled with so much toxic stress and bad politics that I regularly broke down crying when I got home from work.

- By default, almost everything you ship is used by a lot of people
- Benefits are really good","- You work all the time. It's impossible to truly step away from work. I had dreams about FB projects until about 3 months after I left.
- If you don't end up on a good team, or with a good manager, you're out of luck in terms of ""upwards"" movement and ""impact"". It's really a dice roll unless you're privileged enough to select a specific team.
- Facebook itself is a well greased machine. It self-enforces a lot of its own problems we're seeing the outcomes of today due to how it works. It's unlikely to change that anytime soon, so if you don't like how FB is unable to predict externalities in its work at its scale, you'll be upset working there
- Working at FB is a bit like having blinders on. You're so dang busy and shipping things all the time, it is not conducive for you to think about the big picture and (related to above) the potential butterfly effects/externalities of your work. Many well-intentioned projects end up having disasterous consequences, but I'm confident that 99% of people out there, if they worked on the project, would've also been unable to predict the fallout. The prime example here is Instant Articles, which was a design-lead initiative to give select news partners the ability to make their articles load fast and render ""natively"" in the mobile apps (spun out of Paper after that got shut down). I can assure you that all the team wanted to make was a beautiful interface — it was lead by a product designer — and none of them would've wished to kill ad revenue/contribute to ruining journalism. You can argue that Instant Articles was one in many many steps FB took that ultimately shifted the ability to make money off of news ads from newspapers to FB itself, and lead to today's massive journalism layoffs and click-bait culture (if ya can't get clicks, ya can't get ad views, and ya can't make money). If you ever met the Instant Articles design lead, you'd know all they care about is a good design and polished interactions. But it turns out, just caring about that means you aren't thinking about the potential damage your product can do 4 years down the line."

- Many people do not get hired for roles in different departments or functions simply because they didn't do well on an interview, when they are more than qualified based on previous work experience at the company -- which isn't taken into account for hiring decisions. They weight internal/external folks the same. 
- work life balance is not great, but you don't come to facebook to ""Cruise"" if you do, you will be fired quickly 
- Newer PMs from other companies seem to be infiltrating a ""CEO"" role in their job -- which is not how Facebook operates. Collaboration > dictatorship of features and product. 
- The product specialist role specifically is challenging to stay in for longer than a few years -- the bar for performance gets higher, but you have the same ""quiver"" of tactics and tools and can only reinvent the wheel so much. 
- Many teams don't understand your role or respect it much, which is problematic because a lot of your impact comes from your ability to push changes and improvements through EMs, PMs and other product focused teams."

- Internal politics have drastically increased. There is a growing focus on optics vs. impact, which is incompatible with a culture that operates under ""Focus on Impact.""
- I found it difficult to express the company's values such as Be Bold and Be Open in a couple of organizations, because leaders who were external hires brought in a hierarchy, a ""CYA"" culture, and a combination of empire building and swim lanes.
- The culture in some organization is toxic – people feel unsafe voicing their opinions and being their authentic selves.
- Many teams find themselves blinded by metrics, still doing good work but missing the greater opportunities by ignoring clear paradoxes between metrics and customer experience.
- Internal transfer policies can be restrictive due to restrictions around leveling and performance. I know at least three people who left the company who wanted to move to a role that better suited them, but could not because they weren't meeting expectations in their current role (that didn't suit them)."

  As an engineer, with engineer in the title, and over 10 years of experience, I really thought I would get to do more engineering.  Unfortunately, the job is really about 50% business analyst and 20% project management, and 30% engineering.  You are expected to own every aspect of your project, regardless if anyone else actually does.  Also, you're told you have the opportunity to choose the team you want to be on, but for me, that choice was removed at the last minute.

2) bad management, bad leadership - all managers are expected to be individual contributors which is basically another way of saying that they aren't particularly good at either, and do not have time to devote to both roles.  Also, be prepared for mansplaining.

3) more money than sense:  gobs and gobs of money are being thrown around.  there's basically an offsite every other week.  Nevermind about work, deadlines, or being competent, it's more important to go glassblowing.  The pay is nice, in fact, its the best feature about the place.

4) the company that wants to connect the world would rather loose talent than have remote workers.  no, seriously.  say you're on a team, and your team decides to move to another office thats like 1 hour away.  you are kicked off the team and put on another team.  what sense does that make?  new mom wants to wfh?  not allowed. 
 Seriously, it's called skype, people.  

5) and speaking of teams, the team structure is completely whack.  instead of having a core group of people I work with on many projects, I have a different group of people I work with on each project.  a completely different set of swe, pm, ds, and de for each project.  This completely limits our ability to grow more efficient with each project, let alone build any sort of a professional relationship.

6) you're not allowed to fix things that are legit broken.  I've only been here a short time and have already had to suffer fools who prefer poorly designed metrics with political bs to actually measuring things properly.  bug 1 told not to fix it - too big to fail, bug 2, never got fixed by other team, bug 3, too high profile to fix.  seriously?  why not just admit all your metrics are wrong?

7) people care more about performance reviews than actual performance.  no really, if I hear the phrase make ""an impact"" I will vom.  What this really means is not ""do good and useful work"" which is how it might be interpreted, instead it means that you should very little on the very high profile projects, and then post it everywhere, to make sure people NOTICE.  Also, keep a log of your work so that you can share it with your absentee manager come review time - otherwise, he (yeah I said he) likely will have no idea what you worked on or why.  But, instead of this being a meaningful signal, it just becomes more noise."

- global reach and impact

At Facebook, you have the opportunity to work on products that everyone uses. This helps you use and sharpen your skills in an entirely new way, and really think through your logic and decisions—unpacking every detail because you have to make sure it works and is understood across all demographics, countries, cultures, and languages.

They also take care of employees. Everything is free: shuttle rides, laundry service, professional development courses, tons of swag, and all the food, snacks, and drinks you can eat (the “Facebook 15” is real). The company’s health benefits are unmatched and they even have medical, dental, and gym facilities on campus.","- politics and back channeling 
- competitiveness and lack of collaboration 
- relationships hold more value than quality work

Facebook the company is like the platform: everyone acts like everything is great, but no one acknowledges or exposes what’s really going on under the surface. People act like it’s all sunshine and roses, but because there’s such a “focus on impact” and performance, it’s actually a competitive environment where people are out for themselves and scrambling for whatever projects will give them the most visibility—at Facebook, visibility > impact > high performance ratings > bonus multipliers + equity refreshers. 

As a result, people you know and being an influencer matter more than the quality of your work. Likes are the real currency and even though you’re told to “be your authentic self”, one type of person benefits most: those who are extroverted, don’t rock the boat, and are oftentimes male.

While the actual benefits and perks are great, don’t be fooled by the glamour of it all: they’re also designed to keep you there and keep you working. You’ll be taken care of, but the focus on impact and performance makes it’s easy to forget to take care of yourself. There’s an undercurrent of anxiety in the culture that is very real and not often acknowledged.

Facebook is a great company for those just starting out their career. If you’re a seasoned professional, I suggest staying away. It doesn’t matter how much experience or expertise you have—I spent most of my time proving to people half my age that I knew what I was doing. 

Time and again, my suggestions would be ignored or edited to the point that they were no longer my ideas. Time and again, leadership would be shown those watered down ideas and say, “Nope!” Time and again, when I’d go back to my original recommendation, leadership would say, “That’s the one!” After awhile, it was finally time for me to say, “I’m tired of (and better than) this.”"

Community is at the core of FB. I’ve never worked at a company that cares so much about its people. Taking care of yourself and working sustainably is part of the culture. All the amenities are there to keep you focused (or distracted). Food, snacks, multiple gyms (with classes), car service, life@ (I took my passport photos there for heavens sake). 

We have, workplace, FB’s own internal app. It’s like Facebook within Facebook for employees. I can message anybody and be in contact with anybody in the company. I’m an entry level engineer and talk to VPs Directors and even Mark, who holds open forum EVERY Friday in person. That level of access is phenomenal. 

If you have an idea you can do it. You have the support and finances to achieve whatever you can think of. If you’ve worked anywhere else then you can see why everything I’ve written is so important. It just isn’t like that anywhere else.","It’s so good that it would be hard to work anywhere else. I’m destroyed for life. If it’s your first job I would feel bad because this is NOT a true view of the working world. If you’re humble enough to appreciate that then you should be ok. I believe people can develop a degree of entitlement and hubris in this environment. You can run into folks like that, but the majority of others are great."

2296,Meta,"Great coaching & feedback culture, but decisions are very top down",2018-08-07,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"During my time at Facebook, I've had some of the best people managers in my career. They have helped me improve my communication skills, people skills and empathy skills. The perks are absolutely ridiculous, from free charging for electric cars to amazing free desserts, and packed micro kitchens.","One of the reasons Facebook is in this sticky privacy situation is the complacency at the top. For many years, management has denied its social responsibility to moderate the content that appears, claiming to be an unbiased 'platform'. They ignore years of 3rd party studies that show that they are creating echo chambers.

Even after getting ""Exceeds Expectations"" cycle after cycle, I found it difficult to influence the top-down decisions. A group of engineers & analysts may prove a huge opportunity in developing a feature, with data and all, but if it's not the direction coming from the top, then it's unlikely to get resourced. They don't always put in the effort to discuss the pros & cons of these strategies."
2297,Meta,"Open, fast, no bs",2014-03-17,5.0,Software Development Engineer,"It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a ""need to know"" basis, etc. 

This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.

It's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.

One cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.

They have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.

The perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.

Of course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.

You'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.

FB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.

Work-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.

The best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it.","FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.

FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.

FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and ""get with the program"" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent."
