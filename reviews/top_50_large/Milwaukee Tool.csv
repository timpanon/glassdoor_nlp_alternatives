0,Milwaukee Tool,Infectious culture encourages me continue to learn in my role,2022-03-28,5.0,Senior Accountant,"- Motivating and infectious culture
- Continued growth opportunities
- One team mentality, the collaboration that occurs cross-functionally creates wonderful learning opportunities","Being involved with such a fast-paced company and considering the growth trajectory we are on at times it can be overwhelming. Things are always changing for the better, and leadership continues to value the opinions of its employees."
1,Milwaukee Tool,Great Company to work for,2022-03-30,5.0,Mechanical Design Engineer,"-Alot of responsibily for new grads
-Trust in employees
-Great Culture",-Fast paced environment can take a little to get used too
2,Milwaukee Tool,Limitless Company,2022-03-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Milwaukee Tool is truly an incredible company. It was obvious to me on day one why the company has seen tremendous growth -- a never settle mentality, profound investment in not just products and technology, but its employees and facilities, and the the value it puts on its team members. There is a clear hierarchy and ample training, which helped me hit the ground running. In my last role, I was under a tremendous amount of pressure to hit the bottom line and went to bed most nights worried about my future, but here I am energized and can focus on doing the best I can and then finding ways to do even better. The communications from the executive team make me feel secure in that the company understands why other businesses have failed and how we can avoid each of those pitfalls and continue our incredible growth.

My pay upon hire was a healthy percentage above market and I have enjoyed perks such as stunning facilities, subsidized lunches, product discounts, schedule flexibility, casual work dress, and travel opportunities.","The company's rapid growth has stressed the availability of office space/parking and resulted in office sharing and moving, but I have been impressed by the company's willingness to invest in new space quickly."
3,Milwaukee Tool,Great Place to work,2022-02-21,5.0,IT Associate Analyst,"Pay, Scheduling, Team work, Benefits, and Fast Pace","Orientation is a little wonky. You learn a lot about items that do not pertain to the field that you will be involved in. So it should be more focused for your job specific role. 
401(k) - There should also be stock options. This would encourage those that are looking for a long term career at Milwaukee Tool to push themselves in their fields to see the Company succeed. While 401(k) is good, the stock option would be better and encourage the culture that Milwaukee is known for. Maybe do 1 year on job Salary Employees can purchase stock. For Hourly maybe 3 years on the job and then you can buy stock. Let the Employees become invested in the success driven environment, which will make Milwaukee Tool the set standard for the industry."
4,Milwaukee Tool,MET Review,2022-03-29,5.0,Senior BI Developer,"Great benefits, good pay, great work life balance.",Managers are all technical people that got promoted. They are doers not people managers and in that regard they worry about accomplishing things instead of growing the people they manage.
5,Milwaukee Tool,Some growing pains but great opportunities,2022-03-21,5.0,Design Engineer,"Great culture (not overly formal or bureaucratic) and passionate people
Lots of opportunities for leadership even at early stages of career
Company has many resources at its disposal and isn’t afraid to invest in development",Company is growing so fast that some of the new groups and processes are having growing pains as they get set up
6,Milwaukee Tool,Recently started,2022-02-17,5.0,Firmware Engineer,"It's a very friendly work environment where everyone is willing to help and answer any questions. It has a very motivating culture that encourages you to take control of your work and seek out ways to improve your approach and yourself. Almost everybody at the company is accessible and you are encouraged to build relationships with coworkers and managers, both in your department and outside of it.","The company moves fast and people's schedules can very easily fill up. There is a very strong culture here that may make you feel like an outsider if you are not motivated and interested with your work. In this way, I'd say working here is probably not for everyone so keep that in mind and get a solid idea of the culture when looking into job opportunities here."
7,Milwaukee Tool,"Best-in-class onboarding, endless opportunity, incredible culture!",2022-02-09,5.0,Director,"The on-boarding process at Milwaukee Tool was exceptional. I had everything I needed to hit the ground running the moment I walked in the door. The organization is so focused and mission driven you can't help but want to pitch in and make great things happen. It's a massive breath of fresh air to come into work motivated and empowered to make a difference for a company that produces tools for the life blood of the nation - trades. If you're looking for a place with talent, passion and opportunity, Milwaukee Tool delivers. The One Team mentality works because we're bonded through a shared commitment to making the best products/experiences for customers - it transcends barriers to collaboration you may have seen at other companies.","So far there are no real cons. The company is growing fast which comes with its own challenges, but these are fun challenges to help solve."
8,Milwaukee Tool,Very Progressive Company,2022-03-28,5.0,Set-up Technician/Technologist,"I have been loving my time at Milwaukee Tool, they provide me with the resources to excel and advance my career. The environment is fun and most issues internally are dealt with swiftly.",There is not a very good system to expect and check accountability for one's responsibilities.
9,Milwaukee Tool,Great Culture and Environment,2022-03-28,5.0,Electrical Engineer,Coworkers are very easy to work with/talk to/always answer questions. Culture is also fantastic; company leaders are sure to disperse and cultivate the right culture among coworkers.,No cons to speak of
10,Milwaukee Tool,Don’t believe the Hype,2022-03-09,2.0,Demand Planner,The perks and the health insurance.,Gaslighting in demand. No clear direction. Constant changes to the “process”. There is no process. People are afraid to ask questions. Too many bosses no true leaders. Professionalism is lacking. Too many people drinking the kool-aid just to get through the day. Work in any other portion of the business except Demand. 1/4 of the job is forecasting. 3/4 of the job is updating PowerPoint presentations. A lot of point fingers and lack of accountability. Don’t believe the hype.
11,Milwaukee Tool,Walking the walk.....not just talking the talk,2022-02-16,5.0,Sourcing Manager,"Culture is huge at Milwaukee Tool. 
From the moment you step foot on campus (or virtually) you are part of the team. The ONE team mentality is real, you can feel it immediately.

The benefits here are pretty good as well.,Our team is growing and will be relocated to a new facility in the future. It's not a deal breaker but just something I'll need to adjust to when the time comes.
14,Milwaukee Tool,"Good Culture, Getting Diluted",2022-03-03,4.0,Design Engineer II,Milwaukee has great facilities and consistently provides you the resources you need to do you job.,"A lot of people are getting hired quickly and starting to dilute the good culture. Many subordinates are having to train their managers and even their entire team, which makes for a difficult working situation on a daily basis.

The increasing need for heads is also taking up internal career opportunities for advancement. It is slowly turning into a company that you could stay at and grow, to one that you're going to come to for building your experience for a few years and then moving on to be able to advance in your career."
15,Milwaukee Tool,Corporate Isn't So Bad After All,2022-02-23,5.0,Human Resources Talent Specialist,"I knew working for Milwaukee Tool would be good, I had no idea it would be this great.

The compensation for Industrial Designers is single handedly the worst part about working at this company. The starting salary for an Associate Industrial Designer has not changed in the past four years, even though inflation and company sales have grown exponentially. The average salary brackets of Industrial Designers here is close to insulting; it seems everyone on the design team is incredibly underpaid.

It's not required, but it tends to ""happen"" as an engineer working on cool stuff with a company that gives you the tools you need, it's easy to get sucked into the work.

I'm working with an amazing group of people who are always making themselves available as resources. The Brookfield facility is remarkable and the culture is truly impressive.

Help Desk - the nicest people work at the help desk support line.

Fitness Center on site.

Free flu shots on site and regular blood drives.

2 days off for local volunteer opportunities.

4 weeks of severance offered if they fire you and you agree to sign their shady NDA.","Interviewed 2 times for a posted job with 8 people. Had a great experience in the interview and was offered a job different from what I interviewed for. I never received a job description and ended up having to write it myself. After 3 months I worked with 1 of the 8 people I interviewed with. On my 2nd day one of those people were fired with no explanation as to why.

Terrible health insurance. Somehow my insurance was enrolled in twice and I was charged twice. It took 2 months to receive an insurance card so I could even use the insurance.

The division I was moved into with the 3rd Manager I had in 4 months was a toxic environment due to leadership. The biggest issue was a power struggle of who is in charge. In order for me to do my work I need to get ""alignment"" from 3 division heads. It was difficult to get everyone together to review work at one time so when I would make a decision based on meeting with 2 out of the 3 groups the 3rd person left out would interrogate as to why they were left out. I couldn't win with getting ""alignment"" by the given due dates as it would be a bigger issue if a date was missed.

No regard for COVID safety. Required employees in the office to be in small closed door meeting rooms without wearing masks and no vaccination requirement. Corporate guidelines said that virtual links were required but when I would join from my desk due to wanting to keep distance I would be called to have to come into the room. In a cross functional corporate meeting I had to listen to someone going off on a rant about how people need to get over these COVID concerns when concerns were brought up. A leader came from Texas to speak in the auditorium to speak and the direction from management regarding the packed audience was that not enough people were there in person and we need to make sure to attend (a link was provided for viewing but they don't want it to be used).

Petty and disrespectful environment. It was commonplace to be asked to contribute to lists of complaints on people that they didn't like and review their concerns with management. Sometimes that person would find out and elevate to HR which would drop that issue.  Other times management would talk to the person that has a list of complaints about them to their face and also say the concerns are petty without passing any legit concerns along creating an environment full of drama and gossip. 

Weekly meetings would be held with as task masters giving out to do lists to the group along with deadlines. Afterwards separate email different direction would be sent with a different direction and cc management as if something was done wrong. Not a team environment; was a witch hunt to accuse everyone but themselves of doing things incorrectly.

Turn time for work was unrealistic. Products would be received and expected to be evaluated, reviewed with team and full feedback sent the next day. Usual pace for that at other companies is 5-7 days. Work hours ended up being very long as there was not enough staff to complete the work. 

Very bland and cold white male environment. Literally the temperature is too cold. Women's bathrooms do not even have feminine hygiene products. I was in a meeting where a manager actually said ""white men are becoming extinct"" in a presentation.

My final manager before joining the company got all the gossip on everyone and started to influence people before he even came. I was told to stay away from certain people as they were working on getting them fired. I had to watch him sneak around my desk on my last day so he could tell his boss that I was there so he could fire me. Even though to my face he told me things will get better.

This is just a few examples of the toxicity. I hear other areas are better to work in."

The plant never meets the expectations whoever has set. Supervisors who have a terrible attitude, non qualified, always pushing people harder and harder to make sure their butts are covered from corporate, can’t spell, can’t type, willfully ignorant to the well being of the employees who actually do the job. Management does not care about you, until you mess up. You will never make enough parts, or seal any packaging, or finish the parts. You will spend 7 days a week in the plant and be so tired when you leave that all you can do is sleep and get right back to work. Profits and numbers will always be more important than your health, mentally or physically, so be prepared to not live up to what they want, getting evaluated, then telling you your not doing enough, and leave work and do it all again the next day.

I’ve literally been screamed at multiple times and when shared with my multiple managers, nothing was done except excuses were made. Leadership is made up of a Frat Boy crew who are unprofessional and regularly use profanities but like to pass it off as being casual. People are continuously promoted who lack experience and knowledge to be successful which leads to poor decision making and send teams scrambling in bad directions only to revert course and redirect leading to unnecessary rework.

The company culture is great and it provides an excellent workplace when values are prioritized and followed.,The program that I currently work in has not provided me with a good working experience with Milwaukee.

It is fast pace, competitive, and extremely challenging. You learn to juggle multiple initiatives, and there is always some new innovation to communicate to your customers. From our entry level positions up you have the leeway to be a true partner with your accounts in a way that fits them best. Management is focused on a ""work to live"" and not ""live to work"" mentality, and while you put in a lot of hours, family time is always a priority. This job offers challenges, flexibility, and the ability to play around with power tools.","We have grown so much in the past years it is hard to have the same level of service to all the accounts that have been brought on.

Very little nice outdoor space available at the brookfield office. Plenty of room for a 20 acre parking lot, though

Location, location, location -- Brookfield is a bit of an exurban dead-zone, so be prepared to commute from downtown MKE or Tosa if you want to be near any action.

I was there for 7 years and I very much enjoyed it for the first 5.","The work is hard and the hours are long. My last two years were very stressful and I worked long hours, without recognition. Promotion goals are visible and even though those goals are met, management can hold employees back.
The quality team is lacking, which affects new product development. About 30% of my time as a new product engineer was spent fixing quality (not design) issues. I was still expected to meet all new product goals as well. This greatly added to the work load.

At the time of the acquisition, there was a great deal of trepidation and uncertainty felt by all Empire employees, as is common with most acquisitions. What was uncommon was the zeal and eagerness with which positive change took place. Long-needed investments in equipment, process refinement and staffing, demonstrated in short order that Wisconsin manufacturing was not only a priority for Milwaukee Tool but also a passion. This passion was further demonstrated through an aggressive drive toward safety improvements, cleanliness, organization and efficiency. Bolstered by the marketing prowess of Milwaukee Tool, demand for Empire product increased dramatically as did our capacity to manufacture through the purchase and integration of automation and state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment. It is worth boasting that as efficiencies increased with automation, we continued to hire and train additional skilled and entry level production workers due to the increased demands for Empire and Milwaukee Tool products.
In addition to an unmatched benefits package, Milwaukee Tool intently provides and promotes opportunity for advancement. Job opportunities have commonly crossed over between Milwaukee's Brookfield campus and Mukwonago Manufacturing as well as opportunities within manufacturing, promoting from within whenever possible. The clean, organized, climate-controlled facility in Mukwonago has become a showplace for the new age of manufacturing. 
“Never satisfied, always improving” is the mantra we live by; employee input is highly regarded and promoted with a ‘Continuous Improvement’ suggestion board that is reviewed routinely and acted upon by the entire management staff. Like many of my coworkers, I look forward to the challenges and rewards that arise every day.","Perhaps due to Mukwonago’s relatively rural location without mass transit access, sustaining the growing need for good entry level positions can be challenging."

341,Milwaukee Tool,Unrealistic Project Schedules Results in Fire-Fight Culture,2019-11-21,2.0,Design Engineer II,Projects can be very interesting as they are tools that you will likely use at home.,"Milwaukee tool does a poor job of properly scheduling, planning, and executing on projects. Nearly all projects end up as a fire fight for the last 3-4 months. Management will then pull additional people to fight the current fire but then the projects those pulled resources were responsible will suffer as well with another fire fight on later on those projects. This results in a continuous never-ending cycle and culture of fire fighting without any plan to improve the situation. Management is happy enough with the status quo because they have bonus structures in place to incentivize pushing lower level engineers to work extremely long hours to maintain schedules. Management does not care about employee burnout and turnover is starting to become a large problem with increasing amounts of engineers leaving the company due to the excessive work hours and below average pay given the amount of hours management requires."

I never feel like I don't have a voice or platform to succeed personally.,"Petty complaints but usually from ""non-big-picture"" people who only care about how something affects them directly rather than how it affects everyone in the organization.  Those same people expect to do the minimum but be rewarded for exceeding expectations. When that doesn't happen or they don't get their way, the negative, biting comments and reviews ensue.

The executive team has a lot of opportunities to continue the training and empowerment of middle management to start making more decisions for the business.

Milwaukee Tool has a decent amount of brand equity within WI or workers in the trades.,"The culture lacks meaningful diversity and inclusion strategies and efforts. So far, I've seen a very white male dominant culture - often resulting in chauvinistic and discriminatory practices. I've also witnessed unprofessional outbursts from senior leaders (ex. CFO and President Power Tools) include but not limited to yelling at employees during meetings, talking/laughing with each other while lower level employees are presenting, and making jokes about peoples appearances (stature, clothes, etc.) in public forums. 

While they ""started"" a diversity and inclusion effort more formally on 2/26/20, it's limited and doesn't address the core issues. In fact, they adjusted the objective of the initiative to delivery ""diversity of thought, experience, and background"" but didn't provide measurements of success or mechanism to affect internal culture."

They throw most of the resources they have at that.","If you work in supply chain, however, you are seen as at the beckon call of sales and marketing. There is no collaboration. Only being told by sales what is going to happen, and then the supply chain has to make it happen. Supply Chain should be advisers to the sales team, and provide solutions. Not the other way around. Home Depot runs the supply chain decisions being made, to the point that the other channels and customers get left behind and neglected. Service levels of 98% are only met because of service to Home Depot (who sit at near 100% fill rate most months).

- Milwaukee encourages employees to try new things, so if you're up for a challenge and you're excited about attacking other areas of the business, the opportunity is there for you.
- The leadership organization has gotten much better about listening to critiques in recent years.  As a result of feedback from the organization as a whole, improvements have been made to many of the things important to employees in the field, such as more balanced compensation and bonus structures.  Milwaukee Tool is now an organization driven by employee feedback than ever before. 
- The outlook for Milwaukee Tool is strong.  Our company has put up growth numbers that far eclipse the industry average, and have done so for 10 years running.  No signs of slowdown here, folks!
- If you like tools, this is the place for you!  As a tool junkie myself, I get excited about all the new products we're developing.  And we're developing A LOT!","- Though I hesitate to list this as a con, I understand that some people would view this as such: if you want to advance, you WILL have to work for it.  That can mean long days and a plate so full of work that it can feel overwhelming at times. The organization knows that the successful employees will find a way to achieve in spite of these challenges and will continue to push you.  If time management, lots of work and the occasional stressful day aren't your thing, this may not be the right company for you.

A few years in, I was given the opportunity to move to New Product Design - Power Tools to focus on designing power tools to meet detailed user needs and drive projects to aggressive schedules. After building my knowledge of our ME design process I became interested in cross functional team's processes and the business case around why we select the projects we do. After presenting this new interest to my management I have since moved into a Project Leader role and my career path continues to develop and surprise me each year. 
If you are looking for a fast-paced product design company which will allow you to grow at an accelerated rate based on performance, Milwaukee is the place for you.","Very little cons. 

The passion and drive for holding schedules which is contagious at Milwaukee can sometimes get in the way of work life balance. As at most companies the work load ebbs and flows with the stage of the project."

425,Milwaukee Tool,Great fast paced company,2015-07-28,5.0,Professional,Milwaukee is growing extremely fast mostly through rapid innovation and launching of new products.  It is a fast paced dynamic environment which is hard to find in most midwestern manufacturing companies.  Feels more like working for a tech company on the west coast than a manufacturing company.,Fast paced aggressive culture is only a con if you don't like that kind of job; the trade off is that you can move around to get a lot of experience and if you work hard you will get promoted.  Not a place to come work if you don't like to be challenged.

Richman is a true leader VERY inspiring! 
It's not always about making money it's about being the best at what we do and what we make. 
The reason it's not for everyone is if you think your going to come in and work 9-5 and sit at your computer all day, sorry no. Milwaukee expects results, they go the extra mile for you, you should give them more in return. Employers pay for 8 hours of ""work"" not 8 hours of ""time"" make sure you are giving more than you receive!","I really can't think of any cons but if you want to call this a con I work 10-12 hours per day, but I like working so I have no problem putting in extra time.

- Ability to take on a lot of responsibility
- You get to travel a lot","- Lack of appreciation from upper management
- You work LONG hours and aren't compensated for it
- Don't value their hardest and best workers
- If you resign they will either one, fire you on the spot or two let you go early. It is extremely sad to see how they treat people when they decide to leave the company. They are not supportive at all. You will see how many job openings this company has because so many good people have quit due to the lack of support and appreciation as an employee
- HORRIBLE company culture, lack of any acknowledgement that you have a family and other priorities in life besides work
- They will sell the fact that you can move up quickly but all it is is a fancy title, little increase in salary, way more job duties and openings are only due to the high turnover this company has
- If you are going to quit, DO NOT PUT IN YOUR TWO WEEKS, they will let you go immediately or fire you. It feels horrible quitting without being considerate and giving a two week resignation but Milwaukee will not reciprocate that consideration back to you
- You will work more than 40 hours a week, bonus structure is horrible as it is only once a year and all or nothing (you hit your bonus or you don't, not compensated if you are very close to hitting it)"

Company-provided uniforms

Discounts on other TTI brands","Managers have no clue. Many are stuck in the ""good old days"" and can't seem to adapt.
Company is out of touch with employees at the ground level, especially manufacturing, central repair, and the branches. They send down demands with no idea what is going on below them.
Company overall seems to be constantly putting out fires while simultaneously trying to find an identity.
Company is full of veteran employees that have drank gallons upon gallons of the kool-aid, but things changed, and now they're just grumpy old bullies that will eventually leave.
Mostly discriminatory. Many assumptions are made regarding age, religion, skin color, sexual orientation - all of which is totally unnecessary in today's culture."

Every year or so you can promote if you are hard working and motivated to learn.  You get a company truck, gas card, expense account, iphone, laptop and fax machine/printer.   You can drive the vehicle on your personal time and do not pay for gas.  Brand recognition, innovative products and aggressive product launching help to increase opportunity.  Benefits are pretty good.","Work/life balance is not very good.  To promote you almost always have to move.  If you keep turning down promotions you will end up blacklisted, forced out or fired.  All sales positions have low base pay.  Only receive a 5K raise for each promotion.  Very aggressive bonus structures are paid out annually only (zero commission).  If you do not hit your bonus at the end of year you get nothing.  Only cost of living raises.  All markets receive same compensation.  The company is growing very fast but we do not get compensated more.  Constant turnover hurts our reputation at the distributor and end user level."

There is an extremely high level of respect between employees at all levels. There is no pecking order and upper management makes sure to engage with every single employee.
-Everyone is busy, but strangers will take time out of their day to help you complete a task. 
-There is lots of autonomy, even for a Engineer I. You will be given basically total control of your project from the beginning.
-The company is not afraid to spend money. Anything you need for your work, you can just put it on your corporate card.
-Massive in-house prototyping shop for mechanical parts.
-Most people can flex their time (some managers are more-flexible than others).","-You get thrown in the deep end right away. There is a self guided onboarding process, but a lot of it is outdated. I didn't have time to review it due to my workload.
- You will need to be humble and ask questions a lot, which is usually handled well by more experienced co-workers.
- Agressive project schedules can be difficult to manage. Delays are inevitable, so there is buffer built-in to any project. Management will be generally understanding if you support your reasoning with hard data.
-Electronics lab isn't as advanced as prototyping shop, but they're working to address that.
-Design work is test and data driven, which leads to scrap and wasted time. Little emphasis is placed on model-based design."

There are a few reviews on here that criticize work/life balance. I personally do not see this as a problem - those with the 60+ hour weeks are typically self inflicted. There is a ton of support here and everyone is pulling together. You just need to be mature enough to ask for help if you need it. 

Of all the employers in the Milwaukee area, this has got to be one of the best organizations. There's a boat load of growth potential for the company and for your career. Highly recommended.","Don't be intimidated by the ""not for the faint of heart"" stigma. This is true but if you are a hard worker looking to do good work, rise up to the challenge. The one thing I will say is there could be some more diversity in the workplace though this has been improving as the company grows. 

Non-core hours are occasionally worked when conference calling global teams (China, Europe). This is typical with any international company and takes some adjustment."
497,Milwaukee Tool,White Male dominant culture. Get ahead by who you know.,2018-09-08,1.0,Quality Engineer,"They say they work hard and play hard which is true.  However, some of that does come at a great personal sacrifice when the demands of the job makes you choose between your family and the job.  Could be a great opportunity for younger less experienced professionals, but it can grow tiresome quickly for more senior workers with a family.","As the title states, it is VERY white male dominant culture.   This company works very closely with the team in China and the people there are all treated as children - follow directions and not allowed to think critically.  The few that tries, are severely punished when they make mistakes, which makes the rest less willing to follow that path.  In the end, actions speak louder than words and the fact that they have a white male senior VP in the China factory for many years (as long as I have been there).  In addition, all of the high level VP in every department is white male except for HR (very typical).  In the end, it doesn't matter if you are good at what you do.  What matter is that you look like everyone else in management and can say the right thing to the right people and not say the wrong thing that offends the wrong people."
498,Milwaukee Tool,Overall good place to work,2019-10-30,4.0,Assistant Product Manager,"Young working environment, given a lot of autonomy",Put in a lot of hours
499,Milwaukee Tool,Employee in Brookfield,2015-06-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great work environment and good people. The products are awesome and you receive a nice employee discount. Good benefits - Health and life insurance, 401K with matching, on site gym in Brookfield. Company has been growing at a decent amount year over year for at least the last 5 years. On site cafeteria has good food and average prices. Most people will receive a company paid cell phone and laptop. Most people are very passionate about their jobs and the company/products.","The office is getting very full in Brookfield. Most people have less work space than they used to. It can be hard to find a parking spot and people park all over where there aren't spots designated. The review and compensation process is not the best. Most people receive cost of living increases even with a stellar review. Even with a promotion it can be hard to get paid fairly like you would if you took a job at another company. In all fairness, some people are paid very well, but it's often not easy or possible to catch up if you are underpaid."
500,Milwaukee Tool,Nice company,2019-11-01,4.0,New Product Development Engineer,Really liked my work there,Seems like there is a constant turnover of managers
501,Milwaukee Tool,"Good company for growth, but caught in the weeds",2019-09-19,3.0,Sales Associate,"Quick paced, driven individuals, good people","Unfettered growth, expected to work toward vague directives that have nothing to do with sales goals."
502,Milwaukee Tool,Bad decisions & declining culture,2015-11-25,1.0,Senior Project Leader,Casual dress code is a nice option but some people take it too far and dress very unprofessional,"Chaotic is the norm as are fire drills.  Bad decisions made by Sr. Management because they have their hands too far down- they should be focuses on strategy and improving a declining culture.  Culture is arrogance and favoritism.  Makes it difficult to enjoy when you know Sr. Managers put people down, black list them and walk around with a sense of superiority.  Place is getting so crowded that it's not pleasant anymore.  They saw this growth coming years ago so why they haven't addressed it sooner is beyond me.  If you join the company and don't drink the Kool-Aid your time will be marked.  Just go in and fake it till you can get out and work for a real company that doesn't use buzz words like ""disruptive innovation"" and ""fast paced"".  Beware of harassment and lack of diversity.  Everyone looks the same and acts the same.  Cult like."
503,Milwaukee Tool,Always traveling/wearing too many hats/no commissions,2016-01-22,3.0,Territory Representative,The products are amazing. Milwaukee is growing like wild fire because their engineers are developing the best products out there. Great training. Great people.,"As a Territory Rep (which you're actually an Account Manager) you are traveling non stop. Don't listen when they say you get 1 week a month in your home territory or 1 office day a week. Prepare to live out of a suitcase for your time there. Long work hours because you're a one-man-show. That means you're not just selling and reporting your sales. You're doing all the advertising, marketing, and you are the customer service, and you're doing it all late at night and in a different hotel room every night. The work load is ridiculous so you're better off not even paying rent for an apartment because you'll only sleep in your bed a handful of times each month.

Archaic ordering methods don't make your life any easier or less time consuming.

Zero commissions on sales. Lack of incentives won't drive a sales team. Being told ""You should be lucky you're selling Milwaukee tools."" doesn't help pay any student loans."
504,Milwaukee Tool,Intern,2017-11-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The coworkers are great and make you feel very welcome and supported. There is always someone around to help you if you have any questions. The projects I got to work on were varied so I never had a dull day. I gained experience in all areas of my field and had a nice mix of easier projects and projects that challenged me. Pay is great especially for an internship and the work enviornment provides space for collaboration, individual work, and lots of natural lighting. Management was amazing and willing to help tailor your experience to your career goals as well as allowing you to work on a flexible schedule.","As with any job, the workload fluctuated. There were times I had plenty of projects to work on and a few times I struggled to keep busy. Past orientation, there were not many events to help interns in different departments get to know each other."
505,Milwaukee Tool,Great Culture and Great Opprotunities,2019-08-19,4.0,Project Engineer,"Lots of room for advancement, challenging and rewarding work, great employees in all parts of the business.","Start with 2 weeks of vacation, no bonuses or profit sharing available."
506,Milwaukee Tool,Re-branded churn and burn,2019-08-16,1.0,Software Development Manager,Good money if you're willing to sacrifice everything else in your life,"Very chauvinistic culture.  Expect to be judged if you put in less than 60 hours.  Deadlines are ridiculous, and people have gotten reprimanded when they receive necessary details AFTER  the actual deadline.  They've got employees thinking being ""obsessed"" with work is a good thing."
507,Milwaukee Tool,COMPANY TO GROW WITH MILWAUKEE TOOL,2019-08-15,4.0,Branch Service Manager,"Great Pay, Great Benefits.  The management let's you do your job. Gives you Challenges that are awesome. Helps you grow.",All Cons I had have been all resolved.
508,Milwaukee Tool,Disappointing company - compensation to their hardest working and most committed employees decreasing every year.,2013-04-21,1.0,Engineering,"The company has been growing and increasing sales, but it has been through selling cheaper outsourced foreign hand tools.","We are required to come in early and work late and field 10pm conference calls with China. Upper management pushes us for more and more every day. So we every day work our buts off and sacrifice time from our families, overall the pay and bonuses were the worst I have ever seen here. They had a record sales year, and the pay and bonuses were the worst, workers are really disappointed with how the company had been going backwards in their compensation to their hardest working and most committed employees. 

The company wastes a lot of time with poor communications from the top down. It is just too common to have duplicate efforts on the same work. We spends hours everyday in useless meeting and you look around and everyone is just surfing the internet on phones.

Expect to be ignored if you try and say good morning to any upper management when you pass them in the halls. They act as if you do not exist and bury their noses into their phone texts to ignore you. Management has missed the mark and they are ingrained as being dysfunctional in the company. But they are so focused on the bottom line they completely miss reality."
509,Milwaukee Tool,Sr. Sourcing Manager,2016-08-01,5.0,,"From the corporate office to the plants, Milwaukee Tool takes great pride in making the workplace a safe, fun and awarding environment. The Brand and branding message is amazing! It's the small things that make a difference, Milwaukee Tool offers Employee Appreciation lunches, great training opportunities, and empowers their people to make decisions! Milwaukee Tool is a very fast paced environment and we work for the end consumer. Our goal is to ensure that we make the BEST products that meet the end consumers need and will hands down outperform other brands on the jobsite!","Milwaukee Tool is similar to other retail type products. We are conscious of the bottom line, we live quarter to quarter...etc,  I have worked at other companies that allow each quarter to dictate their plan moving forward, Milwaukee Tool doesn't necessarily follow that practice. That is a refreshing for a company of our size. No real cons other than work life balance can be difficult if the employee makes it that way."
