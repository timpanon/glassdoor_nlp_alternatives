1,Mountain America Credit Union,Great Company,2022-03-15,4.0,Branch Manager,They put a strong focus on development (especially leadership) of each employee. They live up to the company’s mission and vision. They take care employees and give each branch a good budget to recognize and reward people for a job well done. Company is growing like crazy opening up many opportunities.,It’s hard to request more pay if you are needing a little extra. They only pay for experience in the type of role not experience in the company.
2,Mountain America Credit Union,AMAZING,2022-03-13,5.0,Member Service Representative I (MSR I),"You can tell MACU really cares about their employees. Great training and wonderful managers, wonderful benefits. It was my favorite place to work.",Members were grumpy sometimes. No cons with MACU on its own
3,Mountain America Credit Union,Best Employer,2022-03-15,5.0,Product Manager,"Employee first, phenomenal benefits, great pay, and competitive.",PTO/Vacation time could use some work.
4,Mountain America Credit Union,Trying to hard,2022-02-08,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Great Benefits that include inexpensive and good coverage options.,"-Inconsistent expectations depending on what you do or who you report to.
-Unachievable expectations depending on market and or outside factors like economy (i.e. employee retention).
-Ineffective experience from leadership who are driving wrong behaviors while preaching the MACU core values. (i.e. sales integrity vs top performers)
-Trying to hard to be the biggest credit union out there and losing sight of the value of what a credit union is."
5,Mountain America Credit Union,Great!,2022-02-23,5.0,MSR I,Great place to work! Mountain America is one of the best credit unions around and actually care about the people working for them!,Management sometimes is not it.. and members can be rude have tough skin
6,Mountain America Credit Union,Great company to work for,2022-02-09,5.0,Dispute Resolution Specialist II,"Really value their employees, lots of incentives and bonuses. Clear expectations and path to move up in the company. Management is eager to assist in helping you grow as an employee and making sure that you are taken care of. Salaries are very fair and have a yearly review. Raises are fair and consistent.",For me it was just the commute from where I live to the building.
7,Mountain America Credit Union,"Says one thing, does another",2022-03-11,1.0,Learning Experience Designer,I got an increase in salary.,Make business decisions without consulting experts in the field. More interested in maintaining the status quo than changing and growing to improve policy and procedure. Survival of the fittest culture. High rating on Glassdoor because they lack self-awareness and have a culture of sameness.
8,Mountain America Credit Union,They take good care of their employees,2022-02-16,5.0,MEO,Awesome benefits. Want you to have a work-life balance and want to see you excel and grow in your role and within the company,9-6pm that’s basically my only complaint
9,Mountain America Credit Union,Very Nice and Want for you to succed,2022-02-20,5.0,Member Service Representative,They are willing to work with your school schedule,Sometimes you have to deal with difficult customers
10,Mountain America Credit Union,Not Ideal,2022-03-08,2.0,Member Service Representative,Leadership was very kind. You always have work.,"Hours take you away from your family way more than other jobs. 
They tell you it’s the greatest job in the world rather than encourage you to grow and look elsewhere."
11,Mountain America Credit Union,Great place to work!,2022-03-20,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Everyone was super nice, training and materials were really helpful.","Sometimes I felt like my ideas weren’t listened to,"
12,Mountain America Credit Union,Customer service,2022-02-24,5.0,Customer Service,"Awesome benefits, cheap health insurance",The calls can be so boring
13,Mountain America Credit Union,Members First,2022-02-19,5.0,Mortgage Loan Officer,Primary focus on helping the credit union members.,Can be stressful at times.
14,Mountain America Credit Union,Needs Improvement,2022-01-22,3.0,Financial Services Representative,"Great people to work with, great culture, great benefits, okay pay and chance for incentives, very diverse company, CEO and senior leadership are amazing! Great place to have your finances.","Work life balance sucks! Sometimes you have to work while sick, the CEO said he doesn't want anyone working while sick, yet I had to do it. Branches are open until 6pm. You have to work weekends. Management promotes growth only within the company and not goals outside MACU. Meetings or trainings are not communicated well. The training you receive is basic at best and not adequate in any way to consider yourself to help people make huge financial decisions. It takes forever for management to hire people. It's like pulling teeth to ask to do things during work hours, again the work life balance needs major work. Morale is low right now in the branches. Mutual trust and respect is huge in the culture but management is the worst at giving it, even though they preach it the most. Rumors between management and negative perceptions make it hard for you to grow or shake a negative view of yourself. The sales culture is getting out of hand and people are being dishonest and nothing is done when it's reported. Branch employees are paid the same as stay at home employees, might as well stay home and make the same money without having to deal with members in the branch. Career opportunities depend heavily on where you live."
15,Mountain America Credit Union,Toxic,2021-11-14,1.0,Fraud Specialist,Some genuinely amazing people work there.,"The most toxic place I have ever worked. Management does not care, regardless of how much they pretend to. They will turn everything you say around on you and convince you it's your fault. They are pushing out quality people that genuinely care about the members of the credit union and making a difference. The team is in a constant burned out state due to the amount of turn over and significant increase in work volumes. They promote giving others the benefit of the doubt, but it is never given in return. Respect goes a long way and it's severely lacking at MACU. I have never felt as disrespected in a workplace as I have here. Even seeing promotions painting the place as the most amazing place to work makes me sick."
16,Mountain America Credit Union,Great company,2022-02-03,5.0,FSR1,"great company with good benefits, good incentives and amazing culture",they could pay a little more incentive for certain products and services

21,Mountain America Credit Union,Great Company,2022-02-08,4.0,MEO,"Good leadership, great culture, and good communication from upper management.","Pay is alright if you're looking for a sales role, but in order to make more money you would need to work in a higher sales role that could take years to achieve."
22,Mountain America Credit Union,"Great job, good benefits, incredible culture",2022-01-05,5.0,Marketing Manager,"Strong leadership, incredible culture, really love working for Mountain America.","Not a lot to say here, especially while I still work here."

27,Mountain America Credit Union,Beware,2022-01-24,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Nice building and many holidays off.,"Eliminate positions without notice. Witnessed many suddenly disappear, and this was pre-Covid, cant imagine how they are now. Watched an AVP sit on his iPhone daily and surf the internet while being paid nearly 100k while his team worked horrible hours and did all his work."

Co workers 
Products and Services","Inconsistent expectations depending on department. Some depts micromanage you, while others ignore you. Seemed to be retaliated against when trying to have difficult conversations with Managers. Coaching inconsistent and irrelevant to job at times."
29,Mountain America Credit Union,Overall disappointed with management and how they work with employees.,2021-10-16,1.0,Bank Teller,"Experience in a professional setting, opportunities to work on customer service, great co-workers, and unique job responsibilities.",Management does not prioritize their employees. Management does not take feedback well. You will only be treated well if you’re performing well. Poorly managed all around. They focus too much on numbers and not enough on each individual and their hard work. Management does not provide enough direct assistance when employees need it. Poor management of time and employee schedules and general logistics.
30,Mountain America Credit Union,Great company,2021-12-14,5.0,Multiple Titles,"Great 
benefits 
Has a corp gym","Management

an 
overhaul
No good understanding on team work"
31,Mountain America Credit Union,MACU Boys Club,2022-01-12,1.0,Manager,"Great Benefits, Great Training, great coworkers",It turned into a boys club at the branches.  VP’s would only mentor males and not engage female employees who are interested in leadership.  During my time their I only saw a VP hire maybe one female branch manager out of 10 branch manager position he hired over a five year period.
32,Mountain America Credit Union,Delivery driver,2021-12-20,5.0,Delivery Driver,"Close to home, need job asap","It is very, very busy"
33,Mountain America Credit Union,Fantastic place to work.,2021-12-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great benefits and work life balance.,I don't really have any cons.
34,Mountain America Credit Union,Wonderful employer,2021-05-13,1.0,Loan Officer,"Focused on members and employees. They do what they can to ensure high quality and level of job training and the management has always been good to me. They listen overall and care.

They work on and improve the negatives within the company.","Some departments might have some negative management views or relations. The department of service center loans had some issues with negativity, stuffy approach to employees that lead to a high level of gossip which was addressed and felt as though it wasn’t always a safe environment to discuss issues or training needs but this was resolved with my personal manager and seemed to have been addressed across the board. To be clear though, my last three managers are amazing and loved working with them. So negatives are a little thing because the company has excellent policies and does improve bad. 

One negative I would say that was not addressed is that the pay for loan officer is not competitive. Hourly is good but insensitive for online apps are only paid on additional products and not loan volume for the online mobile apps. Other cus pay for that which would drastically effect pay. Btw I did see good loan officers leave for this exact reason. Pay competitiveness is very important to keeping qualified, motivated and high performing people."
35,Mountain America Credit Union,great place to work,2022-01-26,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"nice people, good benefits and pay",not very time flexible or easy to work around schedule
36,Mountain America Credit Union,Good for getting your foot in the door of retail banking,2021-09-23,4.0,Customer Experience Agent,"Great opportunities to move up the chain.

They really want you to move on from the entry-level positions and on to a better paying, more fulfilling career.","It was becoming more of a sales-type position by the time I left.

We were pressured to push products on members/customers when it was pretty apparent that they didn't want it or didn't have the time to discuss it."
37,Mountain America Credit Union,Heloc underwriter,2021-12-01,5.0,HELOC Underwriter,"Flexible work schedule/ home and in office
Great culture

38,Mountain America Credit Union,"Great experience, long way to go in diversity",2021-10-26,4.0,Assistant Manager,"Working at MACU created a safe, clean working environment especially at the new corporate office in Sandy, Utah. The gym and cafe are top notch. Opportunities for growth are plentiful.","With a lot of other companies stepping up their game in the benefits department, MACU will eventually need to add supplemental benefits to compete with all the fintech coming to Utah. There is still a huge lack of diversity at the top in regards to minorities and women. For years you would only see white families in their advertising. The Mormon culture is also a big influence in this company."
39,Mountain America Credit Union,A really nice credit union!,2021-12-13,4.0,Compliance Analyst,"* Great management teams

Lower pay then other companies"
44,Mountain America Credit Union,My husband is jealous…,2021-08-11,5.0,Senior Marketing Communications Specialist,"I’ve been spoiled with so many gifts this year from Mountain America that my husband is jealous. Or maybe he feels like they’re showing him up because my SVP has sent me more chocolate than he has. 

I’ve been with Mountain America for about 6 years, and I can’t imagine ever leaving. My team feels like family. Work/life balance is encouraged, and they never make me feel guilty for taking time off. The benefits are generous—the HSA (employer contribution) saved my bacon this year!","I honestly can’t think of any cons. If you hate snacks and tons of paid holidays, you probably won’t be happy here."
45,Mountain America Credit Union,Transparency,2021-09-07,5.0,Member Experience Officer,"training
opportunity
support

Unbeatable levels of training and support along your journey of learning.","I'd have to say the pay would be the only downside. Specifically for an MEO. 
You're expected to do ALL tellering duties, plus all lending duties of an FSR. 
This type of position is largely beneficial for the company, but I can see burnout in these positions being created moving forward. That would be all though. Great company. It's really hard to say anything is a ""downside"""

As a not for profit credit union, their focus allows for a wonderful work place environment that focuses on development of team members and skills toward member focused products and production.",Pay is not the highest but it is still excellent with the ability to still compete with the job market on a tight line due to incentives.
