0,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Good place to work,2022-03-30,5.0,Postdoctoral Research Associate,"- Great work life balance which can vary depending on the team
- Good to have this name on your CV
-","- Too much bureaucracy
- Almost no growth 
- Less compensation"
1,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,"Great projects and interesting work, poor environment",2022-03-30,3.0,Software Engineer IV,"Really interesting work and projects.
Job stability - once you pass your probation period of 6 months, they can't get rid of you (can be a good or bad thing).","They tend to slice you thin across multiple projects. People can end up working on 4-6 projects at the same time. Talking about being efficient and switching gears...

Lots of micro environments under the same roof. Your happiness and success in this place depends entirely on the team you land in. There are many unhealthy environments, so ask to talk to all team members before joining the team just to get an idea of what the culture is.

Job stability, where after 6 months of probation they can't get rid of you, can be very detrimental to the team. The team can end up with very poor ""specialists"" that are stuck in the group with very little contribution and very little value to add to the project."
2,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Lots of opportunity to be involved w/ work that aligns with your career interests,2022-03-16,5.0,Flight Software Engineer,"Strong leadership, team ethic, supportive culture, broad scope of work, interesting projects",Culture of wearing many hats to get things done so it takes a lot more effort on your part if you're looking to specialize
3,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Be Very Aware,2022-02-04,1.0,Program Coordinator,Working with robotic missions to other planets is exciting,"Micro-management, 1950's style system. ""At your desk"" = ""being productive""
Multiple layers of management, many of whom have contradictory policies for their employees leaves you caught between 2 people above you.
Too much red tape. At the time I left, I had 7 managers. Yes. 7.
Health Insurance is a joke - super expensive except for the cheap HMO and if you've tried finding a doctor in LA that takes new HMO patents, you realize you are getting nothing for your employee contributions.
Zero rasies, minimal raises, given with a smile by your manager who will happily tell you how lucky you are to have this job.
Condescending, harassing culture that is aided by HR. They tell you to report harrassment to HR. Then HR turns around and rats you out to your manager.
Promotions are based solely on whether or not you are personal friends with your manager.
They tout diversity and inclusion but it's just window dressing.
Most of my colleagues were taking anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs.
Truly an awful work environment.
Salaries cannot keep pace with private industry and since JPL is in Pasadena where a starter home is over $1M, it's not sustainable to work there."
4,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Great Work/Life Balance,2022-03-09,5.0,Lead Ux Designer,"Depending on the organization you are in, the experience you have and the type of role you have it is a great work balance and many exciting opportunities for projects.",Not equitable across the workforce to the expectations of specific job roles and career levels.

11,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Extremely siloed workplace - manager makes or breaks experience,2022-02-12,2.0,Technical Learning and Development Specialist,"Some of the most talented, deeply interesting people I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with are employed by JPL. There is zero shortage of passion and curiosity around the lab. And, of course, the missions are incredible.","I’ve worked in large corporations and in academia and, unfortunately, JPL seems to have embraced the worst of both types of workplaces. The lab is extremely siloed as an organization which means that your immediate supervisor or manager is likely to have an extraordinary influence on your experience. Combined with the fact that hierarchy and years of service at JPL are everything, there appears to be zero accountability for people in positions of power even in cases of discrimination, abuses of power or the like. For anyone interviewing with JPL, I highly recommend you get to know your immediate supervisor(s) and manager(s) as well as possible prior to accepting a position. And beware of gaps between blue-sky descriptions of how things are (e.g., Glassdoor awards) and the day-to-day reality (e.g., retention issues among earlier career professionals). In hindsight, some of the strange and frustrating aspects of the application and interview process (poor communication among people on the JPL side, disrespect for my time, vague and inconsistent descriptions of the role and responsibilities, last minute demands and changes, etc.) were glimpses into what would become some - just some - of the frustrating aspects of being a JPL employee. Get curious about things that seem off during the application and interview phases and you might save yourself some heartache down the road.
The position I was in spanned HR and Business Operations, both extremely political organizations that expend a great deal of resources on maintaining the status quo (and status quo for these ordinary business organizations at JPL is, ironically, 10-15 years behind the private sector) and fear-based leadership. If you are an engineer or research scientist, your experience may be wildly different - and can help one to make sense out of the wide range of reviews here on JPL - but the siloed nature and hyper-localized culture of the lab will still be relevant. It was a heartbreaking decision to leave JPL and a position that, on paper, seemed like a dream opportunity. I can only hope that incoming leadership will help to improve the experience at JPL for a wider variety of employees."
12,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Dream job for just about anyone,2022-01-12,5.0,Principal Electronics Engineer,"The missions and the level of detail is out of this world. You will never analyze anything else as much as NASA JPL will ask of you. However, when is up in space, you will shed tears of joy.","Because the space industry is very specialized, a person gets ""type casted"". Unfortunately, not too many space companies out there looking to hire."

The culture has continued to improve. We're all working from home which is great. There's a lot of support in my department to make meaningful changes and improvements. The work is good.,Not a ton. I'm hoping we don't have to drive back into work because the commute around LA is no fun.
16,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Great Experience,2021-12-07,5.0,Systems Engineer II,"I felt super cared for as an employee here, which obviously depends on the institution as a whole and direct management, both of which were excellent for me. Annual peer reviews keep you thinking about your work product and goals. There is also a lot of opportunity for movement within the company if desired and modest monetary awards are handed out for solid work. They do the coolest things! Can't beat it.","Expensive, government-funded, one-off missions leave little room for error and creativity compared to some other aerospace companies. Project's can feel like they move at a snail's pace if you're not used to it. However, the projects are absolutely one of a kind."

You can clock 2 hrs of work a day and get by somehow. People will think you have a 'cool' job.,"Extremely silo'd and bureaucratic. Moving positions internally is painful, promotions require doing favors for middle managers, raises are less than the industry average cost of living adjustments ( 0% for bad years, 2-3% for good years, 5% for promotions ).

Everyone is somehow related and it makes you question if they would even get the job without their parent’s help.

Management is slow to promote and if you don’t have 20 years experience at Jpl good luck being able to move up especially on the business side. They do not value non-Jpl experience or industry experience

57,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,"Can be nice, just know your purpose in working there before you start",2021-08-08,4.0,Systems Software Engineer,"It’s the place to work if you’re into deep space robotics, it’s also prestigious and there are always clever people around.","I call it “The Space DMV” because multiply the amount of bureaucracy you find at the DMV by 20 and you have JPL. Get ready do jump through paperwork (online or otherwise) hoops for any number of arbitrary things.

There are N number of little fiefdoms and micro-fiefdoms, there are a lot of smart people there, unfortunately there are also a lot of control freaks masquerading as knowledgeable people and the bike shedding rate is excessive.

This place could really use one of Elon Musk’s fabled firing sprees.

Be prepared to do things for absolutely no good reason. Be prepared to waste both your own time which you will be given side-eye for despite both you and your colleagues being unable to innovate (because of fiat bans on much process innovation) your way to a less frenetic, less manual, more automated, less unaware manner of doing things.

It’s quite silo-ized so be prepared for a total lack of a cohesive online communication strategy (slack was introduced in 2016 and it took a global pandemic to get to 75% participation (participation on slack was at 25% of lab-wide employees previous to lockdown).

Like I said, if your career is in deep space robotics and aerospace engineering then JPL is anywhere from THE place to be, to a great notch on your resume. You’ll learn a bunch of stuff, and depending on if your academic or chosen career trajectory aligns with those subject areas, then the stuff you learn might even be useful generally speaking for you.

The health insurance is a joke, the PPO premiums are punitively priced (it’s as if they don’t want you to actually see any doctors).

The 401k retirement account and contributions are pretty stellar, that’s about the only area where JPL wins, It’s the 8.5% automatic contribution to the retirement account (14% if you’re over 55).

So if you’re a space nerd and you REALLY REALLY ARE a space nerd and it would be your dream come true to work on space stuff… go apply at Space X, if that doesn’t work out, give JPL a shot.

I’m not a space nerd and kinda accidentally got in here, which explains the frank and candid breakdown."

JPL is a large campus. The tour groups are told it bigger than Disneyland.

It’s academia! It IS managed by the neighboring CalTech after all. It has the feel of a college/university atmosphere. However, it’s not just pure academic research. It’s applied science! You can work there as an engineer or a scientist, an accountant, a manager, a machinist, or a mechanic, or a glass blower, or a janitor. 

Nothing compares to the emotional rewards when a successful touchdown happens on the surface of Mars or on an asteroid or your research goal and your small or large contribution to the project, the countless invested engineering hours finally pay off!

It was a great place to work! There was a lot of freedom!","Like all large organizations it’s suffers from being top heavy, lots of bureaucracy, and endless hours writing grant proposals to fund research because, let’s face it, large groups of citizens see it as a waste of resources to invest in space technology. They don’t see the upside being useful things like JPEG encoding, microwave ovens, and vast amounts of scientific education regarding our origins in the universe.
Because it’s academia there are a lot of Masters and PhDs. Brilliant people all of them. However, many of the are not practical people. They are theoretical folk. So as an engineer it was my job to distill their theoretical understanding into an achievable practical solution. Sometimes with them throwing their academic weight & credentials around to fight you every step of the way. At least until you could show them a workpiece and finally shut their theoretical nay saying up. This was not a huge “con” just a minor annoyance. In the end it still was a wonderful place to work ."

76,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,An amazing,2020-10-12,5.0,Systems Engineer,"Overall, JPL is an amazing place to work that is one of the most diverse and progressive workforces in aerospace. The projects have global impacts, often lasting generationally, and co-workers are motivated, passionate, and caring. All of my co-workers and management have wanted to see me grow into the individual I can be, as opposed to just seeing me as an employee. There is a big culture of teaching and passing on knowledge as opposed to keeping IP constrained to certain individuals. Moving around is encouraged and making large career changes to learn something new is not uncommon. It really is like a giant Disney world for engineers/scientists/artists across the board, even if space exploration is not your hot topic. There is Earth science, science communication, microdevice research, and a whole lot more. Anyhow, I have a lot I could say, but I would highly suggest trying to work here if you are a motivated individual who wants a good balance of life, culture, and engaging/challenging work.","Because it is still aerospace and an FFRDC, some of the benefits of working in more start-up-esque tech places don't exist such as free snack rooms.

Inspiring vibe; like a university with the drive to actually do things","Pay can be low compared to other tech jobs (""We don't see Google as our competition"" -HR during negotiation)
Management track for young-ish high achievers doesn't exist

I place these as cons because they eventually became that for me. But if you're a technical person who loves the technical problem, these probably aren't substantial complaints. I realized I enjoyed more and was better at architecting and ""selling"" solutions than implementing them and JPL didn't really offer a growth path for this... And yes since I've left the lab I've made 2-3x more, but I've never been as excited to go to work every day as I was at JPL."

The perfect place to discuss Star Wars or Star Trek over lunch or get astronomy tips - even if you aren't an engineer or scientist. After leaving the corporate rat race and listening to CEOs drone on about ""shareholder value"" - JPL is a dream when it comes to working for the benefit of knowledge and humanity. get to talk to people working on spacecraft or doing the research that will make it possible to explore Mars, Jupiter's Moons, asteroids, and more!","The learning curve of JPL jargon and the bureaucracy of an organization that pre-dates NASA. It's both government and higher-ed, while those things can be positives it's an adjustment if you come from the corporate world and will occasionally make you shake your head. (But between you and me, the pros really outweigh it and this gives you an amazing opportunity to contribute - but you need patience!)"

95,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,For front of discovery,2020-12-28,4.0,Data Scientist,"Working at JPL is like living in a science fiction novel. There are lots of projects pushing the boundaries of human knowledge but participating in such projects requires very technical skills pertaining to applications of physics, chemistry, software, and engineering.","I can only speak for the science section of JPL rather than the engineering side. It's still an academic environment with the same stigma as a top tier university. In academia, one's life is usually defined by their work. I have managers that work all the time and send emails at odd hours of the night. Projects move very fast and you're often juggling 2-4 projects at a time. Not all will lead to publications either usually projects are more focused on a deliverable data product/service rather than a publication. When you're employed you sign away rights to your intellectual property. In the sciences/academia, you're expected to write funding proposals and publications and at JPL these projects will ultimately fall under the IP of the company. However, little to no company time is given to employees to write proposals/publications which means if you want to advance your own bibliography expect to work nights and weekends."

102,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Great place to work if you know how to navigate bureaucracy and hierarchy system,2021-06-24,1.0,Mechanical Engineer,"*Always doing something new, which is very exciting
*Starting and ending times are somewhat flexible
*Prestigious place to work. Family and friends bitterly idealize you
*Large campus like setting","*very very bureaucratic to the fault. Ones who know how to work that system really thrive here. It really doesn't matter you're the best employee. You just have to kiss so many a** correctly
* Very traditional way of working. Takes days to reply important emails. If you ask about an email that was not replied, you will be in trouble for stressing that person.
*Slow to adapt for new technology and doing things efficiently. Making sure funding received is well spent. Once you work here, it's hard to adjust to a commercial/profit driven company
*You need to be popular to get promoted. It's a cult like atmosphere. 
*Lots of ill trained inexperience people at the management just because they know to intimidate people.
*Popular way to hire people are to offer contract or temp positions. This means no salary increase for however long you work there. They will promise you the path to a permanent position but will never happen. So, after working at JPL on a contract or Temp basis, it will be a career suicide. You will have a hard time getting back to a permanent position.
*Besides, no matter how experienced you're, your say means little if you're a contractor or a Temp. There's a clear separation between social culture in contractors/Temp and permanent staff.
*HR is there to protect the management. Systems are in place to mitigate issues, but they are just systems – barely makes them to actions.
*Lots of $$ spent on outreach and branding
*Salaries are 20% less than the industry level offer
*Changing groups to acquire new skills or for your own career development is nearly impossible
These comments are very genuine effort to stop people from making emotional decisions when considering an employment at JPL. Best wishes!"

You won't find this kind of work anywhere else. At the end of a long project, you'll be able to say that something you contributed to is in space or on another planet.","- Poor pay compared to industry. You will be renting forever unless you want to commute 1+ hours each way. 
- HR is ignorant of the fact that Pasadena is a very expensive area. Good luck negotiating salary, especially if you are a woman or a minority. You'll be gaslighted until your hair catches fire.
- Management is ridiculously bad, especially in the engineering sections and divisions. They promote the best and/or favorite engineers to be managers, which kills two birds with one stone: you now have a bad manager who doesn't want to be there and you've lost a brilliant technical person. Well done management.
- Sexist old boys club. As a woman, I lived with daily gaslighting, questioning of my qualifications and ability to do my job, and highly inappropriate jokes, both verbally and in emails. In one particular incident, the presenter in a meeting said that he preferred working with men in the lab because ""women tend to cry when things get difficult."" The higher ranks are overloaded with old, white, baby boomer managers and technical experts that are clinging onto the old ways like their lives depend on it. Don't even bother trying to change their minds because it's not going to happen.
- No support. From anyone. You go to your manager with a problem? Watch them spend the next 20 minutes explaining to you that you're simply over-reacting and should maybe try harder/work more hours. Ah, the sweet smell of gas. That is if they'll even make time in their ""busy""? schedule to meet with you in person. Wait 2 months, then watch as they lose their mind and yell at you when that thing you asked for their help with threatens to delay a milestone. Unless you're the part of the project that is so on fire it's going to delay the launch, your requests for help will go unheard.
- No opportunity for advancement unless enough managers decide they like you.
- Rampant favoritism. Managers and high up technical people pick who they like and if you're not one of the lucky ones, you won't go anywhere. Those that are chosen get all the help and support they desire and are listened to in meetings because they have someone that will back them up.
- Remember that scene from Star Trek when the Centaurian slug burrows its way into Captain Pike's head? That's kind of what it feels like in a JPL design review, except instead of a slug eating at your brain it's the words of the reviewers. It is brutal. There is no respect if you have been there <~15 years If you're <5, I'd suggest covert kleenex earplugs. You will be yelled at, told you're an idiot, etc.... Reviewers have gotten out of their chairs and started smacking the projection of a powerpoint on a whiteboard. Poor whiteboard.
- If you're seen as brilliant and valuable enough to the lab, you're safe from discipline no matter what you do. Managers will cover up anything and everything.
- Everything is a competition between employees due to the practice of ranking employees for raises. Employees will battle with each other for resources and throw their teammates under the bus to preserve their image to management.
- Poor training, no standard documents/procedures. Reinventing the wheel is rampant. Documentation? HA.
- Bad parking. Road to the east lot floods when it rains. Watch out for glass that gets carried into the wash, it'll shred your tires."

Majority of people working here are enjoyable to work with and helpful. Flexible working hours. 9/80 Working Schedule: 9 hours per day with every other Friday off for 3 day weekends. Personal choice of either using a PC or Mac. Everything required for an Engineer to fully complete a task is located on Site (Computer Clusters for Analysis, Machine Shop for fabrication of hardware, Environmental Testing and qualification of hardware, etc.). Phaeton Program allows Early Career Hires to start working on a Flight Project immediately instead of waiting for the next Flagship project","Lower than average salary compared to Industry. Low raises. Adverse attitude towards new ideas and/or change. Little room for career growth. Systems to manage and store paperwork is poor; clunky and buggy interfaces, poor design which all equate to inefficient use of time by the user. PhDs appear to have more leverage on winning proposals and obtaining money to support their tasks versus ones who do not hold a PhD."

249,NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory,"Good people, poor sponsor",2011-04-18,3.0,Member Of Technical Staff,"People at JPL are generally smart and interesting. This and the fact that JPL is the clear world leader for interplanetary missions creates a very intellectually satisfying atmosphere.

I think managers are doing a decent job given the low level of resources.","NASA is a bad sponsor due partly to unclear, shifting priorities but mostly due to inadequate funding for unmanned missions and research. Projects, lab facilities, and R&D efforts are routinely underfunded and success comes in large part from people putting in substantial amounts of uncompensated overtime. The environment is ""entrepreneurial,"" which means you may spend substantial amounts of time lining up your own work rather than relying on management doing that job. Due to poor funding and shifting priorities, many efforts get started but never completed. Sometimes you can get in a mode where you're constantly proposing new work, hence the slang renaming of the place as ""Jet Proposal Lab.""

Since JPL has a good reputation, many people want to work there. The demand for jobs is limited and so the compensation tends to be lower than at comparable institutions. Average raises are typically less than inflation.

In many cases it's more appropriate to think of JPL as a ""soft money"" environment rather than a government job and you may find yourself constantly hustling after small and fleeting pots of money. Before accepting a job, consider having a discussion with your manager about funding levels for your projects and if you'll be expected to secure your own funding. Generating your own funding is not easy and usually comes only after years of building your reputation by networking within the organization and cultivating relationships with headquarters."
