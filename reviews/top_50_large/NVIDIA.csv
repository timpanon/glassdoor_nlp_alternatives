0,NVIDIA,Beyond Amazing,2021-05-07,5.0,Software Architect,"Jensen, our President/CEO is very intelligent, driven, articulate, encouraging, warm, and approachable. What you see on stage is the same person you bump into in the halls or overhear at the bar. Yes, we have a really nice bar in our building.

NVIDIA's success and amazing culture clearly comes from the top. During Covid, he has firmly repeated this message: ""Put family first!"" During the holidays, we don't have a big expensive company dinner, we volunteer or donate to our local communities.

The work is challenging and meaningful. Compensation and benefits are great. I love my coworkers. I've been here almost five years. It's real and I still can't believe how lucky I am.","NVIDIA innovates at a crazy pace. There is more work to do than time to do it. But everyone around you is working super hard. And doing what you love, with people you care about, for a president that seems genuinely to be one of the nicest human beings I've ever met makes me want to work extra hard, too. So the biggest negative is really self-inflicted."
1,NVIDIA,2 year review,2022-03-29,5.0,Software Engineer (Swe II),Great mentorship from co workers,Sometimes need to navigate politics

4,NVIDIA,A Company that Provides Support and Encourages Learning,2021-09-21,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"NVIDIA plays for keeps. They provide resources to help support employees in many different ways: sessions on well-being, Employee Resource Groups, generous benefits. During COVID, I've been able to have flexibility in my work schedule.

Equally important, they provide resources and tools to help you acquire new skills. There are many opportunities to learn internally (with Tech Talks) or externally (linkedIn Learning, udemy, and Stanford (if you're accepted)).

NVIDIA also provides opportunities to give back to the community. Employees can volunteer during work hours to update maps or build STEM kits to send to under-represented minorities. 

The company culture is important here - it's not just buzz words to make everyone feel good. They expect intellectual honesty, teamwork, and want folks to speak up and speak out.","It's been a little tough joining a new team when everything is virtual. That said, I've taken advantage of opportunities to get involved with a few Employee Resource Groups to start building connections with folks outside of my team.

The other con is that NVIDIA still has some work to do to improve diversity. It's clear that they are taking steps to improve it, but I hope it continues to receive attention."
5,NVIDIA,Fantastic job at an innovative fast paced company,2022-01-12,5.0,Account Manager,"Sales compensation plan is the best I have seen in the industry. It incents collaboration, long term growth and customer focus.

- Relatively flat technical organizations. If you don't like going through multiple layers of management to get to a decision maker, this is the place for you
- Asking open ended questions, or clarifications is part of the norm. Everyone wants to make the best possible decisions and outcomes, revealing blind spots or things we didn't consider is how we learn and grow","- It's easy to lose track of time when everyone around you are working diligently on hard problems. Definitely schedule time to take a pause and prevent mental fatigue

Technology is cutting edge with CEO who has genius vision and branding strategy. Fast-paced but generally very forgiving in terms of performance if your efforts are clearly visible. However, missing delivery deadlines are unforgivable.","Can be a toxic work environment. Flat organization where internal fight for attention and back stabbing are common. Upper executive level is bully type mentality with arrogance that trickles downhill.

* I believe in how we are doing it. We care about the environment and try to do things in the most ethical way possible.
* I believe management is always trying to do the right thing. They will step in and change things that are going wrong. You can voice your opinion on how things should go and upper level management will listen and change direction when they agree with you.
* They treat everyone that works for the company as their family.
* They encourage everyone to give back to the community and they take care of the communities that we live in and society in general.
* They treat me better than anyone when it comes to compensation. They took a look at how long I was in industry and what I was doing and paid me the going rate for those numbers. They didn't consider what I was making now nor any of my other offers. That made the Nvidia offer 50% higher than my current job and all other offers.","Sometimes there is a manager at a lower level that isn't doing the right thing. Nvidia will work with that individual though and do everything that they can to change the direction and help everyone to succeed though. And if you can't make that work out, you can always switch teams (and there is sooooo much going on that is fun and exciting.... not a bad option)."

2. Very good pay
3. Opportunity to work in industry leading technology","1. This could be team specific but too much of micromanagement. Often was taken to an extreme in my team and caused confusion about actual expectations, priorities etc... Also the manager would always talk in a derogatory and accusing manner. Seemed like the aim was to make me feel bad. Depends on each individual’s preferences and sensitivity but this caused a lot of anxiety to a point where I had to quit. 

2. Growth can depend on a lot of other things than the actual talent and contributions such as 
what / who a particular manager favors 
whether an individual is from a “top” school"

100,NVIDIA,The Best Place I've Ever Worked,2021-03-11,5.0,Senior Product Marketing Manager,"I've been in tech for more than 20 years, and I've held positions elsewhere that I fondly remember as dream jobs... but nothing comes close to the benefits and opportunities that I've experienced working for NVIDIA. I work with people who inspire me every day, as we all come together to tackle the hardest technology challenges possible, with the goal of making a positive impact on the world. Core values include intellectual honesty and empathy for every employee (and their families)... both of which are extremely important to me. Employee support during COVID-19 shelter-in-place has been incredible. There's so much room for growth - even if you're a veteran.",Parking can sometimes be a challenge during busy times.
101,NVIDIA,Great trade-off between execution and innovation,2021-06-17,5.0,Senior Research Scientist,"Great atmosphere, lots of respect for innovation and individual contribution. NVResearch is a great org to be apart of where innovation is key and ""research"" isn't defined and papers and patents.","The internal development infrastructure is ad-hoc and/or archaic. Nvidia would do well to adopt some of the numerous open-source tools that yield better code management, maintainability, syntax, checking, etc."
102,NVIDIA,One of my dream company,2021-06-16,5.0,Senior Mask Layout Design Engineer,"1. Technology is very advanced among the similar industry;
2. Compensation & Benefit are very competitive;
3. Team members are very motivated, helpful, a strong team with great leader, can lead success;
4. A very good CEO","1. Sometime the schedule is tight, but not always;
2. You have to start with simple job, and build your reputation along the way, which is true with all other companies."
103,NVIDIA,pretty good,2021-11-02,4.0,Softeware Engineer,good people work at nvidia,there is disorganization at nvidia
104,NVIDIA,Ultra Frugal Employer Treats New Employees Like Garbage,2021-08-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"1) In between project cycles, there is nothing to work on (but this isn't really a pro for me, as I felt incredible bored, disengaged and unvalued). I have so many skills but none of them were utilized.... this company has way too many engineers and not enough work to go around (if you've been here less than 5y, you will only get assigned the garbage work that no-one else wants to do, all the good stuff goes to folks who have been there 5 - 20y). They rarely hire new folks (almost never). Great place for lazy people (long-timers) to rest and vest.","One of the worst companies I've ever worked for (people, culture and frugality are among the worst attributes of this company):

1) Ultra frugal company:
 a) Pays much less than other companies (RSUs smallest I've seen) 
 b) Refresh RSUs are practically zero (not even worth mentioning)
 c) ESPP is useless (I was actually losing money on it while I was there)
 d) Incredibly difficult to get equipment purchases approved
2) Dishonest/unscrupulous recruiters/managers
 a) Recruiter actually negotiated lower level for me with HM than was discussed with me and didn't tell me about it! Unreal... same title had 3 levels so I had no idea until a few months after joining. So the RSU refreshers were much lower than discussed with recruiter.
 b) Waited several years for my manager to let me do the work we agreed to upon joining before moving on. 
3) Only long term employees get promoted (or those with same race/ethnicity as VP). 
 a) I experienced complete reverse discrimination while there (VP only promoted those of same race/ethnicity). Those of this race/ethnicity treated me like garbage and the VP (and other similar race/ethnicity managers under him) protected them and retaliated and beat-up on me for complaining. 
4) From what I saw, all new employees get treated like garbage by the long-timers at this company. Ironic since they have been there a long time and are making significantly more than you due to stock run-up. 
 a) A big part of the problem is that this company has no peer review system in place for annual or real-time feedback, so when folks behave in an outrageous manner, there is nothing you can do but try to ignore it. Totally broken review system.
5) People only respect you if you've been with the company a minimum of 5y.... time spent with the company is like a badge of honor. Ideas and industry experience gained outside Nvidia are disregarded/ignored (Nvidia is *not* interested in how things are done elsewhere in industry.... it's their way or the highway type of mentality). In my case, I had ~20y industry experience (specialization) in a particular area, and they wouldn't even invite me to meetings (I practically had to beg to contribute). No one at Nvidia had anywhere near the level of experience or knowledge I had in this area.... folks that were hacks were listened to like they were experts. It was amazing. I was used to being the subject matter expert for a company with 200,000 employees, but at Nvidia...with <10000 employees, they refused to allow me to be a subject matter expert (my director actually rejected my request to contribute).
6) People working here displayed a complete lack of integrity/honesty (although this happens at some other companies too).
7) The labs at NVIDIA are a disaster.  Most look like a bomb went off, and you have to fight to get even a tiny amount of lab space.  Definitely the most disorganized, underfunded and poorly run labs I've seen in industry."
105,NVIDIA,NVIDIA to the Moon 🌙,2021-04-22,5.0,Paid Media Manager,"Flat organization that gives its employees autonomy to do their best work. When you're in a meeting, there is no hierarchy. It's a free flow of ideas from everybody. You will have the ability to work on BIG company projects that drive real value to the world. Innovation is at the heart of NVIDIA.",The organization is big and sometimes there is random busy work to check a box. This busy work can get in the way of finishing your own work.

109,NVIDIA,Better Than Ever,2021-05-11,5.0,Marketing Executive,"NVIDIA has grown exponentially in recent years to become one of the most innovative and influential companies in America. But even amid the boom, many of its strengths have deepened and it's outgrown some past frustrations. Despite its size, it's still non-political, personalized and highly focused on doing right by its people. The company's really shown its values amid COVID and the Black Lives Matter challenges.

The philosophies that were noted on my way in the door have proven to be how the company operates.  It’s not lip service.,"The structure can be challenging at times.   People self organize and jump to help with different things, making it a bit puzzling at times to find your way.   Everyone understands this, helps with navigation and it gets better over time as you learn the ropes.   The flexibility of the structure ends up being an advantage in many cases."

Although they advertise that they are a hardware company that has built its software strength. Truth is that good software practice is poor. As for the quality of SW infra in a hardware company - decide it for yourself.

Some groups have bad process and tech stacks. Work has little skills involved but lots of drama and politics. Often needs to stay late night to work with people from different timezone."
128,NVIDIA,Passionate leaders and employees drive the success of the company,2021-01-13,5.0,Senior Director,A very flat org enables employees to effortlessly work across teams and exchange ideas with senior execs.

They have welcomed me into their team and have made sure that I have been given the tools necessary to succeed. It's a little weird starting with a company during a global pandemic, but my manager has been able to make the process as smooth as can possibly be. My team is amazing and the comradery between colleagues gives me a feeling of belonging that I lacked from previous employers. As for the company itself, I truly believe in the vision Jensen has.

* Lots of brilliant engineers
* Strong stock performance
* Flexible working hours/environment","* Engineering culture is very top-down. You will often hear ""There is only one boss at Nvidia - Jensen"". All decision-making is top-down and grassroots creativity is often overlooked.
* Because of top-down culture, teams/engineers experience a LOT of pivots. Most engineers typically work on 3-5 completely different projects/initiatives in the span of 1-2 years. This causes a lot of thrash.
* Politics is obnoxious. Orgs and org leaders have been around for decades and have created their empires. If you are caught between the politics/crossfire, it will be very ugly.
* Culture embraces ""brilliant jerks"". People are aggressive, somewhat arrogant and extremely entitled.
* Not very respectful - I've heard Jensen bad-mouth competitors in company all-hands."

Management is very understanding and strides to be ahead of the curve. Many people before the pandemic were already remote working from home once to twice a week. This made the transition during the pandemic much easier. Again going back to having people support one another it was easy to get advice on how to set up your home office and deal with challenges you might not have expected while working from home because colleagues are there to help and support you.,At times around big events it can be a bit hectic but that might just be standard around the industry

I agree with these reviews that the work you do in NVIDIA is exciting and will keep you on your toes. The company outlook is great and the emphasis on keeping their culture true to who they are despite the substantial growth is really outstanding to witness. There's a strong emphasis on meaningful work that really motivates employees they're making a difference in their roles.","At times, work/life balance can be tricky depending on the projects you are working on"

199,NVIDIA,Love this company!,2021-02-17,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Focus on caring for their employees, encourages family first and doing your best work.",A lot of information is tribal knowledge
200,NVIDIA,Why else would I work here for over a decade?,2020-10-08,5.0,Technical Program Manager,"A lot of companies will have upper management proclaim that they value their employees, only to turn around and conduct layoffs and/or pay cuts shortly thereafter. NVIDIA's CEO and upper management have, time and again, emphasized how valuable NVIDIA's employees are, and they have, time and again, proved true to these values through their actions. 

Amazing benefits have been implemented, some borne out of employees speaking up about previously unaddressed needs. Salaries and overall compensation are extremely competitive. Management listens to the boots on the ground, whether the subject is diversity and inclusion, furthering your own professional development through education, or pursuing different careers within the company. Since the pandemic began, every effort has been made to provide for and protect employees as human beings, from ergonomic furniture subsidies and flexible schedules due to family obligations, to careful and strict regulations and accommodations for the handful of essential employees who do come on campus. 

My colleagues are, by and large, wonderful people who just want to do the right thing, all the way up the management chain. After hearing so many horror stories from friends and family on the tech employment carousel, I feel like I won the work lottery, so guess what? I am motivated to push myself, to do my best, and to continuously learn and improve and contribute to my team.","As with many companies, there are some high intensity crunch periods during which there is a very real danger of burning out if you're not careful, depending on the team that you're on. Certain teams would benefit from reviewing these crunch periods, learning some important staffing lessons, and taking steps to mitigate burnout in the future. 

That said, some teams/organizations have better managers and management styles than others, and while I've been fortunate enough to be in A teams for my entire tenure, I also know a team or two that are just a sneeze away from a train wreck.

Last but not least, some may complain that lunch isn't free, unlike a lot of big tech companies, but all things considered, that's a minor (and frankly entitled) non-issue."

If you are good at kiss-up your manager then this is a great company.
If you got a good leader then this company might work for you, but beware of new automotive division are with most bad people mangers.","No transparency in  performance management process, you would be rated by your manager how ever they like you, no measurable system.
Also no transparency in performance review process that means you will never know what is your rating ,because company policy allows manager not to disclose your review rating!.
So you will be surprised one day that you are out the doors , because you had different opinion from you manger on executing tasks and rated bad in performance rating and no other manger inside the company will be ready to hire you for second chance, since you are already screwed  and you will never know.
Now imagine newly formed automotive division  with mangers only have technical skills and no people management  skills or leadership skills .

Also company itself changing it  goals every two months on automotive products, Good luck asking you manger about your goals ,where you will be provided nothing but retaliation and no way to prove why you got that bad rating, even after you are lucky enough to find out your rating from the classified top secret system."

Rank and seniority don't mean a lot.  If your idea is good, it doesn't matter who you are or how long you've been here.
Lots of people here who literally wrote the book on their technological specialty.
Zero tolerance for ethnic/racial/gender/age discrimination.   That's not from HR, it's everywhere.    Do or say something that appeals to stereotype or prejudice and people think you're an idiot.   Maybe that's how things are in 2019 techworld, but it sure is refreshing.
The commitment to reducing our environmental footprint is genuine.   The stuff I've fought for at other companies along those lines is already happening here.    Company strongly encourages commuting by bike, public transit, carpool or work from home.","IT is under-resourced, and gets snookered by consultants and the occasional snake oil salesman."

Also, if you enjoy tinkering alone without input from others, NVIDIA is great.","A lot of people and management on the software support side have been there for 10-20 years and are indoctrinated in the belief that NVIDIA software support is a functional organization. It is not. New features and development get all of the attention, and the support organization is left grasping for scraps. The culture of the organization seems to be indifferent/complacent regarding improvement.

We're no longer competing with just AMD/Intel; processes and infrastructure are running about 10-15 years behind other Silicon Valley companies, and NVIDIA staffs these departments as if they were cutting-edge and had the levels of automation and organization that the competition has."

330,NVIDIA,NVIDIA - Best Company to Work For,2019-09-23,5.0,Software Engineer,"I have joined NVIDIA as Software Engineer. Though my association with NVIDIA is just over an year, I have lots of Pros to discuss here.
1. Best Work Culture
2. PTO's and WFH is among the Best in the Tech industry.
3. Maternal and paternal leaves are awesome.
4. Getting to work on leading cutting edge technologies and your peers and mentors are completely supportive of your endeavor.
5. ESPP rocks!
6. Good Pay and other benefits like Medical, dental etc...
7. RSU grant and refreshers are OK.....",1. RSU refreshers could be slightly higher.

332,NVIDIA,Great company to work for,2020-10-08,4.0,Human Resources,"Flexible, agile, open to change",Can work little more on employee career development
333,NVIDIA,Great place to work if your income is not important,2020-02-01,4.0,Account Manager,"Great leadership, great culture and people, technology is amazing, cool company to work for.",The benefits are average which not what I expected.  The compensation plan is not competitive.  Low OTE's and no upside for Sales Reps.  If making money is important to you Nvidia is not the company to work for.  RSU's are given out to make up for the low target incomes.  They are stingy with the number of RSU's you get after you start.   Get as much up front as you can.
334,NVIDIA,Great benefits,2020-06-01,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Great leadership (Jensen Huang, CEO)",Unsure how well that leadership percolates down the chain
335,NVIDIA,Great Company!,2020-04-10,5.0,Strategic Account Manager,"Strong executive leadership, flat organization, opportunity to contribute at all levels of the company","Strong headquarters based culture, more difficult to navigate as a remote employee"
336,NVIDIA,The best company to work for,2020-05-25,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,Incredible Leadership. Company culture is amazing and work life balance exists.,Nothing I can think of at all.
337,NVIDIA,Amazing technology to work on but culture is hit or miss,2020-03-20,4.0,Hardware Engineer,"Opportunity to work on the cutting edge of robotics, autonomous vehicles, and large scale datacenter issues. 
Small teams so outgoing employees can take on more responsibilities and learn 
Brand new labs and work space","Some initiatives lack experts on the team so young employees do not have good mentors and have to learn the hard way. 
Compensation is far behind FAANG. Salary may be above average but stock compensation is extremely lacking. 
Product roadmaps change constantly with a lack of detailed communication on why"
338,NVIDIA,Great company to work ar,2020-05-20,5.0,IT Senior Director,Technology vision and solution provider.,Executives can be disrespectful at times
339,NVIDIA,Great company,2019-10-07,5.0,Senior ASIC Design Engineer,"You can focus on your job, not dealing with the company. The engineering managers are also engineers. People work hard and are smart. Compensation is excellent. Nvidia is involved in a lot of very exciting technologies. Benefits are also good, and work hour expectations in my group are reasonable.","Some higher-ups are very opinionated, so significant decisions are often dictated by them. Certain significant people are very demanding, which can create some stress at times. It's a slightly aggressive culture, in terms of pushing for difficult challenges."

leave policy (unlimited)
benefits 
learning","less intimate team relationships (depends on the team)
hike or promotions take a long time"
341,NVIDIA,Reminds me of a young IBM,2019-09-23,5.0,Senior Architect,"We have thousands of amazing minds working on a variety of hardware, software, and architectural problems.  Of those minds, they can be on their first week of employment or have been here for 25 years and still have their idea appreciated.  We are carefully planning and trying to move into new markets to leverage all of those minds.","It's a delicate balance to measure risk and reward on every suggestion.  As any company grows, it is important to not get too complacent or morale, profits, and success will all drop."
342,NVIDIA,Great company with generous benefits,2019-09-20,5.0,Senior ASIC Design Engineer,"Visionary CEO and competent management
Talented colleagues
Supports career skills development and internal transfers 
Work life balance
Gourmet food in cafeteria
6 months maternity / 4 months paternity leave","Pay is above average but not enough to comfortably raise a family in Silicon Valley (but the company offers several commuter benefits to make it easier to commute from affordable places)
Lot of redundancy in hiring (helps with work life balance but downside is that you become easily replaceable and it's harder to get promoted)"
343,NVIDIA,"Great work-life balance, calm culture, kind people",2019-09-20,5.0,UI/User Experience Designer,"Its rare that I have to stay late, especially since my team allows its members to WFH (work from home). My coworkers are caring and kind.","Its an older tech company, both in years established and in demographic/median age. I'm 24 and most of my coworkers are in their 30's, with the oldest being in their late 50's. I normally don't mind until I realize that all of my friends have made personal friendships with many of their coworkers because there isn't a big age gap. It can get a little dull around the office as well.  Also the salary is great but there are less perks than other big companies (no free meals,  just subsidized)"
344,NVIDIA,You can see the impact of your work,2019-09-23,5.0,Senior Product Manager,"Hit the ground running and leverage your skills right away.
Your team and teams around you provide guidance on what to do and how to contribute. 
See the impact of your work directly on products, services and other areas unrelated to your direct job responsibilities. 
Everyone has a voice at the table. 
In a way, each team works like a start-up. 
Flexibility in work schedules and places and almost all collaboration tools are supported.",The team start-up work environment might not be the most appealing for some.
345,NVIDIA,One team culture,2020-02-10,5.0,Product Manager,Clear mission and one team culture promotes collaborations. People helping each other out and communication is always great.,Company is getting bigger so quickly and you have to keep up very quickly so u are on top of things.
346,NVIDIA,Great place to work,2019-09-27,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Who doesn't like video games, robots, self driving cars, AI, and high performance computing all in one company? There are projects in almost every area of hardware and software design. Great culture around designing the highest performance products based on what can be done verses what is ""good enough"". The benefits are good, Jensen understands and cares about employees.","Deadlines can be tight, a lot is asked of employees to deliver at times, so can be stressful like most companies."
347,NVIDIA,Inspiring leadership whom employees and shareholders actually believe in!,2019-09-24,5.0,Verification Design Engineer,"Very competitive salary and benefits for this industry.
Very high level of technical and corporate transparency across teams/sites  (this is in striking contrast to many other so-called leading companies in this industry!)
Everyone believes in and works towards the company's goals and vision.
High employee morale and corporate pride.
Shared sense of success (and failures too) - not a ""me"" culture.
Employees feel valued.
Minimal politics that would block technical people from achieving their goals.
Agile decision making and course correction to stay on track with product roadmaps.
Company does not live in the past or rest too much on past success.
Fair amount of work/life balance (as long as you take responsibility).","Not suitable for people who aren't self-starters - often frustrating when onboarding to a new team to get very little help from peers which results in wasted trial/error.
A lot of tribal knowledge and sparse/outdated internal documentation/websites make it difficult and inefficient to find information.
Matrixed org structure leads to firstline managers with unmanageable amount of direct reports resulting in  very low opportunity for focused one-on-one time, coaching, and development.
Too much focus on projects and staffing at Headquarters - this leads to limited growth/movement opportunities for people outside of California.
Rapid growth is stressing the company's resources and historically closeknit culture."
348,NVIDIA,Fantastic Place to Learn and Grow,2020-03-18,5.0,Marketing Manager,"Highly intelligent and experienced colleagues, exciting projects, flexible and dynamic work culture.","Flexible, low process environment can cause individuals not used to this style to struggle."
349,NVIDIA,An amazing company at the epicenter of the computing revolution,2019-09-20,5.0,Vice President,"A 14,000-person company that feels like a family. Amazing leadership that cares about its employees. A place that creates the conditions by which bright and passionate people can do their life's work. At the heart of its culture is one that relies on intellectual honesty, a virtue that I have not seen anywhere else.","None. This Company makes a heartfelt effort to look after the well-being of its ""family."" Any shortcomings (if there are any - I don't see it) are merely incidental and very minor."
350,NVIDIA,I have been working at NVIDIA full-time for more than a year,2020-07-27,4.0,Verification Engineer,Incredible Leadership. Company culture is amazing and work life balance exists.,Nothing I can think of at all.
351,NVIDIA,Great company culture. Smart and helpful employees. Emphasis on innovation and best work,2019-09-20,5.0,Senior Architect,"Company culture is the best thing (e.g. flexible timings, remote work). Actual attention to employee happiness and career growth among other things, e.g. moving between teams and orgs is easy. Management is very technical. Collaboration across teams is an important aspect of work. And of course, emphasis on innovation and be the best in what they do (push the bar higher).","May be not so laser focused as some other execution companies/teams, e.g. vs Apple silicon engineering group. But that's the price you pay with flexibility, employee happiness/workload and allowing them to move across teams."
352,NVIDIA,Excellent company to work at,2019-09-23,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"More interesting work to do than can be done in ten lifetimes. Chance to constantly work at the cutting edge with people who favor results and not drama. Your work will be used by many many people, and you will get to advance the state of the art for entire industries. Company is very flexible, and willing to accommodate people who work hard and perform well.",Hard to stay on top of everything all the time.
353,NVIDIA,Talented and collaborative organization,2019-09-23,5.0,Distinguished Engineer,"The litmus test for good engineers is the willingness to listen and, when the conclusion is different than the plan, to change the plan. NVIDIA is full of engineers who are thoughtful and have the capacity to accept change.","Number one goal is always schedule. In pursuit of schedule, decision makers change the scope of work in order to meet schedule. Sometimes this means useful and important features are pushed to a later generation or architecture. After investing months or years on a feature, it is disappointing."
354,NVIDIA,Best Company I've worked for,2019-09-20,5.0,Senior Engineer,"I've worked for about a dozen  companies in my career, startup to established, small to large, and NVIDIA is by far the best company I've worked for.  There's a mindset of frankness and intellectual honesty, a sense of shared purpose and values, and a culture of work/life balance and of giving back to the community -- volunteering, charitable giving, etc.  The company continues to excel, despite many bears and naysayers, and the benefits of success are shared nicely amongst all employees.","For me, there are no cons to working at NVIDIA."
355,NVIDIA,Experience working in Nvidia,2020-05-28,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The people around you are very friendly and the culture is quite open. The salary paid is not competitive with FANNG but outstanding among hardware companies, e.g. Intel",The procedure of promotion is not clear. It usually feels like your promotion all depends on your manager.
356,NVIDIA,A Great team & Strong Company,2019-09-20,5.0,Technical Product Marketing,"- Excellent company culture :  Flexible work schedules, good benefits, family focused,  and pet friendly in some buildings! 
- Open work community :  Teams are encouraged to communicate and collaborate with each other. Teams aren't silo'd. 
- Advancement Potential : There is a lot of opportunity to grow in this company and there are a lot of talented employees that want to see you succeed. You can find support from your peers everywhere. 
-Personal Growth : A variety of resources are provided to continue developing your skills. You are encouraged to step out of your comfort zone and to try new things. 
-Strong Vision & Driven Peers - The overall vision the the company as it continues to push the boundaries of Computer Graphics, &  AI is a huge factor that keeps us all motivated and thinking about what can be done next.
-Variety in Work- You won't get bored. A lot of teams  work with the latest software and hardware so there is a lot of potential to try new things. This reliable change in pace keeps work interesting.","Resourcing/ Long term Planning - Every project is important and needs attention. Sometimes its hard to find the time to do everything and some teams can be stretched a little too thin. This becomes a bigger issue during launches or shows , when new tasks come in with a tight turnaround ( two-three weeks). During these times working overtime and putting in more hours becomes a must for a lot of teams. 

Pivoting - You need to be flexible and able to pivot with the company. For the most part, NVIDIA has a very steady direction but how we continue to go in that direction can change often and require teams to adapt."
357,NVIDIA,"Great Tech, Great Work Environment",2019-09-19,5.0,Principal Engineer,"Great environment. Doesn't have the ""analysis paralysis"" disease that is so common. Decisions get made and we move forward. Decisions get revisited when situation changes.

Much of this is related to having a strong consumer focus. Business results require new product for Christmas and Back to School. Those products use the same building blocks as non-consumer products so the whole company is on that cadence.","It's a big company that still acts like a startup in some ways. Documentation is spotty (and is frequently ""here's what we did that's different from last time"")."
358,NVIDIA,Good company,2020-03-23,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,Good benefits and great work environment,No free food as of now

360,NVIDIA,Best job I've had,2019-09-24,5.0,Technical Marketing Engineer,"I've been at NVIDIA for about a year and a half. Great mix of employees (age, background,  ethnicity , and so forth).  Lots of common-sense perks. Relatively flat organization with a fair amount of CEO oversight/visibility. 

The Santa Clara corporate headquarters is a beautiful space. Look forward to coming into work. Great to have cubicles and not an ""open office"" environment. 

Flexible as far as work@home goes.","None worth mentioning. And, this is based on over 20 years in the tech industry."
361,NVIDIA,Great company to work for with top-notch benefits,2019-09-21,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,You have the opportunity to work on best in class products that are solving real world problems.  You're working with other talented engineers that keep the work efficient and agile.  Every engineer gets a change to influence change in the products or software shipped to customers.  Despite the size of the company many aspects are similar to working for a startup.,"Long hours are not unusual, but employees can typically set their own work/life balance expectations."

2) Decent compensation and benefits.

3) Working on cutting edge AI and Machine learning, which will be the future.","1) Work-life balance might get screwed up a bit during hardware releases, but I think that's the case during the release period for any company.

2) Benefits can be a bit better matched to competitors such as Google, FB etc."
365,NVIDIA,Amazing opportunities to learn,2019-09-20,5.0,Solutions Architect,"Within solution architecture, I have been able to explore multiple fields within ai and  learn a lot. Coworkers are brilliant and there is always an expert to ask questions to.","With solution architecture there isn't a clear way as to what you can do next in your career. Nvidia will let you move between organizations, but there isn't a super established path as to how you grow career wise, some go into business development and some into engineering and product."

374,NVIDIA,Pursue your passion,2019-09-22,5.0,Principal Engineer,"You would do what is best for you and best for the company
Pursue your passion at full speed without spending much time in regular chores around the job.
Work with some of world class engineers in an open and cooperative environment.",You will be lost in the depth of innovation and the details of what it takes to really deliver something.
375,NVIDIA,Great Place to Work,2019-09-20,5.0,Senior Engineering Manager,"Lots of opportunities for advancement and taking on new responsibilities.
Startup culture with big company stability.
Smart, driven people do very well and are compensated very well.
Teams are given leeway to make decisions for themselves.
Graphics, deep learning, self-driving cars, and high-performance compute. What's not to like?",Can be a little chaotic with no org charts and many independently operating teams.
376,NVIDIA,"Okay for a while, not a place to stay",2019-10-23,2.0,Software Engineer,"- Salary and Bonuses are less than say, Google or Amazon, but still quite good. ESPP in particular is great generally, and has been amazing over the past 10-ish years.
- Fellow engineers tend to be dedicated and skilled.
- Being in a fabless semiconductor company provides unique challenges compared to say, transmitting advertisements 1% faster.","- A switch to ""Agile"" development was done by people who have no idea what Agile is
- Depending on your team, if you don't put 6 hours in per day in JIRA, you will get a nag email. Helping other teams? No way! Going to meetings? Well, not too many...
- Corners are cut frequently. You will never feel proud of your work, always surprised it shipped.
- Does some task require special expertise? Well here is a 1 hour meeting about it a week after the task needs to be done. Maybe just read the slides, no time to actually attend that meeting. Want to read a book to understand the topic better? No way, there is no JIRA task for that.
- Employees complained about lack of Learning and Development resources so, they paid for Coursera. Not enough for all employees, so you may have to wait. No support for learning on the job, so I guess the idea is that you'll log in on a weekend to watch videos that are often freely available.
- Very few retros/post-mortems, multiple chips will go by without your team stopping to explore why testplans are always being trimmed to be actually completed, and even then very few changes will be implemented.
-Maybe you will work 12 hours a day , 7 days a week for months. Well enjoy your expensed lunches and dinners on the weekend, that's all it's going to get you. Counts for nothing towards management, Just say No when they ask."
377,NVIDIA,Great culture of innovation,2019-09-24,5.0,Senior Software Architect,"Cool new tech, amazing people, phenomenal leadership, friendly  and open environment, flexible schedule, reasonable pay, good benefits","Work/life balance could be better, open space environment sucks, cafeteria is underwhelming"
378,NVIDIA,I like working here,2019-09-20,5.0,"Engineer, Senior, Tools Development",The products have impact in multiple consumer and business areas. The campus is nice. The food is decent.,My only complaint is the sparse perks and the cubes shrinking with every floorplan update.
379,NVIDIA,"Fast-paced, innovative, little hierarchy",2019-09-20,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"You get tons of autonomy and ownership. Fast-paced work environment. Learn a lot, very quickly. Feeling of contributing to real and important projects and to the success of the company. Very smart colleagues.",Lack of hierarchy can seem chaotic at times and sometimes requires one to step-up and lead.
380,NVIDIA,Overall a pretty good company to work for,2019-07-24,5.0,Senior Applications Engineer,Everyone can make a difference. Most of management is willing to listen to you if you have a good idea and can execute.,"The same as the pro. Everyone, including unintelligent, brash, and loud people, can make a difference too. You gotta stick to it."

383,NVIDIA,I wanted to share my great experience working at NVIDIA for anyone considering joining.,2017-05-12,5.0,Senior Product Manager,"First off, not every experience I have while working here has been great, but there are so many reasons that I love this company and the people it attracts, it outweighs any negatives .  For reference I have worked here for 6 years.
- We are a data based company and a very intellectually honest company.  If we fail, we fail together, but we don't hind mistakes or make excuses.  We learn why we made the mistake and we adjust.
- Down to earth people.  During the development of a product, I had no issues getting our engineering SVP in a room to help make decisions and make the product a success.
- We have great leaders.  
- We are investing in productivity, and infrastructure to help us innovate.  IT has not always been good and is not great yet, but is getting better so quickly.  And we are building the most beautiful new HQ - Endeavor.
- Great ESPP
- Onsite perks are getting really good.
- Healthcare access is a priority 
- Parental leave is great
- Work-life balance is a priority
- We only hire great workers and for the most part human beings... :)","- We are growing very fast and it is challenging to fit everyone in from a facilities perspective.  Meeting space is tight, but we have invested in meeting pods to help.
- It is hard to think of others that I didn't list above"
384,NVIDIA,Work on very cutting edge and challenging  hardware designs in machine learning and AI,2019-09-20,5.0,Principal Engineer,"Machine learning
AI
Flat management structure across programs
Expectation and ability to take on greater ownership 
Close interaction with software teams in hardware/product design
Management team that knows their company strengths and sees opportunities earlier than the market","Location
Changing priorities (normally market or product driven)"
385,NVIDIA,Best place to work!,2019-09-20,5.0,Senior Systems Software Engineer,"Tons of different things to learn, work. Surrounded by projects which are always working on or using cutting edge technology/software tools. Promotes learning opportunities. Flexible work time. Very open culture of communicating with anyone within organization.",Culture changes team to team but ramping up and adapting to new project was challenging
386,NVIDIA,Excellent place to work,2019-09-23,5.0,VGPU Specialist,"NVIDIA supports me completing my MBA, offers flexible work hours, and has an excellent management team","Honestly, i have only been here 6 months and so far there have been no issues"
387,NVIDIA,Fantastic Place to Work,2019-09-23,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"* Intellectual honesty is not just encouraged, it's required
* Relatively flat organization, easy to talk to whoever you need
* NVIDIA is still innovating like crazy, I love it","* Lack of ""organizational charts"" (on purpose) makes it difficult to ""find the right person"" on your own"
388,NVIDIA,Great company and exciting workplace,2013-03-30,5.0,Software Engineer,"When I saw some of the negative reviews on Glassdoor about NVIDIA, I was nervous about whether my experience would be similar to those ones. Having worked at NVIDIA for nearly a year, though, I can say that my experience has been anything but negative. I absolutely love my job here -- I wake up excited each day to come to work. My work life balance is great -- when I'm at work, I work hard, but I then leave my work at the office and don't think about it when I'm at home.The work itself is challenging, but I have found that  this helps to motivate me all the more. I have never had any trouble getting help from my co-workers, and in fact, I've found that most will bend over backwards to help someone else when they need it. I've found that most of the individuals I've worked with have been exceptionally smart and I've learned a lot from them, but at the same time, I've found that I have been able to offer a lot back to the group and it's a great feeling to feel that my relationships have been a two-way street. It's also been awesome to work at the cutting edge of technology and to see the innovations the company is developing.  

I'm continually impressed with NVIDIA and I feel I've made the right choice in coming here.","The main form of communication at NVIDIA is email, and accordingly, you'll get tons of it. Effective filters/rules help to manage the deluge."
389,NVIDIA,Great company with great benefits,2019-09-29,5.0,CPU Microcode Engineer,"* Great benefits
* Flexible work hours","* If you work for an organization that isn't part of the core business (i.e. CPU team), there is certainly a lower sense of urgency to be ""the best""."
