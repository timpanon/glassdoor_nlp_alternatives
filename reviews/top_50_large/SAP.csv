SuccessFactors is a provider of Human Capital Management software and aspires to the ideals fostered in their applications. Comp and benefits are great.,"One's overall experience is driven by the individual's reporting line. My experience was horrible. I was marginalized and harassed by my manager. Expectations were rarely defined and unclear when they were. SAP owns Qualtrics which is leveraged internally for evaluations of management. These surveys carry weight at the LOB level but don't seem to resonate at lower levels.

There is significant technical debt and an aggressive high risk, high reward plan to close that gap. Time will tell, but the practicality of that plan has to be questioned.

In an environment that pledges customer centricity I saw at least 2 cases of unethical behavior that at a minimum create reputation risk. It is possible these cases could also create legal liability."

Large corporate users/customer base.","Work life balance is a thing of the past. 
Pay is half of market rates. 
Development senior leadership is overly frugal and inexperienced; they set unrealistic goals with no objective reasoning and then blame/punish the productive roles for failing to meet them.
Development senior leadership is only concerned with getting something on the product listing; no regard for quality or product viability.
Development senior leadership greenlights projects that aren’t ready and short-circuits their own product lifecycle processes, leading to serious delays from research.
Development senior leadership is completely inflexible about product release dates for literally no reason other than to get products listed as fast as possible, leading to release of unusable software.
All members of leadership constantly make bad decisions for short term gains because they are using their roles as a springboard into higher leadership and leave before they face any consequences.
Product Managers have their own reporting line so they have completely different goals and success criteria not aligned with their development teams.
Product Managers have no scrum training nor experience, don’t come to scrum ceremonies.
Development managers who are brand new to the company think senior developers are inept because they haven’t quit already, don’t consult them on major decisions, and then blame them when everything backfires.
Development managers have no B2B nor enterprise software experience, and fail to recognize the inherent complexity."

Too stuck in old ways of thinking for tech companies, hard to implement change without getting hammered with corporate red tape.

HR is the biggest problem (with the exception of the Diversity and Inclusion Pillar which is phenomenal. ). There's very low EQ for alot of the HR staff and many of them have long tenures so they are just coasting at this point. Even when doing internal transfers, HR can be terrible. Direct quote from HR during an internal transfer when negotiating level and salary cap ""If money is all you care about, maybe SAP is not the company for you."" Why would you say this to someone who already works for SAP? 

I also think there needs to be better company wide training and evaluation on how to deal with situations of harassment in the work place as HR consistently botches the handling of these type of situations.

I have confidence in SAP to manage that task going forward.,"It is a very structured organization that has many layers compliance.

1209,SAP,Join if you want to make the company better,2020-09-29,3.0,Technical Program Manager,"SAP North America's benefits are slightly above average for a company of its size. They have pretty standard dental, medical, vision, 401k, parental leave, and PTO. One perk is unlimited sick days. Their employee equity plan has relatively no strings attached. The one downside is that they partner with an obscure company out of the UK. Customer service is poor, and their investor portal has a lackluster UI.

The people are nice, and everyone is well-adjusted to remote work. They don't mind kids or dogs in the background of virtual meetings. A perk (at least for me) is that SAP does not require video during virtual meetings. There's sort of an unspoken rule not to use video. I personally enjoy it. I can dress comfortably, and I'm not distracted about how I look on camera.

North American leadership is very community minded. When tragedy strikes, they respond. They've created relief programs for natural disaster victims. After George Floyd was killed, they hosted multiple All Hands sessions and diversity education sessions. They testified in front of Congress. Even now that Black Lives Matter isn't making headlines, they continue to promote minority causes and small businesses. They are not afraid to ""get political."" One of SAP's core values is inclusion, and North American leadership works hard to foster that. SAP in principle is a progressive, equal opportunity employer. For example, they had training about non-binary individuals before it became ""mainstream."" They also have an Autism at Work program.

It's very possible that you'll work with people who are all over the world. It can be very rewarding (and something to brag about).

The North American offices are LEED certified, which means they pass stringent environmental standards.","Right now, the SAP I love looks very different. From my perspective, global leadership's attitude has been essentially, ""Shut up and do what I say."" They don't understand or care about how our internal processes work. They've forced us to roll out solutions that aren't ready for customers, or solutions that customers don't even want. In order to meet their deadlines, we have to implement complex manual workarounds to get the job halfway finished. To be fair to current global leadership, SAP's processes were complicated before. Unfortunately, selling has always been the primary goal. We have a poor track record of actually delivering quality service. But the current pressures we're facing are making things worse. Add all of the COVID complications, and now you have a place that really isn't fun to work.

Though SAP's pledge of inclusion is admirable, it is not always practiced. Hiring practices can be elitist. To be frank, leadership is primarily white men and high caste Indian men. Our current Board is all white, mostly German, and only has one woman (there will be two when 2021 starts). Our first female Co-CEO—a loyal, beloved member of SAP—""parted ways"" with the company less than a year after she was appointed. 

Overall, I am disappointed in the current state of the company. I think it has potential to be a great company, but not with the current people in charge. 

If you want to make the company a better place to work, then please join us. If you're just looking for a job, I recommend looking elsewhere."

1233,SAP,"Great place to work, learn, grow and continuously develop",2020-08-28,5.0,Vice President,"Despite being the world’s industry leader for business software, SAP managed to keep a “small team” feeling - where colleagues work in a respectful and agile way. Key focus has been, and is, to deliver value for SAP’s customers (internal and external). From smaller enhancements to reimagining entirely new business processes, SAP brings some of the smartest people in the industry together to drive and solve tomorrow’s technology innovations. Knowing that a majority of the world’s economic activities are processed on SAP systems, and seamlessly connecting producers of goods with consumers, makes us proud. Knowing that many of our technologies and financial contributions are used to help and better the life’s of less fortunate world citizens, shows commitment to purpose and heart.

SAP’s management solicits and uses employee feedback in its daily business practices resulting in an environment of trust, respect, and genuine practice of “employees are the most valuable asset”. Being part of the SAP family means, one never runs out of options to further develop, learn, grow, and take advantage of opportunities. There are thousands of colleagues that are ready to support, be it for business mentorship, a personal challenge, or simply to have a friendly competition of encouraging fitness tracking as part of work-life balance and a healthy lifestyle.

SAP has generous benefits and pay – which is only one part of the equation. The boundless opportunities, with learning opportunities, advice and mentorship – as well as the ability to work with and learn from top international industry talent is a priceless experience not many companies can match. I can highly recommend SAP to anyone looking for a true opportunity that goes beyond of just being a job.","At times, the things that make SAP such a great company, like individuality, innovation, autonomy in one’s job, can be the biggest challenge. 

Establishing a good network of key contacts from day one is a must, and allows tracking and following of new developments across the entire organization – even outside one’s business area. Find a good mentor and be prepared to work in a “team work” approach. 

While working remote might be acceptable, working closer to an official office location may also help with establishing those relationships (though most leadership is distributed throughout the world, as in many global companies). 

SAP being an European company, the treatment of employees is very fair and considerate (maybe more so than many US companies) yet they are not immune to continuous changes in the industry, which leads to organizational enhancements from time to time (for the most part not reductions, yet changes in managers or teams). These will be easier to digest with a good network and a positive attitude in place."

They've given us 10 days to use for crisis leave like taking care of family or decompressing as kids are at home; this is not for sick leave which you'd use if you or anyone in your family gets Covid-19. They even sent all employees reusable cloth masks to use and kept us update on the current Covid-19 situation worldwide. Prior to all this it was great going into work and meeting with colleagues and eating lunch together. Now our whole UX department meets on virtual chat every Friday or so just to chat during lunch hour about none work stuff. SAP has also asked for Fridays to not have meetings so people can get work done and flexible to figure out the new norm with staying at home.

1285,SAP,Phenomenal Company!!! - just a few small critiques,2020-08-11,5.0,Education Consultant,"So many pros -- the pay, benefits, vacation time, work/life balance, parental leave. Higher ups at SAP really do care about our wellbeing. SAP's response to the COVID-19 crisis was phenomenal and showed great leadership. They immediately closed all their offices and training centers and shut down all non-essential travel. They sent free masks to all their employees, and gave us all an extra day off to get out of our home offices. Although in some cases, SAP is known for older technologies and interfaces, that isn't often the case anymore, and you can join a group work on cutting edge technologies. SAP does a great job promoting internally and allowing employees to move around to different roles and positions while staying within the company. If I ever decide to change my role, I know that I want to stay with SAP.","A lot of optional benefits you can take advantage of at SAP, like tuition benefits, fellowships, etc., is all determined by your direct manager's approval. This is extremely disadvantageous to those of us at SAP with managers that don't believe in these opportunities and don't want to use any of their budget for these items. More importantly, your ability to move up in your career is determined by your direct manager, and this is an extreme disadvantage with some of the managers they've hired. Also, it is very difficult to get fired from SAP, which means that poor performers at both management-level and individual contributors get shuffled around to new groups rather than getting let go, which brings down all of SAP with their lower standards."

1349,SAP,"Fantastic company, I feel fortunate to be a part of it.",2020-08-03,5.0,Principal Consultant,"SAP has exceeded my expectations all around. SAP is enormous so navigating the ins and outs of an enterprise this large is reality; so yes, there will be cliques here and there, there will be managers who aren't as adept as other managers, and change is constant. Thing is, in 2020 successful companies have to keep inventing and innovating. If you stay stagnant in this global economy, you'll struggle. I'm listing this as a ""pro"" - there is no hand holding at SAP. The company has invested mightily when it comes to self-learning and if you take advantage of these options and invest in yourself - you'll be successful. There's plenty of opportunity for growth and movement within the org and not just from a professional standpoint. The company offers and supports sabbaticals and fellowships. The technology provided to employees is top-notch. Want to use a mac and not a PC? Sure! Need supplies now that we're all working from home? No problem, order what you need (in reason, obviously). There are many 2018 reviews stating how people were leaving certain SAP brands en masse - and while there is some validity there, many of them expressed regret 6/12/18 months later. Says a lot about the company.",Still need to figure out how to harmonize all the products and then publish (and keep up) tight and clear documentation on the harmonization. Many times it takes trial and error to figure out something one would think would be clearly documented.
1350,SAP,"Best culture I've worked in, ever.",2020-08-03,5.0,Center of Excellence,"Values employees, their needs, opinions, safety, career growth, needs, family life balance.  
Great benefits.  Good compensation.  Incredible on-boarding program.  Great communication both from upper management and immediate management.  Overall, I am blown away.  Covid 19 wise, again the company has employee safety  at heart.   For those with high risk, I believe they will work with employees who have travel requirements, in order to stay safe until immunizations exist.  Very impressive.  The amount of content available to employees borders on overwhelming, there is so much available to educate, prepare and enrich employee knowledge.  They even have formal programs for finding  mentors, coaches and peer interactions.  I could go on and on.  Great company.","With so much content available to leverage, they need an improved internal search mechanism.  They do have one, and it's effective, but it could be better, perhaps leverage more filters and attributes....given how much content there is.  This is the only think I can think of, and it's nit picking."

1362,SAP,An awkwardly goofy but nice enormous company,2020-08-03,5.0,Software Architect,SAP is home to several software mega-projects and its rare you get a chance to work at this scale in software.  Everyone is nice beyond belief and extremely competent in their different areas.  Developing software for mega-projects is an unsolved problem and you get to work on it with great people.,"It's very difficult to develop software at this scale. It's very difficult to manage at this scale. Teams can function agily at small scale, but it can take a long time for large scale features that span hundreds of teams to solidify into action.  Small companies can't dream of taking on problems of this sort, but at the same time, everything you learned at a small company has to be reinvented."

1364,SAP,Best Employer of my 23 year Career,2020-08-03,5.0,Cloud Operations Specialist,"SAP cares about its employees. Yes, really! It recognizes that its Human Resources are its most powerful resource. SAP has created a culture of people first, whether that be rewarding its employees with bonus days off during Covid to ease stress, gifting stock options or providing amazing free learning/class opportunities to ensure health and wellness. I have never felt that SAP talks a good talk but does not back it up with action. There is a clear path for advancement. The compensation is fair. The flexible work environments are a plus. As a working mom, I have never felt unable to put my children first before work commitments.","Change is a constant in the business work, particularly with tech. However, I have experienced more than average changes and re-orgs in my time at SAP. For example, I have had 4 different managers in one year as part of various re-orgs. My colleague has had 6 different managers in a year and a half. This leads to a feeling of job insecurity that is never good. Also, while SAP was ranked #1 for diversity by Forbes Magazine, my personal experience does not match that. There are no people of color on my team. Tangentially, I work with only one woman of color and three men of color. Older employees tend to get re-org'ed out. The Board is white and Germany with only one woman currently in what I would consider a 'more female"" role. To SAP's credit, they have stepped up in 2020 to address racial injustice in a meaningful way that has been more than lip service."

I’ve had an HR ticket sitting open for 4 months with no response. IT responses to tickets can be too cryptic. This item alone is super frustrating when you need help and if you’re new to SAP. 
Remote Office: This is not really a Con but more of a challenge for those who haven’t been 100% remote before. I’m so used to being in an office and collaborating with others. Working 100% from home has taken some time to get used to."

1498,SAP,"overall, a solid place to have a career",2020-08-12,4.0,Customer Success,"As a whole, SAP is a great company to work for. It's successful and stable, the pay and benefits are competitive, and the corporate culture is extremely conducive to establishing a long-term career with the company. Generally speaking, once you're at SAP and have established yourself as a solid performer, the company makes it relatively easy to explore other roles in other areas of the company, and many people take advantage of this flexibility and enjoy long and happy tenures with the company. 

SAP is constantly changing, which can be frustrating for some, but it definitely helps keep things interesting and is a necessary part of adapting to the needs of the market. 

The fact that our CEO openly encouraged employees to submit Glassdoor reviews says a lot about him.","Like any large company, there's a potential for politics to come into play; and like any job, whether you love or hate it will be largely dependent on your boss, the leadership of your specific organization, and the culture they establish. 

Management opportunities can often be based on personal connections over merit. There seem to be lots of examples of people quickly jumping from the bottom of the company into very high level positions after working in ""the office of the CEO"" but how those opportunities are assigned is a mystery to most employees.

SAP also touts a focus on ""diversity and inclusion"" - while it does seem that we have at least some diversity in the lower ranks, diversity in leadership is severely lacking. There is a clear focus on promoting women into leadership positions (there is even a stated goal for that) but so far, that seems to be limited to caucasian women. Having been at SAP almost a decade, I can't think of a single upper management position held by a person of color."

1513,SAP,Fantastic Product Complicated by Sales Processes,2020-08-07,3.0,Account Executive,"Qualtrics was an incredible offering at the top of their class. Leadership was good, and it was clear they hired the high level talent.",Raleigh's satellite office got a little less love than expected. SAP began to loom over larger deals. Quadrant was something that was annoyingly lingering every day of your life (performance metrics).
1514,SAP,"SAP may be okay, but life at the Concur subsidiary is misery",2020-08-27,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,I honestly can't think of any. All of the ones I can think of would be disguised insults.,"Concur cares about you. They think. As long as you are exactly the same as everyone else at Concur. As long as you don't complain about anything that happens to you at Concur. As long as you keep your head down. As long as you don't ask for any assistance from outside your team. As long as you don't complain when your assignments are literally impossible without assistance that you can't get. (As long as you can prove that you were working very hard and producing a product, it doesn't matter that it does not and cannot work.)

Concur seems to have a management training program which turns out people who exult in trying to make every employee like every other employee. Two employees have different strengths? NOT ON MY WATCH. We will not assign people to tasks that they excel at. And if we accidentally do, then we will make sure that, if your task is not high status, you will not get any promotions or significant pay increases, no matter how important that job is.

Nothing gets done at Concur unless you know someone. Filing a ticket because you need a static IP address at your desk, so you can do tests? It won't be denied, it will simply languish for six months, until you contact this guy you know who tells you who would know who to talk to, and three hours later you've tracked down someone to take care of your problem, and an hour after that it's done. Woe betide the remote employee who doesn't start out with an automatic support network of the people in the offices near him.

HR/benefits is never your friend. Example: you read the rules of how the 401k matching works (updated for this year!) on the company's benefits web site, and schedule your 401k contributions accordingly. Except the matches don't come in properly. So you file an HR ticket, which gets ignored. So you go and find the appropriate person via networking (see above) and say 'look this isn't working how your document says it should'. And they say 'wait where did you get that document' and you say '...the benefits web site?' And two hours later they write you an email saying 'thank you for pointing out that document, it was wrong and we have removed it and the right document is elsewhere and it says that you're going to lose out on several thousand dollars this year and that is not our problem.' And if you want your money, that you were entitled to according to their own document, you will have to sue them, because not giving you the money you were entitled to is a hill that they will die on.

HR/benefits makes a LOT of mistakes. For example, issuing incorrect W2s, and then having to correct them, and issuing incorrect CORRECTIONS, and having to correct THOSE. And then next year issuing incorrect W2s AGAIN.

Like 'accidentally' taking double the legal amount for HSAs out of your paycheck, and then telling you that they couldn't correct it themselves, and that you would have to do so (even though the HSA contractor they use says that it's their responsibility to correct it). And then in order to correct it making you sign a document that says 'the undersigned has been advised to discuss this with a CPA or a tax law expert' and then refusing to pay for you to discuss this with a CPA or a tax law expert. Even though they are the ones who created the problem in the first place.

Like giving people the wrong cell phone reimbursement policy, and then after they've put in their expenses for the first two months, telling them that that was not the right policy and that it was their responsibility to know what the right policy was.

Like their parent company (SAP) having an on-call-time pay policy, and Concur accidentally allowing on-call-time reimbursement for one person, but when the other people who are on call and want to be paid for it too ask for it, Concur discovering their 'error' and lecturing them on how all developers should be DevOps and should expect to be on call 24/7 as part of their job description. This despite mediocre pay and benefits, no stock options, and crappy bonuses. ""Look, if you have to work from 5 AM until 7 PM on January 1st, hung over, and you miss a party you were looking forward to for weeks, that is not our problem. Maybe you can ask your manager for a day off. But not two days off. That would be crazy.""

The most astonishing thing about working at Concur is that there are still some good people there. I can't imagine how, though."

SAP-Concur offers a great work-life balance.","Policies & procedures have become ridiculous. We have literally gone back 10 years in time to manually keeping track of issues with our new ""Issue Tracker"". Nothing is automated like it used to be. 

Also, finding the right resources is tough and the documentation and training are severely lacking. 

Making sure new employees have proper access is also a headache. Half of the managers have no clue on how to get proper access to new hires. 

As a woman working for a large company, there is a huge pay gap between men and women. I know this because my referral (who is male) was hired on making 10k more a year than me for a lower position and this was after I had been with the company for over a decade.  While Sap-Concur has made some strides to improve the pay difference for me, it is still not enough. I am barely making more than the new hires that I am expected to train and mentor."
1519,SAP,"A mixed bag, but it's nice to have stability in a time of crisis",2020-08-04,4.0,Senior Education Consultant,"The company is financially secure and your employment probably will be as well. Good benefits and generally kind people. In my experience, your managers actually want you to take your vacation and care about work/life balance. 

If you're good at your job, you can get a hefty amount of restricted stock pretty regularly.

A lot of job opportunities at the company are internal only, so there's a pretty normalized culture around hunting for new jobs within SAP. This gives you ways to grow when you inevitably hit your team's ceiling.","There's a lot of division of responsibility. This means unless you're lucky enough to be in an influential pocket of the company, your ability to do things quickly or have an impact is HEAVILY blunted. Worse, a lot of the teams you'll need to work with to do your job are pretty poorly-performing.

Diversity is lacking, especially among leadership. The people in charge are mostly German men. Since a lot of functions are global, even people based in the US will often have layer upon layer of male German managers.

Reorganizations are a constant fact of life and often seem based more on political power struggles for headcount than any logical ordering of labor. If you're lucky, you'll keep your direct manager and impact is often manageable. If you're unlucky... well thankfully it's only happened to me once."

And I work in a team which interacts with almost all business units, I have seen this problem all across SAP.
- SAP pays very very less compared to other companies in bay area. Salaries in SF region are comparatively higher, thats a known fact, but even compared to the competition and their partners in Palo Alto/ South Bay. SAP pays 30-40% lesser than Google, Facebook, Netflix, Apple, even lesser their immediate neighbors, VMWare.
- Another big cons, lot of promotions happen in the T4 level, while people in T2 and T3 are struggling to prove their worth to their managers. I have seen very worthy people denied of promotion, while their middle management takes credit the work climbing up the ladder very quickly.

It gives the employees room to grow and gives them wonderful extra time to help your family cope with any troubles in life. SAP also tries to fulfill best in employment salary and bonus structures.,"While SAP as a company offers great benefits, the problem is within the Product Support division.  People who may apply for Support engineering role should look elsewhere due to the reasons below.

In Product Support there are two main tasks (i.e. could be inhumane too), that is so tough that it requires you or forces you to work nights and weekends.

I) First task: Man the Expert Chat Channel.  Why is this so tough? First there is not a lot of people who may help here (or it adds a lot more work to your daily requirements). If you somehow walk away to go to the bathroom or you are helping other customers online, there would be a flag or an alarm to management that there is nobody manning the chat (Or you are not manning the chat).  This makes employees start to feel anxious to the point that SAP Product Support becomes a very stressful environment (i.e. unhealthy). 

- If going to the bathroom gives an employee stress then this is simply a requirement that is inhumane (HR issue)
- This makes employees very stress to the point that they may quit the company (which happens a lot in SAP)
- Turn over is pretty big
- This task also adds to the overwhelming number of requirements that the support engineer needs to do daily
- This is also going to be recorded in a report that is available to management - how long did you logon to Chat?  They can use this number against you.

For example: If the support engineer needs to help 5 different customers daily with their issues technically that may last 1 to 2 hours each (in a web session call or deep dive session), this chat (i.e. you may get between 1 to 3+ per day) will add another 30 min to 2 hours each on top of the already scheduled 5 customers (10+ hours).  This will either push other important customers aside for the next day (lower customer satisfaction) or would make the support engineer work beyond normal working hours to fulfill the requirement.  SAP is wondering why they are not getting high scores in Customer Satisfaction, it could be that the process they placed could be stressing their employees to be the best they could be.

If you do this daily, you would have tired and highly stressed support engineers which will then be burned out. This may show up in our customer satisfaction results as your engineers are not fully rested and can only give 5 minutes to each new customers (i.e. ping pong effect).

 II) Second Task: You are also required to work nights and weekends (Saturday and Sunday).  This is one of the hardest one that is given to any support engineer.  Yes they may ask you to take some other days off or may even give you money but it also takes away the most important thing a person needs and that is time with family and time to recharge oneself.  We can argue that the chat + weekend support makes an engineers life hard.  Wait til you miss a call or work during the weekend, this is where you would feel what hell is like at work.

These 2 tasks from product support is one of the most challenging thing to swallow (your mindset needs to be a zombie).  If given the opportunity to work for another company or division in SAP that do not have these requirement, I would say sign me up immediately!

Last issue is as soon as you get to a particular level, there is no more growth.  You have maxed out.  Your contained within your level per budget limitation.  

If you can work in SAP in another division, that is good. Within Product Support, it is tough."

 Leadership survey process makes sure employees are taken care of and their needs are fullfilled. 

Performance based stock awards, medical benefits, time away from work, paternity and maternity leaves (almost 12 weeks plus)

You are mostly rewarded based on performance and at times based on relationships","If you are an U.S. employee and not a citizen, rely on visas to legally work, it's really difficult to grow here since lot of hiring managers do not want to deal with the administrative overhead of handling visas and the process, you will not be able to move within the company as freely as a citizen would. This limits your growth potential.

If you want to gain global exposure or want to move to different country to continue your growth to avoid the constant anxiety around U.S. visa process, you have to deal with the global mobility bureacracies, COVID has made the already difficult international transfers impossible, it requires board level approval to move between countries, SAP touts the run simple mantra, there's one for running simple. If nobody but board could take decisions on an international transfer, you can understand how bureacratic the processes are here.

Diversity - If you look up the L1, L2 and L3 leaders in SAP, you can figure out how much diversity is respected in senior leadership, it's only at individual contributor level and gender diversity at leadership level, you should start empowering people from different ethnic groups."

1561,SAP,"Overall, a great place to grow!",2020-07-06,5.0,IT Executive,"The benefits are competitive, compensation is pretty good, there are always challenges for those who seek them, there is growth opportunity, and there is always an ability to learn something. SAP takes care of their employees (generally speaking) with the understanding that we will pay it back in kind. I, and others, have been very fortunate to always have opportunities at our doorstep.

Technology and solution challenges are plenty, as there is always something to do.

Christian Klein is brilliant... One could argue he became sole CEO too early, but those arguments would be severely flawed. He has a solid field of recognition and a strong grasp on what people in the company are doing. He's a financials wizard, but he keeps his heart very close to the technology. He's an absolute rock star in the making.","Work/life balance can be an issue (particularly in nations without protective worker laws), and ancillary benefits are not always consistent from region to region. Some of this is to be expected.

An unfortunate side effect of a large company, like SAP, is that that willfully ineffective people have an ability to hang around far longer than they should. They tend to hide in different departments or act as barriers to progress. Again, not a show stopper... but at times it can be an annoying impediment. 

Additionally, there is not enough visibility on the quality of individual (named) leaders. These individuals can either positively or (severely) negatively impact the quality, moral, and retention of great employees - thus, valuable talents depart (good leaders or good teammates under poor leaders) before it can be recognized. 

The one con that many of us have not yet learned to overcome is this: If you are NOT in proximity to the global headquarters, it is hard to get recognized and there is a bit of a glass ceiling on your upward mobility. There are fewer true growth opportunities. This means many people end up departing for other green fields in an effort to advance their careers and ambitions.

SAP would do well to independently review their people surveys and outcomes for hidden talent in other regions."

1578,SAP,Walked the talk.... at first,2020-07-08,3.0,Market Development,"Entire organization is very interactive and (mostly) inclusive. I've never known a sales organization to have dedicated sales coaches and program managers specifically for market/sales/business development type roles, and that type of support goes a long ways. The highest achievers are team players and are always willing/able to share what's working well for them, both on a personal basis and on large group calls. Majority of management has done this role before, which you don't see too often. If they hadn't, they listen to their employees to understand exactly what we do, and go out of their way to constructively coach.

Being backed by the SAP name is very powerful, but Concur still has its own culture. That feeling of independence goes a long way.","There never seems to be an 'off' button, and it feels this way especially since COVID came around. I've never felt more stressed out to hit a number or micro-managed in my many, many years of sales. It's one thing to understand and adjust to what the business needs, but even when new objectives are communicated, there still seems to be a lack of alignment with our direct selling counterparts (a majority that I've met are outside hires that don't fully understand what Market Development's purpose within Concur is.)

After working with past Concur employees and hearing what it used to be like, I feared that MD still honed the fraternity/ good ole boys club atmosphere. While it certainly appears to have improved, that aura still lingers above us and it can be felt on a daily basis. Management does everything they can to support 'under'performers, however many peers aren't as generous. I've seen a couple people leave because of that lack of camaraderie or inclusion. This job isn't easy by any means but these conditions make it a lot harder, and I can understand why there appears to be a faster revolving door here compared to other SaaS inside sales orgs."

This is not the industry norm. A typical tech co pays reps at the end of the month following when the order was booked. (i.e. - close a deal in January, you get paid end of February.)

At SAP, the rep gets paid only after the customer pays SAP. So in the case above, close a deal in January, customer pays in April, you get paid end of May. Most customers are paying @ net 90 the past couple of years. This means you'll wait 4-5 months on average to get your commission checks. And that's after long 12-18 month sales cycles that are the typical for SAP products. Be aware!!"

Most of the job positions are filled without any interview or screening, so you better focus on your networking skills than hard or smart working.

During the COVID, they came up with strange restrictions which require approvals at all levels, for employees that want to move to another country due to visa restrictions, company process requires board approval, that's for less than 10,000 USD expense, talk about running simple.

If you establish a process where nobody but board can take decisions for expenses of such low dollar value, you just don't have trust in your L3/L4/L5 leadership team, Global mobility team in SAP acts like government office (no offense to anyone), you have to constantly beg them to get your response.

2. Highly unlikely for SAP employees to be laid off or furloughed due to Covid-19 or any other crisis.
3. Highly unlikely to be fired for non-performance or poor performance. But like any major company, they will do a major reorg every 5 years and at that time, even good performers will loose their job.","1.Risky proposition for H1B holders and Green card aspirants- they will say they will process, but it will not go all the way to the end. Even SAP employees in senior roles with 10+ years in the company have had to exit USA due to visa issues.

2.Like in the case with many European companies, the important/exiting/value adding work is done in their European HQ (Germany for SAP). So, folks in USA, India etc are only given tasks that they don't really care about, as it is not important.

3.SAP has a large workforce, but leadership is lacking and is poorly managed as the ratio between leaders and 'worker-bees' is bad. For eg, if a Sr. person in leadership role is good, he/she will have 50 or more direct reports and responsibility to manage 2-3 acquired companies for that department. So, due to this overburden, he/she will not be able to perform upto his ability. In other words, 'good guys' cannot perform due to over-burden and 'bad guys' cannot perform, as don't have the skills and experience."

If you are not part of the cool kids club (in other words white), you will not be selected to grow in your career. There is a lack of minorities in leadership as that is not the culture here as compared to any other tech company. SAP touts itself as an inclusive employer focused on diversity yet for SAP; diversity means gender equality (but you have to be white) – it’s like SAP jut woke up to gender equality and it was the latest buzzword out there. The other problem here is SAP is great at marketing itself - it is after all a sales and marketing machine and not a software company - so reality is very different from the illusion SAP markets itself as in terms of product or people diversity. If it was not for CoVID-19 a lot of people would have left sooner.

Lastly from a performance management perspective, it does not matter if you kill yourself to stand out for you probably will make 10% more than the lowest performer and forget about talking about career goals (re: see above for explanation)."

The stock program, OwnSAP, is a great value for employees. You can contribute up to 10% of each paycheck to the program and SAP will match 40% of what you contribute (up to some ceiling). The stock immediately vests, so if even you don't want to invest in SAP you can immediately sell it and essentially increase your salary by 4% for free.","Booted Jen Morgan in favor of a German CEO.

What they telly you is not how it's going to go down.  I figured that out about 3 weeks into my job.  You will just be thrown in w/ basically zero leadership. Every  six months there's going to be a reorg and panic sets in after q2.  Hiring freeze and travel freeze to save money to help make the final numbers.  That's how it's done.  Most of it's a shell game.  New labels aren't added to SAP.  They depend heavily on the same install base to keep buying bc they are so tied into SAP that they can't leave.  You'll never beat SFDC in a head to head deal unless it's an SAP shop.  Only way you'll make your numbers is on named accounts.  SAP says they want to goto mid sized accounts, but has zero name recognition puts very little effort to make those customers feel special.  So if they hire you for that area and accept just bank the base salary for as long as possible till you realize that you have no shot. Very political environment.

Managers tell you straight to your face insulting words even my colleague was facing mental issues. All my co workers and I wonder how the heck this place get rated as best place to work for? We are all miserable here. Maybe because when we went to HR they don't even care for these issues so nobody bother to report? Or tbh even scared of the pettiness they will stab you in the back and find out who writes this review and let you go.
This place does not have a problem of letting people go. If you work here and you see it you know it's true they all do off source labors and contracting work that's it. The salary is great, yeah for full time workers. And guess what, you don't even stand a chance for full time even if you are an internal application. Disrespect is everywhere from management. Ready to yell at you for mistakes and never an appreciation. People are so petty they even find problems to report you for using phones and act like they are special. Oh and nobody holds doors for you with a smile ever here. They do it like it's a task and they are scared of socialization. Elevator talk? Forget it. A good morning from stranger? Forget it. Free food? You are ready to pay for pasta and sauce with no meatball? Meatball is extra charge! Oh and the lines re infinite and you basically fight for tables.

Great company culture
Fairly competitive salaries
Good benefits","1. SAP varies the benefits it offers its employees based on geography. Employees in the US, for example, get significantly less paid parental leave than those in Europe. 
Ex. In Europe, the *minimum* a new mother can take is 15 weeks, and she can take up to 26. In the US, the *maximum* is 12 weeks. 

For a company that talks a lot about taking care of its employees, it seems somewhat hypocritical to treat them all differently, working within the minimum guidelines laid down by law. 

2. Internal raises and salary increases are fairly stagnant. Practically the only way to get a significant raise within SAP is to get a new job in a different department. This is awful, because then those with much higher expertise and product knowledge just... leave. Regular actual raises for increased expertise and product knowledge would save SAP a fortune in hiring and training newbies, as well as improve employee morale and help retain good workers."

I've been part of Concur pre-acquisition and post-acquisition (SAP) and the culture has not changed even in the slightest. The work-life balance, focus on health and wealth,  individual career and personal growth, and the complete buy-in from leadership has not changed. SAP is an amazing  global organization that does the right things and takes care of their people.","Concur is the 800lb gorilla in the room and continues to be the market leader in the Travel & Expense software.  Innovation and product improvements are the two areas that need more focus, but changing such a massive cloud based software product that is used by millions daily around the globe is a challenge, but they're making strides. SAP is one of the top 4 ERP and Business Suites giants in the world, but ""Running Simple"" is sometimes the hardest part of using SAP products."

I really love it here.","The biggest issue I have is how LARGE the company is.  Sometimes, something that should be simple (like getting a P.O. issued) takes an inordinate amount of time.

I have been doing this kind of work for a long time, and the quality of people here are top-notch.  While there may be some changes to our team's leadership, the Leadership team is AMAZING and work TOGETHER to get stuff done and make things better for employees.","SAP is a HUGE company, and for those of us who are used to being scrappy, it is hard to get as much done as I want because there is a process for everything. We work it through, but patience is sometimes not my strong suit. it doesn't overwhelm my positive experiences, just a pet peeve, really."
1877,SAP,Great company!  Would recommend a friend who is willing to work hard.,2019-10-07,5.0,Presales Consultant,They are very focused on taking care of their employees.   Top management does a lot of Town Hall Meetings to share vision.   They have a big focus on diversity and giving back to the community.   Great benefits and care a lot about work/life balance and putting family first.   For key product such as Finance & HR - earnings potential is the highest in the industry.,"In the past, middle and front line managers were not A+ talent but this seems to be improving.    The job is hard....if you are looking for easy big money - this is not the place for you.    Big company means ""run simple"" is just a tag line - not a reality.

1880,SAP,SAP a workplace where the people REALLY MATTER,2019-10-07,5.0,Business Engagement Lead,"At SAP, you have the opportunity to develop, network, and an environment to share ideas with peers and management. Teams really work together to support overall goals. Vacation days are earned quickly, starting with 3 weeks plus holidays. Flexibility to work when and how you work best- workplace of the future.",I honestly couldn't think of any cons
1881,SAP,"There's No Ladder to Climb, It's a Jungle Gym",2019-10-07,5.0,Small Business Advisor,"Great work life balance. You can really go anywhere once you get your foot in the door and ""climb the corporate ladder"" so to speak although it's more of a jungle gym than a ladder.",Parent company SAP located in Germany. Kind of disconnected. Doesn't feel like we are all one company.
1882,SAP,"Entrepreneurial spirit, collaborative, tons of growth potential",2019-10-07,5.0,Marketing Specialist,"CAREER FLEXIBILITY: I started my career in pre-sales, moved to product development, and  looking for a new challenge, I reinvented my career in marketing. I can't imagine another company where I'd have been able to reboot my career *with support from management* as I have here. 

COLLABORATIVE CULTURE: The level of collaboration here is really amazing. Talk to SAPers and the most common  ""plus"" you hear about the company is ""the people""... Can't find information you're looking for? Send an email to someone you don't know who has that keyword in their profile, and no matter where in the world they are, they're going to help you or help you find someone with the information. I've never had someone say to me ""that's not my job"". It's amazing. And uncommon.

ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT: SAP is big, but everyone I talk to agrees the thing we love is the way you can mold your role/job and career here - and if you decide you want to leave to try something different or you're taking a break from work to take care of family, and want to come back to SAP you'll find that additional experience viewed as a positive (and in the case of a break to care for children/family, you will find support for your re-entry).  That said, if you are someone who wants a job that's highly-directed (strong oversight, active management by your boss on a day to day basis with daily feedback/input) this is not going to be a place for you in most cases. This is a highly-independent work environment in the vast majority of cases.

CULTURE: I'm going to sound marketing-y for a minute, but imagine working for a company that is EDGE Certified (leading business certification for gender equality), has a global Tech Diversity & Inclusion team, has offices and customers in ~180 countries;  has a major Corporate Social Responsibility organization that coordinates volunteers for service activities, and during 2 mos of the year offers paid time off to participate in volunteer activities;  and donation-matching is offered. SAP has been in industry leader since 2014 delivering an Annual ""Integrated Report"" which considers the corporate impact on the environment and our sustainability, to use a holistic view of our total impact beyond finances as our measure of success each year.  We also have a range of employee interest groups including Business Women's Network, Black Employees Network, and are one of Workplace Pride's Top 10 companies in the world for LGBTQ-friendly  workplace environment and policies.  Inter-cultural training is provided to help teams in different countries understand how to work and communicate more effectively with each other. This is not about political correctness; it's about being respectful of others' cultures and different points of view, even if you have different beliefs. 

GLOBAL REACH/IMPACT:  If you eat it, drink it, drive it, wear it, or use it in your daily life, our customers probably make it. E.g., 78% of the world's food supply is delivered by SAP customers (including 82% of the world's chocolate supply, and 72% of the world's beer).  That is incredible - but it also is a key reason our Board and CEO have a mission to ""Help the world run better and improve people's lives"". If your company touches 70% of financial transactions that happen daily, globally, you have an opportunity and a responsibility to think about how that reach can benefit people - not just ourselves.  A lot of people struggle wanting to work somewhere that makes a difference - I've found working at SAP I have a long-term career where I do make a difference, in ways that I can't imagine other companies could. Very cool.

SUPPORT TO INNOVATE & TAKE RISKS:  the CEO says ""tell it like it is"" and take informed risks and as far as I've seen, this is supported (standard caveat of, ""when it's done in a constructive, and respectful way"".  This may partly be a function of German work culture, but I've found the openness here refreshing compared with friends' experiences.

PURPOSE-DRIVEN: SAP's mission FOR YEARS is ""Help the world run better and improve people's lives"". This was our mission before it was 'cool'. This was our mission before terms like 'green-washing' and 'virtue-signaling' came into mainstream conversations. We have had CSR programs for more than 20 years; we have had sustainability programs for at least a decade; we've had excellent benefits like paid parental leave for adoptions, paid bereavement leave (immediate family ), affordable healthcare, paid vacation starting at 3 wks (sick days are separate from vacation days), subsidized public transportation, and our larger offices there are employee cafeterias where you can get subsidized lunches (hot food, not just deli-style food), sourced locally when possible, and with vegetarian and vegan options. 

TRAINING & CAREER SUPPORT:  a robust program for growing within the company means once you join SAP, you can do a wide range of jobs and change careers - as I did - multiple times without leaving the company. I personally attribute this to the German business model, which brings in young talent and nurtures it, versus the typical American model where recruiters look for existing-employed individuals and attempt to hire them away.  This model means a lot of people stay at SAP for a long time compared to other tech companies - but the ability to move around within the company and try different jobs keeps your career fresh and interesting. There are formal and informal job training programs, formal Mentoring and Coaching programs, internal recruiters to help people move around, and - one of the best things - opportunities to work in other countries for short term or permanent assignments, with the most opportunities in Asia, Europe, and Latin America.","LARGE BUSINESS COMPLEXITY:  the entrepreneurial spirit is real, but SAP still is a large enterprise, with a broad portfolio of software and there's just a layer (or layers) of complexity that's unavoidable.  Approvals are layered and things don't move as fast as you want/should. No worse than other places, better than many. 

RE-ORGs: all companies in tech go through reorganizations more frequently than companies in traditional fields like manufacturing, but SAP is somewhat known for moving teams and organizations around faster than average.  Depending on your role in the company, you could have a new focus in your job every year without actually moving to a new team. 

If you hate change and having to constantly learn new things, this will be challenging for you.  But if you get bored easily, this could be a positive even if it can be frustrating."

Although the company is large, there are abundant resources and people to connect with to further your career.  I have spent time at a small startup and SAP often has that small-company energetic, change-the-world vibe and I know that is rare or nonexistent in large companies elsewhere. The Executive Leadership is trustworthy and transparent.  Motivation to do your best work abounds, I really enjoy working here.","Sometimes certain elements of vision can get clouded through the vastness of a 100K employee company, but you truly can seek out lots of information about where SAP is headed internally and educate yourself.  There are also normal pains of navigating a large organization to find the right resources, but SAP is committed to ""Run Simple"" and we're making improvements."
1886,SAP,Unmatched investment towards employees' development,2019-10-07,5.0,Presales Consultant,"1. As an early-talent, I have never experienced this level of investment towards newer employees. Your input is encouraged and respected. You are empowered to make a difference.

3. Culture of mentorship and teamwork: everyone is willing to help you, irrespective of their seniority, team, location etc.

- Lots of opportunities for training and advancement
- Good quality of life and relatively low stress","- Working outside of the main office in Germany can feel like being a 2nd class citizen at times, where we are shut out from decision making and given less interesting work to do
- There is a trend in the company to build open floor plan offices without even cubicle walls. Developers are largely introverts working on tasks that require total concentration for hours at a time. It should be obvious that the open floor plan is a DISASTER for this kind of employee. It's hard to estimate precisely, but my productivity has dropped to probably 30% of what it was in a cubicle. Imagine the overall impact on employee morale, as well as the bottom line when you need to hire 3 people to do 1 person's job in this kind of environment."

- WLB is ok I guess. As in any other company in the bay area.
- Lot of politics around. Good idea to shut up and do your work wearing headphones.
- The company doesn't seem to be doing so well. I am seeing less money being spent on employee engagement. We used to have monthly outing and stuff a few years ago but now its once in like 4-5 months. SAP normally has a yearly outing to great america but they even cancelled that this year saying they need money for ""processing other employees green card"". I mean who says that ? That was so bizarre. We got some horrible food trucks where it took my 2 hours to get a small slider I am not even kidding. Overall with the recent layoffs and other small things going on here and there I am not very sure about the future about this company and looks like a sinking ship."

Since I work on a truly global team there is no need to be at the office although the office is wonderful and most SAP locations have special access suites for lawyer office which means no fighting for meeting rooms. There are several programs that allow you to expand your experience- The fellowship program and the experience exchange program. One allows you jump into another job role entirely for 6 mos or more and sometimes in international locations. The latter program is a shorter job shadowing or project secondments in other departments which also comes with a travel budget. Employee engagement is valued and worked on. Every location in SAP worldwide has free lunches and some places free breakfast.,Pay is never the highest. The pace of change can be slow for those that want to come and change things quickly but this deliberation also helps with stability.

More early talent programs would be beneficial in achieving the goal of getting more young talent hired.
1947,SAP,Great company with a poor compensation strategy,2019-10-07,4.0,Global Strategic Operations,"SAP is a big place, sometimes there's literally a job for every little task that can be thought of. If you are great at networking and self-promoting you could move around quite a bit within the company. There's a lot of fringe benefits and learning opportunities that are offered. Some are good for development and some are good for a nice distraction to your day to day.","This is a big place with lots of people. Organizations are complex and there's a lot of overlap. It can be hard to operate across organizational lines when you aren't even sure which organizations do what and owns what. It can feel like you're working within an amorphous blob that can only roll uphill or downhill. 

In addition the compensation strategy is poor. This is a sales driven company, everyone else is treated like ""everyone else"". Promotions are driven by ""who's next in line"" vs ""who's deserving"". Since compensation isn't driven by performance, they do try to be creative about finding other means to promote performance but those efforts generally fall flat and they themselves are funded enough to meet the demand. 

The compensation culture incentives position movement (even lateral ones) rather than performance to increase your compensation."

Beautiful campus in Palo Alto
Healthy Company Culture & Values
Good Early Talent Programs
Great food on campus","- Terrible compensation at SAP silicon valley/bay area. Even though I have always been a top performer in my team (I've been SAP Catalyst for several times), even with my promotions/progressions I have stayed at 70% of my level's median salary. Raises have been around 3-4%. My only option (I'm bound to SAP through my Visa and slow GC processing) was to switch to a company SAP acquired, which I did. Suddenly, it was the most normal thing in the world to be paid 100% of my level's median salary.
- Slow Green Card processing - I'm not affected by this, but many of my peer complain about it. SAP uses Fragomen for Visa processing and they are terribly slow. Expect for a single email to answered by Fragomen after 4 weeks, sometimes two months. Now figure how many years some people wait to just get their GC process started.
- Incompetent people & product management - Most managers have no idea how cloud software is built and how dev teams have to be organized.
- Reporting lines across the ocean and back
- Terrible product quality: I do not know a single SAP product that I enjoy using. Everything is just hacked together.
- In the very end, no real value-creating work: Software development at SAP is mainly about stitching together acquisitions with our core. All the newer stuff (machine learning, IoT blockchain, etc.) is done at comparatively low investment (politically and with resources) mostly driven by non-technical people instead of ""value engineering"".
- I haven't seen a single ""innovation"" project succeed at SAP within the past 5 years (Leonardo, etc.). Everything is just stitched together somehow with no real strategy."

-Work from Home: depends on the team, but it's very common here and most managers are very flex with this. 

-Opportunity for Growth: Lot's of opportunity for growth 

-Cool events: They throw some cool parties if you're near an office. Holiday parties and Summer Picnics are pretty fun and they really go all out with the events. They also bring in awesome guest speakers like Jill Biden, Elizabeth Smart, Jerry Greenfield, etc. and i really look forward to these","-Training: almost all training is done online now and everyone knows the quality and effectiveness of online training...  

-Lack of technical training: there are soooo many different types of customer support / enablement teams and no one has really any technical or functional knowledge of the products. 

-Work Life Balance in Consulting: It's great that the executives preach about work life balance, but everyone knows in consulting, that doesn't necessarily exist if you're working for a large, strategic customer with unrealistic timelines 

-Sales vs. Professional Services: conflicting KPIs within these orgs causes lots of headbutting and undercutting. I cant tell you how many times sales people have sold/promised something that doesn't exist without talking to product and then they just dump it on the consultants after the deal is signed and they get their comp. 

-Products:  lots of product shortcomings. It's extremely frustrating to be working on strategic accounts and implementing a product that has lots of room for improvement, but SAP has laid off product resources to hire more customer enablement people that sit around and blow smoke."

Pay is reasonable, given the lowball ""salaries"" (if one is lucky to have one) that have become standard in the economy. Benefits are good.","Zero visibility to those on the ground. All major decisions are made in Germany, and are often shortsighted and/or senseless. Developers who aren't in Waldorf or Bangalore often get the short end of the stick, while expecting to conform to half-year deadlines.

Good place to learn about enterprise software.,"Significantly low pay compared to other jobs in the Bay Area. No clear company agenda. Too many managers which create a huge disconnect. Many managers are unqualified and upper management only care about numbers and not results. Trust in management is super low, especially after the huge layoffs in March. Tech stack is old and becoming obsolete. Progress is slow. Unless you’re planning on retiring soon, staying for more than a few years in SAP is career suicide. That’s a reason why many employees have a hard time leaving the company and those who do end up leaving for MS, Salesforce, Workday, etc."

I learned more through the recruiting process and was blown away to hear about their impact on the world's business community. They power so many companies across the globe! What really hooked me in and got me interested in working at the company was their employee value proposition tagline of ""Bring Everything You Are, Become Everything You Want."" That assured me that SAP could be a place where I could innovate within my specialty and grow my career. I've been with the company for almost nine months and I can honestly say it's an awesome place to work and grow. Superior benefits, great programs and workshops, honest and inspiring coworkers... coolest place I've worked in my career!",There's always more room for collaboration between teams so as to avoid duplicative work.

While it can be tricky (and confusing) at times to navigate the continuous changes that occur at tech companies, I really appreciate the positive and collaborative culture at SAP. Nearly all colleagues I've worked with at SAP are truly nice people who are focused on making a positive impact to the company and its customers.","Like other tech companies, expect a continuous flow of change within the organization. It can be confusing at times. If you find that unsettling, this probably isn't the right industry for you."

Then they moved everyone under them on and brought in their buddies. The new senior managers would make arbitrary decisions on who the managers under them should be. It happened at least 6 times  in 3 years. The people working for the managers were way more qualified for the jobs, but not one of those positions were ever advertised.

2072,SAP,The cheapest company in the bay,2019-06-12,1.0,Software Developer,"- You can chill a lot and coast along. Variable comp parts are very minimal and firings are pretty uncommon, despite bad performance. TLDR: Perfect company for coasting and retirement.
- Perks are OK (but not great)","Working for SAP, especially if you are the Bay Area and you want to have a career with a meaningful purpose or comp is one of the worst life choices you can make.

There's a ton of problems at SAP, but I believe many of them are symptoms of an extremely below market compensation and incentive structure which nurtures and rewards a culture of mediocrity.

They key problem areas are:
Compensation (Note this is from the perspective of Engineering):
 - The compensation at SAP Palo Alto is severely below market. New Grads often get only around ~100k TC (total incl, bonus and stock!) and even as a seasoned engineer and high performer it is extremely difficult to get 200k total comp. Most folks I know earn between 100-150k (again incl. bonus and stocks) and have around 5YoE and are usually pretty high performing. While ""100-150k"" sounds like a lot somewhere else this is ridiculously bad for a company of SAP's size in the bay area when you are a high performer. Almost every startup, no matter how small will pay you more Base than what SAP offers as Total Comp and give you a generous stock option package on top.  Most bigger companies of SAP's size will pay you at least 1.5x, often times 2x than SAP (FANG would go even 2.5x-3x if you get lucky) . Furthermore the salary progression is very slow. If you progress as a high performer you get often times only between 2-4% salary increase per year. During a promotion you will normally get at max only get 10/11% more, often times less than that. Note typically you can get a promotion earliest every 2 years. On top of that almost everyone with your YoE gets paid the same, no matter how good or bad you're performing. I.e. If you perform 10x to the worst person in your team, you're probably still just earning about the same, max 10% more. Managers get a very small bonus and salary raise pool that they have to distribute between folks. Furthermore the pool size doesn't depend on the performance of the team. If you are in a team with only high performers the pool size is the like in teams with only low performers. Altogether the comp level is extremely low and the system does not reward performance, therefore everybody is just coasting and the whole atmosphere is very demoralizing.

Extremely political and bad decision making:
Most of the middle management is extremely political and just trying to keep their job / justify their existence and increase their teams headcount instead of actually making the right technology and product decisions in the interest of the company. I had one SVP even admitting this to me and saying that at ""SAP SVPs are like dukes fighting to keep power over their own little kingdom"". If you want to experience GoT real life, be SAP's guest. Often multiple organizations worldwide work on a very similar problem but instead of joining forces they're just making up arbitrary differences to avoid a conflict and keep their SVPs independent. Important technology decisions are made by SVPs and Architects in committees where 90% of the people haven't written a single line of code in decades. Every tech decision is affected by the ""not-invented-here-syndrome"" and instead of reusing existing proven OSS tech for non-differentiated components a bad SAP-copy of a technology is developed, because leaders believe they can easier sell proprietary SAP tech for top $$$ to their customers. This works in the beginning with some naive SAP fanboy customers but never leads to an industry leading product or technology and long term always leads to the same result: SAP's losing in favor of a much better and cheaper competitor. In general whoever makes the best PPT slides and talks the loudest gets to make decision and the promotion. SAP is a sales machine and not a tech company, unfortunately.

Immigration Policies:
The immigration policies at SAP are an absolute nightmare. First of all you have to beg your manager and HR to file H1Bs and GC. For GC you have to be 3 years with the company until they start the process, unless you get an exception approval. If you leave the company within 1 year after getting the GC, you have to pay back all the lawyer and filing expenses. The immigration team (HR and Lawyers) are extremely unresponsive and often times don't answer for weeks or months to your emails. You basically have to beg your manager to follow up with HR / immigration on your behalf and even your manager doesn't get answers for weeks at times. Furthermore they have some weird policies like that you have to be in particular T  level (career level at sap) to file a GC in a particular category. For example for GC EB-3 you have to be in T2. If you are already in T3 this means in some cases your manager has to temporarily demote you to T2 in order to start the GC process which is just another way of keeping your comp down. Many folks I know are visa-trapped inside SAP on an L1 or E1 visa and SAP uses the visa trap to keep folks inside the company on their subpar comp. Those folks would leave the company within a blink of an eye once they get the right visa.

Subpar technology and Engineering:
The engineering and technology at SAP is pretty bad overall. Because of the politics often times bad tech decisions are made and because of the bad comp SAP can't get the right talent to consistently create good tech. A lot of the core technologies that you have to use in your day-to-day work were developed and are pushed by the HQ in Walldorf where people live in their own bubble and rarely hear or acknowledge of tech industry trends before it's too late. Over-engineering is a serious problem as well.

For context I just want to add that I've worked at SAP multiple years, both in Walldorf HQ and in Palo Alto. The experiences described not only represent my personal ones but are consistent with the experiences of my network in multiple teams and locations, incl. US, Germany and India. The only location which I would mildly recommend is SAP Germany due to very good perks and OK-ish comp (that being said there are much better alternatives there too). It honestly appears like a miracle to me that SAP has a 4.4 Glassdoor rating and is rated as a Best Place to work, but can probably be explained with SAP being very good at Marketing bad stuff as Gold."

You will not learn many new things. People stick with the company just to get their benefits, do their 9-5 and go back home to family. If that is what you want, SAP is awesome.

I actually love going to work everyday and feel valued and appreciated which strengthens my  loyalty and dedication to this company.

Challenges are inevitable in any workplace and SAP has created a culture that allows colleagues to constructively navigate these challenges through innovation and collaboration without fear of failure. SAP respects a distributed workforce and relies on its global population to influence the company direction which empowers employees to be influential and successful regardless of where they work, even home based employees. The company's desire to build an inclusive workplace, coupled with it's strong brand as an employer, is allowing them to reach underrepresented populations of incredible talent who will find an ally in SAP - a company willing to stray from the norms of systemic oppression, making a deliberate effort to drive parity in the workplace for all demographics of people so that individuals can spend their days developing professionally in an environment that empowers them to bring everything they are in order to become everything they want.","The complexity of any global company is difficult to navigate but the reward of having a global impact far outweighs it.

Also, the managers do not breath down your neck while working and are flexible when it comes to working hours. SAP has a ton of resources for career guidance, which is very appealing for a young professional. With this comes encouragement to try out new positions as you progress within your career at SAP. SAP does not want their employees feeling bored with their job, so they provide tons of opportunities to try different jobs out. SAP also compensates their employees more than well and depending on the team they usually let you live in your desired destination.","It can be extremely tough obtaining a full-time job at SAP. It seems to be you have to know someone to get it in. The common path for young talent is to enter as an intern and network internally to find a full-time role. SAP hires a lot of interns and provides them all the opportunity to find a full-time job, but there is only so many full-time jobs available, often leading it to be very competitive. 

Due to the nature of the software industry, technology advances very fast, leading to a constant internal structure change. Sometimes this causes teams to dissolve and new teams to start. This can be a good and a bad thing depending on the field you work in."

I have had the opportunity to work with Fortune 10 companies, small companies, public sector entities and everything in between. The reputation of SAP gives me instant credibility with the customer as the vendor representative. I have the opportunity to develop a trusted advisor relationship with my customers and work with them on business critical projects; giving direction, providing leadership and support as they implement SAP's software products across their company.  
It's easy to maintain and build that credibility with the wealth of documentation and colleague support. I am able to find answers to product questions and develop solutions to implementation challenges knowing I can count on other colleagues across the company supporting me.
SAP gives me the opportunity to do what I love to do every day at customers around the world that I would never have the opportunity to touch otherwise. I have the freedom to assume as much responsibility as I wish and rise as high in the company as I am able. 
Expertise, hard work and results are generously rewarded based on my abilities.","Customer facing positions can be high stress since you're the face of SAP and you're dealing with decisions that cost millions of dollars and can make or break the customer's company financially. You have to continually study and add to your body of knowledge as new information becomes available on an almost daily basis. You have to continually increase your skill sets to remain relevant.
This is not a job, it's a lifestyle. If you don't approach it that way, you'll burn out quickly. The advantage of SAP is the (earned) perception that customers have about the quality of our employees. The disadvantage is that you have to live up to that perception every minute you're in front of the customer.
If you're looking for a 9 to 5 job with very specifically defined, repeatable tasks, SAP is probably not for you."

SAP also promotes work-life balance. The company's global nature creates an environment where your work product speaks for itself, not the hours of face time you put in at the office. Accordingly, most employees can easily work without any negative consequences or judgement. This is great for working parents and other employees who value the flexibility to create their own schedules.","The company's global nature leads to frequent virtual meetings, with few in-person meetings based on your location. If you want more in-person interaction, you need to go to the office. Yet sometimes the office isn't heavily trafficked, depending on the location.

Besides the salary and benefits, it is rewarding to work with customers who are the best in their industry, or thrive to become the best, and being able to show them how using our solutions can make the difference, accelerate scale and growth, help compete or create new business models. The company has strong and inspiring leadership, which empowers us to drive and execute a strategy  we can believe in. The company is flexible enough to allow for multiple career paths: For instance I started in implementation consulting, learned programming on the job, joined development, became a patented inventor, joined product management, and was able to experience diverse  teams on different continents. Would I do it again? Of course!","As a global player in a globally active company, your team may cover all major time zones.

Working at a place with a recognizable brand name helps.","It seems like every year, it gets worse and worse to be in sales at SAP. They constantly raise quotas by 50-200% year over year. My quota from last year went up 250%. They cut down the number of accounts you can have, and they constantly take out products from your sales bag and either don't give you credit for them but still have you support those conversations or they give the products to everyone to sell. There is a ton of competition against your own people at accounts. It's honestly like how Oracle used to be."

Individual contributors have opportunity for annual bonuses based on performance as well as targets determined by several business factors. Each annual bonus I have received are amazing and never disappoint! SAP really cares about their customers success and drives this throughout the organization.","Being a remote employee has its disadvantages, at times you don’t feel a part of a team or the many activities they hold at corporate offices. Invites are never made to local offices, even to holiday parties or outings. Work hours can be long when issues arise and it’s expected you work, even on weekends and especially on release weekends. Career advancement is very difficult to achieve unless you personally know someone, opportunities are not always given based on qualifications and the internal job posting process is not consistent. I personally applied for over 12 internal positions I was highly qualified for over the last 2 years and was not offered 1 position. No feedback from recruiters or hiring managers. Continued job education is hard to achieve due to time constraints during work hours but with so many products that are supported it is a must to keep up with products and changes."

Very laid back and informal atmosphere. The team is full of smart, hard working people, and there are a lot of opportunities to learn new things. Everyone is happy to help and communicates often. The office is fun, and there is occasional catered lunch and beer on Fridays. You will make many friends. 

SAP is a huge company, and there are tons of opportunities to connect with people around the world.","Workloads have gotten absurd in recent years. Software is buggy and engineering is focused on developing new features instead of fixing issues, putting support into impossible positions. In essence, you are set up for failure day after day. 

There are very little opportunities for career development within the support organization, and the opportunities that are there are not advertised to the team. The only way for you to get a worthwhile raise is to get a different job within the company, and to leave support altogether. Management is in constant flux, so you never have the opportunity to work with anyone to develop your career in any meaningful way.

You get harassed on a daily basis for updates by other internal teams, and more effort has been put to hire people to micromanage you than to ease the workload."

Previously it was much more controlled out of Germany.  Today it's a much better environment to work and thrive in.,"The employee atmosphere here is really good.  My only real ""ding"" is with many of their cloud products.  They really don't have their act together and it makes it difficult and sometimes demoralizing to compete against other much more nimble and user friendly firms."

2602,SAP,Always keeps it interesting,2018-08-22,4.0,Solutions Architect,"Been here over 18 years.  Like the industry, SAP is constantly evolving with the times and has come from Mainframe, to Client Server, to the Web and now is a force in Cloud Computing.  What has impressed me the most is that SAP will invest and retrain its employees as opposed to going out finding those new skills.
If you like learning new skills, this is the place for you.",SAP has become a very large organization with around 100k employees. Having been here 18 years it has lost some of its internal culture but I guess that is to be expected when you have experienced such growth.

Top company for social awareness and consistently among the best companies to work for in various surveys. Strong & focused senior leadership communicates the mission well for the whole organization. Major change management from on-premise to cloud-based culture is progressing well.,"Sometime a bit to heavy handed financial controls from HQ in Germany interferes with effective staffing/business execution in the field. Legacy on-premise attitudes are still entrenched in some areas, causing delivery hurtles that need extra effort to overcome.  the necessary competitive moves toward greater utilization of off-shore and near shore delivery centers is a necessity, but dilutes the quality of delivery as these less experiences tech-implementers do not have the same business domain experience as the regular consultants."

- Empowered to make my own decisions
- They do a good job of hiring young talent, excellent internship programs","- Heavily underpaid. As a software engineer, you will often make 30-50% below market, or in some cases even more than that. It also feels like SAP takes advantage of people who can't leave with their work visa, they don't have any bargain position. With extraordinary performance (when we still had ratings), I didn't even get the regular 4% that everyone else got, only after explicitly asking for it.
- SAPsv identity crisis: Pretty much every person I talk to at the Palo Alto location questions what SAP does in Silicon Valley
- Prepare to be stuck to your career level: When we still had performance reviews, I had ""extraordinary performance"" a couple of times in a row. Now with SAP talk things became very wishy washy. I still get good feedback, but haven't seen any action or tangible output. My manager keeps pushing things out to ""next year"". Not the manager's fault though. Also, the curriculums I am interested in that would help me advance are unavailable in the bay area, even though my manager supports me in participating.
- Processes - Software engineering it a hell at SAP. We have to use a lot of proprietary tools that don't even get the job done, simply because some process owners in Germany have too much power. Our team in particular wastes 30% of our resources to fit their engineering processes/tools and still build our own stuff in order to get the job done"

Much depends on the manager: does she / he take care of the team members, or strictly manage up for own career goals. I have experienced both, and if you are lucky, this will be a great company to work for.
The company's willingness to move to cloud is there, with considerable investment to implement change: which is amazing to observe and be part of.

In general, the US offices are good facilities to work, working from home is mostly not an issue.","SAP is big, and moves slow. 
Change is managed by huge teams, with an emphasis on 'manage', not getting it done.  
At least in the US, SAP embraces the hire/fire mentality: if a team becomes obsolete in the eye of a VP, there's no support for individual team members to find alternative positions within the company: no matter how experienced, talented and skilled these people are, how long they have been with the company.  No sanity check by HR. As a result, loyalty is heavily affected, especially among the younger generations."

Some issues are technical and require a lot of research and thinking. You can do neither here unless you work extra hours. To make things even more insulting, the people who bother support for updates get paid more than support. Somebody with no technical background at all can get hired on a team called preferred care and their managers reward them for harassing support.

Sales and account representatives lie to customers about functionality and then when the customers get upset we're told that we need better support. Everything falls back on support and all management does is get in our way and make it hard for us to get anything done. Many of the actual issues we troubleshoot have been around since before i started with the company which was years ago. 

When we bring issues up to management we are told that we are being negative and then management just talks about how good we are doing even though its pretty clear that most customers and most employees are miserable. They are out of touch."

They even put it in their contracts with customers. If you want a quick burnout, that's the place to work."
2634,SAP,Set up to fail from day one,2018-08-22,1.0,Technical Support Engineer,I will let you know when I come across one.,"Sales has zero, ZERO idea on what we actually do so they sell something that does not exist. The Customer Engagement Executives (CEE) are just as worthless. They are to help manage the customer while support works on issues, now all they do is demand a solution for the customer THAT DAY (which they already promised to the customer without ever checking with you). Support is left to basically just do whatever the customer is demanding, not asking, but demanding. There is no real scope of what should be supported, it is just a free for all. A customer doesn't like the font the application is written in, well then it is clearly a product of the issue and needs to be fixed ASAP. The volume of work has increased tenfold within a year but the staffing has either stayed the same or decreased due to people leaving due to burnout. Management talks a big game of retaining people, but no follow through. all we are told by the parent, SAP is that adding more employees does not fix the problem. But then even when we get to hire some people it is usually only 1 person and even then there is usually a hiring freeze. So the 20 people you were supposed to get, end up being 1 person, that was supposed to start Jan 1st, but due to hiring freeze won't start until Oct 1. That is if they actually waited that long and didn't look for something else. The pay could be better for the level of stress you face on a day to day basis. Or you can just start not caring about the work as most employees do. For a company the size of SAP you would think they would attribute an entire multi-level office building just for support? Nope, just a third of a floor with about 30 people to support a global community that grows by 10-20 customers a week. There isn't much great or even good about this place as certain departments get all the respect and recognition and the ones doing the actual work just get more work to do."

Personally, I would encourage anyone who wants to get their foot in the door at a great company to start in Market Development as it has provided an amazing foundation for future successes in sales roles. Effort is directly correlated to success in this role, so if you come in ready to work hard and earn good money while doing it, this is a fantastic role for you.

2695,SAP,Application Specialist,2018-05-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"High profile clients, good coworkers","BE WARNED: if you accept a job as an Application Specialist here thinking it's a day job with normal (7-9am start and 4-6pm end), you might end being mistaken. Management hires separately for the night shift on support, but does not hire separately for second (swing) shift. So, upon being hired as an Application Specialist, there is a chance you will be put on an unusual shift requiring working until late at night and/or on weekends -- for an undetermined amount of time, often a year or more. Working on a swing shift does not come with a pay increase, though obviously it comes with a lot of added stress both personally and professionally.

Management overall is poor in the Support department. Within the department, it can be very confusing and frustrating to understand how to ""move up."" Management is very cagey and stubborn about title or pay increases. While there is an official set of expectations in terms of how to be promoted within the department, management tends to delay or insist you ""aren't quite there yet."" Employees accept harder, more complicated work without title or pay increases in the hopes (and sometimes, with assurances from management) that the title or pay increases will come in the future. Some end up working months or more than a year without seeing the promotion.

Support department management often had a hostile attitude towards employees that can create a toxic, tense, and needlessly stressful work environment. Some fellow coworkers of mine have described it as being similar to a ""high school"" environment in which employees are treated like misbehaving children. Almost everyone works incredibly hard, but the department seems to be perpetually understaffed, and this gap between work to be done and number of workers is not treated empathetically by management but rather as a fault of the workers.
 
It often felt like the Support department was stuck in a limbo state between being a call center (think Comcast) or a more typical support/application consulting department in a tech company. This can end up being quite frustrating as an employee -- especially in the earlier stages of working on Support, your job is very numbers-driven, and you will be strongly expected to handle a certain number of support cases per hour. Simultaneously, there is a strong expectation for Support employees to become more like ""consultants"" in terms of having in-depth knowledge of highly technical concepts and processes. As you might imagine, it is stressful to feel stretched by two seemingly opposing sides: I need to close X cases today but I also need to handle this very complicated and technical case that would truly require hours of research to grasp. Other parts of the company often felt at odds with support rather than on the same team, adding to the sense of pressure to do things both quickly and perfectly."

2712,SAP,"Gaslighting, Sexism, Terrible Management & Communication",2018-04-17,1.0,Applications Specialist/Analyst,"Free snacks, happy hour, new office building.","Communication:  You don’t know of changes before they are put in effect. Communication with managers is terrible. It is never an open forum. When you bring up examples of something – they will ask ‘who said that’ or ask for specific names. So there’s a lot of finger pointing and blaming. The lack of communication is comical at times. Every bit of information I learned about when people are being hired, when people are moving to other departments, any changes at all has been from a colleague. Sounds like a rumor mill because it is. And it isn't that they are waiting to finalize things, we just never hear anything from management. Silence.

Role/Promotions: Roles work in whatever way allows management to favor who they want while not paying people for the work they do. Promotions are based on an arbitrary and subjective list of attributes of the employee, but even if you “check all the boxes” promotions are seemingly only possible once a year so be prepared to be told month after month that you will be promoted in the coming months until an entire year goes by.  Moving from help desk to PMO support should be a title change – its’ different work, more difficult, deserving of a pay change. It is incredibly frustrating doing the exact same work as a colleague but knowing they have a different title and are being paid more for their work. If the managers really love you, (meaning that you have completely bought into their terrible management style and decided to take on that approach), they might create a role just for you and never actually hold interviews or make public that a new role has been created. The favoritism is out of control. They have also invented new roles, basically getting people to do the managements dirty work, and asked application specialists and analysts to take it on. Again, no title change and no raise. Just way more work and responsibility. Skill and experience are not rewarded here. Ever. When other people responded negatively to this new role, management repeatedly claimed it was what we had asked for in a survey given out. In reality, we had asked that our managers be more available. They basically did the opposite by putting more people between us and them. 

Gaslighting:  Management blames productivity on the people left in a department that is clearly understaffed and often employs gaslighting to get their employees to comply. 
If you messed up and have an understaffed department don't make your employees feel like they are to blame for not doing enough. They are always working hard. How about thanking them in a genuine way? Maybe even apologizing when management messes up? Do you really want to be a manager using a tactic for psychological abuse on your employees? Probably not.

Management Style (or lack thereof): When starting, there is a sink or swim attitude. If you don’t pick it up on your own and exceed without any help, then you fail. There are hardly any resources for anyone who is failing besides being reprimanded. Their attempts at improving morale are embarrassing and as soon as they see any major issues going away they return to their same ways, which have proven time and again to be very very bad. They operate on a 'putting out fires' mentality. There is no forward thinking, no planning ahead. Management has made it seem like they don’t have time for meetings. And then they get mad when their employees don’t go to them with concerns or struggles. If you make yourself unapproachable and continually have a bad attitude, you cannot expect people to go out of their way to seek guidance from you.  Management loves to ask rhetorical questions in meetings. It is a way to belittle staff. The relationship between manager/ employee is not professional.

Shifts: Management did not make it enough of a priority to inform applicants of the possible shifts they will work. Instead, they make vague statements when asked if we will work a typical work week. Honesty isn't really their thing. Instead, they lie and then treat their employees like children who weren't listening when they explained how it all works. If you end up with a “swing shift” you are treated as though that assignment was a deserved punishment that you need to earn your way from in order to get a day shift. People who started at the same time as you will have your desired shift from the start, not having earned it in any capacity. 

Sexism: It was difficult to imagine my career growing within the support department because management was almost entirely made up of men.  Any efforts made to provide opportunities for socializing and bonding within the department were based around male-dominated interests and activities such as shooting and fantasy sports leagues. There was no effort to come up with activities that would be inclusive of all interests or at least have a variety of activities covering many interests. Outside of support, men in higher up positions continuously creep on younger women. The environment of the company allows them to keep doing it."

2738,SAP,"The opportunity is endless, as long as you start outside of Market Development",2018-02-15,4.0,Market Development Representative,"-Concur has unlimited opportunities for career growth (once out of Market dev.)
-The people you work with are fun, friendly, and you will want to hang out out with them outside of work
-The product is amazing, and if you are able to get to a point in the company that you get to sell the product and not a meeting, it really is a value-added service
-Great Benefits","The  Market Development team has gone through a roller coaster of management in the past 2-3 years. The current regime has caused a severe downturn in morale, productivity, and trust in the process, and unfortunately Concur as a whole.

The rest of the managers have a lot of potential, but are forced to abide by upper management's leadership style. The major issue that I ran into was that I constantly was being talked to like a child rather than a working professional. An awesome pro of working for Concur was their benefits including 25 days PTO, however if you take a vacation, and do not hit your goal (which is astronomically high, while only increasing) you will be chastised. In fact, some were asked ""do you really think you should take that PTO over Christmas with how your month is going?"" 

The job itself is difficult enough, cold calling is difficult enough. The job of leadership is to be selfless, to be a part of the grind, and to MOTIVATE people, rather than showing up late, leaving early, taking constant PTO, but then belittling their employees when they want the same (or similar) freedoms.

You will also need to be in seat for a minimum of 1 year, while attaining the high quota consistently to be eligible for a promotion. Elsewhere in the organization it is based on merit and production for a promotion, however in Market Dev the leadership (primarily directors) were more worried about hitting their own numbers, and how much you can help pad their pockets than your career development. They will do whatever they can to keep the  top performers on their team to help themselves, rather than helping you progress in your career within Concur.

One final con: At Concur, and now SAP Concur you are a part of an incredible organization that strives to change businesses and lives of their employees as well as yours as an employee of SAP Concur. In Market Development, you are told NOT to attend the all hands meetings, the team celebration lunches, etc. because that time is better suited with you on the phone. This completely secludes the MDR teams from the bigger picture, and thus makes you feel like nothing but a number"

2781,SAP,Invest  in Culture/Leadership Selections/Career Management - Needs Attention,2018-01-18,3.0,Executive Human Resources Consulting,"SAP hires bright talented employees; I have never worked with so many smart people.  POSITIVE:  in HR cloud business, better structure around sales content/learning is an improvement in aligning market messaging - this has long been missing. 
Innovation- anticipating and investing in breakthrough product devt - like Bus Beyond  Bias - very cool, and forward leaning.  Breaking out from the pack.  Very good - keep anticipating and building for the future, not the past.  We need better INTENTIONALITY around the ""anticipating"" - not enough resources out there tracking HR trends/working closely with HR and Business leaders to help drive the innovation, and be there.  Bus beyond Bias happened but what's next - many areas are perfect for us to take on.  This would be a great investment.","Too many bully tactics used by leadership.  Leaders who yell at, use high-pressure communication, can't be acceptable.  Beating the drum harding may get the result- but kill the engagement, and impact customers directly.  Still way too little diversity - and that goes for style as well as race/gender.  Need to make ""autocratic command and control"" tactics unacceptable instead of rewarding with promotions.  We need ""leaders of the future""  - why are our most motivational leaders leaving, or being shown the door? people will follow and go above and beyond for leaders who empower them and provide a real vision based on a true knowledge and passion for the field.  Recent changes in leadership in HR Cloud business is right out of the ""old SAP model"" - quickly dissipating energy and motivation of very talented people.  Everyone has their head down to stay out of the way.  NOT the  culture we want.    
- Career options:  I cannot tell you how many ""Fast Track"" employees have applied for jobs internally, and never even gotten a response.  We totally should be handling internal applicants differently- any time a ""Fast Track/High Performing Employee"" applies for a job internally - the golden glove should come out.  Why are they looking to move?  is there an issue?  this is data that should trigger a response by management - not just recruiting.  It should include a coaching session to understand what they are looking to do, the full context, and then actively look for a role for them.  YES - a high-performing employee should have an advantage, AND research says they cost less, and add more value.  Why aren't we leveraging this? In the last 2 years, way too many talented people I know left because there was ""nothing"" here for them.  They couldn't find a job internally - and we make it way too hard to make a lateral move without sacrificing compensation.  This is a real opportunity for us to figure this out because this is the way of the future workforce."

2786,SAP,"If you're a fast-moving, high performer, Concur might not be the best fit for you right now",2017-12-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Company growth - They have created a great suite of products and services. There are many untapped markets in the world. There is also a great potential to grow their existing client business. It doesn't take much to capitalize on it. It's just a matter of having the right people ""on the bus"" to maximize returns for SAP shareholders.
Culture - Very inclusive, friendly and warm place to work. Lots of great people (don't confuse this as all of them are the best candidate for their respective jobs). Can be fun. Most teams have autonomy to innovate. 
Work/Life Balance - Most managers allow working from home some or all of the time (for the right people).   
HR - Their HR team seems to be a solid group of competent professionals, despite  the recruiting arm leaving much (all) to be desired.","Recruiting has been known to lie - There are countless examples of people who were lied to about their title/level and their next move in company. Backwards titles complicates this further. This coupled with much of my other feedback lead to great employees either leaving the company, or leaving and coming back (which the CEO, SVPs, and many other leaders have done). When it comes to hiring your own team, people managers have to do the majority of searching for candidates (provided they want to assure they get the best person for the role). 
Most mid-level leaders are afraid of and/or avoid confrontation - Bad to mediocre employees aren't disciplined, and over-achievers aren't reward commensurate of their impact. I'm not sure anyone has ever been put on an action plan (let alone fired) at the company, which makes those that are (below) average at their job think that they just have to wait to be promoted. Leaders try to contain over-achievers by promising a bright future if they just wait, then offer you everything you want(ed) when it's too late. Senior leaders lift up concerns about employees, so do said manager's people, and yet no material corrective action is taken resulting in their great employees moving on. Wrong or right, this gives the perception that managers are more concerned with being everyone's friend and are happy with where they are, so they state that ""everyone here is great"" to make things easier vs having tough conversations or potentially ruffling feathers by having some on a faster track than their peers. 
Top down management style - A lot of mid-level to senior leaders don't take constructive criticism well from their employees. They get the majority of their direction from senior executives, then generally tailor to what their plan was, which delays or fractures career promises (moving targets). They no doubt mean well, but don't seem to realize that if they are authentic 98% of the time, employees are still left guessing when the other 2% is occurring (and if they can truly rely on them for their best interests). Additionally, when you ask them why overall company projections or a product launch deadline were missed, you tend to get boilerplate excuses.   
Seniority can breed complacence - The most people I've ever seen in a company that have been there for the majority of their career. That's generally a good thing, but many of these people don't have a competitive background for their position that one would expect from an SAP/leader in technology. Diversity (including in professional experiences) is a good thing. A lot of the leaders that have been with the company for the majority of their career likely wouldn't be at the same level at any other comparable company, and many didn't go to school for what they are doing. Perhaps they realize this, so they never leave, and are fine with mediocre employees on their team as it won't challenge their position in company. Because many haven't worked at other major companies, they don't know any better, generally given false positive reviews on their managers and for Concur as a best place to work. Little to no value is given for having advanced degrees (nor do leaders encourage their employees to pursue them) as the company seems to think consulting companies and annual conferences are the only thing needed to help with on-going education efforts."

2795,SAP,Good Culture - Average Product,2018-01-21,3.0,Senior Account Executive,"Great culture, good people, great benefits",Some cloud solutions are a amalgamation of acquisitions that are hurriedly stitched -  together - creating dissatisfied clients and lot's of work post sale.   Focused on pushing the product of the quarter (usually the last acquisition)  instead of solving customer problems...
2796,SAP,Prospective Market Development Reps Beware,2018-01-31,1.0,Market Development Representative,">> Supportive direct management and great co-workers
>> Free LaCroix, soda and juice
>> Incentives/Competitions; although the extra monthly competitions use to include AMEX gift cards and more appealing prizes now you maybe earn a coffee or free lunch. 
>> Great benefits through SAP, 25 days of PTO, although in this department it's looked down upon if you utilize your available PTO and because you're quota based you feel too much pressure to enjoy your time off.","*** FACT: The Market Development department has had over 100% turnover in 2017. I think that number speaks for itself. ***

>> Excluding direct management, the directors within Market Development run their department with a ""Hero to Zero"" mentality if you are not the top performer that month you aren't even worth making eye contact with (when they even make an appearance on the floor which is maybe once every other week to once a month). 
Directors run their meetings like camp counselors, playing loud music, cheering while you walk into the meetings until they drop bombs on the MDRs discussing new processes that make your job more difficult and rolling out unattainable goals to make it impossible to hit your quota. 
At first, this ""Camp Counselor"" leadership style and over the top unauthentic speech is appealing you eventually realize they are constantly speaking to you like children and have no true respect for you as a career professional.
Don't ever believe you have a chance to move into a leadership role within the Market Development department. Directors lead MDRs on; whom are more than overqualified, been with the company for multiple years and proven themselves worthy of leadership roles; to think that they have a chance at the roles opening up within the MDR department and then hire externally or in different departments because again, they have no respect for MDRs as career professionals, with one exception, a 23year old that they gave a manager position too because one of the directors had a personal relationship with that MDR. 
** Note: Management just handed that MDR  the management position without considering any other prospects or making it available to any applicants** 
- - It's also been discussed that employees applying for internal roles outside of the department have been sabotaged by directors approaching the hiring department telling them not to hire that MDR because they are a top performer and want them to sit in the department and make them more money till they're burned out and leave - - 
:: Also, there's a ""rule"" that you have to sit in seat in the Market Development department for at least 1 year before being eligible to move throughout the company. No this is not in your job contract or discussed throughout the interview process you find this out after you're hired and are stuck. ::

>> Now to discuss the job itself... You are a telemarketer that can be replaced and rotated out. There is no strategy, you do not create relationships with your Sales Execs because you have 25-40 that you support. You used to strategically work with 4 Sales Execs and support their specific territories going after top accounts and helping them bring in quality customers. They changed this process because of the massive turnover they're seeing in the department and now the sales pipeline won't skip a beat with MDRs constantly leaving.
You have call center metrics you have to meet every day and if you don't meet them you are interrogated on the reasons why you didn't meet them that day. The micromanaging is absolutely out of control, there's no faith in you that you are a professional that can do your job and run your business properly. This job requires no relationship building just endlessly calling prospects to see if they have 10min to learn about Concur and passing off anyone who says yes to the Sales Exec assigned too the account then getting back on the phones to find another prospect to say yes. 

::: Warning: DO NOT TAKE A SMALL BUSINESS POSITION although the direct manager seems great and doing what he can to make the most of that segment, the goals are wildly unattainable compared to the Inbound, MidMarket and National segments. With the consistent failure, the directors put pressure on this segment and constantly question the failure to meet quota when the quotas are near impossible to hit. :::

>> Unfortunately, because of the way that the directors have built this department and treat their employees you see valuable workers losing belief and confidence in themselves and their abilities. It also is quite obvious that this has spread to other departments so moving internally throughout Concur is becoming more an more difficult. It's heartbreaking to see these quality and overqualified employees being so discouraged and leaving this company after buying into the ""Concur dream"" because there truly is value in this company, just not in the Market Development department. There are people that have taken massive pay cuts and steps down in their career to buy into this dream and leave lost, beaten down and regretful they ever left their previous job to become part of this department."

Unlimited soda/coffee/LaCroix options. They cater in food all the time.,"Although the job description states that the role is for a Market Development Representative position, you are really an overpaid Telemarketer. The truth is this role consist of cold calling prospects 8- hours a day with the sole purpose of  setting appointments for Concur's Regional Sales Executives to follow up with potential new business. The practices that Concur uses to reach out to prospects is the biggest reason I left. You will be forced to mail merge/email blast thousands of new prospects, then follow up with them via telephone. Emailing these prospects constantly, calling them constantly, leads to a ton of rejection. They implemented new software to cut down on the email blast earlier this year, but with limited to sending 250 emails a day, they switched back to the ""spray and pray"" mentality. Get used email merges, daily, sometimes reaching out to 10K people at a time. It seems like they don't care about saturating their territories with constant emails. 

You must perform well in the Market Development Representative positions for a minimum of 12 months prior to being looked at going into any other role; in those 12 months, you must be hitting 100% to goal each month or you WILL NOT be promoted. That simple. The goals keep getting higher and higher because they want to get to 1 Billion in revenue by 2020. This is constantly preached. 

 This position is best suited for someone straight out of college, very flexible with work hours (some reps work 6:45am - 5:30pm daily), no kids, and live close to the St. Louis Park location. A large number of the current MDR's do not like the position at all, but are working hard to possibly be looked at to be promoted down the road."

2875,SAP,"SAP FG - Decent first gig, but don't get your hopes up.",2017-10-21,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Still has some startup feel to it, even though it was acquired by SAP almost 2 years ago. Solid perks, including a generous amount of PTO right from the start, and ""unlimited"" sick days. The office location is great, right in downtown Chicago across from the Metra station. With backing by SAP, the company is not going anywhere and is miles ahead of any competition in it's industry. 

For most of the people on the support side, it's a great first job where you can make decent money and have full benefits. Once out of support, the company/management is very nice.  Due to the fact that FG makes it's money off of transactions for the clients' contractors, the sales team doesn't have all the power/is not the focus like other companies. Anyone client facing is important to the company as a whole, and management, for the most part, understands this. 

The company spends quite a bit on keeping the kitchen stocked and regularly buys meals for the day side staff, and there is beer cart Thursdays.","Support is primarily on the younger side, usually within the 20-23 year old range. For most, it's their first job out of college. Between staff moving to other teams or leaving the company, and the documentation being sub-par at best, most of the knowledge is among the staff,  which leaves huge gaps in knowledge. There's rarely anyone that's on support for more than 2 years,

The company currently is struggling to balance out the exponential growth of the company with the amount of support agents that they have on staff, even globally. It can be a bit of a meat grinder, especially around the major patches for the application. Day side is the main focus. There are no managers on staff for the second and third shifts, which means those shifts are easily forgotten about. Management has been quoted saying their main goal is to keep you on the support team. Even with support being the entry point into the company, the managers do their best from having you move to other teams. Management is good at changing their language during discussions to fit their motives.

Support agents are mostly looked at for their stats from managers that don't have much experience outside their current job. Stats that are hard to balance, and, for the most part, require working the system to make them look better. 

They do not allow you to work from home. 

Large office = rarely get to meet other people unless you actively seek out other teams."

3036,SAP,Silicon Valley Next Talent Program,2017-05-17,5.0,Developer,"- Silicon Valley Next Talent (SVNT) Program:
SVNT is a highly competitive rotational program and career accelerator within the products and innovation organization at SAP. The cool thing is that you can rotate on multiple SAP teams within the first year. At the end you may select the best fit based on mutually benefits. Therefore, you may develop a big picture mindset about SAP, while contributing your strengths on many impactful product features that are using by the world's most successful businesses. I think this unique program would be the best choice for all new graduates to consider.

- Application Process:
The review below is based on overall recruiting process of Silicon Valley Next Talent Program. The whole process took about one month (starting from the time that my resume was accepted and I submitted the survey form). The recruiter is pretty helpful and responsive with interview arrangements as well as status updates. The interview process has several rounds. The first round is talking your background with the recruiter. I learned about the recruiting process and what to expect after joining SVNT program. After that the second round interview is with the SVNT program manager, in which many behavioral questions were asked. I enjoyed the conversation a lot and found that the core values and team culture at SAP would be the perfect fit for me. I also felt connected with the program manager when I shared insights about my experiences and lessons learned. The third and fourth rounds are technical interviews with SAP experts in my field. The format and questions were similar to typical technical interviews with other large tech companies. One thing stood out was that all interviewers were super passionate about their work and shared many great things about working at SAP. These conversations really helped me to develop a better understanding about the benefits of SVNT program and I then decided to accept the offer from SAP instead of some other top companies.",The overall recruiting and on-boarding process in quite smooth and many detailed guidance is provided. I think the SVNT program at SAP is one of the best recruiting process I had ever experienced.

Projects are being rushed to start implementation when they are not ready, and the internal project team suffers as a result
- There is more pressure put on internal hires/tenured employees because the ramp up time for new hires can be very slow.  It can seem like managers tell everyone that they are doing an awesome job, so employees feel there is no difference between those who do great work and those who are mediocre"

The bulk of SAPs sales are made in big BOMs (Bill of Materials) and if your solution is not established enough - you are all alone with no help nor any support from any areas. This includes a lack of pre sales, implementation, value engineering and executive level support. It will be almost non existent.

The ""SAP"" Establishment still runs the show there. If you can get into the broader org, you may have a chance with some hard work. If not, there is little to no priority on your success or your team.

I have witnessed arbitrary movement not based on skill or performance. I have noticed nepotism, stagnation wrapped in a cloak of ""new tasks"". Expect to be asked to do more tasks as a dangling carrot and be given an excuse why the promise was not kept. Depending on both shift and team be prepared to never have the chance to take your company entitled PTO (but your manager can be gone every other week). Expect never to be provided expectations or kudos when you perform above and beyond. DO expect to be nit picked as knee jerk reactions to something unrelated to you, or something that is minuscule and not impacting bottom line or bigger picture .

3360,SAP,Modern day slavery,2016-06-27,2.0,Software Engineer,"Releases every 3 months, friendly co workers, fruit tray every morning, regular socials, outside speakers, beer bashes","Ever since SAP bought the place, 70 % of the employees have left. So some of the remaining were quickly promoted to senior management. Vast majority of them have minimum social skills. Just think there enough VPs and directors with whom I cannot have a conversation about the weather! Most of them have 0 to 4 direct reports. There are enough directors with no direct reports. I know of one director who works 11 to 3 pm, and them sets up 1-1 and other meetings after 9 pm, because here baby sleeps by 9 pm! 

As a result the remaining workers are piled on a huge amount of work. More than a typical startup. The support people are useless, hence development and qa have to find the issues. The pay scales are typically 20 % and less than market rates. No options. You will constantly reminded that you are getting paid too  much.

Typically some junior developer in China will decide the sprint schedule and once the dates are given there is no changing. If QA finds one bug, you will warned about termination. 

The teams in China and India work 9 to 5. So they schedule meetings most evenings and sun evening. If you object or miss one, you will terminated. Its pretty common for a manager to insult and berate their employees in front of everyone. If you defend yourself, you will be terminated.

Don't expect much support from HR. They will tell that you are a slave and have to work anytime the manager wants. No down time on evenings, weekends or vacations. They will typically offer some money if you agree to leave quietly.  After you sign the exit paperwork, understand that they will tell you that you violated some clause and that the money is being withheld. This is typical.

As you can imagine, skilled people come and go. During the last SAP survey, 60 % said they did not trust their boss! This is the lowest in SAP."

Lifers are often really low motivation and just do what they can to get the checkbox with little to no effort.

Being at another large, global company I have seen more out of their HR and talent management teams in 3 months that I saw in over 10 years at SAP.

These countries have strong worker protection laws/policies. Every time there is a corporate RIF (~every 3 to 4 years), countries with no social partner agreements tend to get the lion's-share of the forced reductions; so while workers in Germany, as an example, get moved to another role, workers in US have their roles 'eliminated'.

Most of the Dev and QA management are Indians as well as team members they prefer to hire:
   A lot of the Indians get hired on the spot without going through official interview process, just because they are relatives or friends of those managers, which makes it difficult for other applicants to be considered for a position.
There is a lot of politics involved in the processes, project assignments, promotions, etc.

Number of meetings during the business hours as well as non business hours is abnormal.

1. In my experience the people are great, and over the course of my tenure I've always been happy with my immediate management despite several changes/promotions.  I've dealt with very little micro-management, and I've always felt able to approach my manager with concerns or to ask for advice.

2. Ability to move up quickly if you display intelligence, a good work ethic, sense of personal responsibility, and make smart/strategic decisions.  It's the business world - you have to be able to play the game at least a little bit.

3. Great company culture - casual office environment, higher level management is generally approachable, beer carts, and historically there have been a lot of company social events.  However that culture feels endangered due to acquisition by SAP (see cons).","1. Very poor internal communication strategy.  People get promoted, change departments, or get fired and you almost never hear about it from management and when you do its way too late - everyone already knows about it through the rumor mill.  This is leading to a growing lack of confidence in management, especially in the face of the company being bought out.

2. Fast-paced growth and acquisition by a giant software mega-corp is changing the feel of the company overall - despite insistence from upper management to the contrary.  It's not all bad - but it's different and in combination with number 1 lends itself to a sense of unease amongst employees.  Tech start ups don't stay start ups forever if they are doing it right, so these changes are to be expected."

SAP, up until 2014, had a strong history of no layoffs, due to it's Co-CEO arrangement with Bill McDermott (US) and Jim Hagemann Snabe (Germany). However, McDermott took over as the sole CEO in 2014, and that's when the cuts and reorganizations started.  It has heavily affected offices in Israel, North American and other locations. SAP is putting an ""all-in"" strategy into HANA and SAP Cloud, so it's beefing up those areas, while placing less focus (and investment) into other areas of the business (like Middleware tools, for example), so folks on those sides of the business are feeling the heat."

This makes it very difficult for a single individual to explain things to customers, and as a result, the account team becomes a small army of resources - each one specialized in one small niche of the overall solution.  Ask 10 different resources to define something as heavily marketed as HANA, and you are likely to get a good 7 or 8 entirely different responses.  

I'm always surprised when I read other people listing work/life balance as one of the ""pros"" of working at SAP.  I worked weekends and vacations just to keep up because of either unrealistic expectations or dealing with the added time required to work through the red tape that is required to do one's job.  Every vacation request was challenged by my manager even though I had earned the time off, and I painfully recollect times when I was staring out at the ocean from my hotel room while I was on a mandatory conference call.

Maybe it was just the team that I was on, but I found management to be aloof and clique-ish.  A lot of management by intimidation, and then those same managers wonder why you don't reach out to them more often.

I mean some people don't even know what their official title is anymore. Also there's this really passive aggressive war between Professional Services and Account Services, which just stifles collaboration and fixing the stuff that's wrong."

This really diminishes the value of the purchase and confuses the customer base in the process.

SAP appeals to many large companies and is therefore a staple of nearly 50% of the F1000.

It's capabilities, service offerings and resources have been decimated to the point where you will just sell SUPPORT services.  (Ask about ""One Service""  or about the number of consultants employed year over year during your interview and listen carefully to the answer.)  

Despite what they tell you, the job is NOT a true Sales role.  You'll mostly be a flunky of the license reps who will favor external partners.   Your management will be powerless to support you, but will hold you accountable for their failed strategies.    Most of them have never been front line sales people. Many of them are buddies from past jobs at other companies.

Key to Success: If you you are a shameless self-promoting sycophant, you'll do well here. Your main sale will be to promote yourself to clueless management who assign accounts based on how much you kiss up to them.  ACCOUNT ASSIGNMENT WILL MAKE OR BREAK YOU.  Last year (2014) approx  10% of the Services reps made their quotas.  Good Luck!"

I was lucky to hit quota last year, but only 10% of the SF field reps made their quotas last year.  SAP's slogan is ""RUN SIMPLE"", but if you are working here expect the exact opposite.  One last thing.....Last year they told us we would not get commissions until May, which ended up being August.  We literally did not get our first commission check until August.  They pulled the same thing again this year.

With SAP, you get the feeling that you are working on high value products that make a material impact to how businesses are run. The brand is highly respected in the industry. Work culture is great, very open and employee friendly. Pay and benefits are okay, it is better than average market, but the upside is limited as there is no profit sharing or RSUs granted on a regular basis. 
The best part is, SAP provides great opportunities to move within the company to new jobs and teams, and invests in talent development.","Speed and agility - This is definitely an area SAP can improve on. 
I have often felt that SAP leadership lacks decisiveness. So, in several areas you see similar products competing with other SAP products, and it could be confusing. This often affects the speed of delivery. 
There is also more resistance to change, so you could get stuck with ""dead"" products or technologies for a while.
Proprietary technologies - SAP's flagship products - SAP Business Suite - is built using proprietary technologies. In the last few years, SAP has embraced more common technology stacks to build solutions, and I hope this will only increase and will improve the ease of development and speed of delivery. 
Not enough early talent - I feel that the average age of an SAP employee is higher than the industry average. This is a huge benefit due the experience and knowledge levels that reflect in high quality of software products the company produces. But, it is important to balance this with early talent to leverage new ideas, trends, skills and energy they can bring."

The South SF office is really nice with lots of space for one to function and there's free food and snacks most of the time. Comp and benefits are above average vs. the industry and most people are nice.","SAP management has taken over and they either 1) have no clue about what made Successfactors so successful or 2)  have a clue but have their hands tied due to other quantitative initiatives or 3) fail to see any issues or problems within the organization.  There are so many layers of management that nothing gets done or approved in a timely manner (ie: taking 6 mo - 1 yr to backfill a role.  Which leads me to the next issue: teams are almost never properly staffed AND trained in a way where they understand the product.  This holds true in areas such a customer support to product management.  Just because you're adding headcount (coincidentally all from INDIA) doesn't mean that they are suitable to do the job as they lack the soft skills needed to deal with American customers.
