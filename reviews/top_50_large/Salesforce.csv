0,Salesforce,BDR - Marketing Cloud,2022-03-31,5.0,Business Development Representative,"-work life balance
-friendly coworkers
-really nice office and free snacks","-very high metrics that keep being raised
-management focused on themselves"
1,Salesforce,"Still a lot of opportunity to learn, connect, and chart your own course, but Big Company culture is encroaching.",2014-07-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've spent over 8 years with Salesforce in various management and individual contributor roles, all customer or partner facing. Some of the pros:
- vibrant, fast paced culture 
- smart, fun, aggressive colleagues
- management is focused on latest tech trends and staying or becoming a leader for many of them
- by and large, customers and partners are very positive about the technology
- good benefits and perqs
- hip urban culture at HQ
- a chart-your-own-course mentality that rewards those who aggressively seek out the job they want and pursue it, or sometimes even create it","After my long tenure and many Dreamforce conferences, I'm nearly fried. To say the culture is fast paced and the focus is always changing is an understatement. The reason Salesforce always seems on top, and chasing the latest trend, and in the press, is because employees are expected to run harder, carry more, cheer loudly, and pivot constantly. It's the world's biggest startup in behavior. But at the same time, with the recent influx of top career sales leaders from Oracle and what appears to be a board-level mandate for doubling revenue, employees are being asked to do even more with even less, fill higher quotas with smaller territories, less help, and the big company bureaucracy is rearing it's ugly head. 

Worse still is the politics. When you hire a bunch of smart, aggressive people, and put them in an environment of outsized expectations, throw in a bunch of re-orgs and changing management,  and sprinkle with uncertainty and constantly changing priorities, you inevitably get people back stabbing each other and throwing others under the bus to appear smarter and more worthy of promotion. 

The few at the top will get very, very rich. The rest will lose the sense of personal ownership and start to wonder why they've given up health and family"
2,Salesforce,What a disappointment...,2020-11-30,3.0,Account Executive- Core Team,"- Benefits are top notch
- Perks in the tower and holiday party are impressive
- Sales tactics and strategies are great for growth even as an experienced rep
- You’ll meet very talented sales rep with a wide variance of styles
-ESPP
- generous maternity/paternity leave. Although this will affect your likelihood of be promoted","I came into Salesforce like every rep, excited and eager to get my “MBA” in sales. Working here you’ll have to be prepared to give up everything just to stay afloat. In the first year you will most likely be given a terrible territory and what you do with it will decide your future here. Things you will need to juggle effortlessly or will lead you down the road of being let go are:

- Activity- lots of calls. People who fib numbers here are celebrated by leadership but frowned upon by reps
- Opp rigor- the amount of fields you will need to update are mind numbing
- Pipeline- with a terrible territory be prepared to pipe aspirational pipeline that will be highly scrutinized
- Prep meetings- there are endless prep meetings before calls. Due to schedules each person involved will require a prep meeting, leaving your day with little time for anything else.
- Team selling- be prepared to sell with folks much junior than you and not held to as high of standards. If the deal falls through, it’s on you. There are a few coprimes that are skilled sales reps
- Your “brand”- It’s important to maintain appearances, even on bad days. Your brand is determined by how involved you are in diversity, volunteer work, and leading the team, which requires tenure.
-Manager 1:1’s- these are a trap to look out for. Salesforce preaches trust as one of it pillars, but beware that everything said in those meetings will be used against you when they have soured on you
- Time management- working a 12 hr day is table stakes. There are endless distractions you will need to navigate and make hard decisions on “brand”/ appearance maintenance vs selling

The work/life balance is very heavy on the work side. The exec team repeatedly say their biggest regrets are not spending enough time with family. This will never change if they don’t take it serious. There is a lot you can learn here but at the expense of your self confidence as some managers make you feel worthless when your awful territory isn’t performing. If that isn’t enough to make you steer clear, the pay is very low and less than 20% of reps hit their annual numbers

The “Ohana” culture is a mirage. There is nothing remotely familial about the culture. It is an ultra competitive pressure cooker. I just had such higher hopes for my experience left disappointed..."
3,Salesforce,"Hard work, but amazing!",2016-10-21,5.0,Account Executive,"The 1-1-1 Model here (google it) and a tangible benefit that results of it is 7 full days of VTO (volunteer time off) to be used responsibly at your discretion. Matching gifts to a non-profit of your choice. 

- Benefits here overall are incredible
- ESPP is attractive
- Time off is generous
- comp package works in your favor- i.e. hard work does in fact = revenue. 
- equipment is all up-to-date and excellent (iPhone as work phone, and MacBook as laptop)
- Training that consists of bootcamp in San Francisco, and further training at a local hub. Ongoing trailheads and updates also keep you on your toes. 
- Fast-paced environment 
- Great culture 
- Talented professionals 
- Collaborative environment across different segments 
- Brand recognition 
- Smooth employee processes in the background (payroll, time logged, benefit tracking, incentive tracking, employee profile, etc). 
- Continuous acquisitions of companies continues to strengthen our products and offerings. 
- Snacks, events, and happy hours
- Flexibility and autonomy given to consult with your clients 
- Networking opportunities here are endless","- You can feel ""left-behind"" here at times, so it's crucial to stay organized to keep up with the pace, especially early on. 
- Work-life balance (self-induced): it's easy to become attached to your work and your accounts, and it trickle over into your personal life after hours, or on weekends. 
- Difficult quota to hit, but that's for a reason. if this were easy I suppose they would let anyone in. 

Can't think of anything else. It's hard to find things wrong with Salesforce, in fact this section took me a lot longer to provide the bullet points above then the pros section."
4,Salesforce,I really like it here.,2022-03-29,5.0,Support Engineer,"This is my 6 months of employment review. 

I am surrounded by strong women who are amazing team Leaders and workers. Management is fair and cares a lot. I'm not the best employee. I would consider myself incredibly average. I do feel that this is the first time in my career that my skills are accurately rated. I am given the opportunity to as they say ""level up"" with very detailed one on ones. This model only works for those who want to be better engineers and customer service agents. 

I never feel as if my caseload is too much. in fact, I have the free time to help my team reach resolutions and educate myself on my product.

I really hope to retire here
Before this, I owned my own business, and before that, I was a contract IT. I rather eat a whole brick house than work at any other company.","I'm pretty sad only 50,000 people get to have the joy to work here. I am honored to be one of them."
5,Salesforce,Great Place to Work...as long as you're not a POC,2022-03-01,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Innovative Company
-Brand Recognition
-Great Benefits and Learning Opportunities","I don't know what the culture is like on other teams, but my team is not diverse at all. I'm the only black person on my team, and even on our larger 30 person team, there are only 3 people of Asian descent (which is nuts considering tech demographics overall), everyone else is white or white-passing, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. There has been a lot of marketing recently about Salesforce meeting its 50% underrepresented goal a year early, but that number includes all women, and if it didn't they'd never meet their goal. A lot of middle managers are not interested in diversity and definitely not inclusion. Even if you're hired here as a black employee, you won't be treated equally and people will question your experience and abilities constantly. It's demoralizing, and it explains why retention is so low. I wouldn't recommend working here unless you have a bigger goal in mind for what you want to do next."
6,Salesforce,Outstanding Onboarding Experience,2022-03-02,5.0,Senior Solutions Engineer,"I started at Salesforce about six months ago as a fully remote employee. One of the most challenging things with any new job is getting ramped up to perform to the best of your abilities.

Salesforce has blown away any preconceived notions I had of what an onboarding experience should be like. From providing me a coach during the interview process to that I am presenting the best version of myself and my skill set to an thoughtfully laid out onboard plan.

I do understand that I may have a different experience than others because each department also controls a large portion of onboarding. However, I don't know of another company that spends 3-6 months ramping you in all the relevant areas you need to be successful at your job. Afterall, my success is ultimately the company's success.

Additionally, I was paired with both a mentor who had been in the job for some time (12+ months) and a buddy who was only a few months ahead of me and can still remember all the struggles and challenges.","In regards to the onboarding experience, I have absolutely none. I have never felt more cared for or empowered to be successful than I have here."
7,Salesforce,A company to grow with,2022-03-28,5.0,"Vice President, Software Engineering","You have the ability to grow as the company grows and adapts - continually adjusting and creating new opportunities. The saying ""doing well by doing good"" is true at every level of the company that continuously balances doing our best for our customers, our staff, and the world around us.",Need to be able to be flexible and adaptable and a continuous learner in a high pace environment (con is the speed of change and demands to keep up with it but also it creates the opportunities for personal growth).
8,Salesforce,Be surrounded by people that bring their best while bringing out the best in you,2022-03-14,5.0,AVP-Sales,"People are the best of the best
We use our own products
Customers actually like the technology
Still in a growth mindset - which gives you an opportunity to leave your fingerprints on pieces of the business as we scale","Big company so it can be challenging keeping up with all the new additions
You better be someone that actually likes (and embraces) change. It is a constant over here."
9,Salesforce,Great company (mostly),2022-03-01,5.0,Director,"Salesforce is a great company, if you level set your expectations.

* Consistent pay, benefits, PTO
* Smart peers
* Good company culture and values
* Manageable scope of work without much deviation","* Cultural indoctrination; you need to fully buy into the Salesforce culture to be a fit. If you don't drink the cool aid, you won't be a fit.
* Still lacks diversity in parts of the organization; cultural and gender diversity remains a challenge.
* Your role is to stay in your swim lane, scope of your work is defined and you are expected to stay in your swim lane.
* In order to get promoted, you either need friends higher up or fit a very specific Salesforce profile. There is partially still a glass ceiling for many minorities."
10,Salesforce,Best place to work,2022-03-24,5.0,Senior Sales Recruiter,"The onboarding, training, trailblazing mentor and everything in between truly sets Salesforce apart from all other companies. From day one, they prioritize your learning, partnering with the team and being engulfed in our culture. The strong training experience has ramped me quickly and allowed me to find success and already start considering what is next in terms of goals. I would highly recommend Salesforce and truly love it here!","There are lots of tools/applications that one needs to learn, it can feel overwhelming at first like drinking from a fire hose, but everypiece of training is impactful and truly sets you up for success. Be prepared to learn a lot early on."
11,Salesforce,The hype is real!,2022-03-24,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"- Innovative company and culture that is striving to be best-in-class when it comes to driving social impact, emphasizing diversity and inclusion, giving back to the community, sponsoring employee wellness and development, and carrying out sustainability initiatives. Salesforce lives and leads with its values from the top down and encourages transparency and feedback throughout the organization. 
- For a large enterprise, Salesforce works hard to ensure we are agile and nimble. The company is not afraid to fail fast, pivot strategies, execute on new ideas and proactively lead with a bold vision in the face of a rapidly changing world. The phrase ""Better, better, never best"" is a great way to describe the culture.
- Individually in my customer-facing sales role, I enjoy being able to work with so many different types of businesses and executives. It's rewarding to help clients succeed, transform, and adapt their businesses - and it's also a fantastic learning experience for my own development. Because Salesforce has such a huge platform, we are enabled to have conversations with every business department and are empowered to deliver real value. While we are selling a technical product, working at Salesforce allows me to elevate the conversation by leaning on Salesforce's own internal success and leadership to inspire my customers.
- There is a sense of pride in working here; there are just so many cool things about this company, it's hard to list them all!","- The job itself is not ""easy."" Because the company is always innovating, always bringing new products and solutions to market, and always striving to stay at the forefront of the most pressing business challenges and trends facing our customers, there's constantly new information we need to learn in order to be trusted advisors to the clients we support. It's a lot to learn and stay enabled on; this is a company that thrives on fast-paced change. 
- Additionally, because our platform literally does everything, there are a variety of ""point solution"" competitors big and small that we have to constantly stay one step ahead of. Fortunately, Salesforce invests in product specialists, competitive intelligence teams, and other resources to support you.
- You can definitely make a lot of money here if you are a top performer. That said, I get the sense that our base salaries are less competitive than comparable software sales roles at other high tech companies. That's a tradeoff to working at the best company though. Once you work here, you can get hired wherever. In fact, many people leave the company in order to get a MUCH more senior role somewhere else, and then leverage that to come back to Salesforce at much higher role and salary band. Staying at Salesforce might mean that your upward mobility is slower."
12,Salesforce,Great culture. Great future.,2022-03-29,5.0,Account Executive,"Industry leader in CRM, Service and internal/external engagement.

SF is a true transformational leader.

There are no end of tools and resources to help drive project/opportunity success.

My direct manager is very supportive, very patient. Team is right there always willing to help and coach. Unlike anything I've been a part of it. Great experience so far.",Lots to learn. Lots of resources to leverage.  Fast-paced. Super-innovative tech.
13,Salesforce,Excellent Experience,2022-03-24,5.0,Account Director,"The interview process with Salesforce was exceptional. The people I met were delightful, professional and transparent. The culture is amazing. I am very excited to be part of the company.",Nothing to be improved upon that I can see at this time.
14,Salesforce,Great compnay,2022-03-27,5.0,"Director, Sales Development","Very strong culture that attracts and retains high performers, best in class products, career progression based on merit and success, exceptional upper management who are forward thinkers and provide sufficient transparency into decisions and what the company is running towards.","Company is getting bigger quickly, not making short term tradeoffs and continuously bringing in great people to maintain high standards will potentially present challenges."
15,Salesforce,Everything they say about the culture is true!,2022-03-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Incredible culture & work-life balance - truly unparalleled compared to all other companies I've worked at,The company has grown quickly and there's room to increase operational efficiencies as it looks toward the next phase of growth
16,Salesforce,Meh place to work,2022-03-22,2.0,,The benefits are pretty good. Theres unlimited PTO and it's a good name to have on your resume.,"Career advancement varies wildly by team and there isn't any pay transparency. You're encouraged to explore different roles at the company, but it'll hold you back from pay increases and promotions even if you perform well and have great feedback from customers and leadership. The company is hyper political internally. Getting ahead is rarely about what you've done, but more who you're friends with. Leaders rarely listen to feedback even though they solicit it constantly and people of color are treated differently than white people. This company sells itself as a dream job, but really it's just like every other corporation: greedy, opaque, and insincere."
17,Salesforce,Best company ever!,2022-03-14,5.0,Software Engineering Principal,"This company cares about its people
The company values matter
The company lives its values
The people are great
The work is challenging and interesting
Innovation is highly valued","It is hard to keep up
It is hard to slow down
The level of information intake is always on Max"
18,Salesforce,Salesforce is an amazing organization!,2022-01-26,5.0,Managing Director,"Salesforce is truly dedicated to the contributing to the success of our clients through innovation, collaboration, teamwork and breakthrough thinking. The level of talent that is here is astounding and everyone works together to share ideas, find solutions and support each other and our clients. The executive team is compassionate and cares deeply for everyone on the team and the level of transparency to the executives is amazing especially given that we are such a large organization. Compensation and benefits are also highly competitive and targeted to things that make a difference for us personally and for our communities.","Given the pace of change that we are leading, it can sometimes be overwhelming to keep up; however, they value self-care which helps you strike the right balance personally as well. It's large organization, so it takes time to learn who does what and what experts to turn to when you need help but everyone is willing to help when you get to them."
19,Salesforce,"Trust, Respect, and an Incredible amount of Support/Care for Employees & Customers",2021-11-09,5.0,Senior Principal Customer Success Manager,"Huge Emphasis on Wellness; Encouragement and Support to continue professional education in order to move forward in your career; Tons of resources to support anything you need to get done and in a variety of formats, including people. Super flexible environment and laid back culture.","Amount of content can be overwhelming for new employees and even people who have been here for a while. We are delivering content faster than employees can learn it. This makes it very challenging to sell it appropriately, provide guidance on how to use it, and knowing where/who to go to for supporting the new content."
20,Salesforce,Deserves the title of best place to work,2022-02-05,5.0,Software Engineer PMTS,"Im my group, my colleagues are competent and collaborative. In my assignments, the team actively reaches out to inform on the background and context of requirements and solutions. The technology framework, effective and with battle-proven success on production, is partly new to me; I am excited to learn and contribute to continue our success. 

At a company / division level, there is ample and motivating communication with the values, focus, programs, and events of the company. The on-boarding program is pretty well organized. The processes, such as on-site Covid testing for the office opening (for employees who want to) have the employees well-being at forefront.","The ramp up is pretty steep and takes serious effort. 

The internal libraries documentation is a little lacking. For better or worse, I end up spending quite some time reading / running code to learn the ropes. Thankfully the code base is good quality in my opinion. On the functional side, taking many training modules on Trailhead slowly gave me a picture of our offerings."
21,Salesforce,Best place to work,2022-03-29,5.0,Product Manager,"Salesforce really is one of the best places to work. The leadership is awesome, the perks are great, pay is great and the culture is truly something that needs to be experienced.
Work life balance is highly valued at Salesforce",Can't think of anything yet
22,Salesforce,First Class Interview Process,2022-03-02,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"The recruiting and interview process with Salesforce was incredibly well organized and everyone was respectful and personable. This company ""walks the walk"" with regard to their core values. They embrace your individuality, and encourage you to pursue your passion within the company and your community.","Not for people who can't create content and communicate product value to an audience. Part of the interview process requires you to put together a presentation for a panel of interviewers. You give a 15-minute elevator pitch. with only an outline provided. You have to go create your presentation based on research, and the marketing materials that are available online. I felt like this gave me an opportunity to showcase my individuality and unique style, but others might feel overwhelmed."
23,Salesforce,"Amazing company, benefits and culture",2022-03-30,5.0,Sr. Director,"Great Culture
Strong Benefits
Ample opportunity to build a career","Disconnected Leadership
Lack of strategic focus"
24,Salesforce,Truly happy here,2022-03-17,5.0,ISV Partner Account Manager,"- Work life balance is great. I rarely think about work related things when I'm clocked out
- No micro managment
- Leadership will always step in and help, no questions asked and I really do feel they have my best interest
- Benefits and pay are competitve 
- Quota is achievable
- Promotion path is clear","- WFH culture is great, but I don't feel is sustainable with Salesforce's brand and there is very little opportunity to ever work with colleagues in person"
25,Salesforce,Interview and Hiring Experience has been great as fully remote team member so far,2022-02-24,5.0,Proactive Monitoring Engineer,"Great recruitment team! Stephanie Martin reached out to me regarding a position at Salesforce. I believe she is the reason I felt comfortable and prepared for my interview by explaining in depth what the role looks like, as well as the interview process.

Onboarding process allows you to engage with your internal department onboarding, as well as all aspects of Salesforce and teams from all over the world!","Most individuals are being onboarded remotely, which is not a smooth transition at any company since these are new processes due to the pandemic. While Salesforce is probably ahead of the curve, you will be inundated with LOTS of self-navigation resources during your onboarding experience. It can be a lot to organize and digest."
26,Salesforce,Loved it at Salesforce,2022-03-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"They have great benefits
There are great Career Growth Opportunities",A lot of politics and you need to be able to self-promote to get ahead

29,Salesforce,Opportunity for upward movement in the Renewals Org can be misleading and infrequently available,2022-03-30,4.0,Senior Renewals Manager,Salesforce is a great company that truly strives to better the world,"As an individual contributor it is very easy to feel like a ""cog in a wheel"". Upward movement is difficult and leadership is not very transparent in the process of working toward the next step. Salesforce pays less than comparable roles in other companies, but that is the exchange for working for a great company with great benefits."

- Takes care to ensure employees have work life-balance: Work smart not hard culture
- I feel freedom to share ideas with peers and take creative liberties with my deliverables","- Stock-based compensation portion of compensation lags behind other companies
- As with any large company, there are pockets that haven't adopted the best parts of the culture. This is counteracted by freedom to switch teams without requiring approval from your own management chain"
38,Salesforce,A great move for my mental health,2022-03-12,5.0,Senior Solution Engineer,I joined Salesforce 8 months ago and could not be happier that I made a career pivot.

They offer great benefits, wellness, you donate 1% of your time to volunteering. They also have a great matching program and provide grants for donations. I’ve been at salesforce for almost 10 years and I’ve always felt, even as a remote employee, that I am an important part of the company.","Despite being a global company it feels very San Francisco-based. Before Covid if you didn’t live in San Francisco you felt a little separated from the rest of the company. Things happen in the office that just don’t happen remotely. However since Covid we’ve all been working remotely and while offices are open, people are more likely to work from home. I think salesforce has done it right with remote work since Covid."

58,Salesforce,Wonderful people led by a visionary but megalomaniac CEO,2021-12-21,3.0,Executive,"Amazing, smart people surround you every day. Truly the best of the best.
No better place to learn how to run a software business.
Incredibly visionary leader.
A playground for you to experiment and innovate every day.
Working for a truly global brand, at a company where money is no object, allows you to have once-in-a-lifetime experiences all the time.","Marc is the only decision-maker at Salesforce. He will revert the decisions of tenured & seasoned executives, his ELT, or any C-team member in a second. This devastates the teams and people doing the work.

Competency is not a criteria for C-level jobs. Marc's favoritism is. One needs only to look at the exodus of Marketing talent (at all levels) in 2021 to see the impact of his most recent CMO selection.

With an army of talented leaders, but very limited opportunity for them to actually make decisions, the battle for ownership of the remaining work is more important than doing the work itself."

For those who love Big Tech taking a place as an enforcer of government and media control, SalesForce is a heaven for you. If you believe in freedom of choice and diversity of mind, I don't recommend it. 

- Industry leader, good name for a resume boost
- Competitive compensation and benefits
- Office were nice, when we went in to office for work","- Diversity is only encouraged, when it fits with mainstream narrative 
- Push self-righteous political and philanthropic ideologies internally

Health insurance is cheap, for actually extremely good plans. The lowest tier is completely free! Good dental and vision care too. Lots of time off to volunteer, but the biggest standout is the $100 per month wellness reimbursement, which can be used on lots of different things. If you use it, it becomes an incentive to take care of yourself and an effective $1200 per year of extra pay.
Management is extremely flexible about when and where you work, which is extremely convenient.","Get ready for senior leadership to forget that your job exists, unless you're in sales. ~80% of All Hands Calls are focused entirely on sales, and the majority of training you have to complete is sales focused, even if your role is not in sales.

150,Salesforce,Great Role to Earn Your Stripes,2021-09-20,5.0,Account Development Executive,"This job was my entry point into the world of Software Sales...it can be very challenging at times and things can feel out of your control, however if you learn to focus on your outputs (number of calls, emails, LI requests) you can see that you are able to influence your results incrementally. This job taught me a ton about persistence and focus and I most certainly would not have the job I have now (alliance leader at a global SI) without the lessons I learned in this role.","Month over Month quota can prove to be extremely taxing on a person's motivation and self esteem over time. It doesn't help that the quota usually does not change each month...so you are expected to hit the same metrics in December as you are in a more normal month like October.

If you are starting at the bottom, it is a long grind to the top. The Commercial AE role you can bridge into from AE can be very challenging as MuleSoft is designed for Enterprise companies. I personally chose to switch companies with 2 years experience under my belt."

Was told several times during my time ""stop trying to develop relationships, you won't be covering that account next year"" and ""it's not your problem if the implementation fails, just sell the licenses and someone will worry about it later.""
Was shocked by the level of micromanagement, time wasted on internal meetings, and sense of self-importance. Also, reps (often with manager support) spend a remarkable amount of time ""gaming"" the internal system. Setting up dupe accounts to manipulate commissions, a practice that often creates internal confusion which ultimately impacts the customer experience."

Getting VERY big and a series of promotions from without and seemingly disingenuous internal promotion systems (you cannot brag about how many new roles are open when a majority of these new roles are already spoken for by the people in the roles you killed off).

229,Salesforce,Toxic Sales Culture,2022-01-27,3.0,Account Executive,"Salesforce is an incredibly reputable company to work for. It really is the best resume booster you could ask for that sets you up to be recruited by almost every company. The benefits are top notch- healthcare, ESPP, wellness stipend, and discounts at a variety of different companies. The offices are absolutely beautiful and an impressive place to take friends and family. I have heard that most departments are really great to work for, but be VERY careful to do your due diligence in figuring out which ones those are.","Underneath its grandiose, towering presence and pristine public reputation, lies a dark reality in the sales organization. I could never recommend a career in sales at Salesforce for these reasons:

Compensation: Salesforce's base and OTE's are well under the market rate for Account Executives. On top of that, you are punished financially for being promoted within the company, and will receive a base/OTE that is 10-20k lower than external hires. Due to this, there is incredibly high turnover, as long term Salesforce sales employees bounce to other companies to receive proper compensation and many of the sales teams are constantly dominated by new hires. Territories are created in a way in which only about 20% of reps will hit their annual number so base your expected income on your base rate and how comfortable you would be living off of that number. 

Customer treatment: Salesforce redistributes territories every fiscal year, meaning customers are given a new Account Executive every year. This leads to extreme frustration and oftentimes, customers being sold solutions that they don't necessarily need. Expect to be dealing with many angry customers during the first part of the fiscal year, and cleaning up the mess created by the previous AE.

Management: From my experience, I have had some of the most micromanaging and condescending bosses of my career at Salesforce. Even though I am a remote employee, I constantly feel as if my boss is looking over my shoulder through the constant Slack messages and tracking of my daily activity (call/email volume). The worst part is the culture of toxic positivity. Never admit that you are struggling either with work or in your personal life, as that will be used against you in one way or another. Favoritism is rampant and is gifted to those who go out of their way to express immense gratitude, compliment their boss, and NEVER admit frustrations, even if valid. Sorry, but I'm too old to act like a corporate robot monkey. 

Career mobility: As I mentioned above, in the sales organization, your pay will hardly change as you go up-market. Switching into other departments is nearly impossible as you must seek VP level approvals, navigate the lousy internal recruiting teams, and build up a case as to why you are more valuable than external hires. This is why there are so many Salesforce boomerangs... 

Ultimately, I had really high hopes for the Sales Organization at Salesforce, but was super disappointed by my experience. I understand that not every experience will be the same, but I think it is important to look past the facade."

235,Salesforce,Not somewhere I would ever recommend but to each their own.,2022-02-25,1.0,,There is a decent amount of freedom depending on which team you are on. Remote work is typically an option for anyone who's interested or you can be full-time in house or a hybrid of the two.  There is so much work and so much change that you will learn A TON... but it'll be at a firehouse pace so it's hard to sustain.,"Extremely toxic culture. ""Leadership"" that specialized in gaslighting and very blatant threats. An HR department that chooses to sweep complaints about senior leaders (from multiple people and orgs) under the rug. HR seemed to purposely omit exit interviews for many people I knew who left for some of these reasons. Constant reminders about how we're all ""Ohana"" but yet numerous mass layoffs with little warning, PIPs were given to people for little to nothing, unreasonable expectations were set to purposely to drive people out of the company (i.e., expecting an associate engineer who joined my team to deliver the same level of work I was within their first month... they quit last year too).

Politics ruled the world; you couldn't get anything done unless you were doing a favor for another team or going to the top of the chain to force it down someone's throat... which people often thought was funny to do on a Friday afternoon to force others to work the weekend. Initiatives were constantly changing before the previous one was completed. Management never really seemed to know what was actually the focus of the month because, quite frankly, they were moved around so often and so overloaded, they rarely knew more than the ""1000 foot view"" of the product they were supposed to be managing.

Hours mandated were ridiculous; some days we worked until 3 or 4am and were expected back on shift by 9 or 10am; wasn't uncommon to work 60 to 80 hour weeks, occasionally seeing 90 to 105 (yes in a single week and no that'snot an exaggeration). A considerable amount of talk publicly about ""work life balance"" but it wasn't present in the slightest in our org.

I could honestly write another entire thesis on the things that weren't great about working here after my 7 years. I left because I just didn't want to deal with it anymore (like MANY others) and I've literally talked a number of people out of even trying to apply. If you're young, single, and love to do nothing but work your life away, it'll be a great place to learn but don't get stuck there in the golden handcuffs if the position doesn't suit you. There are MUCH better places to work who will treat you like a person instead of a feature delivering dog."

Deadlines can be incredibly hard to meet - even when working with teams of some highly motivated and intelligent people. Generally speaking, people are very passionate which is great, but can lead to conflict if there are competing interests. This can be uncomfortable, but is something you have to get used to. Upper management is 50/50 on saying the right thing vs saying something completely tone deaf (though admittedly, this ratio is still much better than most places).

When the pandemic hit, Salesforce made sure that its employees were well-outfitted to work from home, and emphasized prioritizing mental health and balancing new work/life struggles. (Note that it wasn't all rosy, Salesforce also chose to do a round of layoffs during the pandemic, even though they were experiencing a record quarter, which caused a lot of controversy.)

For as large of a company as Salesforce is, it is reasonably transparent. Employees have access to executive leadership, and have opportunities to ask them tough questions, such as regarding the layoffs they chose to do during the pandemic.","There is a lot of pride in Salesforce's culture, which can often feel a bit cult-like. I joined Salesforce through an acquisition, and the leaders at the acquired company seemed much more used to tough questions than leaders that I observed at Salesforce.

There's also a lot of internal training stuff through their internal trailhead platform that seems more time-consuming and less value-packed compared to other companies I've worked at."

Many of the veterans are leaving as they are pushed out or burnt out. We have a lot of marketing around 'Ohana' and valuing our 10+ year employees, but that can change very quickly. Lots of talk of work life balance, but that can vary depending on your team and manager."
346,Salesforce,Great to work at,2022-01-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good Culture, good people, pro- remote work, have done well during Covid",Large Company that makes it challenging to move to other internal jobs as an internal candidate
347,Salesforce,Too big for it's britches,2022-01-15,2.0,Marketing,"You learn a TON, and are exposed to some really incredible people here. I wouldn't change my time here at all and have met some of the best mentors and smartest people in the industry. Benefits are great, WFH flexibility and the stipends are wonderful. There is a lot of opportunity to move around within the company and learn new roles and duties, which is lucky, because in order to move up you will have to move around.","The promotion system is broken. Period. Only promoting 1-3% of your workforce every 6 months is a broken process and gives over-perfoming employees two options if they don't get promoted that round - wait and see, or move into a new role within the company at the higher title. Or, the route I took, leave the company. I understand putting a cap on the amount of promotions each team can have, but it can cause teammates to have to wait YEARS for a promotion they should have just been given. 

And finally, ""Ohana"" is BS in my opinion when it comes to those in leadership. Those not in leadership totally embody that spirit, but the amount of politics, backstabbing and egotistical leaders in this company is unacceptable. When you disagree with someone who doesn't understand your job but is in a leadership role, you are punished, get duties you enjoy doing taken away from you, and told to make things better without any guidance on what is actually broken. 

Salary is also way under in comparison to other companies. Salesforce used to be at the top of salary ranges, and have unfortunately not kept up with the times. 

Every year the employee survey continually highlights these issues, and now with some of the top employees in the company moving on to greener pastures, I really hope they tackle these problems. It starts from the top."

There was a lot of opportunity to do different things. There are some great people at the organization that I worked with, and for a while felt well compensated for my contributions. Having Salesforce on your resume is a great career builder.","As the company has gotten bigger, roles have become more narrow. I had looked to move into another role for a while, but, as a director level, there weren't a lot of opportunities - Salesforce is hiring more and more junior people to fill roles. My position was eliminated and replaced by an analyst level person straight out of college. Many other higher level ( read- older, long-term employees) folks were part of the same layoff in 2020. 

You will have many different managers while you are there - I had 13 in 8 1/2 years. So, if you have a bad one, wait - they will move into something else. The bad part of this is its hard to make a mark when you constantly have to re-prove yourself. 

The company used to give raises every year - even just a cost of living raise. This stopped around 2017 or so. So negotiate your upfront salary well."

Not all managers are great.
There's turnover here because the training programs and talent that attract people to Salesforce also attracts other companies to steal from Salesforce.
To move up, you need to self-promote and network - if you're not comfortable doing that, you'll be frustrated. Sometimes the ""one love"" vibe can get old/feel disingenuous - it's still a job.

454,Salesforce,Big Company/Close Family,2021-12-28,5.0,Solutions Engineer,I love my team and even though we are virtual I feel well connected.,It is a big company and sometimes there are so many moving parts and lots of people involved to do small task.

456,Salesforce,BDR,2022-01-16,5.0,Business Development Representative,Just company with great benefits,Working remote can be challenging
457,Salesforce,"Not the best, not the worst. Not a place for introverts",2021-12-08,3.0,Solution Engineer,Pay and benefits are good.,"Salesforce is better at buying outside talent than it is at developing its own people which is why there are so many boomerang employees. People leave to get the experience they need to go to the next role they want. There are no formal performance reviews meaning being promoted to your next role is very subjective depending on whether or not your leadership team likes you. Additionally, for the all the talk about showing up to work and embracing your authentic self, at the end of the day all anyone cares about is how you show up on a dashboard which incentives people to log things they did not do sometimes to an absurd degree like someone logging that they worked 70 hours a week every week for a quarter and then getting an award for most hours logged. 

Relatedly there is a huge emphasis placed on managing your personal brand. If you come from a cultural background where you are taught to do your best work day after day and expect that to be noticed in merit of itself, you will be disappointed working here at least in the sales organization. You have to have the desire to talk about yourself a lot and be a self promoter. 

Lastly, I want to share something I personally observed while working here. In my first sales team which was predominantly white, we had one female person of color on the team. She was exceptionally hard working, eager to learn, and dedicated to her job. Management and her colleagues did not support her in the way that was needed for her to reach her full potential. Moreover I believe they made work difficult for her in an effort to push her out of the organization. I never understood why. Maybe she didn't fit a type that her team was looking for. She later left to join another company where she is, unsurprising to me, doing very well. I would have thought that retaining and supporting talented employees of all backgrounds would be a priority but especially employees of color given how much Salesforce as a company talks about diversifying its workforce."

461,Salesforce,"Trustworthy, transparent and friendly interview experience",2021-12-06,5.0,Support Engineer,All the people I've met from the recruiter to my now manager have all been amazing. They all really seem to enjoy working at Salesforce and want to help others and each other.,"None so far. The onboarding seems a bit overwhelming, but there is a lot to learn and they are still growing strong."
462,Salesforce,Gaslighting,2021-04-08,2.0,Director of Infrastructure,"I worked with some really cool people, some really smart people.","This is a severely toxic organization - reorgs  and a lot of political fighting, posturing and sabotage between the VPs as they try really hard to get noticed by the EVPs. What's worse is that it appears that the HR folks are either powerless and so they go along or they are in on it. Several coworkers described experiences of being horribly berated by hatchet folks in HR based on ""complaints"" that HR would not clarify or explain. They described being pulled onto phone calls and told they have to ""apologize for what you did"", and when asked what they were talking about, would be told ""it's impossible that you don't know what we're talking about and if you don't then it's even worse than we thought.""

Some have hypothesized this is how Salesforce rattles employees they, for whatever reason, decide they want to leave ( inside scoop indicates this is another maneuver by some VPs to create ""opportunities"" to shape an org the way they want when they get key folks to self-select out) but have no reason to push them out or worse yet, the employees were actually considered high performing by prior managers.

I highly recommend anyone considering Salesforce to stay away unless it is the best you can get because its a huge company, if you get on the wrong side of just about anyone it could get really bad for you and there is nothing you can do."

Many people are willing to jump in and help wherever possible. Company has excellent benefits and the majority of people who work here seem to really enjoy what they do.,"High pressure environment felt mostly by sales teams. Most power is taken away from the AE's to be able to run and execute on deals, which feels like a lack of trust. RVP's and AVP's are expected to come in to 'save the day' and close the deals vs empowering the team. Big opportunity to upskill AE's, RVP's, AVP's and SVP's on executive engagement and how to have value driven conversations with customers instead of leading with product. By promoting strong AE's to 1st line managers, they don't have the training and coaching in place to make them into good leaders."

-commitment to the company values
-lots of very hard working, smart, passionate people 

For a long while, I never thought I would work at a better place than SFDC and I think that opportunity could still be there if you're on the right team.","The company culture at Salesforce has changed a lot in the 4 years I was there. I felt like things really changed in late 2018/early 2019 when the company started to see quarter after quarter of success, plus the SF HQ tower opened. 

Within that change, what I felt was us moving towards being overly corporate and people constantly seeming stressed out. There started to become a very formal feeling wherein coming to work meant that people we afraid to say what they thought, decision making became harder because of so many silos within the company and politics abounded. 

The politics at SFDC were probably the most stressful thing for me. It was hard to feel valued when the company is constantly reorging in some area, having layoffs even after record breaking quarters and constantly pivoting. It takes a lot of dedication and energy to grind at Salesforce but it also started to become mind numbing when I realized that it would be very very hard to make it to the top & for it to be worth it. 

The promotions process here is also really murky. They've tried for years to create transparency but it just isn't. Many promotions, even a title change promotion, require you to interview for the role which feels tedious and like another hoop to jump through to prove yourself. 

Another major con for me was that when I changed internal roles, there was no pay increase. This meant that I didn't see a salary promotion of any kind for nearly 3 years. After some time, it starts to feel like you're just a cog in the machine. When I would try to approach financial compensation with my manager, she also would get very cagey. For a company that is raking in the dough, it sure doesn't feel like the wealth is being spread around. 

This is a great place to work if you are either 1) starting your career and can climb the corporate ladder & then jump off to somewhere else or 2) are coming in at a senior manager or director level."
528,Salesforce,Salesforce Has Jumped The Shark :-(,2021-08-26,2.0,Regional Vice President (RVP),Great products overall. There is still a lot of solid talent here but they are starting to leave. They are acquiring companies so we will continue to grow. It is an excellent place to learn if you are new to sales and need a respected company on your resume. There are lots of opportunities for women and we have a promising career path here.,"Accountants and beurocrats have taken over. When a company stops taking care of its employees, the customers are next. The non-productive overhead has increased significantly and they are now cheating their sales and sales managers out of commissions. This is no longer a place for experienced or top producing AE’s. They will screw you out of money any chance they get and hide behind the policy. It's really sad actually. Even medium producers have compensation challenges. Go elsewhere unless you don't care about money or are a new or mediocre sales rep. Top talent won't get rewarded here."

I'm still new to the company and one of the great things they do is provide a mentor for you the first year while you're getting your feet under you. I think this is so invaluable!","None for me so far, but I've heard a common complaint is the frequent org changes and leadership structure changes."

Also, the career opportunities for individual contributors are ubiquitous. You can join as an Account Executive and make your way over to Software Engineer if you're willing to learn the skills and build the network necessary to do this.","Salesforce is a chaotic environment with a lot of noise. If you are easily overwhelmed by stimuli (like tons of IM's coming to you from different people who require different asks for different engagements), you will have a hard time at Salesforce. Salesforce also tends to hire ""Type A"" people which leads to the problem of developing too many employee resources and enablements. For example, if I'm looking for an answer to a specific question, it can be quite difficult to find that answer within existing company documents since there are so many assets to sift through."

-Management needs a little work in the compassion area. Working through a pandemic and political turmoil is pretty difficult to sell CRM to small businesses who just had to fire half their staff or are GOING OUT OF BUSINESS but we are still expected to ""get creative""
-If you are lucky, you will get a territory that has an account that shouldn't be aligned to you but you will make your number from it cause management will look the other way since they want the ACV for themselves
-Brand is absolutely everything, Anything you say or do will be held against you. You say one wrong thing it will get around.
-Pay is horrible. You get a $1/hour increase when you get promoted for each role and they frame it like your OTE will be much higher though. FALSE, again unless you have an amazing territory, 25% of people ACTUALLY hit their number/OTE. So good luck with that. 
-Office perks are no longer. Since everyone is remote, half the perk of the job was all the cool things at the office. Say goodbye to that if you work remote. 
-PTO, don't even bother trying to take PTO... ever. You will fall behind or be guilt-tripped for taking it at all. Want to take PTO at the end of the month? ha not a shot. Want to take PTO at the end of the Quarter? good luck getting that approved. Want to take time off after the fiscal year ends? ha then you are the sucker who isn't working on their pipeline generation for the next year. 

Overall, great company. But if you want to go into sales here, get ready to have your ego, confidence, and sanity ripped to shreds. I would recommend any role here BUT sales."

The focus on wellbeing with wellness days, VTO, and the countless other financial benefits make Salesforce a great place to work. I feel like a valued employee.

The opportunity to work on different tech stacks is great. The people in Security Assurance are highly dedicated and live the value of Trust. Salesforce also provides many opportunities for developing your soft skills which is also great.","The Security organization (Security Assurance specifically) is going through an identity crisis with a hazy long term vision to support a changing engineering org. Without a clear vision and direction, the focus is on fire fighting and operational day-to-day tasks. The culture never recovered from the DefCon/Meat Pistol incident and leadership turnover.

Lately, there seems to be high turnover in more senior Security Assurance engineers due to slowed career growth, increasing workload, and less competitive compensation."

I'm also lucky to have an awesome manager who helps me bring my best self to work and encourages me to look ahead and explore different roles to grow into for future reference. It also feels great to work for a company that shares the same values. The company is focused on customer success so it doesn't waste time on corporate BS. The company makes informed decisions based on data, employee feedback, and to always stay ahead. Which may seem like common business sense, but I've worked for other companies where they have redundant policies that cause stress and inefficiency just for the sake of being corporate.

This affects my KPI's and was expected to perform with little to no direction. It's radio silent in my 1:1s and was asked to come up with points of view into their new logo accounts. They don't utilize their BDRs correctly and believe were supposed to research all of their new logo accounts and come in with a step by step plan. How am I supposed to do this with no knowledge or direction on any of the products or goals?

652,Salesforce,Mid Commercial Core AE,2021-11-01,3.0,Account Executive,"Good benefits, SPP, Great product, interesting customers, work some big complex deals. 

I’ll get straight to it, overall your experience will be dependent upon your RVP and AVP, territory and your mentor. I personally came to salesforce to sell to new clients, be challenged and force myself to grow. At my previous company it became very rinse and repeat. At salesforce none of your conversations will be the same and you can drive some very unique business outcomes with the products at your disposal. The core role is basically just knowing who and what resources to bring in for each conversation, you are a quarterback. You get a six month ramp quota that you can attain if you put in the work, but there is some luck and timing involved to that. Your first year you will probably get subpar to okay accounts but they will usually throw you a bone and give you 2 or 3 buying accounts that are actively doing projects or buying. This role is not for guys who sit around and do inbound all day, it’s very prospect heavy you will have to get creative and be humble. If you have a good BDR they can make this a lot easier for you. First two to three months are a grind you probably won’t hit a good stride in meetings until month three. Overall I like the role it’s just sales fundamentals, get activity, be consistent, listen to clients needs and align the proper people/solution to their problems and thats when the money comes in.","Pipeline management is a lot of work and your deals will be scrutinized heavily. It can be difficult to have a sense of direction in the core role since you can approach it in so many ways. Coprime AEs like marketing cloud or tableau are pretty weak they usually aren’t true sales people. Some people get dealt bad hands in their territory. Salesforce sub verticalized accounts this year so a lot of people are struggling to hit their numbers, but this should change next year and you also close most deals at end of year. Accounts have been shuffled alot so expect your clients to be annoyed they have their 5th AE in 2 years."

Unfortunately there's too many parrots in the organization who try to build their brand and get noticed by trying to be mini-Marcs; they try to crank up their social change charisma but lack his ability to inspire.,"Stock refreshers have dried up. Promotions don't come with pay increase. Overly saturated ""woke"" culture is often overbearing. Under the banner of ""business is the best platform for change"" you will be lectured via email or company webcast on each and every recent social issue as they occur. It is not uncommon for a SVP or above to email their organization on how they feel about a particular social issue. Those in positions of power at SF, apparently are more versed on these social issues and you are supposed to benefit from their insight.

Work/life balance is not respected all that much. It's stated that you should strive for a work/life balance, but the amount of work given does not allow it, and you'll usually find yourself frantically looking for extra time to fulfill work that's been unrealistically dumped on you.

The job will suck your soul if you are lower level, but seems much better once you move up the ranks. In order to be the best, you must do the most and work the hardest; not necessarily be the smartest. Initiatives like 'well-being' mandatory days off 1 time per month make life worse not better.

- A big happy family story - SF constantly says `We are great family` and at the same time has so crappy benefits that it is really hard to find IT company in Seattle with such crappy benefits (example medical, dental)
- Executives do very interesting stuff - first ban business trips, organize a party on Hawaii for executives in a middle of pandemic and broadcast to everyone how awesome the company is"
733,Salesforce,So Disappointed,2021-02-18,1.0,Director,"Decent pay, good benefits, unlimited PTO","I'm what is affectionately referred to as a ""boomerang"" (an employee who leaves and returns) and I have to say, I am incredibly disappointed in the company that I returned to. Yes, the pandemic has changed the way we do everything but honestly 95% of the company worked 90% remote before the pandemic so what I'm currently experiencing cannot possibly be as a result of the pandemic.

The culture used to be people oriented where you could bring your whole self to work. You could count on a face paced environment but very clearly direction on objectives. You could expect leadership to be focused and thoughtful in their plans and direction. No more.

The company still pays lip service to ""Ohana"", equality, and our values. However we have increasingly promoted really good engineers into leadership roles -- senior leadership roles to boot -- who have little idea about what it takes to be an effective leader. The company is disorganized and entirely focused on delivering everything yesterday that there is no room to focus on ""Ohana"" and taking care of the people in the process.

Marc no longer is an active, visible leader in the organization. That falls mainly to Brett Taylor who seems content on turning Salesforce into Google.

If I had to do it over again, I wouldn't have returned."

They do not publicize retention. Microaggressions, bias, and unequal pay are still issues. Zero accountability, even from teams tasked to lead this work. From a technical standpoint, it can be easy to pigeonhole yourself into their proprietary stack such that those skills are less marketable outside of the Salesforce community.

Benefits are good and the base salary is respectable. Internal sales processes/operations is excellent and very good CXO involvement,"Toxic. Just plain toxic. The only difference between Salesforce and all the other large tech firms is Benioff. He is the master of PR and CNBC love him. He's the master of spin and promoting Salesforce as the ""purpose driven"" company to address the world's social and climatic ills. Other than that, you will work 24x7 and no matter where you are when it comes to your experience, be micro-managed by people less qualified than you. The expectations on quota are no different than any other firm and you miss the mark...you'll be shown the door. Also, expect to drink the kool-aid big time in term of ""social justice"" and other initiatives to push the BS marketing efforts. You'll be REQUIRED to engage with a non-profit or charitable organization and demonstrate/prove 10-15 hours of community activity. This is nothing short of fascist.

Can make a ridiculous amount of money if you close a lot of deals.,"Constant pressure to win new business every month. I understand that is the name of the game in sales. But we put customer relationships at-risk in the long-term because we are constantly asking them to upgrade or buy something more ""now"" instead of on their timeline. Long term relationships are more valuable than a quick deal just because our month is about to close."

Some people really like it. But it can be rough for those who do not care for marketing—it is a marketing company first. And a technology company second.","It’s a sales company, so if you like marketing and sales—it is the place to be. If you go with the expectation that you are working for a product focused company with an ethos for design excellence—don’t hold your breath. It is not that. Again, it’s like the name sounds—-it’s a company of and for sales people."
746,Salesforce,Don't believe the hype - lots of cool aid and group-think,2021-09-21,2.0,Senior Solution Engineer,"Phenomenal products. The platform is unreal, honestly they sell in spite of themselves a lot of the time. Most lost sales are of our their own doing. Pay is ok - they don't expect much, and pay accordingly.

A lot of autonomy, the brand buys a lot of credibility and the opportunity to get involved in great work and great customers.","Sadly a very big strong culture of group think, not a lot of true independent thought going on (generally actively discouraged - a lot of ""but this is the way we've always done things""). 

Culture is predicated on a lot of cool-aid drinking - espouses values ""trust, customer success, innovation, equality"", these look nice on a slide but are sadly mostly lip-service. The company simply expects people to believe these things because they have a well established brand, rather than earning them and living them day to day (which an alarming number of people do not). Most of the actions they take in this space (equality especially) are often quick-fixes that look nice on a headline but don't fix the underlying problems

Fundamentally most of these values and even the view around ""making the world a better place"" are absent inside the company. Once you're in, it's all about the current quarter's revenue and not much else. Long-term customer relationship management or strategic planning are almost entirely absent from KPIs or discussions, everything is about the immediate sale opportunity and how much money it will bring in - Customers' relationship managers generally get shuffled every year, so the customer never really ends up with a strong relationship. 

They generally depend on the fact that once you've bought and invested in the system and embedded it into your processes, it's too expensive to switch, and palm off implementation to 3rd parties and don't take ownership of success/failure for the customer, too busy already focussing on the next quick sale."

Benefits are amazing (compared to smaller companies I have worked at)

A very welcoming and inclusive environment.","On large calls, Management is spending as much time on equality issues (BLM, Stop Asian Hate, LGBTQ, or whatever is making headlines that week/month). Firstly it's too much time on the subject and secondly, it seems like it's ""Flavor of the day"" Equality. I would rather spend the time learning about work-related topics, I am involved in equality learning and action outside of work.

It's extremely hard at first to find resources internally when you have problems to solve, there is so much information available. After a year or so"

What I want to share is Salesforce actually walks the walk when they say they support employees to find a work life balance especially where family is concerned. Over and over again I have been able to flex my schedule to meet family obligations. The on-going pandemic has really brought to the fore front the huge advantage of SalesForce as a company that actually support employees. 

Recently I needed to drop a project to be with a sick parent.

803,Salesforce,Complete Waste of Time,2021-09-25,1.0,Strategic Accounts AE,Zero as far as I was concerned.   It’s all about an every changing PowerPoint narrative that is high level at best — and the “next big thing” everyone was directed to focus on —  which changed at least 3 times in my short tenure.,"The huge number of sales “overlays” is shocking and a complete disservice to shareholders.   Very few were evenly moderately well versed in their “cloud specialty”.    

For a company that invented CRM, the instance of CRM the Reps used is a compete mess of a maze with duplicate account records, thousands of overcomplicated widgets and very little explanation for why they were needed or even better; why not sunset them?   Many were useless and last used years ago.   

Most shocking was discovering that less than 40% of the Reps make Quota.   I never once heard on an All Hands call any reference to Quota Attainment — it was all about the record breaking prior Quarter or Prior Year Growth — and as a result how awesome everyone was!  While growth is a critical metric, when Quotas have almost zero chance of being attained, the model is broken.   Or it’s just simply disingenuous.  Thinking high caliber (and highly recruited) Reps are going to stick around for their base salary with the hopes that next year’s account list “might” be better is a non starter."

Great managing Covid - Listened to the employee feedback for the most part","There are reviews here with 0 cons which I find hard to believe for a 60K employee company. They jam public surveys down our throats to get the image of the ""Best place to work."" Seems like HR is rushing to drown out poor reviews....

Salesforce is an okay place with some very, very toxic people. I've met one of the worst human beings of my life here, and with how the world is in 2021, that's saying a lot. First-line leaders are more often bad than good. Back office draws territories randomly every year, and leaders have very little say, so it's the luck of the draw. Under 20% of reps hit quota and meet their OTE for a company already underpaying due to their name. You need to hit quota to get paid a reasonable amount which only happens once maybe twice a year if you're lucky. Managers won't acknowledge that you have a bad territory and have the same expectations as the leading rep. Leading rep makes 3 to 4 times the amount of everyone else and is put on a pedestal but everyone including themselves knows it's the opportunity given. Accounts change every year, so prospecting is demotivating, knowing the work you do will go to someone else. Essentially an order taker with not enough orders to hit quota. Very saturated market. Inundated with pointless nonrevenue generating admin work/meetings. Inundated is an understatement. The majority of the information logged within the CRM is fake due to the pressure to meet all of the initiatives and stay off the naughty list. Leading to inaccurate reporting which leads to increased expectations.

You will be drowning, gasping for air as your first-line leaders stand on your shoulders with their heads out of the water... for the most part. If you can tread water for 2+ years, you will get the Salesforce stamp of approval on your resume to find a better, higher-paying job. 2-3 year turnover is drastic. HARD WORK DOES NOT GET YOU AHEAD. Your mental health and wellbeing will deteriorate.

Please do your research and reach out to folks working there to get their opinions."

You'll learn from the most talented marketers around, and you'll have more experiences in a year at Salesforce than you would in 10 years anywhere else.","Salesforce pays new hires at/above market rate, but won't compensate existing employees to bring them up to market rate--merit increases and promotions will never get you there. It's well-known that in order to be paid fairly at Salesforce, you have to leave the company to get your worth. It's incredibly disconcerting that top talent isn't valued, and that the company is essentially betting you won't take the risk of leaving in order to be paid fairly. ""Equality"" is a value in name only, and the ""equal pay"" practices aren't actual equality, it's just a marketing ploy by HR and leadership."

Companies like Google, T-Mobile, Facebook - all give employee stock. What doesn’t Salesforce with its mega growth? 

401k match is nice but lower than the average. 

Good boys club still exists. Females are treated differently. 

Leadership will never remove middle and lower managers who should be gone. Even after managers get multiple reports filed and complaints. They are still there. 

Product is still lacking. They spent tons of money on new products that are overpriced and basic. So we are still behind our competition."

- Lot's of ""I think"" answers. Little ownership (until you're wrong).
- A dozen ways to send messages, no added benefit to clarity or communication
-Kumbaya atmosphere immediately stops when mistakes are made, which feels disingenuous
- Very difficult to know if you're a good fit, because low quality work may just be the result of a lack of intel or training

2) Leadership - Benioff and Salesforce leaders are visionaries and highly engaged. I trust them to make the right decisions for the company.
3) Internal Mobility - you are encouraged to explore career opportunities in other functions if that is of interest to you","1) If you are very senior (15+ years experience), I would avoid CSG. Upward career mobility is very limited and leadership makes very little effort to promote a career focused organization. Revenue growth is the primary motivation, career development takes a back seat.
2) Reporting hierarchy - it's ridiculous at some levels. You could be reporting to a peer at your level who's competing with you for promotions, salary increases, recognition, etc. Conflict of interest, you think?
3) Yearly Re-Org: the intent is to position the company for growth, but the rationale and results do not always make sense. It definitely puts the customer through an uncomfortable transition period."

- highly political at executive level: achieving results is considered obvious. What matters to progress is knowing the founder, ""culture and behavior"" and ""personal brand"" which means personal preferences, lack of meritocracy, and fierce competition to build one's ""brand"" (announce results before others, take credit for others work etc)."

I had very high expectations for the company, and after working here 6 months I can honestly say that Salesforce exceeded my (very high) expectations.

The compensation and benefits are at the top of the industry standards. The leaders here truly care for those that work under them, and wellbeing is something that is emphasized and preached. Honestly, I have never been happier at a job before. I love working at Salesforce and don't see myself leaving anytime soon (or ever!)","Because Salesforce is in such an innovative industry, change is a constant.

Tons of enablement and assets to leverage in selling, however a lot of the materials live in disparate locations making it tough to navigate. You work with a huge extended Salesforce army, many of which are specialists on a specific product so you’re not expected to be an expert on all solutions which is nearly impossible considering the amount of products you have to sell. You will learn so much here about the art of selling, they truly do produce some of the best sales talent. ESPP is nice, but so is equity which as a sales person you don’t get because they think your commission is enough but the reality is if you’re not meeting your monthly goals then you’re not reaping any of that “benefit”. Monthly wellness stipend is nice and so is the name recognition you'd get on a resume.","1) When starting out they will give you the worst patch to see if you can turn dry lemons into lemonade. As you get more tenured you may or may not receive a better patch, it depends on how you want to navigate the favoritism game. The more popular you are with leadership, the better the accounts and the more flips you will get.
2) To be successful it's all about the 3 T's: Territory, Timing, and Talent in exactly that order. If your accounts aren't growing, you will have a very difficult year ahead living on base salary alone which is already way lower than market. Be prepared to spin your wheels which can often feel like high effort low return as CRM decisions don't happen overnight.
3) Every start of the fiscal accounts are shifted around which can be frustrating both internally and externally. The revolving door of AEs makes it hard to establish long term trust with customers. 
4) Be prepared to invest a lot of time fixing CSAT issues from poor implementation left behind from the rep before you.
5) The majority of ACV is made in Q4 which is around year-end holidays, making it stressful to take time off."

My manager definitely cares and I love my team.","With rapid growth it’s hard to move up quickly. There is more red tape than before in terms of trying new projects, getting approvals and promotions. There used to be more of a startup mentality and more freedom. I’ve noticed an increase in administrative activities as we have rapidly grown this past year. 

The “target income” is much less than what recruiters advertise. I’ve overachieved my metrics and have done an amazing job yet have been stuck at an associate title. I am paid less than others who are external new hires in my same role. 

I was told “although I qualify for a promotion, there are many others on the bench who did not make the promotion cut last time. If I want to be at my desired salary I should leave for a year so I am an external hire and then be rehired back in.” I do not want to leave as I love my team but unfortunately I may have to in order to advance my career and avoid red tape.

1100,Salesforce,It's all about the CULT-ure,2021-07-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. Looks good on your resume.
2. Good benefits.","1.You'll need those benefits to seek treatment for issues that result from prolonged exposure to Salesforce's toxic environment.
2. Promotions are based on favoritism rather than competence, responsibilities, and merit. Image is the ONLY thing. They rely on something they call Salesforce style (or something) which is really just a way to allow unscrupulous managers to manufacture unmeasureable reasons to deny you a promotion. 
3. There are several levels of managers who add little to no value but cause a lot of pain. They literally spend all their time going to meeting and running orders down the chain. They couldn't do any of the ACTUAL work if you dared them to. Then they have lots of free time for politicking and deceit.
4. DEI ""efforts"" are nothing more than marketing. They want to see themselves as good people without doing the actual work. The truth is that discrimination is rampant and they do nothing about it. Nothing other than increase DEI-related marketing while they gaslight black and brown employees.
5. Pay is significantly lower than you'd find at other companies in the industry.
6. They will consume your entire life and all of your energy if you allow it through overworking, forced volunteering, forced ""fun"", and all that family talk (all the better to manipulate you).
7. ""Employee Success"", ""Ethics Point"", and the ""Warmline"" are all HR. Their role is to protect the company from liability. They don't actually care about employees.
8. They periodically send a link, via company email, to come to Glassdoor and provide a review. What person who needs/wants their job would follow an email link from their employer and give anything less than 5 stars?"
1101,Salesforce,What more could you ask for?,2021-04-19,5.0,Lead Solution Engineer,"They care about your work/life balance. They pay very well. They care about their managers through how their direct reports are doing. They care about you as an employee. They appear woke, but are generally respectful to those who are not. They are continuously working on their processes that need work (constantly sending out surveys and requesting blunt opinions). They even have us actively working on self improvement and advancement, even if it's lateral.",There are no downsides... No cons!

COVID put all companies to the test and Salesforce reacted with their employees (and customers) first and still continues as the pandemic stretches on. I have been incredibly impressed at everything they have done and continue to do to make sure we still make money, keep our health and family life in mind, and over communicate so we know exactly what is happening inside and outside of the company. 
COVID aside, the people they hire are all really talented and a culture fit so you are working with incredibly smart people that want to help you succeed even if they don't benefit at all. I don't think I've run across one person yet that hasn't offered to help with anything I need now or in the future. 

The bar has been set incredibly high and I don't see myself making a move to another company anytime soon, even if I was offered more money. I am happy at my job and feel really supported and am encouraged to take breaks or days off to recharge.

The company’s focus on revenue has gotten far too large, they’ve cut budgets in all the wrong places; it’s seriously compromising our ability to deliver solid products and customer success resources to our customers - even the ones paying us millions of dollars.

No RSU’s for sales ( unless #1 rep ) 
New territories every year so you can’t build lasting  relationships.  Customers and AE’s are burned out from starting over every year. 
Territories are extremely small so either you make great money or your squeezing blood from a rock.  Favoritism is real.
Micro management due to monthly quotas ( even though you are comped on a quarterly / annual number ) 
Management makes you “play the game “ and create fake pipeline to ensure “activity” on dashboards. 
Cap overtime ( currently told zero overtime ) even though recruiters include this in their OTE package pitch when you take the job.  20-30% less bi-weekly pay because of it.  
Too many products with Co- Primes that do nothing and get compensated on your deals.  All you need is the Co- prime engineer to help. 
Too many layers in sales and management so it’s slow to get ahead quick.  Average 3-5 years to get to next position.
Every end of month is a fire drill. You feel the burnout during the holidays when you can’t take time off just to close the end of month ( even if you are comped quarterly / annually )"

Candid / transparent feedback is requested and promoted, but providing it isolates you and isn’t acted upon.

You will receive no support, will be constantly bullied by people who think they are the smartest in the room but have no idea how the companies they sell into actually work. Their only advice is “be strategic”, but leadership has no clue on what that even means. The group is run by politics.

Sr. Management is pretty disconnected with what actually goes on the ground. 

Middle management is huge popularity contest.

What bugged me this most is the preaching of diversity and inclusion, yet they constantly hire and promote a very disproportionate WHITE staff in their Sales org. Particularly evident in their Central teams. Very very few minority leaders and individual contributors are actually hired, retained, groomed for success, and promoted. It's almost as if they hire diversity to check a box for their board and shareholders? At the end of the day, yes, the best producers are rewarded, but if you're going to promote such values, at least walk the walk, because the company can definitely afford it."

Salesforce focuses on building programs, communications, trainings, and resources to support employees in a continuous way.",The cons are much like any company's during the times of COVID.

Constant shifting of priorities creates mountains of technical debt that is never paid down. Teams are not adequately staffed to handle extra load from other members going off on parental leave for months at a time. There is empire building happening at the senior management level that often results in career casualties for the people doing actual work.

1319,Salesforce,Best job I have ever had,2020-12-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"There is soooo much to know and learn about Salesforce, but they prep you well. Everyone in the company is more than willing to help you out when you need it and answer questions. Finding answers to questions yourself is quite easy. So many resources, you need to know how to work through those but at least the resources are there to be found which is all you can ask for!","Hard knowing it will take months before feeling really comfortable in the position but almost everyone does within a certain time-frame. No cons really to speak of, just good to note if you are the impatient type."
1320,Salesforce,Strong Innovative Company,2021-04-19,5.0,Vice President Product Management,"Great culture, training and career growth. Very focused on innovation and open to new ideas.",At the time there was a lot of travel and offsite meetings. As the company gets larger more red tape.
1321,Salesforce,Very well thought thru Org & true sense of family/Ohana,2021-01-20,5.0,Principal Memember of Technical Staff,"1) OHANA! When I was joining Salesforce from Microsoft, with over a decade of experience in the industry, I had doubts in my Mind - if what Salesforce claims about ""caring for employees"" - is it all real!? After being in the company for 6 months - I must say - oh boy! it is 200% real! Lemme fire an example: At my previous gig in a Cloud company - we had an excellent policy to take a break whenever we need. But, as most of the Cloud teams are always in FIRE - taking that day off and being able to disengage from work was really hard - esp. for someone doing inter team collaboration work - it was just super hard. Here - at Salesforce - they thought this thru & in addition to that ""you can take a break whenever you need"", they invented - wellness breaks - declared 1 day OFF a month - so that the entire org will take a day off - as a result of which - I truly am able to disengage from work and have my day off! Introducing policies - and going extra mile to really mean them - is a sign of honesty. 

2) MARKETING! SALES! In my previous gigs I worked for a couple of world class engineering teams. I know for a first hand - how it feels when we shipped a world class - truly distinguishing and ground breaking engineering product of that time & IT WAS NOT marketed at all! That was a very LOW point feeling. These old companies don't just understand - the need for telling people what we did! They assume that the world is following them :). At Salesforce - your engineering work is in safe hands - as most of the times - it is very much part of the plan & aligns with the bigger Company goals & will be marketed really well.

3) PROCESS! There are strong signs of process-oriented thinking every where. Right from my experience as a new joinee - the amount of information and processes they introduced to me during Onboarding to day-to-day work to creating every team to be a true round-the-world team - very well thought thru! Salesforce has scaled really well to this 50K+ employees sizes - because of these very thought thru processes - on which they continually iterate and make better!","1) TECH PERCEPTION! Salesforce in general is seen as a ""UI on a DB""! Most of the cool tech that happens in the company is unknown to the outside. Its almost like an enterprise suite - QUIP doc, Tableau for business reporting, CRM for sales, Marketing cloud, now the new SLACK for employee comms!

2) ACQUISITIONS! Acquisitions could sometimes bring in low quality code bases to hustle or integrate with!

3) 401K match is less when compared to FAMG."

The company truly INVESTS in its employees. You have opportunities to learn and make yourself more competitive not just internally but in the greater marketplace. Everyone wants you to succeed. 

Marc Benioff is an incredible CEO and such an anomaly in Silicon Valley. I've never witnessed a CEO that seems so in touch with the world around them. He's so approachable and truly cares about the greater impact that Salesforce has on the communities it serves. His investment in the environment is one of the things that really drew me to Salesforce, specifically the Benioff Ocean Initiative. He's not just another talking head in Silicon Valley.","It's obvious, but Salesforce is a giant tech company.

The pay is obviously very competitive. 

Also, during the pandemic, our CEO has been instrumental in helping other companies  by sharing information as well as shipping PPE from all over the world. They really act out their values of the 1:1:1 model, donations and fully supporting volunteerism/nonprofits.","Some of the onboarding was rocky for me as I’m a remote worker (in SFDO). This is pretty minor, but I think a major con is more systematic. As in there is so much information and resources but they’re not organized well most of the time (files and such).

While the work is challenging, I have the support to continue improving and reaching for my goals.",This is a company that attracts serious achievers and perfectionists.

1420,Salesforce,A company that TRULY cares about their employees,2020-09-18,5.0,Human Resources Analyst,"Salesforce's culture has consistently exceeded my expectations time and time again. Salesforce truly acts in the best interest of their employees, instead of only focusing on shareholders. This has become even more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Salesforce quickly and efficiently shifted to having all their employees work from home to protect their safety, began weekly company-wide calls with the executive leadership team so employees are always away of updates across the company during COVID, financially supported employees' home office setups, made numerous additions to the benefits plan to adjust to COVID-19, and continually prioritize employee wellbeing during all these changes.

Salesforce talked a lot about ""Ohana"" or ""family"" in my interviews, I'm so happy to say that culture they talk about to candidates is genuinely the culture we all get to experience day-to-day. It's everything I had hoped, and more!",No cons in my mind

The company despite its size is nimble and I have seen us changing our course quite quickly considering the size of Salesforce.
CRM may sounds boring but Salesforce has been able to make good use of all the latest technology in their vision and products to make the work super interesting.
Salesforce is so much more than just the Salesforce employees and products, it feels good to know we care about our partners, customers, users.","Salesforce is a big company and if you come from a startup, it takes a bit of time to adjust."

1434,Salesforce,"I love you, Salesforce, but we can do so much better! Employee Success I hope you read this :-)",2021-03-13,3.0,Lead Solution Engineer,"The 1:1:1 program and ERGs are what make the Salesforce experience unique. I've worked my way up from local hub lead to a global role this year, and it's been a game changer for me. I never thought of myself as a leader until I got this opportunity, so thank you, Salesforce!

I think it's also why the majority of employees are are not only talented, but great people (albeit predominantly white). 

The CRM technology works and it's super exciting to work at a company that's so innovative (even after 60K+ employees, countless acquisitions, and 21 years in the biz).

The benefits and pay are top notch (I love being able to pay my bills - hooray!)

C-Suite leadership that can acknowledge their mistakes (I'm lookin' at you, Brent Hyder!), and seem to genuinely want to make things better. I would also say the same about the leadership within my operating unit, for which I'm grateful, but that is not consistent throughout the company. 

If employee success actually reads this, I will totally list them as a pro (although the daily emails always make me smile, so I guess that's a pro as well).","I had a super rocky start at Salesforce and my experience is extreme but not unique: 

I had 4 managers within 15 months, starting 6 weeks into my Salesforce career (90% due to poor luck), and by the time I had my 4th I felt demoralized and completely incompetent. Personal brand is everything, and if you don't have a manager that's going to support you in this regard, you should start looking for another job. Thankfully lucky manager number 4 recognized how I was feeling and got me into a much better place. As of this year, I'm happy to say that I've never felt more supported or appreciated. 

Unfortunately, not every employee has the chance to turn things around, and get the Salesforce experience that the company sells. I fear that this is especially true for our employees that are not white dudes (not to say that they haven't had issues as well, but like many things in this world, the impact is disproportionately on our URM and female employees).

Over time we're putting fewer and fewer resources into customer success, and while it hasn't affected the business yet, it's only a matter of time.

Recruiting is a nightmare to work with - I've never had my referrals treated so badly, and it's so embarrassing, I've given up."

For everything you notate in Salesforce and Quip be prepared to discuss with 3 levels of management on all the details several times a month in a nonproductive meeting. We don't use Salesforce the way we sell companies on using Salesforce and it shows in our meetings that could have been a Slack update. Did I mention overbooked calendar?

Chatter is ridiculously distracting. So much activity and information thrown at you - I had to hide/ignore it.
Google slides are the worst. Bring on Microsoft Product Suite, that's what all our customers use and prefer.
You are shunned if you don't get a Mac. It's bad. (not a fan at all - prefer windows) Macs are way harder to set up a home office and a ridiculous amount of peripherals and cords needed compared to Windows based home office and connectivity."

1691,Salesforce,Smoke and Mirrors,2021-02-10,1.0,Account Executive,The Salesforce platform is amazing and so is the training that they provide that is usually onsite in San Francisco.,"The ""culture"" at Salesforce is extremely toxic. Everything that they do is purely lip service. Their work life balance? There is none. Diversity, do they make diverse hires? Sure, are you welcome into the office? No. How do they keep getting such great reviews? Take a look at the reviews, most of them are from employees that are 6 months or less. Right after you attend training(which is great) you are sent a survey to rate them on Glassdoor. You are on a high from training and have no idea what you have gotten yourself into yet so you give them 5 stars. Fast forward if you are an AE you are given your territory that has generated virtually no revenue from the year before or was oversold by the previous rep(you are then stuck with handling customer service issues due to poor implementation) and a number that is impossible to reach. Multiple times a week you are required to have a 1:1 with your manager to go over this territory where you are trying to make lemons into lemonade. Nepotism and favoritism runs rampant here. They allow other employees who have ""put in the work"" aka been there the longest to get the best territories and therefore they are hitting their number and eligible for promotions. The irony of this is that they are also tasked with training new employees where they have the attitude of "" pull yourself up by your bootstraps"". They are little to virtually no help because Salesforce fosters an environment where you personally have to be #1. Anything or anybody that could interfere with that is seen as a threat.  I could go on about how terrible of an experience this was for me and I also recognize that this isn't everybody's experience as well. However I would be lying if I didn't cringe every time I see articles talking about their next initiative."

5.  Great on-boarding for new employees.","1.  HQ/San Francisco based employees have best opportunities and benefits (Promotions, SF based employees only events, access to resourcing, etc).

SE pay varies based on Geography which can mean a paycut/non-competitive pay depending on where you live and where you were working before.

SE's are not paid commission for the quarter if they leave during the quarter. No pro-rated pay. Nothing. You just lose it. Only place I've worked where you give two weeks notice, they agree you can leave after a week because there is not reason to keep you aboard for the full two weeks, and they don't pay you the full two weeks.  While employed, the culture felt caring and inclusive, and not like a big company . When you're ready to leave, you get treated like it's a big company where you are just a number."

- Decent training",Do a quick search of Salesforce marketing spend compared to other big tech companies and you’ll see why working here is such highly touted. The company has shown its true colors during the covid pandemic. Impossible quotas as is with no quota relief during pandemic. BDRs are measured by how much Monopoly money they put into Salesforce and how buddy buddy they are with their AEs. The company says one thing to the press but treats its employees a completely different way. I have not felt any instance of “Ohana” since being here even though I was super excited to work for Salesforce. BDRs feel as if it’s them against the world at this company and have to deal with AE ego on a consistent basis.

However, the gap between the stated culture and what happens on a day to day basis is huge. I would describe this company as ruthless rather than ""Ohana"". 

In my experience, this company has some of the worst managers in the tech industry. Like the saying goes, people don't leave their jobs, they leave their managers, and that is certainly why I left.  

The environment is highly political and punitive. Favoritism is rampant, and the path to promotion is completely unclear and subjective. 

There is very little diversity among executives, aside from their token POC who runs the Equality group. 

Everything this company sells as strengths - their commitment to equality and diversity, their values, their culture - is just smoke and mirrors. They talk a good talk, but they don't walk the walk."

Promotions are political and unfair. Leadership has been telling their people that they are working on a fair and unbiased promotion process for years, but there is no proof that any work has been done.  

Management can often make employees feel like they are replaceable. I hate to break it to them, but smart/talented recruiters do not find Salesforce Recruiting a compelling enough organization to work for.  If leadership wants to retain people, they need to have productive conversations around succession planning and salary increases.  Salesforce Recruiters and Sourcers severely underpaid. 

Recruiting leadership preaches about how Salesforce is ahead of the game with URM (under-represented minorities) recruiting. In reality, it is nothing but a numbers game for them.  The more hires they make, the better they look in front of Marc Benioff. They've been so fixated on increasing the numbers, that they've completely forgotten the meaning/importance of having a diverse workplace.   How about we change the narrative from ""we need to hit our URM numbers every quarter,"" to ""lets think about the importance of cognitive diversity and thought."""

Idk where these people came from but they are micromanaging, unrealistic, unhelpful, insulting...like the list really goes on. Maybe my expectations were too high coming to this amazing company but there needs to be more training for leaders.
- Promotion process is terrible, you're expected to ""network"" to find any answers to anything and it ends up being a huge waste of time more often than not. And don't even think about leaving the sales org. Managers don't help and People across the company look down on BDRs. Also, the pay compared to other places is not good at all. $50K base in seat and after you promote to the next step. OTE increases in next role but not base salary no matter what you promo into.
- High metrics, low commission
- Like any other sales role, you are made to feel as though you are only as good as your numbers
- The metrics are INSANE. Everyone knows people are just BS'ing their way through bc the metrics are so unrealistic
- Work-life balance is horrible if you're actually trying to do your job the legit way and its high stress all the time despite whatever is going on in the world
- Snobby AEs that are selfish but no one cares if you're hitting your number"

1994,Salesforce,Top Company in Software Sales,2020-07-24,5.0,"Account Executive, General Business","Salesforce was the first to pioneer Saas, and is the leader worldwide today. This is a fantastic platform to sell, that is known universally, and is adopted for a reason. The product works, and it works well. This is a product that any AE can be confident in, and for me being confident in what I sell drives my success.

Further, Salesforce takes care of it's employees. I've been blown away by the pandemic response. Salesforce is not only a place that a strong AE can make a lot of money, it's a place you know where management stands. Salesforce management publicly came out and said there would be no lay-offs(there weren't), and pro-actively rolled out programs and incentives to take care of employees.

Salesforce is a place you can grow your career, and you can constantly learn. With all of the acquisitions, you can switch to a new product that interests you, or pivot into leadership.

I've worked a number of places in my career, and Salesforce is the best so far. There are absolutely downsides, which I get into below, but for me personally I plan to be here for the foreseeable future. Frankly, I believe in Salesforce's leadership team and strategy. We are making some incredible acquisitions and are positioned to be the undisputed cloud leader in ten years.","Politics. If you have only worked at small companies, big companies are a different beast. Salesforce, like any big company, has an element of politicking to it. At any company playing ""the game"" is important, so expect that here. 

Large quotas, and small patches. Salesforce has fine tuned territory management, and some ae's have stronger patches than others. It is important to succeed early and often so that you have the credibility to be assigned stronger accounts. New employees not willing to hustle and prove themselves do not last. This is how every big company is in my experience. If you don't have a ton of sales experience, make sure you start at a lower title with a larger territory. Big companies are harder to ""learn the ropes at"", as you are competing with the best of the best for things like territory.

Other than the above, Salesforce has been the best move in my career, and I'm thrilled and proud to work here. I've never found a place without the above cons, and the pros far outweigh them for me."

It allows for experimentation in process and areas for improvement, while considering the historical context of why something is the way it is. 
Being entirely remote (because of COVID) since beginning, there is good work/life balance. 
The company has given WFH Stipends for employees and has excellent communication in the form of All Hands meetings (very frequent) and email communications.
I feel respected for my experience, and not pressured on my performance. 
We are all in the same boat, so we all have essentially similar expectations.
The pay is good, as are the benefits (I expect would be better if work was in person). From what I understand, the promotion and salary reconsideration processes are fair and equitable.","There are a lot of processes in these roles that could be consolidated company-wide (or at least department-wide), that are not, which often times results in duplicate work or straying from the norm. Those processes need to be standardized. 
Sometimes it is hard to feel like a dialogue flows between colleagues, which is expected in an all remote environment, but a challenge nonetheless. The same goes for culture building, but efforts are being made, and I expect this to be more of a result of Remote work, and not the team/department. 
Processes often are overly complicated and should be assessed to whether or not they add value or could be simplified."

Management is very attentive to feedbacks and surveys, they discuss any negative found in process and attempt to address it. Folks are helpful, mostly transparent though there is a bit of that cast-system mentality in some folks. Management is not much tolerant to silos, they try hard to break those.","Intense at times. Silo breaking must go on. Process of getting approvals to push features is not basic. Context switching between projects, some shutdowns / restarts based on resources is pretty regular, at least in my org.

Leaders don’t care about their teams, they care about promotion and power. Leaders come from different companies with the intention to gain more visibility and status at salesforce. The company has been like that since 2018.

People are recognized and promoted by their “marketing” values ( increase salesforce portfolio in the media, increase number of customers, increase status of Marc B, etc) .

The company has stepped up and provided resources for self-case and encouragement to take care of ourselves, including PTO, remote work, etc.
- Compensations and benefits some of the best I've had in my long career
- Obviously, SFDC is a very profitable company, so I worry very little about the long-term viability of the company
- Before the pandemic when I went into the office, the workspace is excellent with snacks, a meditation room, etc.
- My team has been great to work with really open and collaborative, and many individuals outside my team have been willing to help me with advise or guidance","- Change management and communication is not Salesforce's strong suit -- this can sometimes cause internal friction, or even have negative customer impacts because folks who need to know about changes may be not in a loop
- Salesforce's approach and general attitude is very product, sales and marketing centric, which has been key to our success. However, for those of us who are in the services side of the business, the resources and enablement materials at our disposal is not as bountiful as they are, for say, SEs and AEs, so we not set up for success as much, making the job more difficult.
- While Salesforce often says they put the customer at the center of everything they do, those who are not customer facing sometimes lack the ability to put themselves in customer shoes, but those of us who do interact with customers rely upon other internal teams to make them successful, so often times the biggest challenge is navigating our massive organization and hoping you'll be able to get the attention of the person who can help, and hoping they have the resources and time to help your customer."

With our diverse product set, the list of what a CORE SE is supposed to know grows constantly with insufficient specialist support.  I'm a high performer in terms of ACV, but since our comp is more weighted towards team goals I'd rather have a life than have the extra few bucks.  I've been asking for help all year, but hiring hasn't kept up with attrition on the team so its getting worse rather than better.  I think management does care, but it takes so long to hire and onboard new SEs it takes 3-6 months to get any relief.  The promotion process is murky, leaving me wondering if its even worth it to do this.  The company says it cares about health and wellness, but Sales is a company within a company with its own culture.  In that culture ACV > everything."

Highly recommend.,"Not really a con as a thing to think about.  Working in open seating can be tough when the office is busy for some people.

Very few hit quota and they will not discuss the possibly of it being a lack of opportunity in the territory. 

As for the culture...it's not just that there's an extreme lack of diversity but also how they treat their few minorities. I've met so many people across the company in San Francisco, Toronto, Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Boston, New York, and Dallas. Black employees everywhere have had a bad experience here. It's really changed me mentally. I'm a very sociable person but since I came to Salesforce I've been very isolated. Yes, I've spoken with our HR but even black employees that worked in HR have said they have the same gaslighting experience. It's sad because I can tell that the majority (not all but those I've reached out to for help) aren't interested in change but they continue to push their values on ""equality"".

Mulesoft is a great add to help drive customer success.  Microsoft deal seems powerful. AI could be stronger (not sure voice is the game changer needed).  Simplify portfolio by removing sales and customer distractions with offering that are not meaningful to customers (including weak acquisitions).","Acquisition company and leaders were allowed to behave poorly on every level as well as financially perform poorly because of Product organization favorites.  Many ES and HR complaints were address by bullying the people filing complaints.  Leader literally called people filing reports ""names"" Then people filing complaints were targeted, monitored, told to leave if they could not handle it by Employee Success.

High pay, though they don't have as frequent stock refreshes as other large tech companies.","Sort of bizarre workplace environment & culture. I didn't see much in the way of manager training or ensuring that the right ICs were promoted to people manager roles. Annual reviews are in no-way transparent. You are assessed on a set of criteria that is not shared with you (either the criteria or the assessment results). My review was five minutes: ""You're doing great!"" There was no actionable feedback, stretch goals or written documentation for me to learn and grow from.  Leadership in my org very often resorted to bullying and openly shared negative feedback on their own peers with their reports. Several times while working there, I lost my engineering title due to re-orgs and was told that they ""didn't want to transfer headcount,"" so was left with only limited technical work to do for long stretches. And that's my biggest complaint - at least in my org, hard and innovative work was not championed but rather avoided in pursuit of very easy and short-term goals."

2236,Salesforce,Hardest job you'll ever have (in a good way!),2019-08-14,4.0,Account Executive,"- Amazing culture and collaborative team-selling mode (never win alone, always lose together!)
- Well-rounded corporate stance ranging from PTO, wellness, volunteering, philantrophy that stands out
- Marketing is amazing, very well funded and really helps drives sales cycles
- Constant innovation, R&D and acquisitions helps evolve the story and value proposition constantly for customers
- Truly a business-impacting company (i.e. not just trying to sell software), transformational capabilities
- Career Path is astounding, the ability to explore/try new roles as the company grows is a solid differentiator.","- Pace: simply put, the frenetic company growth is unsustainable.  At its peak, think of back-to-back 80 hour weeks, juggling 6 tasks at once, back-to-back meetings & calls to get the job done properly.  Annual quotas that continue to go up isn't something that go on forever, right?
- Management: The company is growing so fast, first-line managers are going to be the weakness that cripples this company.  Not saying there aren't good managers, but there are a lot of bad ones.  To fill the void, Salesforce hires externally (i.e. Oracle) who brings their less-than-desirable practice into Salesforce.  Lack of homegrown leadership is the company's biggest weakness, by far
- Customers get tired: We all hear our customers are tired of getting ""nickled & dimed to death"" because we keep on coming out with new features, new acquisitions, new bundles that cost ""only $xx more per user/month""."

2288,Salesforce,Great place to work - with caveats,2020-07-17,4.0,Program Architect,"Salesforce is a great place to work, for a lot of people a lot of the time. My perspective is mostly from consulting services/CSG, but there are some things that apply across the board.

-Excellent focus on work/life balance. Better than anywhere else I've found in terms of consulting or engineering jobs.
-Excellent salary. My title maps to ""senior manager"" level as an individual contributor, and all things considered I am extremely satisfied with it.
-Health insurance is excellent, in terms of coverage/cost/options. One of the better plans I've seen.
-401(k) is excellent if you're an investing wonk. The match tops out at $5k which is middle-of-the-pack, and the plan is through Fidelity (meh) with which you get a good selection of funds, but more importantly, BrokerageLink to invest in the wider markets, and the ability to contribute after-tax beyond the 402(g) limit and auto-convert to Roth with 1 phone call to set this up. This is relatively new in the marketplace, and still rare. Tl;dr is you can contribute as much as $52,000 to your plan for 2020 and characterize as Roth in the end, not $19,500, regardless of your age (research ""Mega Backdoor Roth""), which is a huge benefit for financial planning for highly-compensated employees.
-Working for Salesforce comes with a lot of cachet within the world of software vendors and partners, and access to awesome tools and information. If you've been a consultant or worked for an ISV and geek out to the product, you're going to love it here, and often be able to get involved with really interesting clients, projects, and internal initiatives shaping future product development.","I did say ""caveats"".

-RSUs are low as compared to FAANG and there are no refreshers - hence, there are a lot of boomerangs, and a reputation as a ""retirement home"", because there is no reward for working harder if you are not also trying to get promoted.
-Despite claiming to have a culture of open debate, it doesn't exist and there is seemingly no motivation to change this. For example, even though they say they will answer forum questions relating to the weekly allhands, they never do if it pertains to an internal policy. There is no upward feedback mechanism, except for your direct manager, and on many teams this is a ""player/coach"" who has no involvement in setting the policies of the department. There is an ""airing of grievances"" forum but it is heavily ""tone-policed"". Bottom line is that if you get stuck in a bad situation or team, your options are to change teams or leave, there is no opportunity to improve things from within.
-Silos and a lack of coordination result in many internally competitive and duplicative efforts, and inefficiencies. Product-wise there is crossover between Marketing Cloud and Pardot, Tableau and Einstein; and Vlocity/CPQ/B2B Commerce for example. Whatever's new and shiny (acquisitions and Dreamforce announcements) gets love, but if your area is not, good luck getting Trailhead modules or product management to prioritize new feature development. There are approximately 90 billion different efforts to create documentation for consulting resources for how to do their job, all run by different groups and stored on different platforms. And because Slack and Microsoft are viewed as competitors, there is no company-wide collaboration tool like Slack or Teams, it's just a bunch of incomplete tools like Google Chat and Salesforce Chatter and Quip and email and....
-There tends to be a lot of politics between teams, even beyond the product-related competitive/redundancy issues. 

In short, if you like what you're doing, and who you're doing it for/with, you're in a great position. But if you don't, you're going to have a bad time. I don't know anyone who was unhappy with their situation in Salesforce who subsequently made it better, at least without changing teams."

2303,Salesforce,"""Ohana"" is the real deal",2020-04-27,5.0,Mid Market Account Executive,"- Salesforce really sticks true to this ""ohana"" mindset. They really do go above and beyond for their employees

- Annual audits are done so nobody is underpaid and Salesforce will fix any discrepancies. The amount of transparency they give back to employees is exceptional

- The technology is incredible. I knew Salesforce was a tech giant before I got here, but I didn't fully understand their reach and portfolio. You hardly ever say no to client

- The speed at which things get done is astonishing. The product gets better every day

- Customer service is great, they really know what they are talking about which is refreshing

- The offices are what you would expect from Salesforce. Fully stocked with snacks, coffee, and sometimes food will be catered (not to common). If your office has an 'ohana' floor it is a really neat place to grab a cup of coffee or hold a client meeting

- The brand recognition is great. Everyone knows who Salesforce is.","- There are so many different places were information lives. Salesforce does their best to organize this, but there are too many different places to search. 

- You will never learn everything and at first it can seem overwhelming. It is great to rely on your SE's, but with so many different products it can feel impossible to manage

- It goes without saying, but Salesforce only hires the best. You are expected to work extremely hard. I always feel like the dumbest person in the room which isn't a con per se. If you are looking for a ""comfy"" sales job this is not it for you.

- Getting a hold of people can be difficult. Calendars are always filled and not everyone is sitting in front of chat. You need to be patient waiting on resources"

2312,Salesforce,"Great company, but come in with similar experience",2020-03-24,4.0,Account Executive Growth Business,"Everything you have heard about Salesforce is true.  It is a great company to work for. My co-workers were wonderful people, super helpful, and genuinely wanted each other to succeed.  There is a culture of feedback. I always felt like I was in a safe space with my manager and could speak candidly.","It seemed like the good old days of slingin software at Salesforce is suspended for the time being. The market is saturated with the customers left over that DO NOT want to move away from their homegrown or preferred systems. Or they do, but can't get there personally to change their whole company's way of doing things; OR the company's employees stage a revolt and flat out refuse to use the software the owners are about to buy. If you don't mind that internal struggle of, why in god's name aren't these people getting it, then you will do fine.

I was in the Quarterback position and regret that decision. DEFINITELY, go in as a Specialist IF you are hired as an outsider. (Meaning you have had a successful run at other sales jobs and didn't 'grow up' at SFDC as a BDR) Reason being, you will be able to focus on your one solution to learn the ins and outs of it. Granted Specialists will have some of the same responsibilities as Quarterbacks.

Working here IS A LOT. That's the only way to describe it. As a Quarterback, you are: managing the deal, which consultant to introduce the customer to or which consultant they already have, internal SFDC Specialists and team for your manager/BDR/Solution Engineer/Service Specialist/Marketing/Pardot/ECommerce/and literally every possible solution they have or will acquire down the road. You will need to memorize enough of each to know when to pull in those Specialists and be able to sell the idea of exploring this other solution to the customer.

All awhile you as the new hire that didn't 'grow up' in SFDC have to learn all the actual products and be a technical expert for the customer.  Your current customers will ask you technical questions and THERE IS NO ONE TO SEND THEM TO. Now, I don't mean this literally but there isn't much support for the customers unless they pay for it. They will have to wait for standard tech support to get back to them in 48 hours. And in that time, YOU are the person they are asking to solve it for them but you have no idea because you are not the technical expert and either give answers you humanly can or put them off until support gets back to them. This happens a lot and is not a one off situation.

Oh and then you have to go back to that customer the following week and ask them to enter into an evaluation for xyz tool that will solve xyz need that they most likely don't have or have been asked many times before by other reps. 

Every month, you have to visit your customers in territory, whether they want you to or not. There is definitely evidence that meeting your customers in-person and getting that face time puts you in a better position to really make a difference in their business. But, it matters what type of territory you have. Long-term customers and 1-3 year old customers are not the best. Either they know what SFDC can do for them and are tapped out on what they need/want. Or the newbies had horrific and borderline criminal implementations that they can't justify any more expense on a system that wasn't implemented correctly or not even in use yet. The push for monthly visits makes sense, when it makes sense....

Finally, your previous experience will make you. Have you worked before in a ""team selling"" environment? Have you sourced consultants? Team Selling here is on steroids and can involve eight to nine people internally. Consultants are your Partners for winning deals and sometimes they are the reason you lose or delay deals. If you get a deal delayed, then you will be blamed for not managing your Partners. Similar experience will bolster you but if you have done well other places that lack the consultant piece or steroid team selling activity, then that is just another thing you will have to learn on top of everything else.

It was a great experience and this is definitely not to dissuade anyone. More so for those hired in directly into a sales role. This is what you need to know before starting. 

Good luck :)"

2334,Salesforce,#Dreamjob Not Always,2020-06-11,3.0,Program Analyst,"Quality work/life balance - This is baked into the benefits and culture. Although, you need a manager that actually supports this for you. If you have that it is great but, when you don't it can feel defeating. Personally, I have experienced the good and the bad with this. 

Training - Trailhead is a wonderful tool that provides a great introduction to many products/services. It's self-guided and you can pursue what interests you at your own pace. 

Time off to volunteer - Again a great benefit but, your manager has to be supportive of your endeavors. Employees are encouraged to give back using the 1/1/1 model. On one hand you are praised if you meet or exceed the number of hours you give back. If you don't have a manager or a team that does a lot of volunteer work, you might be criticized or singled out for ""wasting time."" 

Free Snacks - This is nice when you need a 3:00 snack or can't get out for lunch. 

Access to great perks - Wellness activities, a gym, workout classes, a benefit you can use to pay for massages. Unlimited vacation time, sometimes free tickets to events.","""Diversity"" - There's a good lip service but, the reality is that upper management is mostly white. Until there is massive change in how recruiting and cultivating talent happens in the tech industry white guys are going to begat more white guys. Chances are pretty good they don't have friends or connections who are POC. This also holds true from people who come from other tech companies. When rats jump the ship they tend to bring other rats with them. 

Not so subtle hints that you have to hold a ""right"" set of beliefs/values - you have to get onboard or made to feel like an outsider. If you question or don't hold a certain 

The idea that Salesforce can save the human race - Salesforce is an innovative tech company with products and services that help customers do business. Be that! While SF is the biggest and holds a huge marketshare, it has created this idea that it can somehow save the world. 


Surrounded by lots of people who don't actually work with you - there are some teams that have a larger representation in certain hubs but, if you have a team that is largely based in one hub it can get lonely being surrounded by people who are largely irrelevant to your daily work life. It can also infringe on W/L balance. 

Ohana seating - Gross. Everyone needs their own desk and space.


""Data Driven"" - Sometimes translates to manipulating for personal gain and benefit."
2335,Salesforce,"Great for People Early in their career, not for veterans",2020-08-14,1.0,Senior Manager,"I spent a number of years there and, in the earlier years 2012 - 2016 it was full of potential and promise. Opportunities to grow and try new things for people with 15+ years work experience. The social responsibility and commitment to Ohana culture seemed really enticing. But a bit of a sham and Salesforce taught me that work shouldn't be a ""family"" because the most dysfunctional social units are typically families.","As time progressed, it grew more and more ugly. The unintended consequences of growth saw people who were completely incapable of managing themselves leading large teams and even divisions (with the leaders who hired them scared to fire them and admit their failure of promoting them). People who were, frankly, not prepared for the role were given Manager, Sr. Manager, Director, Sr. Director, and VP roles. Towards the end of my time there I spent most days preparing slide decks (apparently VPs can't read anything but slides) and writing scripts for a Senior Vice President who would need to be coached on what to say at meetings to his superiors. Incompetence hires incompetence and quickly tries to root out anyone who questions that. The spirit of the company got lost at some point along the way and now it is more a holding tank for some of the most mediocre people who happen to have extremely high opinions of themselves. This company is often thought of as an innovative company, but it really runs like a government bureaucracy (I have experience in government) where everyone walks around talking and acting a little like the Stepford wives. But very little gets done. There are a few teams who have good leaders that run really well, but most don't. There is a remarkable amount of fear within the company when it comes to speaking up and trying to tackle hard truths. If you are good at your job and do good work, stay away from Salesforce."

In always being flexible, easy to discuss my concerns with and available to assist via text, email or voice, my questions were answered and clarification provided when requested. The expedient manner in which I was introduced to Salesforce and walked through the recruiting, interviewing and onboarding process stood out from other IT companies making all the welcoming difference.

A few recent hires in very senior management in ANZ (incl. Pip, Ian) have been received positively.","Your experience here will completely depend on your direct manager and reporting line - and that's a very mixed bag of people. There is a lot of ego at play in some leaders and a total lack of EQ/empathy - be sure to interview your manager through the hiring process. There is nothing as demotivating as a sales manager who doesn't have basic leadership skills or self awareness.
They have over hired Account Executives as they believe that this will drive limitless growth in the region. Result being that everyone has territories that are too small to give them a reasonable chance at succeeding. Attainment is poor even from those who have been with the business a number of years and have been successful in their previous roles. This DOESN'T stop huge amounts of pressure being placed on each individual to hit pipe gen and sales targets (even during COVID).
Very few people have hit their quota or anywhere near it in the last few years. 
5-7 years ago this probably would have been a great place to work but it has changed considerably since then.
People don't trust the anonymous feedback surveys so the business doesn't understand the huge amount of grumbling that is happening behind the scenes. AEs are unhappy and many are looking elsewhere. But management also does its best to make you fearful about leaving in order to keep you in place to avoid more turnover.
They made most of their customer success group redundant last year.
Aside from COVID, there seems to be a major aversion to letting people work from home which to me highlights that there is a lack of trust in their people. Some management speak down to their team like they are children.
Very few female leaders in the sales team - not sure the organisation is honestly asking themselves why this is? People talk the talk about diversity because it's a SFDC value but that's not necessarily how they really think or execute. I don't even think most of them are capable of thinking outside their own experience."

Overtime pay","During my time here, I've witnessed countless examples of discrimination and inappropriate comments from management, specifically my manager. This behavior is accepted. Salesforce is not a company that welcomes open, honest dialogue and feedback. If you disagree with management in any way, expect retaliation.

There are people in management positions who have no business being there. When you have questionable leadership, it causes many issues and problems that go unnoticed. In my case, I was subjected to report to someone who lacks the basic qualities a good manager must have: empathy, understanding, active listening, patience, strong communication, transparency, and loyalty to your team. Don't expect any of those qualities in many of the managers at Salesforce. The managers here continue to ""kick down and kiss up"" to get to where they are today. My manager lacked maturity, basic professionalism, and self-awareness . He has said some derogatory things about women, made incredibly inappropriate comments on team calls, and speaks to some of the females on his team in such a brash, disrespectful manner. It did not help that the person he reported to, the next manager in the line of management, was inherently cold and disconnected. 

I have never seen such self-serving managers in my professional career. The recruiting managers and leaders will never have your back. Example: If a candidate feels as though he/she should have gotten a job they interviewed for and chooses to retaliate against the recruiter ( example: write a bad Glassdoor review and name you), recruiting leadership will reach to place blame on the recruiter. Bad Glassdoor review = bad for the brand and the ""brand"" is #1 priority at Salesforce. EVERYTHING that is done at this company is done as an effort to strengthen their brand. It's all for show. All they care about is being perceived as ""a company that cares"" with an ""Ohana"" culture, when in reality, it is all about optics and concealing an incredibly abusive, toxic culture. 

Be prepared to also have a manager that takes credit for your success. You did well because they ""set you up for it"" and ""coached you."" (During my entire time there, I have never learned anything valuable from my first line manager - with the exception of what kind of manager I will not be one day)

Recruiting here is a factory. It's all about pumping out hires quarter after quarter and hitting an arbitrary hiring number at any expense, even if you have to bend the rules a bit. Example: having people have start dates when they're still employed at their current employer, pressuring sales candidates to start immediately without giving a notice period to their current employers and using manipulative tactics like saying ""If they really want this job, they will make it happen""...etc.

Salesforce hires most - if not all - recruiters on contract first. They reassure you that the contract thing is just a Salesforce formality and should you be a perform well, you will be converted in a year or less. I saw first-hand a couple of very high-performing recruiters get let go simply because they refused to play the ridiculous political game that is expected of you. 

Recruiting here is a rat race and lacks any nuance or creativity. As a recruiter, you do not have a voice or opinion. You are a sheep in the herd following the leaders. The ""leaders"" only care about branding, how the company is perceived, and how they themselves look to their leaders. They care very little about the actual recruiters doing the work. Recruiters are at the very bottom of the totem pole. If you hint at any disscontempt with your role, team, manager, company - you will be shunned. 

I can't speak for all of the recruiting teams and the entire company, but this is my honest feedback about Sales Recruiting at Salesforce. I wanted to provide honest feedback to future candidates who are considering leaving full-time roles for this often unpleasant role. If you choose to, use this as a resume booster if you're trying to break into the tech industry and then get out. Understand that the behavior you will witness there and the treatment you will likely receive is not okay. This is not how respectable companies operate. There are so many better opportunities at other SaaS companies where you will be treated with dignity and respect."

2433,Salesforce,Good company for benefits and salary but promotion process and transparency is still very vague and biased.,2020-11-07,4.0,Director,"Reasonably good benefits, global presence, and good market position",A lot of bureaucracy with the expansion in employee size. Losing its core Ohana values rapidly.
2434,Salesforce,Great company that cares for its' employees,2020-11-15,4.0,Member of Technical Staff(MTS),"Pros include:
* fair compensation
* great benefits
* great growth opportunities",Perhaps the fact that everything is written in Java and you have to use sometimes very old tools for certain problems
2435,Salesforce,"Mostly positive experience, even after my role was eliminated",2020-04-02,4.0,Technical Producer,"There are a lot of perks of working at Salesforce, at least for my role. I had the option of working from home and many people in my role did so as well. The office has open (""Ohana"") seating to accommodate that. This suited my personality well but if you prefer face-to-face meetings with your team members, this might be a negative for you. Throughout my time at Salesforce I had coworkers and managers that lived in different states than me. Which is fine nowadays considering all the virtual meeting options. There are free snacks and drinks in the break room. If you become a parent while at Salesforce, you have the option of taking up to 6 months paternity leave at 80% pay, which is outstanding at least by US standards. I never ended up taking the full 6 months for either of the kids I had while employed at Salesforce, I guess out of a dumb sense of duty to my coworkers and Salesforce. Don't do what I did. Take the full 6 months and don't regret it. I enjoyed all the people that I worked with and I had the opportunity to work with a lot of big name accounts. Overall I thought it was a positive experience. My role was eliminated which is why I had to leave Salesforce. I was not happy about it but they were very generous. After my role was eliminated and my role responsibilities were taken away, they continued to pay me for two months while I looked for internal and external opportunities. I was able to find another opportunity outside of Salesforce prior to the end of the 2nd month. Had I not found another role, however, they would have given me a generous severance package in addition to what I had already been paid. I would imagine that is a lot more than most other companies would do.","My role (and other roles in my part of the organization) became very specialized over time, which I assume to was to help with efficiency in client work. But it also meant that I was doing a lot of the same tasks over and over again. I found there was little opportunity to branch out to take on responsibilities of other roles or to learn another role. I knew several people who left Salesforce because they became frustrated at their lack of advancement. People in my role also had a billable utilization goal of 36 hours a week. If you did not have that much time billable, it was seen as an issue. But you are not always in charge of how much work you had or what work was available. Which is true of many businesses, I know. Also, if you wanted to take time off, you needed to find a backup (or multiple backups) to take on your account work while you are out. Which can be difficult if everyone is trying to work 36 billable hours a week. And you had to train them if they had never worked on your account before. So taking time off was a chore, at least for my role. I ended up taking only maybe 2 weeks off during a year. I regularly hit my cap of 300 PTO hours and stopped accumulating PTO. And the billable utilization goal was pushed so much that they started tying it to the quarterly bonuses. In the end, it didn't end up meaning much because my role was eliminated even though at the time I was regularly billing 36+ hours a week.  Ultimately, I would preach to not drink the Kool Aid. They preach that everyone that works there is part of the ""Ohana"" and is family but don't buy it. This is probably not new to a lot of you, but it's just marketing. They are a business first. They don't really care about you. You have to look out for yourself first and foremost. If you start buying into it even just a little bit, that's when you don't take as much time off as you should or don't take your full 6 months of paternity leave out of some sense of obligation to the ""Ohana."" Take advantage of everything they give you down to the last PTO hour because they will happily discard you without hesitation when they don't see value in you as an ""Ohana"" member any longer. If you feel stagnant in your role, use your free work time to help yourself or get out of there because they will not help you take another role."

-Prioritizes engaging employees by aligning personal career goals with each employee's duties and encouraging movement between functions and departments throughout the company

-Incredibly intelligent workforce: Salesforce is able to use its strong brandname to hire only the top talent and as a result has an environment where you are constantly challenged and learning, which continuously develops your own skill set.  (Less than 1% of applicants receive employment offers)

-Strong community environment: Salesforce has been able to build a corporate family unlike any company I've been a part of before.  People honestly care for each other and will go out of their way to look out for past and present employees.

The three T's applies here... Territory, Timing and Talent. Salesforce deliberately assign miniature territories and switch them up annually. It forces reps to be hungry, desperate even when you only have a year to close the account. Heaven forbid one of the two accounts that you are assigned goes bankrupt/is acquired/has a spending freeze that year... you're going to sit on the sidelines for a year and hope that you get a decent account the following year in the 'Carve'. If that doesn't work out... you're gone. I've seen literally dozens of top performers getting turfed due to this circumstance. Sales is a rough game sometimes and it's brutal at Saleforce.

Team members, management, and overall company culture are very supportive. Management will set you up to succeed by providing all the resources, trainings, and other tools needed to make it to ""get to the next level"" and advance your career. I personally have no immediate plans to switch teams because I currently love the work that I am doing right now.

I have seen people easily move across different teams and organizations (lateral and vertical) within Salesforce without issue. This is important to those that want to eventually work on different projects/teams/technologies within the company.

The company promotes a lot of volunteering for employees and is consistently active within the community. It's recommended and encouraged for employees to volunteer and give back and they set a side a large amount of VTO (Volunteer Time Off) for you to do so. I absolutely love this because volunteering makes such a big impact to those in need.

You are treated with dignity and respect working here. I have never come across any issues while working here but there is always an open channel to communicate with management (direct management or other management) if you do encounter anything.

Senior management is very honest and transparent during meetings/emails/town halls, ect. with what is going on within our organization and company as a whole.


Besides all of the stuff mentioned above, there are:

- Excellent Work/Life Balance (I've never worked a weekend, I get off on time each day, and have never felt any stress while working here) . All of our work as a team is consistently completed by the deadlines too!

- Unlimited opportunities to learn and grow your career with tools/resources readily available. (The company promotes enablement and provides you with a bountiful of resources to get to where you want to go in your career) It's just up to YOU to activity take initiative and take advantage of them!

- You have the ability to take Professional Led Salesforce Certification classes for free

- Tuition Reimbursement
- Commuter benefits
- ESPP
- Amazing health insurance packages
- Awesome views from the top of the Salesforce Tower
- Ability to work from home every now and then (varies from team to team and role)
- Baristas available in the main buildings to provide free handcrafted coffee and tea
- Professional Chef's making food at the top of the Salesforce Tower and in Salesforce East
- Arcade games, pool tables, ping pong tables, foosball, 
- Various ERG Groups to join (they do a lot of events that are fun and good for the community)
- Social groups to join (Board games, video games, camera clubs, exercise/workout classes)
- Lots of comfy sofas/lounge chairs
-  Access to the Salesforce Park
- Awesome holiday parties!!!
- HUGE Dreamforce event every year (Really fun and informative)

If you can suck up to your manager you can get all your perks. 
Some teams to prove themselves, try to step in other teams projects and take over and send them out. 
Some managers think their reports should work like their servants and should not express their opinion, too much partiality.
When teams move under different managers, this becomes rampant.  
Managers from certain ethnicity have very less opinion on women workers. Have seen several emotional incidents several times. 
I am sure this is going to become big in coming days as SFDC is becoming a giant. 
Not many women workers in management positions.
Sr. Mgmt is worse as they don't know technical issues at all.

Employee Success is a joke at this company.  It was total chaos trying to get anything done with way too many cooks in the kitchen.

If you're an older employee, don't expect any of your previous work experience to mean anything. If it didn't happen at Salesforce, it didn't happen at all.

Compensation is definitely lower than the other big tech firms in San Francisco.

Then as time went on, I realized it was all fake. The marketing team makes you believe that everything is perfect even when it's not. There is no way to move up even though people say you can. You will be promised one thing then later told the opposite. To move to a different role internally you have to move to a position of the same level or below, you cannot go up (called diagonally) in another department. Even if you make it happen, they keep you at the same pay and level for 6+ months so you will do more work for the same pay. There is NO INCENTIVE TO STAY!! I have known so many people who leave for this reason, then come back a year or so later 3-6 grades higher with better pay and benefits. Recruiters love that because they say it shows how great the company is that people come back, they could have saved themselves time and money by just promoting or transferring the person to the place they wanted to be at. My manager left after a few years and then they hired someone externally who had NO MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE EVER!!! He was the worst manager I have ever had by far, he was rude, disrespectful, sexist, inappropriate, and completely useless. I was appalled at the way he treated his employees and when I brought it up to HR they basically said I couldn't prove it. Then other employees from a completely different department witnessed him scream at people and they went to HR and still the case was closed because ""lack of evidence"". Several employees were asked to work overtime without pay  which is illegal for hourly employees. When I told my bosses boss that I was leaving, they offered me a promotion, but I would have had to move cross-country, and I was told there was no budget for moving costs, so I would pay them all on my own. As for salary, since it was a ""cheaper cost of living"" that there would be no increase. I laughed at this insulting offer to work more, have more responsibility and no increase in money while moving cross country. I declined the offer and they were somehow shocked. I left and never looked back, I am so much happier now that I left."

2648,Salesforce,Unfocused and lacks integrity.  Some nice people,2020-03-09,2.0,Technical Instructor,"Most people in Salesforce are genuinely nice people.
Very nice benefits package
Generous pay","It does not pay to have integrity at this company. You'll do well if you can smile and say ""everything is fine"" while the building you're in is actively burning to the ground.
I was sent on multiple interviews for a position within the company in a department that I wanted to transfer to before being told they would not actually hire me and were just sending me on the interviews for reasons completely unknown to me.  To be clear, there was a hiring freeze already in place and they STILL wanted me to interview more with no actual plan to hire/transfer me.
The ""Family First"" policy is garbage.  They said this motto about a million times when I worked there. When I needed it so I could care for my family member (My fiancee needed major back surgery),  I was told this would not be a problem, was later told this was a major problem and she wasn't family, and then, after we got married, no one checked to see what I said about us being married was true.  To be clear, Salesforce wanted to tell me who could be my family but then didn't care if it was actually true in the end.  I could have lied and had the wedding we actually wanted and had been planning, instead of rushing to get married at the courthouse so I could get the leave and she could get the surgery on schedule.  
There doesn't seem to be a strong decision-making process. I was sent on retreats I didn't need to go on to hang out with people I never saw or communicated with while I needed to be at home to handle important matters. I was told this trip was imperative and I couldn't miss it. When I got there, no one knew what the trip was for and it turned out to just be drinking and games and a pep rally or two.  A complete waste of valuable time."

Even if you have been a seller for 30 years, one full year at Salesforce will elevate your game. You will leave here a far better seller than when you arrived. Their operational expertise, sales execution, deal inspection, etc., are better than anyone in the business (for now). 

I've worked with some of the smartest people I ever have in Enterprise software. Imagine the top 10% of the sellers at your current company.  Now imagine that the entire Salesforce sales organization consists entirely of that top 10%.  Yeah, that describes the intensity.","The executive leadership team at Salesforce exemplifies the values they espouse and  they truly believe that the world can be changed by business. Unfortunately, the values that are core to our belief system (doing what's right for the customer, trust, etc.) do not filter down to the actual sales process. There's a tendency to encourage customers to do things unnatural to their buying process, all in the interest of making the month. 

You will subjected to immense pressure here. The company, to their credit, has tried to emphasize wellness with meditation rooms in each office, etc. But much like volunteer time off, I know very few sales people that have time to enjoy those perks outside of offsites.

With only 50% of AEs exceeding plan, your success depends entirely on timing and territory. AEs who have not missed their number in years come to Salesforce only to fail because the alchemy involved in assigning quotas. There's a reason why so many AEs turn over after less than 2 years.

Get in with the inner circle (decision makers) and you're golden. Salesforce talks a lot about Ohana, even setting their top method/ measure as ohana - but as many other reviewers mentioned. It's all smoke and mirrors. The culture is cut throat and people help you if they think you can help them in the future. There's no sense of boundaries or work life balance.

So do my colleagues.","Underneath the facade, Salesforce is focused on perception more than reality. VTO isn't volunteer time off at all. It's voluntold time on-top (of existing work load) for most of the company. We have targets for VTO set, but many business units aren't staffed appropriately to actually take the time off. Instead it's just adding work load on top of our existing work load. Also, the company really exemplifies the wealth gap, with those at the top heavily rewarded with expensive trips, awards (including cars, watches, etc.) while the majority of the company is paid somewhere around the 75th percentile of industry.

Which for a bigger company is a huge perk.","Their core codebase is a nightmare to develop on. 30 minutes of build time to just fail out due to a minor build issue. And just because tests pass locally doesn't mean they will pass in the remote build, and you won't find out for 4 hours if you are lucky.

The pay is pretty decent for the market, and generally speaking in a lot of teams you can expect good work-life balance.","On the other end, there are some incredibly toxic and incompetent leaders who seem to have the top leadership in their pocket, and so they make everyone else miserable. My department suffered a lot because of such a leader. It didn’t just impact people, but also the business bottom line. And the company is losing money because of that leader.
I have seen other reviews, where some HR person responds empathetically and encourages people to come forward to them “so that your concerns can be addressed”. Please don’t do that. I have gone to that very person before I left the company, with mountains of documentation regarding the dysfunction, and the absolute disregard for ethical concerns. They flat out refused to take action, even after acknowledging that very serious mistakes were happening. They went on record to say that since nothing could be proven in a court of law, they “don’t need” to do a thing - so much for “Ohana”. Not just that, they didn’t keep my complaint anonymous, and the very people who I was complaining against, now had all power to openly punish me.
The top leadership is very much aware of this department and it’s troubles. They do nothing. At the same time they keep talking about how other FAANG companies are such awful places to work, while ignoring their own backyard. If I had any time to waste, I would make my experience public and let public opinion decide if Salesforce walks the walk.
I lucked out that I saw the true side of this company and how they dealt with issues. I was considered a great performer, and had no trouble finding another job with a higher scope of responsibility - so it’s completely not my loss to have had to leave Salesforce."

2827,Salesforce,Tough on Working Parents,2017-07-05,3.0,Director,"Many things are great about Salesforce, in particular Marc's vision and passion for equality.   Benefits are excellent.","The senior most managers at GM, 
EVP, SVP levels do not seem to align with the Ohana value which should include employee family obligations.   I am part of a small group of women key or sole household earners who are also trying to be active parents.  Several of us have been told that leaving early (to pick up my kids) is impacting our ability to be successful.  While no one comes out and says ""you cannot pick up your kids""  you do get labeled and viewed as someone that does not work hard. This in despite of being on calls and on line at all hours (after kids are fed dinner and before they wake up).   Working parents are part of creating a great culture - we should not be viewed as substandard for doing work and life."
2828,Salesforce,So proud to be a part of the Salesforce family,2019-07-12,5.0,Senior Manager,I was working as a contractor at Salesforce for several years and was very impressed with the company culture.  They have an incredible sense of inclusion and really value their employees.  The work/ life balance is incredible and there is a lot of management encouragement to spend time with the family.,I can't think of any cons... it's likely the most rewarding company that I've worked with.
2829,Salesforce,Just another cog in the tech machine. You don't matter.,2020-01-02,1.0,Executive Assistant,"Benefits, meeting other unhappy colleagues who helped me during my terrible experience at Salesforce","Another tech giant trying to spread the company culture kool aid but doesn’t recognize or address terrible leaders and managers or self appointed “lead EAs”. Very toxic, backstabbing politics going on amongst executive assistants which creates an entire group of disgruntled, distrustful, and power hungry EAs and makes most EAs carry a bad reputation at Salesforce. 

Execs and managers who have EAs: some of them need serious management training and learn how to treat everyone under them fairly. This was by far some of the worst treatment I’ve ever seen from an exec who had an EA. Micromanaging, having other people spy on the EA and report back to him about the EA's whereabouts and movement.. The EA was treated like a prisoner. 

Also, there are some EAs who support C-level people and they act as if they are the exec's themselves. They wield their execs' status for their own power and control over others. It's ridiculous and I don't know if the execs who have EAs even know that their EAs are doing this. I hated working with any execs who had EAs. It was always a massive hinderance to my work progress. I don't understand Salesforce and the EA culture.. some are really great EAs but some are terrible and unfortunately they are the EAs at the top.. usually supporting SVP and up. 

I wouldn’t buy into their culturally appropriated “OHANA” and other Hawaiian sayings. It’s all a facade."
2830,Salesforce,So close but when you work for wall street you take it in the pants.,2019-08-26,3.0,Account Executive,"Culture wise this is one of the best companies I have ever worked for.  The people are great and their is a real team environment.  People really want to help and do the best for the team and the customer.  I've never seen another company close to this.  Salesforce also follows a model that donates 1% of revenue, 1% of time and 1% of product to charity.  As an employee, I get 5 days of Volunteer Time Off and charitable donation matches.  It's also super easy for me as an employee to get that match and log VTO time.  Salesforce is setting the bar in this space along with Patagonia.  Salesforce is also trying to be sustainable and is a carbon-neutral cloud. .  No other company can say that.  Compensation aside this company is a 7 on a scale of 1-5.","That said the compensation is a quagmire of BS.  First you can already expect an OTE significantly less than what is the norm in the industry.  Worse still is the 40 acts of vaudeville to figure out if you will get paid, if you get paid and what amount they base it on.  We are out there saying use Salesforce as your system of record and every month my Xactly has little similarity to my sales in Salesforce.  Come on, guys.  Let's not be hypocrites!  Then when you think it can get no worse there is a virtual rubics cube of ways you lose ACV or see $ clawed back.  You have to be an accountant to figure out if you can sell to an account and retire quota.  It's ridiculous how many times, in a short time I have not gotten the full value of my sale due to some arbitrary attrition I was not even aware of as a co-prime.  Do you want me to sell or do you want me to audit the accounts to see if I can retire quota with a sale?"

2838,Salesforce,Good but can be better,2020-02-18,4.0,Member Of Technical Staff,Salesforce company as a culture is very good and there are lot of things which encourages employees to feel inclusive,on-boarding process needs a overhaul and the psychological safety depends on team to team.
2839,Salesforce,Excitement and opportunities for those who are driven and lean toward positivity,2014-11-04,5.0,LMTS,"Overall, the company culture seems very open and encourages honest self-reflection, but there's definitely a bias toward people who are naturally positive and seek opportunities. If you're a team-focused, positive, cheerful, driven person, this is a company where you can make huge strides in a very short amount of time.","First, it's NOT a startup, and while the company seems to have a great future ahead, it's not a fast-growth place where you're going to get catered meals, massages, and toys to play with every day. This shouldn't be a problem, but since the HQ is in San Francisco, people are reminded of all the perks and opportunities that abound just around the corner (or in Silicon Valley). Also, while the company is a great place to work, it tends to favor extraverts and people who desire to move up or who want to do lots of things outside their current job role. Being surrounded by ""movers"" like this can be exhausting if you're one who wants to be ""comfortable"" and seeks to achieve work-life balance."
