0,ServiceNow,"Fantastic Company Culture, Structure, and Values!",2021-11-29,5.0,Advisory Solution Consultant,"Culture truly feels at the centre of leaders' priorities, creating a positive and motivating place to work. The company is successful, and there is a real sense of teamwork to continue achieving great results and recognising team/individual success stories.","Growing so quickly it is easy to feel like a small cog in a fast-growing company. I'd say this is managed very well, but a real risk if not consciously addressed going forward (i.e. ensuring people have a purpose, support network, pathways to grow)."
1,ServiceNow,Great place to work,2022-03-31,5.0,Senior Staff Technical Writer,"Great diversity, engaging work, flexible hours",Work to life balance not always as it should be.
2,ServiceNow,Great place to be,2022-03-07,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"(My experience relates to the San Diego campus in Software Engineering)

I really enjoy working at SN, people are nice, the work is interesting and challenging. I've had very busy weeks but also some very light weeks. It seems WLB varies teams to teams but from my experience it has been good, and usually take more than 4 weeks for vacations per year. Company always has been remote friendly but since the pandemic it has been remote first. With that comes the good and the bad. If you like WFH, then this is great!

ServiceNow has tremendous future opportunities and if the execution keep on being successful, the quick growth will continue.","We have a big campus in India, although I always had good experiences working with colleagues over there, if a project needs fast paced collaboration you are needed to have meetings really early morning or late evening (California - India time difference)
Avoid being on those projects if that's not your cup of tea!

On the Engineering side, I've only worked on Platform teams but talking with folks from application teams it seems like working on the platform is more interesting/challenging. If you're looking for that, I'd go for Platform."
3,ServiceNow,Drinking from the fire hose is no joke,2022-03-24,3.0,Senior Manager,"The culture is real - the intensions, the care from leadership and the drive are all 100% ingrained in the ServiceNow DNA.","Drinking from the fire hose is no joke - I was told this over four years ago when I interviewed and the same applies today. Leadership pivots constantly - there seems to be no ability to put a PIN in it so you can get the job done and it affects your ability to be successful in your role. We are told 'this is what innovation looks like' as if that makes our stress level acceptable. It's not innovation, it's lack of leadership and the result of constant pivoting affects working relationships with partners and the customer experience.
DE&I remains a challenge, we talk the talk, but I am hearing we don't always walk the talk... equity matters."
4,ServiceNow,Mobile team management ruins the good parts,2022-03-16,3.0,Staff Software Engineer,There are lots of motivated and smart people that will help you grow professionally. No lack of work but usually it's not too much to handle and is reasonably scheduled. Apps have high daily user count and do complex things so lots of places to make big impacts.,Everyone in management is chasing promotions and doesn't care about the individual contributors. Management gets promoted a ton and developers get the shaft. Play the politics game if you want advancement and the good tasks. Everyone I talk to says the company is great but the mobile team is managed like garbage. Being available 24/7 is expected for most senior roles.
5,ServiceNow,"Miserable, hostile,political mess...but stock rewards",2022-03-23,1.0,Senior Manager,People are impressed by where you work when they google the stock price.,"The whole thing is smoke and mirrors. You come in and everyone is like 'sorry we tricked you, we know it sucks'. 

I even reached out to the recruiter to ask what was up, 'this is not the job you described', his response was the policy doc for transfering teams.

There is no data. SeriouslyAnd if there was, noone would share it anyway.

The most basic everyday operation tasks are bogged down by very angry and defensive middle managers, who are also fighting for their survival.

Landgrabbing is insane . 
Stay out of the way of empire builders.
Staff who have worked here for a while are afraid of metrics and accurate reporting as it will shine a light on underperforming assets etc. So they kill reporting at all times. Data driven or logic driven ideas are killed by managers worried by a zeitgeist before their four years shares vest. 
I wish I never took this job but I can't afford to leave."
6,ServiceNow,No longer “humble”,2022-03-25,3.0,Customer Outcomes,"ServiceNow has some of the smartest folks I’ve ever met. At the lower levels, it’s a very collegial group of great hires. There’s great salaries and benefits.","Getting way too top heavy with newly hired middle management, who are often unfamiliar with the Platform. Increasingly, it’s become very hierarchical and has lost the more democratized feel and energy that was there 5 years ago. Most concerning is the current culture which stifles any questions or innovation."
7,ServiceNow,Awesome company and culture!,2022-03-31,5.0,Customer Success Architect,"Growth trajectory is amazing
Live and breath teamwork (not just a saying thrown around)
Leadership is dialed in and supportive
Diversity and Inclusion is great!",Long interview process - so hang in there!
8,ServiceNow,Real work not recognized,2022-03-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Company growth, for now
Some good benefits
RSUs average","There is no real review process and nothing is written, maybe deliberately, so that you can't complain or respond (not that it would make any difference). This is in line with the absence of modern internal tools and processes, which is beyond belief for a company that sells itself as the workflow leader.
Reviews are based on ""opinions"" rather than results.; this leads to the promotion of the ""in"" crowd, regardless of performance.
The review process is called ""360"" but in reality is unilateral, from the top down."
9,ServiceNow,A great company that is going places!,2022-02-17,5.0,ELearning Designer,"I started with ServiceNow three months ago and my experience so far has been positive. Here are a few pros:
- Excellent work/life balance
- Opportunities for professional development
- Fantastic speakers
- Above average compensation when factoring in salary, bonus, etc.
- Higher than average amount of holidays
- High morale for a work culture
- Great leadership that cares about their people. The CEO is awesome!","Very, very few cons that I can think of. But here are a few that might factor into your decision:
- There's a lot to learn, so you have to make the investment into your career.
- Unlimited PTO is only bad if you are expecting to cash out on PTO if you leave.
- The 401k match isn't as great as some other companies."
10,ServiceNow,Great onboarding process,2021-12-21,4.0,Account Manager,"As a new hire, I felt the onboarding process here was outstanding, both the company-specific onboarding and team-specific onboarding. The company is very organized and has an employee portal that you use to go through the process of being onboarded. My manager also organized a spreadsheet and coordinated meetings with other teams to onboard me as well as other new hires onto the team itself. My manager also established weekly 1:1 meetings from the start. Having 1:1's with your manager is highly encouraged here. 

The company has published a ton of internal content and has been effective in establishing processes around things which I greatly appreciate.

Benefits are great and they have a virtual assistant to help with getting you set up with health insurance. This was so amazingly helpful.","It takes a bit of time to figure out where to locate specific company-wide documents and information but it's all about getting comfortable using their system and portal. Anything new is going to take time getting use to. It can feel a bit overwhelming at first but you learn as you go. 

Working remote can feel a bit isolating. Although my manager does a great job with having a steady cadence of team meetings, I don't connect too much with my teammates. I wish it was more encouraged to check in on your teammates and how they're doing."
11,ServiceNow,Love it!!!,2022-03-28,5.0,Training and Sales Enablement Manager,"The culture, the benefits, the people, and the executive leadership are all wonderful. I love the DIBs community and its emphasis on career growth.",In the 2 1/2 years I've worked here I haven't experienced anything really negative.
12,ServiceNow,People Focused & Growing Fast,2022-03-10,5.0,Senior Manager,"This company has an incredible focus on employee health, wellbeing and development. I am continually receiving event invites to webinars that serve no other purpose than to educate on inclusion, mental health, personal development and more. Service now pays very well and that alone reduces stress on its employees, but they also practice what they preach in putting the employees first.","The company is growing fast, so employees need to be mentally ready for things to change often. This is only a con if an employee is more comfortable having things stay unchanged."
13,ServiceNow,Excellent focus on innovation and employees,2022-03-28,5.0,Senior Program Manager,"Inclusive leadership approach with an emphasis on innovation and the customer journey

Highly adaptive and considerate of the employee experience

Competitive comp and benefits package",Opportunities for exposure and promotions are vague
14,ServiceNow,"Quote ""Family"" but actions do not measure up",2022-01-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Depending on the management they will treat you well. Also, if you follow the rules you will be fine. We still do not have to go back to the office due to covid, unlike others who are trying to make you go back.","I did feel discriminated when I was working here for the time. I mean look at the travel policy. People of certain rank gets certain privileges. I mean where is the equality in that and they claim we foster equality and diversity. The policies already embed these things base on your level as opposed to other companies where I worked where everyone gets the same treatment. Not so at ServiceNow. When things. do not follow the rules or processes they punish you pretty hard. In fact, only when you kick and scream do they take you seriously. A lot of times, if you don't escalate they think all is fine. So it takes people to aggressively fight back, and then people who fight back get taken off the project. Also, there are a lot of processes and still doing waterfall instead of Agile in software development. I feel like I haven't learned much the time I have been here. We are also being paid after the covid at the 25% tile compared to our competitors...They did not proactive do anything to raise our compensation, but instead actively hire outside. It is like what the ****"

19,ServiceNow,Best onboarding and culture I have ever worked for,2022-02-11,5.0,Senior Executive Architect,"I am new (3 months) so I don't have much to say other than the onboarding process is outstanding. They really get how to scale hiring and onboarding to meet their corporate goals.
ServiceNow keep breaking my corporate intuition through the use of their product. You don't need to ask for help much--its all right there in the checklists and knowledge articles","This is exceedingly minor, but they really stress culture and diversity and this stands out: They do a lot of T-shirts and Sweat Shirts. 5 so far in just three months. They don't have Tall sizes available so I can't actually wear any. Leaves me a bit left out. This is literally the only negative I can think of."
20,ServiceNow,"Great culture, great company",2022-03-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Smart, motivated employees

23,ServiceNow,Great work life balance,2022-03-21,5.0,Senior Support Account Manager,"Remote work, competitive compensation, stock price continues to rise, great benefits, freedom policy for PTO","Management not qualified in some cases, advancement opportunities are hard to come by"
24,ServiceNow,Great company if you’re on the right sales team,2022-03-29,3.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"Great leadership. Amazing, world-class products customers love. Ability to make very good $$$",Success is entirely based on how good your manager is and which accounts you get. Promising double digit YoY growth means if you’re in sales then territories shrink from added headcount.
25,ServiceNow,The grass is greener over here.,2022-02-03,5.0,Senior Solution Consultant,"Amazing culture, amazing product and amazing people. This is the first time I can say that the companies values truly show through the people and work they do. The company is growing and with that comes so much opportunity to grow along with it. Everyone in management (that I have met) is passionate about their job, great to work with/for but also doesn't take themselves to seriously. People here know how to work hard and have fun while doing it. With all that comes great pay and benefits that you would expect at an award winning company like this!",Company is growing fast which comes with a lot of change at times. This could be a con for some people.
26,ServiceNow,Great Organization,2022-03-25,5.0,Senior Analyst,"Compensation, Benefits and Work Life Balance",None I can think of for now.
27,ServiceNow,Amazing Culture and Purpose,2022-03-10,5.0,Associate Technical Program Manager,"ServiceNow is a fantastic company and I have only had positive experiences with management and other employees while working with the company.

28,ServiceNow,Dream Job - Incredible Company,2022-02-14,5.0,Staff Technical Writer,"ServiceNow appreciates their employees and it shows! They offer excellent pay, competitive benefits, fun perks, and lots of swag to get everyone fired up to meet company goals. It's the best job I've ever had. The people are supportive and kind, and the executive leadership makes an impact with their positive messaging and motivating calls to action.",The onboarding process is no joke. The material is relevant and presented in an organized way - it's just a lot to take in.
29,ServiceNow,Great entry level sales,2022-03-19,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"Great environment and people around, fair and attainable quotas",Incredibly complicated platform that takes new sales hires 6 months or more to understand
30,ServiceNow,I love this company,2022-02-16,5.0,Staff Product Designer,"A great leadership team that's engaged with the business and listening to the organization's needs.

Culturally the most inclusive and forward-thinking company I've ever been a part of.

The work is fulfilling and dynamic","Features and sales can sometimes be put over the pursuit of perfection as it relates to design and internal efficiencies.

Low accountability on missed deadlines or low-quality deliverables"

The people are great.
The platform speaks for itself, truly moving forward.

32,ServiceNow,Forcing employees into the office is wrong! People are quitting.,2022-03-30,1.0,,"The salary is ok, but the 401k match could be a lot better.",THE COMPANY IS FORCING EMPLOYEES TO COME BACK TO THE OFFICE DESPITE RECORD PROFITS AND NOBODY WANTING TO RETURN TO THE OFFICE. I'm quitting and will not be returning to the office. Nobody wants to be around egotistical executives and commute 3 hours everyday to the office.
33,ServiceNow,Great company,2022-03-18,5.0,Service Desk Engineer,"Lots of growth, strong leadership, strong IT team, collaborative cross-functional teams.",None. One of the best companies I have worked for.
34,ServiceNow,Great Company - changes fast and political,2022-02-15,4.0,Account Executive,"Compensation, Team Spirit within ranks/peers, opportunities for advancement, great name in industry","Management is political and a lot of jockeying for position. Sales cycles are long and you better have a great relationship with your boss. Quota's can be unrealistic especially after having a great year - they jack it up pretty high. Company is getting too woke. Healthcare insurance providers are average at best, especially if you use any naturopathic doctors."
35,ServiceNow,Great place to work,2022-02-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Spent 5 years at ServiceNow. Culture has really improved to attract more diverse and global talent base. Company is firing on all cylinders with its Industry Workflows. Lots of upside for those willing to put in effort.,"all the same things that you'll find at any company growing 33% QoQ/YoY.

Very friendly amazing people
Plenty of opportunities to leave your mark and work for a company that is doing amazing things","It always comes down to money, pay raises are strict so in order to keep up with inflation or even where you live you may have to leave the company and come back.

42,ServiceNow,"Great Financially, horrible psychologically",2022-02-10,3.0,Director,Comp was excellent. Technical people are excellent.,"Yes, the comp was great. Hard to watch executives get cheered on for plagiarizing your work. Especially when those praising them are letting you know that they know it’s your work product.

- (Formerly) great equity grants
- Very high growth
- Excellent marketing
- Extensive training opportunities","- Internal culture at management levels ranges from non-existent to toxic and hostile
- Once fully vested, people leave almost immediately, which shows how little the environment actually provides past compensation
- Despite internal messaging there is a sense that the music will stop sooner rather than later and things will get worse quickly

There are good managers also - so just be careful to really understand if your manager is one of the bad apples who lacks emotional maturity and spends a lot of time micro-managing everyone and everything.

ServiceNow takes seriously their commitment to Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. The DIBs group has the ear of upper management and has regular contact with all of us.
ServiceNow spoils me on working conditions, though I admit my bar is lower than most. I don't have to go out next to 2000-degree bars of steel on a dirt floor or maintain cranes 6 stories above ground, or breathe fumes from pickling acid or galvanizing lines.

125,ServiceNow,Customer Support Representative at ServiceNow,2021-08-26,5.0,Customer Support Representative,"It is a fast paced environment that is set up well with plenty of resources to perform within the role and cross team support. The culture is great and there is a big focus on working as a team, it is one of the company values. This role is a technical role, however those with no IT technical experience but do have customer support/facing experience can perform the role with training. It is a great opportunity to learn about ServiceNow's platform and gain experience within the realm of IT.","It is a fast paced environment and everyday is different, which is not necessarily a bad thing. However, it can be very demanding on days where the volume of support is high.

First-time CMO, Alan Marks, struggles to unify the marketing org. He continues to make constant reorgs and direction changes and brings in new leadership to “fix” the problems. I witnessed lots of good people just unexpectedly get fired, making everyone nervous and living in fear they are next. Groups are working in silos and struggle to do any meaningful work due to bureaucracy and role duplication. The work quality bar is low, favoring speed. That is because everyone spends all the time in meetings and dealing with politics and not working. The company lacks basic processes that you would expect at a company this size (there is seriously no standardized hiring process). There is lots of hype around ServiceNow being a top company, but I have found the culture to be extremely political and toxic. Senior leadership operates in the command and conquer model with very little empowerment to its people. 

I also witnessed lots of people leave other top companies to join ServiceNow only to be crushed and deflated within the first few months. Senior leadership sugar coats the problems by describing it as a “hyper-growth” company because the problems are cemented into the company culture."

Employee benefits

Growth projection","Middle management is self-serving 

What company leadership is more cheerleading and is out of touch with the true workers

Very little career growth and inconsistency of promotions 

There is very little of the culture that fueled its growth

Bureaucracy and politics dominate over getting work done and cooperation

Showing up as your authentic self if you don’t challenge middle management"
131,ServiceNow,Even the best technology does not substitute for genuine people interaction,2021-12-14,2.0,Confidential,"I’ll give ‘em this – they have the technology thing down. One of the best experiences I have ever had as a new hire. Unfortunately, this was only one of a few positives I have to say. With what I had heard about the company and the promise it offered, I had hoped my experience would have been longer term. Instead, I departed from the organization (and no, I was not fired) only having added to my list of the things NOT to do as a colleague and or manager. 
I give credit where credit is due and to round off my list of positives: the pay was excellent, and they said the right things from the onset. If you experienced a first day only, you would have been impressed. Where other organizations haven’t a clue as to how to get their new employees on-boarded this company has it down. I quickly became aware of the fact that the company wants to be diverse, inclusive and have everyone bring their “authentic” self to work. They also are super proud of their product, and their customers, and all of the employees that make the “magic” happen. But it is quickly apparent that their ability to execute on anything remotely close to what they describe as a purpose driven culture leaves much to be desired.","On the surface this is “the place to work” but when you get to the core it is far from magical. Leaders act as though they walk on water. Team members are anything but welcoming. Bringing your authentic self really translates into you have liberty to do anything you want with little or no ramifications. I personally had to find my own way. No one wants to do anything that isn’t in their own personal interest and when you step up and be “that person” you are instantly chastised- something that no one else initially wanted to do becomes a free for all for others to criticize. As a matter of fact, it seems like everyone avoids getting work done just based on the sole reason that every non-mission critical task gets opened up to vetting beyond nauseum. You could have someone from a completely different business function telling you how to do something that you have done your entire career, but no one has your back to end the nonsense. You are expected to ride out the politics without a clear path to success – in anything. 
To say that leadership is innate may be true and if so, they are not finding leaders with this innate capability. In my experience here leaders/managers live by a “do as I say, not as I do” motto. I am in the mid to late stages of my career and have held many leadership positions, and I am blown away at how uninspired the leaders at this company make me feel. I was in a meeting one time with a leader showcasing some up & coming bells and whistles that were to be rolled out. I asked the question how did they plan to inform colleagues about this? His response: This is a self-service culture. That’s the beauty of what we implement, it needs little or no introduction. And I’ll give him this… there isn’t anything that is full service at this organization especially in the leadership department. Leaders manage to computer generated “nudges” and have little or no interest in what motivates their team members. For a company that is in touch with the uniqueness of their workforce they should be intimately aware that everyone is wired differently and thus a little effort to get to know their staff would go a long way. No one gave a lick about me as a person. So believe it or not I’ll end this- here. If you want a job where you have almost every freedom you could possibly think of and decent pay- I would say hop on board. If you want a career experience that is going to make you feel a sense of accomplishment and feel respected for what you bring to the table, RUN AWAY as fast as you can."

- Similar to getting help to be promoted, you dont really ever get assigned any new responsibilities or roles, everyone just has to wait or be in a good relationship with the director to get recognized for promotion.
- Entry level positions are only posted and given to interns. Very few are ever posted externally.

Leadership turns a blind eye any time problems are raised

Managers do not support the culture, pushing their own, old boys’ school “culture” as being more important instead. People who are meant to be managers and leaders are simply fragile bullies, and the organization rewards that.

The pay is reasonably competitive compared to competitors in the enterprise SaaS space. All my colleagues working in other departments love their jobs and enjoy doing meaningful work.,"This review is specific to HR (Global Talent). I’ve been working in the department for 3 years and it’s had its ups and downs. The most recent down swing has been terrible. There has been a mass exodus among HR leadership, and with it, any semblance of empathy for a department that’s been beaten down. The interim leadership has brought in fresh blood from organizations like Walmart which have brought along their toxic culture from those organizations (I.e. kick down and kiss up, a culture of fear and threats) that has driven down our employee engagement scores to the lowest in the company (by a large margin). In the most general sense, it is a terrible place to work within a company that is a great place to work."

They say the right things but don’t action them . Too much inside politics that plays with the careers of dedicated employees. And at the senior director level it’s even worse.

It’s a shame.  Unfortunately there’s a big disconnect from the narrative Bill has and what leadership down stream do."

The previous CHRO had her pet project, DIBs, which is important, but it was her sole focus to the detriment of everything else. Currently no CHRO. They seem to lack the appropriate policies and best practices of most enterprise companies. HR enables and protects bad managers, leading people to leave the company because they are not being treated fairly. At the very least it's HRs job to protect the company, not management."

Seeing our CEO make a pledge that we would do no layoffs due to the COVID-19 downturn was inspiring, and a lesson in leadership. This is a company that knows it can and will change the world, and make the world of work, work better for people. And, it's people are so committed to doing so. I have never felt so proud or grateful to work for a company. Awesome product, kind people, unlimited vacation, and flexible workplace that truly works with employees to ensure they are happy, productive, and taken care of at all turns. Career opportunities abound internally for those who are self-directed and take responsibility for their own careers. I'm not sure what the lower Glass Door reviews were driven by previously - but there are no signs of trouble now. This is a company that has high accountability standards, which is a great thing.","The company is in a state of transition, moving from a  successful company to a rocketship led by a new type of leadership. Some employees are comfortable with increased levels of infrastructure required to grow a business, and others are not. You sometimes find yourself working with people who are stuck in their ways, and end up swirling before they're ready to come along on the maturity journey."

Stock price keeps going up with the company@s continuing torrid growth.","Too much constant emphasis on DIBS, “wokeness” and political correctness, but given all the amazing qualities of this tremendous company, it’s not that big a deal. The idea behind is noble, but everyone should treat their fellow human beings with kindness, consideration and respect, regardless of who or what they are. This is simple common sense and decency."

Solid technology company - products were in high demand,"Management was awful, changing their minds often on our initiatives and causing a lot of rework. They were competitive and fought with each other openly, teaching co-workers to compete with each other and making everyone feel anxious. Hiring was so fast-paced that a lot of people were hired into roles for which they had no competency. People often took credit for each other's work, creating an environment of distrust.

An INCREDIBLE IT team that whips up cutting edge solutions in record time. Seriously, they're the best. If you work for ServiceNow, work for IT. Incredibly fast paced environment...which is good until it's bad (hello burnout).","The people team is pretty much a dumpster fire right now. During my tenure the existing CHRO left and a new one was hired...and then fired 2 months later (which of course caused a downstream exodus of leaders). While I'm glad they realized it wasn't a fit immediately, ServiceNow didn't have internal HR until 3 years ago so people systems are SEVERELY lacking with literally no leadership in sight. 

I've also truly truly truly never experienced so much workplace politics. I had to tip toe, bend over backwards, and even schedule separate meetings with two people who refused to get along. It was exhausting keeping up with who was fighting with who every week. This may not be the case in other departments but wow it was out of control within the People Team. 

The dept also skews older which isn't necessarily a bad thing in general (and I've been on other teams like this), except at SN I experienced age bias for being younger. It sucked and really made me feel like me and my ideas weren't valued. If the conditions on the People Team were different, I would have LOVED to stay with ServiceNow for several more years but ultimately decided that my mental health was more important than a paycheck."

343,ServiceNow,Mixed Bag,2021-05-06,2.0,Data Engineer,ServiceNow is a fast-paced growing company that more people are hearing about. Great salary along with generous RSUs. The CEO has a lot of energy and a great vision for the company.,"My time at ServiceNow had its ups and downs. ServiceNow operates like a really big start-up company. Since it is a big company, your experience will depend a lot on your manager and team. Its grown really fast to the point where the internal systems/processes haven't really had a chance to catch up. This makes the work days longer for employees. For example, the on-boarding process was pretty messy. I received my laptop a few days late and it also took several months to get access to systems I needed to use for my job. 

I worked in the IT group, and a lot of my co-workers were spread out globally in off-shore locations. It was normal to work around the clock and have multiple meetings at night since development was happening in off-shore. I would estimate that I probably had around 2-3 meetings every night during the week and stayed up late to help out with projects/tasks. Working here can be pretty demanding because of the high expectations and 12-15 hours required to collaborate with off-shore to get your projects done. I also noticed that a lot of people in my group were contractors, so they didn't have a lot of knowledge on the business and needed to have their hand held a lot of the times. I would say it was pretty normal to work or get urgent slack messages over the weekend to fix something in the system as well. There were also a lot of times where I had to fix code that was done by the off-shore team because they were causing issues in production and it was already late on their side. I think a lot of other groups might be better when it comes to balance, but a lot of people I talked to in other groups also felt that their work-load was way too demanding. I think it is just a combination of things moving really fast, without a sense of direction by middle management.

Overall, I learned a lot and gained good experience here, but decided to leave for a better paying opportunity with better WLB because of the demanding hours/workload, having to collaborate with off-shore, and having to work over the weekend here. I would say this is a good place if you are just out of college or new into the industry, but overall wouldn't recommend if you value your work/life balance."

The company is definitely moving in the right direction and Bill McDermott is a fantastic person with the right experience and energy to lead it!","Let's be real: it's a rapidly changing environment. If you are adverse to change, this place is not for you. The change is pretty much all for the better but, like other have said, there is some ""old school"" thought here that we should continue doing what we used to do, which can be frustrating. The other major con is the often silo-ed nature of doing work across functions, which can be redundant and contradictory at times. It's getting better but is an ongoing area of opportunity.

2. Learning opportunities
3. Org restructuring in order to accomplish the company vision and goals
4. Standing within and amongst industry peers","1. CEO leadership , enthusiasm and clear direction for where company needs to go does not trickle down to the managerial level. some Managers unable to create a vision and direction for team, cant think strategically
2. many managers lack functional expertise and people management skills. Unclear why ICs are promoted to managers ,have direct reports if the only value they add is to pass through instructions and be reactive to leadership demands. Disillusionment and demoralizing behaviour from managers contributing to toxicity - being informed that its easier to get a promotion under a different GM speaks volumes. Its a lie when they say your career growth is in your own hands. Getting promoted is solely at the discretion of your manager and other factors outside of your control. Not objective. If the manager has poor influence and visibility within the org then that impacts an IC from being recognized for promotion. Combine this with manager having poor functional expertise and being generally clueless fosters lack of trust. EVS surveys are not anonymous and having discussion with manager is useless as retaliation is real, intent is thrown out the window when having 1:1 discussions to work through things.
3. you have to learn the game of politics and play the game as many aspects of your career growth, especially for new or mid career, is not objective and depends on many other factors. If you are in a org that doesnt have visibility or where manager has no respect then good luck. Likelihood one can devolve, self doubt and develop mental health issues is very possible. 
3. The toxicity has resulted in people competing with each other to gain visibility instead of collaborating toward a common goal."

386,ServiceNow,Work here if you want to grow,2019-09-05,5.0,Director,"1) ServiceNow hires great people, they're ""adults"" (not always the case in Tech) and they genuinely care about each other. 
2) Growing like crazy, so much opportunity to learn and advance in every part of the org 
3) There is a pride in our product that is rare (and deserved). 
4) We are truly are hungry and humble (one of our values). The entitlement you see at other Tech companies is non-existent, and people are hungry to keep raising the bar and do it QUICK (I left a similar sized tech company with WAY more red tape and bureaucracy, I'm amazed at how fast you can do things here ). 5) Great work/life balance! 
6) John Donahoe and the world-class leadership team have transformed this company over the last few years
7) They care about diversity, inclusion and equality. We're still building this capability but the company/leaders truly believe in this and are taking positive steps.","A lot of people who've been here 3-5+ years struggle with the rapid change we're in now. They want to do it ""the way it's always been done"" and many have never worked for a world-class org and don't know how to scale. So there's some growing pains between employees who are legacy and newly hired in the last ~2 years.

Don't come here if you need a nap pod. Or expect free gelato on every floor. The snack rooms are well stocked with good food, but we do pay for lunch in the tasty and affordable cafe. The benefits are almost as good as industry, 401k is still lower, but everything else pretty much on-par. ServiceNow is also stingier on things like team outing budget and have clamped down on travel some quarters."

Petty Politics : Immature, individuals with low functional experience leading major initiatives. Product politics translating into an inability to create delightful customer experiences.
2. Musical Chairs : Constant unnecessary organizational changes to cater to ""extremely"" insecure and political leaders at the top trying to maintain their power balance and trying to give their equally insecure and incompetent inner circle plum positions of power and manipulation.
3. Toxic Work Environment for Women : Women Managers are especially badly treated with no growth prospects and promises made that are not  kept...just take a look at the number of women over manager level in the product organization (way way lower than standard benchmarks).  I have personally seen multiple cases of women getting bullied at work and not having the courage to speak out due to fear of retaliation and getting fired or demoted at a whim.
4. Inefficient Sales - this team knows how to effectively sell IT solutions but is faltering very badly when it comes to selling other new products, makes you question SNOW's strategy of selling into new segments and verticals ...if I had to come up with two words for it - EPIC FAIL!
5. Lots of lip service and talks about transparent culture and diversity but is a culture built  on  dirty politics, games and intimidation

Each month, I feel I’ve grown professionally. Think about how many places can create that type of growth-enabling environment...not many.

ServiceNow is a place where your skills, competency, and adaptability will be tested. Some will fail. Some rocket to profound success. 

This is a varsity team in a world-class league. My colleagues are brilliant and highly competent. To be successful, you have to earn your way to a starting , 1st string role. Those who cannot perform or are unwilling to progress towards it, have a difficult time in this environment. Those who can perform OR are willing to take control of their development will find great comfort in the culture the ServiceNow leadership has cultivated- a culture of critical thinking, deductive reasoning, and winning.

I’m humbled each day. Although I don’t consider myself  “world-class,” I know that in time, being in this environment, I will get there eventually. And for that, I give this company five stars.

Other pros:
-Long but reasonable hours. Office at HQ is pretty empty at 6. Sometimes after work hours are needed.
-Great comp
-strong leadership 
-Nice gym","This is a place is not for everybody. It can be a sink or swim environment that moves and operates at break-neck speeds. Those who will do well are those that maintain a growth mindset, and are capable of adapting and overcoming challenges."

Stock is still climbing
Salaries can be competitive
You might get lucky and join a good team
You might not get fired","Silent executions. Frequent firings. No mention the person was fired. Similar to purges in Stalin era Soviet Union where they removed all record and even airbrushed people out of photos. ICs get fired. Managers and directors get fired. There hasn't been a VP firing in a while.

Any technical interest is eclipsed by the lack of freedom to influence the direction of the organization, product, or codebase. Some thrive, but most have their wings clipped. You'll probably be the latter.

Personality cult around their founder. If you work in the sphere of influence of their founder a reality distortion field will set in. The laws of organizational physics won't apply. You will be micromanaged like never before and you'll be lucky to survive a year or two. Best to avoid those areas.

Some competent, core people but huge swathes of deadwood. Similar to how they backend load quality (inadequate investment during product development, huge release support costs), hiring strangely follows this backend load model. The bar to get hired is often quite low. If later it's discovered that you weren't what they really wanted then no problem, you'll just get axed. Not a good way to run things."

The compensation and benefits are really good. There are a lot of pockets of good and not so good management, so YMMV. Our CEO is an absolutely rock star.","Two big ones... Firstly Politics. If you think about ServiceNow as the major cloud platform player it is, the culture is what you would expect. As a veteran of both start ups and tech bellweathers, the culture here matches the worst examples of political fiefdoms, where knowledge is treated as capital so skunkworks projects and political power plays abound. The second issue - the most successful people here are transparent rear-end kissers. In the choice between doing good and looking good, you have to have an understanding of what your manager thinks good is and emulate it. It is a constant source of bad decisions and groupthink. Some of us who focus on execution have terrible hours and poor work-life balance, while others hide and rest / vest. Lastly, immature processes abound - way too many for a company that is far beyond its startup roots, yet many of the same executives from those days are still there. Bill has his work cut out for him."

538,ServiceNow,"Be Hungry, Be Humble",2020-02-13,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The motto of ServiceNow is ""Be Hungry, Be Humble"" and from what I have seen (at least with engineers), this motto echos throughout the company. 

This is an engineering-led organization full of brilliant people where respect is shown everywhere. You immediately fall into this growth mindset of wanting to do your best here because you're surrounded by motivated, passionate people who are always willing to help out their coworkers. Also, the generous RSU package is pretty motivating for everyone to do their absolute best.

Pros:

- Team-focused environment. Lots of pair programming, even at IC3+ levels
- Fun, challenging environment
- Good work/life balance. No expectations of ""burning the midnight oil""
- Generous RSU program (vesting after a year)
- ""Unlimited"" PTO with no drama when you take time off",Could be a little more flexible with the wfh

548,ServiceNow,Great company,2021-01-22,4.0,Enterprise Account Executive,Platform technology is very strong and leadership is tirelessly looking to increase capabilities and customer satisfaction.,"As with a lot of fast growing companies, growth comes with pain. Some management teams are disjointed."
549,ServiceNow,A company that truly cares about their employees,2020-06-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This is the best company I’ve worked at so far in my career! I’ve touched startups, agencies, and mid sized companies which all have it’s pros and cons so I was a little bit nervous to jump into corporate world. Sure it comes with the standard office politics, no where is perfect but there’s nothing here I can’t handle, I’ve dealt with worse problems- way worse at other companies. 

- There is virtually no ego here. You know those meetings where there’s that person/few people who feels extremely strongly about their opinion and won’t back down at all? Like their answer is the only right answer? Well the people here don’t have that mentality, sure we still have arguments but it’s always from the mentality of we’re a team, let’s make the product the best it can be for our customers rather than stroking our own egos. This is such a breath of fresh air. 
- Which leads to the next benefit, no finger pointing. Throughout my career I have faced countless departments and teams not owning up to their mistakes and would rather throw someone else under the bus. That does not fly here. We do not dwell on mistakes, we accept it and try to find a solution as quickly as possible. Because guess what, the milk has already spilled so no use finger pointing. How can we help each other do better? I love that we act as strong as our weakest link so it’s in our best interest to support those who need help. To help each other learn and grow. 
- I feel like our leadership actually cares about us. It’s very genuine and sincere and you can see it from how they carry themselves. How at each all-hands, they mention that rather than only focusing on numbers. Because guess what, they know that taking care of employees lead to better work. I don’t know why that’s such a hard concept for companies to grasp, treat your employees well and they’ll want to stay. We were one of the first companies to go full remote on a global scale because of the 2020 Covid19 pandemic. And then weeks later, everybody else followed suit. I love that they address head on the issues happening in the world like George Floyd and Black Lives Matter movement. This is a company that truly cares and makes a genuine effort rather than virtue signaling on social media. 
- Amazing people 
- Top of the line benefits and perks
- I can go on and on but I think you get the point. There’s a reason we’ve been recognized for so many things. Also we were ranked 3rd for happiest employees in the US!","- Typical corporate stuff like a lot of teams so hard to know which resource to go to sometimes
- They seem pretty strict on years of experience corresponding to IC level. Like you’re not going to find a 25 year old in a Senior position here. 
- The internship program is only open to those enrolled in school. I’m not a fan of this methodology because it doesn’t help those less fortunate who couldn’t afford college or who wants to make a career switch. We should make tech jobs more accessible"

Talented engineers put extra time to produce results.,"The Employee Experience has talented engineers; but they are leaving the team because the new intermediate leadership team does not understand the culture of servicenow. If the  new director does not like somebody, he leaves them hanging in balance for months and some employees left the team on their own  and joined others teams  within servicenow.  The contract employees are not treated well and some contractors found their last day was Friday, when they showed up for work on Monday and found that  badge did not work.  The senior leadership seems to be completely oblivious to the lack of professionalism. Some engineers are staying only because they do not want to leave because of stock options even if the environment is toxic."

563,ServiceNow,"Toxic, co-dependent and pathetic culture",2019-11-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Free snacks (although they are beginning to go downhill too),"ServiceNow by far has been the worst experience in my professional career.  The people who have been promoted to management (especially in Sales Operations) are under qualified, immature, and incompetent.  The only reason why ServiceNow likes to hire from within is that the pre-IPO “management” are afraid of people from the outside who actually have relevant experience.  They simply don’t want to be exposed for the clowns that they are.   If you choose to work here, be prepared for constant backstabbing and high school antics.  Seriously folks, get a grip.  You’re not saving lives.

There is little to no guidance about doing your job, and the expectation is you’ll just “figure it out” once you’re handed your Active Directory credentials.  Management will boast about the great work/life balance they have; meanwhile you’re working 15 hour days and killing your set for nothing.  The “changes” to the culture are so surface level it’s comical.  Plastering slogans all over walls and having pictures of people with piercings and tattoos on the website doesn’t mean the company has a great culture, or even a good one.  

Bottom line - if you’re not pre-IPO, willing to degrade yourself to get ahead, or just desperate for a paycheck, ServiceNow is not the place for you."

2) the company and executive team have a clear vision and are driving the company to be extremely successful
3) the products are very powerful and innovative","1) the company continues to be plagued by poor hiring decisions in middle-management, where inexperienced managers are driving lower level employees away
2) the culture overall has improved over the last 5+ years, however, it is still a pretty toxic environment where most people feel the need to prove themselves in order to gain any sort of recognition/validation
3) executive decisions on the priorities of the products have changed course over the last year, which is understandable, but has caused incubation products to be killed and the hard work of many to go out the window.
4) if you come in at a low salary, good luck ever getting paid what you actually deserve in the market. they use excuses that HR can only give you a certain % increase, which would make sense, except why isn't there pay equality in the first place when you first make the hire?
5) the benefits have improved over the last 3 years since getting a new HR leader, however, it's still not close to what other similar companies are offering, and employees often feel that hard work will still go unnoticed because it is up to the specific department to promote these benefits and ensure employees are aware of them, are taking enough PTO, are getting all the perks they deserve, etc.
6) some leaders are only looking out for themselves. I have come across many Director-VP level folks that will take the credit for the successes of their department, but will never take the fall for any of the mistakes. Additionally, not giving enough recognition to the hard work of their team."

For engineers, there is little to no opportunity to learn and adopt modern technologies as the platform forces all the application development to be done in JavaScript.

 Engineers with server side skills will have no opportunity to build on that skill unless you are in the platform team. Also limited engineering roles can apply frameworks outside of native JavaScript, such as React or Angular.

-Compensation: They pay below market, I have been offered 50-70% more at other firms for the same job

-Bonuses: They will find any little excuse to deduct your bonus, I never got more than 50% of my bonus

-ACR: They will nick and nack your previous year performance just to not give you a raise, I went two years without a raise even though my billable total was well over the requirement and my CSAT was more than 9 out of 10. 

-Training: On top of your required 80% billable hours per year, they will assign you an absurd amount of training throughout the year and expect you to complete it, even if you're resourced at 40 hours per week with client work. They do not care about Work/Life balance.

They treat their employees better than any other company I've worked with.  It is a meritocracy, where your performance dictates your rise, so if you're a top performer, it will be recognized and will pay off.","Some organizations within the company prioritize taking orders over creative thought and problem solving.  Most of the company is fantastic, but within one org in particular, priorities may shift at any given moment.  Your team may be working toward one objective, then your team is asked to drop everything to rush out a new project.  You may assign a team member to a goal necessary to meet your target only to have them receive new orders from above without consultation, leading to the first objective falling short and reflecting negatively on the entire team."

Worst communication I've ever encountered in a company.

In terms of the company, the leadership is the best I've seen. All aligned, each having strong virtues and very approachable. Because of them, the company's been growing like crazy and the culture has been incredible.

I thought I wanted to join a 500-1000 company where I could have an impact. ServiceNow is huge, but because it's in the next phase of growth, there's a lot of newness and uncertainties where it feels very startup and nimble. So my work is impactful, and I get the budget and resources of a large company. Best of both worlds.","Lack of process. People are used to executing without strategy and process which leads to pointless meetings and wasted work time. It's a changing factor but there's currently a lot of process that needs to be defined.

Minor, but clunky internal software. Some of the technologies we use have pretty bad user experiences, like OneDrive, Solstice."

Every individual has the opportunity to take part in critical and meaningful work that impacts the company. There are ample opportunities for advancement, as they really do promote from within. Reading other reviews I would agree that ServiceNow has a performance driven culture.  I have been here for 1.5 years and our stock has risen by $25. If you want to work for a company in which you can scrap by and earn a paycheck find somewhere else to work. Bonuses/stock are paid out quarterly and yes your performance is reviewed in such terms as well. Some people who worked at bigger companies can't adjust to the fast release cycles or the fact that their work has high visibility. Management expects us to work hard, but they honor our DTO policy.  One of the few places where you work hard, but they respect your work life balance. Their is awesome management who actually cares about your personal growth as an employee, gives you the support, and tools that you need to perform your job well. We are the best kept secret in the valley, if you don't believe it go do some research.",None that i can think of.

1) Fred Luddy, the founder of ServiceNow, made a billion dollars and then came back the next day and worked harder than anyone else. In fact he still commits as much or more code than anyone else.

2) It's a culture of making the customer happy... and we have a TON to keep happy!

I love my job because I know that literally thousands of people will actually use the things that I build. This is why I occasionally choose to work extra hours... not because it's expected of me. But taking time off is encouraged and I never count my days because of the unlimited vacation policy!

Our teams are growing fast but they have made organizational changes all the way up to support it. So I always know who I can go to and get a straight answer.

We get to choose our project management style although scrum is the most popular.

I get to work with some of the best engineers in the world, many of them great teachers! I am stretched and challenged every week.

I have been blessed with opportunities to travel to exciting places to work on exciting projects.

The free snacks are legit: kind bars, peanut m&ms, hint water, greek yogurt... really nice perk.

The quarterly bonuses are awesome. First time in my career that I've ever actually gotten what I've been promised.

Last but not least... I get state of the art hardware and software, literally the best tools to do my job.","Test, test, test. If you don't catch problems with your code someone else will and you will hear about it :)"

If you really want to join the development organization then your best bet is to be a developer. Not a good place for product managers at all. QE is a great place if your goal is mediocrity and limited career growth. Managers seem to get fired more frequently then ICs. 

Choose your VP carefully. Each VP org is vastly different with some much better than others. Try to get to know the organization ahead of time through friends and colleagues. Then hope the horse you're riding on doesn't get sent to the glue factory (your VP doesn't get fired).","No working from home. My manager repeatedly sent out emails to my team to remind us ""The ServiceNow development organization doesn't allow for working from home as a common practice. Last minute emergencies exist and will be tolerated."" She said if your car is in the shop then rent a car and make sure you're in the office. Picking up relatives or waiting for handyman are not considered legitimate reasons. This may be SOP in San Diego but not in Silicon Valley."

As a programmer, it's got a very interesting problem set to work on, interesting set of requirements to design to, to make a product that is so customizable by our customers, open where we want them to modify it, closed where we don't. 

They live up to the Agile/SCRUM methodology - a sustainable work pace that doesn't have me killing myself every release or abandoning my family - nor bored. Very cool collaborative type of environment - I'd worked in offices before, and being able to talk to and listen to my coworkers more easily is a nice change. 

I've been a programmer for 20 years, this is my favorite work environment. I get to get things done, build cool stuff, have a life, work with interesting people. When I hit a trouble point, people here help - I can ask my coworkers or my boss at any moment and get pointed to the right direction.","If you want an office - it's cubicles. Personally, now that I've done it, I like it (never thought I would - too many negative stereotypes of cubicles). The interaction, the ability to just toss a question to a coworker is well worth it. No walls, so you can easily talk. 

No food in walking distance - food trucks and a sandwich place that brings food in - that I do miss, I used to work an office with more choices. We've got a free Friday lunch that is often good, and it's something, but I miss walking to my local Chinese or Mexican in the area."
