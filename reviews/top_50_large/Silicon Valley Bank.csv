The team fosters open communication, diversity, inclusivity, transparency, and using empathy for their team members and clients they design for. 
Being remote first also has its obvious advantages and disadvantages these days, but the leadership team manages to bring people close and build relationships through fun virtual team building workshops and non forced fun time to connect with each other that continues to strengthen the culture there.",The IT support could use improvement but again a normal part of the process of a company growing fast.

Some senior product managers are not technically and technologically proficient. Spends a lot of time in meetings chatting about nonwork-related things."

Great people makes all the difference and SVB has tons of smart hardworking and kind people.,Lots of change. As SVB has become a Large Financial Institution it is undergoing significant change which means confusion around roles and responsibilities and different unsettled opinions about how to do things.
17,Silicon Valley Bank,Good company to work,2022-03-03,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work life balance 
Remote options",No real career development pathway
18,Silicon Valley Bank,Great company,2022-03-03,4.0,Senior Business Operations Analyst,great place to work and really cares about employees,low pay compared to other companies

22,Silicon Valley Bank,Startup Banking,2022-02-14,4.0,Associate,"Great benefits, great work life balance, fair pay and no work on the weekends.",Company is growing incredibly fast and it feels like some employees are being left behind while others are getting ahead. The employees that are getting ahead are either legacy employees or employees that mirror the cultural ideology at the bank. Performance reviews are barely discussed in detail.

27,Silicon Valley Bank,Excellent Employer,2022-01-25,5.0,Administrative Assistant III,SVB actually walks the talk. They take care of their employees.,Internal shuffling of departments happens too often. Internal joke is that your group will report to a new area at least once a year.
28,Silicon Valley Bank,SVB Review,2022-02-08,4.0,Credit Associate,"Good culture, interesting clients, good development program",Pay is not as competitive

30,Silicon Valley Bank,Associate,2022-01-21,5.0,Associate,SVB has a great culture and amazing people.,Not as big of a name in Boston.
31,Silicon Valley Bank,Great Culture,2022-01-21,5.0,Investment Analyst,A departure from the traditional stuffy banks,Can be slightly disorganized given exponential growth but it’s not too much of a hinderance
32,Silicon Valley Bank,good,2022-01-21,5.0,Administrative Assistant,"good, productive, fair and fun",no complaints on my end
33,Silicon Valley Bank,Awesome Company,2022-01-18,5.0,Associate,"Very interesting clients
Very structures program out of undergrad
Awesome and welcoming culture",None that come to mind
34,Silicon Valley Bank,Underwhelming,2022-01-15,3.0,Associate,"- Filled with people that love SVB (kind of weird but still more of a pro)
- Still fully remote if you don't want to come in
- 2 month training for ADP before any real work
- large cohorts of new associates
- get to interact with really cool VCs and founders
- opportunities to move across the bank every couple years
- good first job. Good occasional perks kind of. They'll toss us $25 doordash codes every now and then","- technology is so terrible that I probably spend 2/3 of my week updating repetitive trackers and submitting compliance crap. I don't mind bc I get paid the same either way, but there's truly so much of that nonsense to fit in it sucks
- No indication of any Covid-related raises despite the retention issues. I'll probably end up going to a diff bank since they're poaching us anyways
- Commercial Banking also blows. Some deals are cool but most of your clients will just have credit cards but you still have to cater to them just as much. This isn't a substitute for IB if you actually want to exit to something good in finance
- Hit or miss on ADP/rotation managers (as expected anywhere)
- they make it seem like they care but will never address real issues that people have. work-life balance has severely gone downhill and upper management thinks the solution is to come back to the office regularly. What?"
35,Silicon Valley Bank,Good Company lacking HR Leadership,2022-02-15,1.0,Human Resources Project Manager,Company is solid and has great benefits. The mission of the company is great. A lot of wonderful and smart people. Branding is great.,HR Leadership seems inept to deal with problems within the HR organization. They keep loosing key people and not realizing the reason why. The reason are HR leaders who can’t manage people and are stuck in their ways. I’ve seen HR leaders make people cry in meetings. The CHRO needs to clean house or else they will loose significant talent (which they already have).
36,Silicon Valley Bank,Fair place of work,2022-01-07,5.0,Senior Operations Specialist,I feel valued and fairly compensated for my work and think that this is the best place of work I've been in my 10 year career path.,"Training is a little foggy and the onboarding process could use some work, but as of right now there is talk about remodeling that."
37,Silicon Valley Bank,Probably one of the best jobs I've ever had.,2022-01-10,5.0,Senior Associate,"SVB has an extremely strong focus on work/life balance across all positions at the bank. The culture is phenomenal, I cannot stress that enough. The exec team has a clear outline for the goals/direction of SVB.","Comp is slightly lower than industry average across all positions, in my experience."
38,Silicon Valley Bank,Widespread burnout,2022-01-16,2.0,Accounting,"Good pay, excellent benefits. Unlimited PTO would be great if we could actually use it.","Zero work life balance. Rapid growth has increased workload tremendously, but additional staffing or systems updates have not kept up with the pace, leading to more work spread across the same people with the same outdated systems. 
The response when saying you are overwhelmed is that ""everyone across accounting is feeling it too, it's not just you"". That's not helpful. 
The message from exec level is that our health and well-being is crucial, but mid-level management is more concerned with work deadlines. Your personal life or your exhaustion doesn't matter - just get the job done."
39,Silicon Valley Bank,"Lot of internal politics, people building own resumes than working for corp success",2022-01-15,2.0,Senior Director,Used to be great company till the COO change.

Our values - Start with Empathy, Act with Integrity, Embrace Diverse Perspectives, Take Responsibility and Learn & Improve - they are all great. I think my business unit tries to espouse them.

Pay is good 

Organization is embracing a remote workforce model (for many if not most positions)

Career opportunities are plentiful. You can really grow here.","Growing too fast. This results in chaos (across business units not just mine). Processes and governance for example- haven't been focused on in the past. Now they must be, and management is ""scrambling"", which translates to workers are scrambling, to put them in place. This has an effect on work/life balance."
62,Silicon Valley Bank,Mixed Bag,2021-10-09,3.0,Senior Manager,Good place for new graduates to start out - move on once you have some experience.,"Your physical attractiveness, youth and who you know are the most important factors for success here.

2) Leadership really cares about clients and employees.
3) You feel empowered at work and want to do well for our clients and SVB.","1) Too many Org changes result in extroverts and favorites getting promoted instead of considering peoples caliber or work.
2) Work life balance goes out of wack for people who care about what they do. Leadership encourage employees to take vacation (in words) but keep piling work despite lack of capacity which is oxymoronic.

Would definitely recommend SVB as a great place to work overall.","Management is slow to hire, while results in very tough working hours due to limited resources.

121,Silicon Valley Bank,"Great Leadership, changing culture",2021-02-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The executive leadership is transparent, empathetic and cares about the employees and clients. Greg - CEO, Mike - President and Phil - COO are just amazing.

Compensation and benefits are better compared to other financial institutions.

Overall the company has a sense of purpose and trying to stay on top of emerging disruptions in the financial sector. I see the company growing in the next 10 years, with forays into global markets and innovative products.","The technology leadership gets recycled at an average of 3 years and when I say refreshed its right from CIO and CTO level down. Check how many CIOs and CTOs the company had in the last 15 years. Obviously, with that the entire division gets re-orged and loses focus on work and goals. The current leadership does not look very bright either, results are yet to be seen.

There is a weird nepotism culture at SVB, whenever there is a leadership change, the leaders and their subs get a free hand at bringing their friends, family, neighbors, etc. and with that, the entire work culture changes. This has happened multiple times in the last few years. Right now, it's in the technology and product team. >50% of these teams are now completely new and hired via friends and family offer and have utter disregard for everyone who is not part of their new ""team"".

There are no career opportunities in technology, there's not even a roadmap or job leveling. For many, they don't even know if by some miracle they get promoted what will that title be. Management will hire someone external than promote internal, as there is always a friend, family or referral waiting in line."

Our team is overworked and stressed while we are trying to find a workaround since we have no system to work with. Executives have basically told our team to figure it out.

- Lots of dinners and events to join if you are market facing
- Unlimited vacation policy
- Most people are nice within the org","- SVB intentionally underpays and tries to maintain a lean structure. However, this is a bank that requires lots of human and capital investments into operations. No one wants to work for you if there isn't a fair reward/output ratio across functions.

- Extremely political. As folks like Mike D rises up in the org, people he trusts get promoted faster. Mostly nothing to do with talent but everything to do if their thought process aligns with his. And similar goes to other members within the steering committee. Not a bright future for the bank when you keep doing story telling on diversity while your own leadership table has zero diversity. Having 2-3 women at the table has nothing to do with diversity. You need diversity on career background, race, age, and geography.

- SVB went through at least 6 annual re-orgs in the last few years with the hope to break things down. The results are horrible. One team that really needs to be re-org'd is HR but nothing happened to them. Same drills every day. And never spent time/money to actually provide onboarding and career training when half of the company has been there for less than 3 years.

- Less than 20% of SVB staff is actually tech-savvy. Most people have no clue and no interest in what SVB's clients actually do. Most people within SVB can't even actually tell what are some of the main subsidiaries of the financial group and don't even know how the organization makes its money."

I have been here a few years and normally a company gets better - sadly - it’s the opposite. 

Nepotism has taken a forefront and because of this unskilled people are put into very high roles. These are the people running projects and making decisions - which is very unfortunate since we don’t get paid to churn. The drop in price stock is a painful indicator of how poorly we execute. The only way to move forward is to organize the work, value to talent, and have a solid plan for execution. If things stay the way they are that will never happen.

We have had two organized walk outs/teams quiting within the organization. In IT we had almost the entire network team quite all within 1 week and on the business side we had an entire PES team walk out on the same day across two offices. If this isn't a heads up to management then I don't know what else will. 

In IT all we see is micro management, a senior leadership of yes men and a culture of fear and retribution. Management says one things but does something completely different.

Example, SVB' has a documented work from home policy and a process to implement a work from home schedule but the leadership team questions anyone that has followed this process and has a work from home schedule on place.

Currently our longtime CSO has been promoted to CIO and hoping that he will see the dysfunction within the IT org, specifically Engineering and Operations and work to fix it as soon as possible before we lose many more talented people."

They cut head count after someone leaves and they don’t backfill. Instead new roles and leaders in other departments get created within orgs but what about the missing headcount? Does exec leadership care about the issues? Nope.

Mid level management are useless and are pretty much there because they can discard judgment at the door and could bring themselves to compliment each of JC’s stupid ideas.  And speaking of mid management, some are decent people and others clearly are taking advantage of their authority in the market. Asking your admin to lie on your expense report, making fun of associates, creating an office culture of cool kids (with whom you speak with your airhead tone) and nerds..... is not ok.

The newly appointment Chief Compliance Officer is the worst, if you ever wonder how Wells Fargo got into phony account opening scandal last year and shed management responsibility by firing floor level employees when things got exploded, well, he is the walking post of that rotten culture.  it is well known by everyone at the Bank how he screwed up the BSA/AML division and openly talked about his ability of putting out ""smoking mirrors"" to upper management and examiners, now he is promoted to even run the compliance department.

However, under its current leadership that wave is destined to crash, and crash hard it will!  A recent employee engagement survey has unturned horrific results of discontent amongst the staff across many departments.  There is talk about addressing these issues but nothing has been done yet.  Employees have lost hope and are either leaving on their own or being forced to leave if they dare express their voices.  It’s a terrible shame!  I was once proud to be an SVBer, but that time has passed.

It is clear that leadership is focused on the shareholders, but enough is never enough.  Even with a meteoric rise in stock price, the staff is treated as an expendable commodity.  Long gone are the days of the family culture which is still promoted in a desperate attempt to retain talent.  I’ve lost count of times I’ve heard coworkers say they are hanging on just long enough for the upcoming bonus before they have had enough.

The worst part of all is the toxic culture of leadership which has poisoned everything.  The expectation for privileged treatment has trickled down across all departments.  Rather than do what is right, staff is pandering to the top percent, just to make them happy, regardless of that might be best for the company."

Recent reorgs have no direct reports that are women to the new president. Women on the board are not in revenue generating roles and the long time SVB woman who led the commercial bank was slowly squeezed out and it unclear what she is working on now.  SVB hires senior women but doesn't think about developing who they already have.   

Our management has used terms like ""not lowering the bar"" and at a townhall our CEO flubbed an answer about whether there was a diversity problem at the bank.  SVB follows the herd. I f VCs care about women in tech and public opinion is there, SVB will too. If VCs start to talk about race, maybe SVB will too but for now it barely knows how to talk about women in the workplace. 

Diversity and inclusion teams are not effective because there is no desire by the majority to shake up the status quo that has worked for them.  Diversity and Inclusion teams are led by HR which does not hold credibility at the bank because HR is there to protect SVB and not advocate for employees.  

To be clear, there are well meaning men and women at SVB who support diversity and inclusion but that isnt enough.  

Lately there has also been tension between those brought in to help the bank ""go pro"" and old timers who are feeling unappreciated.    Also going pro has been used in a menacing way/veiled threat/corporate jargon to hide behind unpopular choices.

Additionally, I read some of the other reviews and it is totally true that IT is a mess and the technological debt for a tech client serving bank is enormous.    Maybe the lenders are doing ok but most divisions are going through changes."

- Approaching CCAR Hurdle of $50.0 Bn and the associated changes (while well planned for by management) are hammering certain teams with busy work as opposed allowing for continued focus on loan growth/product penetration and associated credit quality; 
- Regional Markets are punished by the underwriting thesis i.e. if equity funding is light, SVB competes against many of the Middle Market Banks as ABL deals are a more vanilla approach;

I love how my job keeps me on my toes, bringing out the best in me. I'm part of the CCAR team, where turnaround time, accuracy and efficiency are crucial. The good part is that I'm working with the best of the best. As stressful and challenging as it could be, I feel tremendous support from not only the project team but most importantly management. 

SVB is great about recognizing and rewarding hard work and good performance. They give out awards, recognition and on-the-spot bonuses throughout the year. Even better, you don't need to wait for mid-year or year-end performance reviews but Management actually takes time to schedule 1:1 meetings with the employees to provide feedback and encourage open communication. Management, in general, has an open-door policy and are very approachable.

On top of all these, camaraderie between employees is the best I've seen. There's constantly something going on - offsite events, picnics, community service, happy hour events. We had our Christmas party at a Casino last year where they set up tables/games for us, so fun!

They smile at you even if they do not know you and make you feel welcomed.,"There is an absolute lack of good leadership and management across the company. Fearful managers and leaders do not care for employee development and growth. Only the tenure in company and the relationships count for promotion and appreciation of good work. Few teams like CCAR Stress Testing and IT Client Services / Information Management / CCAR Data Governance teams are dreadful teams to work for. There are incompetent people who are not fit for management role but still promoted to Director and Head of the department roles. Employees are treated like a piece of garbage and slaves. In CCAR Stress Testing business team, highly qualified and experienced people are hired and told to work for IT. There is no basic management provided.  For eg, no 1:1 meetings, lack of clarity on roles and responsibilities and expectations are common in CCAR team. There is no freedom for doing things differently and no place for people with creative and out of the box thinking. One person is loaded with responsibilities of 3-4 persons and no help and resources provided to do your job effectively. IT CCAR Data Governance team has a toxic work culture.  This team has nobody with Data Governance experience. Managers hire highly qualified people and make them work on their own terms which becomes frustrating. It is the most bureaucratic team exercising old management style (“Yes Sir” mentality). When you question anything, you are alienated and pushed out of the team and the company. Only people in the inner circle are promoted based on relationship with manager and not based on performance. All the work is done by outsourcing consultants and employees are just acting as middle man between consultants and Business. Consultants have all the critical knowledge and they do not share knowledge for job security. Eventually they are hired as full time employees in this team. Business is very much dependent on Data Warehouse for any data related stuff as there is no sharing or documentation available for Business to understand and use data effectively. Technology project and program managers are treated by this team as puppets and PMs do what functional managers tell them to do."

There was never a boring day and always hand my hands full and things to do.  In fact, more projects than resources most of the time but that was a good thing in some ways.  My direct manager was probably one of the best managers I have every had.  I can think maybe just 1 other manager I had that I would say was better, however, that manager and I have become best friends now for many years so that would be hard to beat.  The camaraderie is awesome at SVB.  My co-workers I worked with daily are all great guys and ladies.  I would come back in a heart beat if I decided to leave my new company.","The only cons that I can think of is the no working remote policy our department had.  This wasn't necessary a company policy but a department policy.  I will say that they are looking at changing this policy soon.  I would still be working for SVB if they would have allowed remote working from home.  I am not talking about just once in a while telecommuting, but we wanted to move out of state where SVB didn't have an office and would have had to work from home 100% of the time.  The only other con which really isn't a con is how the desk are setup to be more of a open environment to collaborate.  It was a great idea but I myself am a fairly loud person and other groups near us didn't care that I was loud.  :)"

Why do they say it is unlimited?   When an IT person leaves they dont have to pay for any unused accrued vacation time.   Having to pay out that much accrued vacation weighs heavily on the balance sheet -- great way to cut costs.  Buyer beware."

CEO is commonly regarded as aloof, or indifferent -- I don't think that is true... I think he genuinely cares about the staff and culture at SVB.

It was great to create relationships with C-level clients and venture capitalists to learn their strategies to execute. The fringe benefits are somewhat superior to most financial services firms (ESOP, ESPP, Health and Dental).","Many in middle management are drunk on their on Kool-Aid and think they are the smartest person in the room. After having conversations with VCs, they start to delude themselves into thinking that THEY are as smart and valuable as VCs. The culture is very cannibalistic and very political. The firm even encourages it. They had training sessions about 'developing your personal brand.' The effect of it was a culture that very 'back stabbing' and completely devoid of trust. I have never seen so much corporate in-fighting and political posturing. In terms of compensation, the hours are closer to I-Bank hours while the pay is closer to commercial banking.

The COO took charge of IT, and promised to make things better, but things have gone downhill with utter chaos and confusion. SVB  needs to realize THE ROOT CAUSE and fix it asap. There is a agile initiative happening in Tiburon, with idea of increased productivity, and FTEs involved are required to travel 2-2.5 hrs one way, with commute involving train system + walk system & ferry system. Talk about increased productivity with 5 hours of precious employee time lost in commute. There had been lot of incompetent hiring in IT senior management, and competent people are suffering, some of whom left and more are on the tipping point. They want to hire talent but talent is not allowed to bring new ideas, and told to learn the svb way first, prove themselves and then bring ideas. By the time talented people prove themselves, the talented people have reached level of incompetency and outdated skills as others. Performance reviews are joke, as rating is already decided by management weeks in advance, and then directs are asked to enter self-reviews. Reviews are based on what others think of you, and not what you have delivered, so everyone joins the race of keeping others happy and stop delivering."
417,Silicon Valley Bank,Applicants beware,2015-09-01,3.0,Administrative Assistant III,SVB Capital has a great benefits package for full-time employees. Compensation is competitive with other VC firms. Managing Partners are great at what they do.,"Managing Partners at SVB Capital have no people management or leadership skills. The business unit culture is not congruent with the culture of the company as a whole. They do not value their support staff which results in high turnover and low team morale. Demands and expectations are often conflicting and unclear. The business unit has been around for 15 years and still operates like a startup. There is no standard operating procedures for day-to-day tasks. 

If you have any opinions, keep them to yourself because the MPs will later use them against you.

If you are considering a job, please do yourself a favor and ask the hiring manager about how many people have left their organization and why - you will get the idea. Also know the hiring manager well, as some of them especially CTO are incapable managers.
Till last year IT was in mood to hire like crazy and all of a sudden at start of this year - no hiring. This is the level of strategic planning the temp CIO has brought on. 
I have heard this used to be a professionally managed IT team till the CIO change in 2013. What I can see is the team spirit is totally subdued, no real motivation, no attention to real problems, no sense of accountability.

HR seems to stack lowest compared to the other companies. The company freely uses the marketing lingo - employees are our key assets, but does little to follow it. They are unable to do anything to retain or motivate key personnel looking at recent exits by senior personnel."

441,Silicon Valley Bank,"Good, but Flaky at Times",2015-03-21,4.0,Intern,Workplace culture is great. You can tell that most offices really feel like family. Immediate managers are wonderful people. They really work to train everyone to be really good at what they do and want everyone to take pride in their work. Managers are always happy to help and train if there's something you want to understand better.,"For a company that focuses so much on innovation, sometimes upper management can be a little resistant to change.

Decent compensation and benefits, feels less of bank and more of a start-up. Culture rewards risk taking.","Business stakeholders do not have capability to convert the company vision to strategic initiatives or stick to them. Lot of decisions are based on perceptions and not well thought out.
IT is badly broken. It was in decent shape till mid-2013 when a new CIO was hired for transformation after the prior CIO left. The new CIO proved to be a fatal experiment and managed to dismantle the org, demotivate almost everyone, increased budget without output, and create a no accountability culture. COO is currently managing IT, and the situation is getting worse as there is genuine leadership vaccum in IT. Not a great place to be if you are looking for a growing career."

They demoralize people and make people not productive. Especially if you are applying for the back office like Marketing or Finance or IT, RUN away or don't join this place. 

Moral is at all times low at these departments. Very high turnover. Some stayed 2 months, some don't give notices. Some left without jobs waiting. But all of these because they are so dissatisfied with management. These people are getting paid a lot of money and yet they leave! Some managers even had all of the workers left but 1 person.

Lots of favoritisms. So if you are a favorite than your career can go up. No real growth."

Inside Silicon Valley this works well as the bank has a stellar reputation but is problematic outside the Northern CA region. Senior management on the life science team is excellent and visionary, less so on the tech side particularly outside the Silicon Valley region.  The training program for new recent college graduate hires is superb.","Silicon Valley Bank has lost its way to support technology entrepreneurs as it seeks today to only fund those with VC backing who are already successful. Work environment is highly competitive, territorial and backbiting despite its newly defined mission to be United.  Expectation to work 24/7 and lack of teamwork along with poor management that lack vision, integrity and raw intelligence lead to a stressful, hypocritical culture.  Turnover remains high with new hires given lack of promotion opportunities and inbred management that seek to protect their backs and cronies."
