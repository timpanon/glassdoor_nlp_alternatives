1,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,Sacrificing morale and quality for the widow’s mite,2022-03-14,3.0,Software Engineer,The atmosphere was great and it was good to work with people who genuinely want to build up the organization. Insurance and retirement are hard to beat.,"- It is hard to get any sort of increase in compensation without finding a new position. I worked here for 5+ years and was only given an increase of $8000 from start to finish. I was essentially getting a pay decrease as the rate of inflation outpaced my pay raises.

- Quality of product and candidates was lacking as the church relied more on temporary and low skilled employees. Experience and quality were often sacrificed in the name of saving “the widow’s mite”

- There is a significant lack of diversity both in race and gender. There was only one female engineer in a group of around 50."
2,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,Great place to grow,2022-03-29,5.0,Senior Customer Experience Manager,"Supportive, developmental environment for those willing to fully engage.  Competitive salary and benefits.",Most departments still require a tie. Some even require suite coat.

It takes awhile to get the attention of the decision makers because they are so far up the line."
5,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,I love working here,2022-03-25,5.0,"Director, Human Resources","Contribution to the cause, great people","CoVid, sometimes there are elements of bureaucracy"
6,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,Amazing Employer,2022-03-04,5.0,S&I Coordinator,"Working for the church is a blessing in so many ways. You cannot beat the work environment, and they do strive to do all they can to take good care of their employees. Highly recommend it!","Separating from constant church influence can be an interesting balance. One would imagine that would be a strength, but it can be hard to hear your own thoughts in a self-actuated way vs. a socialized thought process."
7,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,Wonderful Place to Work,2022-03-03,5.0,Systems Engineer,A friendly and nurturing work environment that focuses on improvement. Great work-life balance and amazing medical benefits.,"For me, personally, the largest downside is the dress code. Some locations have a business casual dress code, some positions have a uniform, but most head quarter locations are suit/shirt & tie type dress code."

Merit raise process annually. Very good benefits (such as health care, 401k, paid leave). Great colleagues. Subsidized UTA pass. Free employee gym. Competitive salaries.","In recent years, it has becoming increasingly difficult to get promotions (across the organization). While salary and benefits are very competitive, there is not a bonus pay system for highest performers, nor are there perks like free tickets, gift after working a certain number of years, etc."
10,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,Toxic Workplace- Decent Pay,2022-03-31,3.0,Contractor,"Well-known community, lots of free time",Don't be gay and work here. It's not fun- trust me.

15,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,Best Job I've ever had,2022-01-20,5.0,Career Development Counselor,Supervisors trust me and treat me as a professional. The management truly is interested in our wellbeing. My personal life mission and the mission of The Church as perfectly aligned. Strong encouragement and empowerment to maintain healthy work/life balance.,"Opportunities for advancement are not as common, at least in my particular department. Openings outside of Utah are fairly rare and difficult to come by."
16,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,Well Below Market Pay,2022-02-08,2.0,UXD,Good benefits package. Technology structure is improving but still sprawling.,"Low pay compared to other similar roles in Utah. ICS pays lower than average, then gets a 10% discount on your labor (tithing). Constant knee-jerking due to incompetent division directors. Very few tools to motivate employees. Constantly told “if you don’t like it here, go somewhere else.”"
17,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,Blurred the lines between your religion and the corporation,2021-09-07,2.0,Quality Assurance,"If you are good at being a member of the good old boys club, you will do well.","Not a fan of having to show anyone my temple recommend except temple workers, my bishopric, and Jesus Christ. 

Human resources is a joke. They are not there to protect you, they are there to protect the name of the church. And many times that means sacrificing the morally right thing to protect the name. I personally never had this problem, but I was around it so often and I felt guilty about it. I struggled that in the church history department was trying to being transparent but rewrite history in a favorable light. If you notice Church Historians are no longer Historians, they are Lawyers.
Glad I got out, unfortunately I was stuck there too long. I struggled with business decisions are made only by the spirit. I believe we all can use the spirit in our work, but only higher management are worthy to recieve the spirit. 
I also didn't like how they don't have real health insurance, they are called Benefit Administrators. They denied my wife's hysterectemy due to cancer risk because we didn't have enough kids (I only have 4) to justify a hysterectomy we needed 6.
They also showed a video upon hiring that said they have a competitive salary but take into account the law of concentration. That is not consecrated, that is a tax. If I could opt into it then it would be consecrated.
Be careful, this could blur the lines of your faith with struggles with corporation."
18,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,Culture is great,2022-03-12,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"But culture, insurance and other benefits, working together for a common goal, supportive management.","Excellent culture, insurance and other benefits, working together for a common goal, supportive management.

19,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,Can be a great experience or you can be sidelined depending on management relationship,2021-09-28,3.0,Product Manager,"I was given a lot of responsibility and worked with some very bright people. The purpose of the work is hard to match and I generally had a good work life balance. I really enjoyed what I did, especially when I had managers who really knew me and empowered me to perform.","The employee review system and yearly compensation is terrible. Management who determined raises were several levels higher than me and had little to no interaction with me. They could not know of my performance and gave the higher raises to their favorites. The ATI program while intentions are good does not function. If you are friends with management they treat you well, if you try to promote change or give options outside the box you can be sidelined despite all the good/sacrifice you have done. Politics are very much a part of the organization and there is usually a lack of transparency."
20,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,Good company and environment with good long-term benefits package,2022-02-11,4.0,Audio Engineer,Good wholesome work environment and great company mission to help people all over the world.,Company headquarters is in a mid-market city that is growing faster (cost of living) than the pay/compensation which is typically at or below market average by hiring practices.

During the past 2 years of COVID, they have allowed us to work from home to keep us safe. The benefits are great. They are one of the few who still have retirement on top of the 401K match. A professional environment, respectful of others. Very stable company with so many job opportunities.",So much work that sometimes requires a lot of overtime.

The workload for this position was extremely heavy and unbalanced. Manager Mr. A was inflexible for my disability accommodation. When I quit during training due to massive stress and anxiety, and manager wouldn't work with me. The job description wasn't as described during hiring interview. I was promised perks that weren't actually offered to someone in my position. I wasn't able to give notice because I was still TRAINING, but later found out that they marked me re-hireable due to this. This corporation doesn't walk the walk that the church 's doctrines teach."

Great benefits. Regular performance reviews and potential for raises. Plenty of time-off, sick leave, and overtime pay. Routine work.","Not an inclusive or diverse workforce. I witnessed more racism, xenophobia, homophobia, etc. than any other workplace. Only men hold upper-management positions. Little to no growth opportunities (the term they use is lateral movement). Employees must be current temple recommend holders and can face termination if they don't, which includes being a full tithe payer (10% of income). Very little autonomy available."

Overall benefits and employee discounts are great. 

Coworkers are great people.","The Operations Managers are the biggest cons in working here. 

They micro-manage. 

They distrust the employees but rationalize it in a lot of different ways. 

They've bad mouthed employees that report to them to other people.

They over scrutinize and set unrealistic expectations when custodial teams are short-staffed.

They only meet with regular custodians when giving disciplinary action or when there's been a complaint.

They ignore opinions different than theirs. At one point I had suggested making some changes in the way a cleaning assignment was designed in order to make it less burdensome and I was accused of being a liar because they felt like there hadn't been any issues previously. A simple ""no"" would have been fine."

The organization is based on misinformation and inexcusable lies. I wasted many years here thinking I was doing good only to find out I was helping this organization hurt people in ways they will never recover from.,"There is nothing positive to say about an organization that hurts people emotionally and spiritually. A few easy Google searches will reveal lies about this church that took me nearly 50 years to uncover. I spent over ten years working here and now I am so damaged I want to die. This organization destroyed my career, my family, and my will to live. I encourage everyone who reads this to expose this organization for the sake of the human race. I gave everything to my work here and have nothing but regret for the work I did. This organization has a singular goal of recruiting new members and taking their money and praise in the name of an imaginary God to build the leaders egos and financial security."

Path to advancement can be a little unclear.
59,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,Good Job for Experience,2021-11-30,2.0,Business Analyst,"-People are usually kind (minimal yelling)
-People care about helping the work progress- I like knowing that I am making a difference
-The company generally splurges on good software
-Good health care and benefits
-You will learn a lot because there is a lot to be done","-Sexism (I have been asked multiple times when I'm going to have kids, and my manager told me that a co-worker told him not to hire me because I would just take maternity benefits and leave... I've worked here for five years and also can't have kids, so that has been a real struggle.)
-Overworking- for a period of about six months, I worked 50-70 hour weeks because two people on my team quit. It took more than six months for management to hire replacements, so I was expected to do the work of three people and was constantly berated for not getting things done. Overtime is expected because it is the Lord's work. I took a day and a half of leave last week for the first time in half of a year and was made to feel super guilty about it, someone literally said, ""glad YOU had a break!"" to me.
-Poor pay and advancement- Do not expect your job to keep up with inflation, no matter how many hours you put in and no matter how hard you work. The people who determine raises do not know you, and the pay-raise process is archaic. Do not expect to ever be able to advance if you are in any kind of technical field. I've been told that I was ""absolutely crucial to my team"" and ""had done so much"" and then given a 2% raise (""the highest in the department!"") from what I was told.
-Fudging Numbers and general dishonesty- I've been asked for data on multiple occasions where the results did not look pretty and was then accordingly told to show it a different way or cut off a couple months' worth of data at the end of a graph. Nobody cares about your opinion or being honest, they just want to look good.
-Split technology department- ICS and church employees don't work well together; because of the contract model, there are many crucial datasets built with Jenga tiles. Models are built really hastily, are rarely documented, and then they are abandoned as the people who built them simply leave because their contract ended."

Once entry level employees obtain an advanced degree, Masters or even a PhD , they are stuck within the lower pay grades. 
One cannot and will not move up within the ranks towards mid-level or even senior level management from entry level positions (analysts, coordinators, etc.). The organization has lost and will continue losing talent by keeping this archaic salary pay grade structure and policy.

None of the supervisors have management training, and there is no way for them to receive feedback as to their performance. Coworkers are frequently jealous, and unable to deal with conflict face to face. There is a substantial amount of gossip, betrayal, and terrible communication. You would expect more from “the” Church of Jesus Christ. But sadly that just isn’t the case. There is no ability to think freely or to voice your opinion without threat or dismissal. My employment here has led me to therapy for years. You also don’t get paid much. Terrible, terrible experience in which they control every aspect of your life. They need leaders who care more about people than policies that have existed since the 70s and are sexist and behind the times. Would not recommend."

I *really* like the work and the work environment and the people. The church is very competitive with salary and benefits. The health insurance through DMBA is especially generous--better than any large employer I am aware of. On-site gym and health center (and cafeteria) at downtown Salt Lake City campus. 401k matching. Maternity leave (7 weeks). Inexpensive UTA train and bus passes. On-site parking, free (including a lot of covered parking). Every department potentially has a different culture and not every manager or situation is ideal, but overall people are trying to work hard and be kind and do quality work. Great sense of mission and unity that can motivate you even through more boring or challenging times. Employer extremely stable--not going anywhere. Merit raise evaluations annually lead to raises virtually every year for most employees.","Dress code is quite conservative--for example, men required to wear suit and tie daily at most downtown Salt Lake City locations. No bonuses or other similar incentives. Slow-moving, conservative bureaucracy can be frustrating. Some departments are relying more and more on contract employees. Organization is reluctant to move toward flex time or telecommuting or other nontraditional approaches. Organization is extremely male-centric (probably north of 90 percent) in leadership positions at the managing director and director levels, though that seems to be changing a bit.

350,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,It's gone downhill the last few years,2019-09-11,1.0,Publisher,Some rare opportunities can pop up where you're able to contribute to really meaningful projects. Most people really develop great relationships with other coworkers on their teams.,"Department management is super unqualified to do their job and are completely out of touch. Finance and budget is really screwy and it messes with project deadlines and destroys creativity. For some reason within the last few years, management has decided it's time to downsize (not based on any actual data) but because they've ""felt impressed"" to do so. They even told us, ""we predict that the work load over the next year is going to significantly decrease. so in order to prepare for that, we're going to let all of our outsource contracts expire. our current workforce should be enough to handle that reduced load."" Then into the next year the workload more than doubled. They essentially said, ""oops sorry. we kinda goofed on that one. But no we're not going to hire additional employees to help with the workload. "" In fact, as more and more people leave, most of those positions are not being backfilled. Budget cuts are everywhere. No more professional development. No more offsites. No more travel. No more team lunches. And when employees leave, their spots are not backfilled. All-hands meetings are a complete joke and are extremely demotivating because of the shocking lack of awareness our management team has of what's going on in the department. This is the most siloed organization I have ever seen. It's absolutely full of territorialism, backbiting, ladder climbing, and ridiculous politics. Product management constantly plays what many like to call ""general authority poker"" where a project's priority is not determined by the actual researched needs of members throughout the world, but how many general authorities the PMs can ""sell"" their product ideas to. (I've seen this happen first hand btw and it's disgusting.) Our department sends out workforce surveys all the time, and even reports back to us on what the most common points of feedback are. Yet no changes are ever made. If you work here, you will be ignored, you will be undervalued, and you will most likely never see any of your work go anywhere."

You know what you are working on is contributing to either a humanitarian or ecclesiastical cause, which is a great feeling.

The IT Department at the Church (the department I worked for) does a good job at staying on top of technology.  They are typically quick to adopt trends early on.

The work environment is awesome.  It may put off some, but I liked starting the work day in prayer with my co-workers.  It infused us with unity and purpose that can't be manufactured through traditional team-building exercises (we did those, too, though!).","The Church struggles to remain market competitive for IT staff.  My pay started out great, but it did not increase like it does in a for-profit company.  (That is not why I left, mind you.  They definitely take care of their employees.)

It seems to be more competitive at entry level and less competitive the higher you get. Good place to start at.","Sometimes the pace of the work can be slow; as in, making decisions and translating them to action can take a long time. Too many hands in the pot and everyone is afraid of conflict and saying it the way it is. That can be bad when a project is headed the wrong direction and needs a correction. When you are hired you watch these training videos about how everyone and their ideas are important and everyone can make a difference.
