0,Twilio,Would love to boomerang; pay OK,2022-03-30,5.0,Business Analyst,"Great people, great culture - you can ping anyone and they are super helpful and friendly.","Not enough pay; below market and it was a mess at the time to try to advance despite getting exceptional on internal ratings regularly. Politics in middle management, affects everyone. High attrition in leadership."
1,Twilio,A great company that still has amazing growth,2022-03-10,5.0,GTM Team,"Strong, diverse culture that expects employees to act independently and empowers them to make their own decisions. Not a top-down hierarchy at all. A great product that developers truly love and respect. Visionary leadership and a very strong brand in the industry.","-Constant growth makes it hard to keep up with new teams and team members, especially in the Covid era. There has been some attrition but for the most part these are long-time employees achieving their full equity packages and moving on on great terms with the company, and often at companies within the Twilio or API economy.

-Clearer information on promotions, expectation in the company is that promotion is unlikely except for a very select few, and most open management/more senior roles are usually filled with external candidates."
2,Twilio,The Best Onboarding Experience Ever!,2022-01-19,5.0,Senior Product Designer,"Twilio has the best onboarding/brand experience internally. They offer tons of useful company tutorials, remote resources, and apps that new hires can learn and take time to fully onboard for a month as well as attending company virtual events which are very inspiring. The Company Kick Off sessions are amazing and Jeff, the CEO has a huge amount of energy, positive, and inclusive attitude.

The company has been growing exponentially over the couple of years, and also taking off great missions like becoming an anti-racist company by hiring a Chief Diversity Officer and encourage everyone to truly embrace and promote the culture of diversity and inclusion. Also, the company tries to make a real social impact by organizing employee donation/charity support programs. I'm proud to be a Twilion! Truly a developer centric culture. They know their customers, users, and employees. I'd recommend Twilio to any of my developer friends.","Not cons, but It's a bit hard to know what other teams are doing due to so many different teams, segmented businesses, and remote teams in many different global regions as the company expands through acquisitions and business growth. Like this year's Twilio kick-off slogan ""Come together!"", I'm looking forward to learn other businesses within Twilio and how other teams work.

Compared to the scale and impact of Twilio, the brand recognition and understanding of what Twilio does to common public is smaller than its business size as of right now, but I love they have been focusing on improving the quality of products and scaling the business first."
3,Twilio,Career side track,2022-03-02,3.0,Customer Success Manager (CSM),"Generally great people to work with, a very strong inclusive culture. Some good benefits but falling behind top tier employers fast with regressive policies like limited time working remotely in another country.",Frenetic work pace especially on operations side. Lots of broken inefficient processes where bodies are used to bridge the gap leading to constant burn out. Comp is about 75% of market norms with miserly yearly increases even with promotions that are mostly based on 'visibility' - has alot of fake it till you make it. eTeam has yet to effectively address persistent concerns about inflation and currently gives it mostly lip service while giving more attention to niche concerns like DEI than broader employee issues. Work life balance is a slogan that gets lot of airtime but zero effective change due to constant under resourcing and poor resouece management overall stemming from cost controls.
4,Twilio,Trouble Ahead :-/,2022-01-27,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Twilio has an amazing product, track record, and ethos. I do feel confident in its long run vision, but there are a lot of short to medium term concerns below.
- Many of the leaders that we’ve promoted up the ranks over the years are amazing role models.
- People are collaborative and super helpful.
- Great progress towards doing good with ERGs, opportunities to volunteer, anti-racist frameworks.","Terrifying retention issues and seemingly no attempt from the company to address these: 
- Folks from acquisitions are leaving Segment and Sendgrid at all levels, making merging technologies and processes extra difficult. 
- Long-tenured Twilions will create a massive exodus in the next few months because their stock options are running dry and they are not considered valuable by HR. We will lose incredible talent, knowledge, and fabric of culture as a result. 
- Rough work-life balance. I’ve been working here 5+ years and never had the option of a sabbatical. Burnout is inevitable. 
- We’re being asked to work cross-team without proper frameworks for it. 
- The new Twilio Magic with its forced optimism feels toxic. I miss our old values."
5,Twilio,"Lots of Politics, No Direction",2022-03-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Great at attracting some really amazing people to work with. You will meet a lot of very smart people.,"Twilio is a company with a lot of great potential, but as soon as you get in the door you realize that they have hired a lot of R&D leaders who are more interested in ""empire building"" rather than actually ensuring that Twilio is a successful company. As a result, there is a LOT of politics and a lot of turnover as smart people don't want to deal with this nonsense. Most (if not all departments) have been expressing that they don't have the software & tools to do their job for years now. However, instead of making those investments, Twilio spends those resources hiring more senior management, many of whom are so redundant that it just creates more infighting for all the ""empire building""."
6,Twilio,Lack of Leadership,2022-03-08,3.0,Leadership,"CEO has the right intention and leads with empathy. The company has the right vision for a communications company, but just needs to execute on it.","In the last 6 months, the company has lost a handful of strong C-level executives and VPs. Attrition is bad. For the leadership still there, many don't seem to know what they're doing. It's smoke and mirrors. I've seen leaders go on leave and have their jobs replaced by others after coming back. Some people who are put in leadership roles do not even know the functions of their own team. They hire some strong new leaders, but they end up leaving because of the toxic culture."
7,Twilio,Good company with growing pains,2022-03-30,4.0,Growth Account Executive,"Great culture and benefits, everyone willing to help each other, industry leading product, easy sell",Company has doubled in size since I started which has caused some growing pains which is normal. There is some disconnect in communication with leadership and employees making a lot of people frustrated.
8,Twilio,"Great Benefits, Some Process Issues",2022-03-29,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Twilio is great about taking care of their people. Time off, salary/stock and health benefits are all great. 

Career mobility can happen relatively quickly in most departments. 

Empathetic managers at the front line and middle levels.","There have been some growing pains as the company expanded exponentially over the past couple years - some processes and tooling have not scaled efficiently. Progress is slow but steady and headed in the right direction.

Some senior leaders manage top down instead of taking input from ICs who have valuable insight."
9,Twilio,Twilio is a great company,2022-03-28,5.0,Inside Sales Representative,"Amazing team atmosphere, very thorough onboarding process and company values.",I don't have any as of yet.
10,Twilio,Growing Company has its Challenges,2022-02-23,3.0,Senior Account Executive,"Base Pay, benefits, time off, role variety, very supportive front line manager.","Rapid growth has lent to silo'd groups within the org
Multiple acquisitions consuming integration of product, people, process taking a lot of time
Many unsettled Twilions due to many C-Level departures in 2021
Lots of focus on social issues - sometimes to the detriment of positive work environment
Leadership communication methods on substantive issues is weak.
Sales Comp plan is super complicated - Quota defined in vacuum. OTE outlined at hire is unattainable for many.
Comp Plan document is super long and is difficult to consume, let alone explain lump sum realization clawbacks."
11,Twilio,Great company overall,2022-03-16,5.0,Marketing Manager,"Great products, strong leadership. Very fast growing even at its current size.","With so many people and growing so fast, things still feel a bit hectic. At least in Marketing."
12,Twilio,"Started off as a great place, been on a slow decline since.",2022-03-08,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Amazing Team Mates

Remote Work

Generous PTO","Stagnant Promotions - many employees are not promoted and or looked over for promotions. 

Pay increases - Its no secret people are leaving Twilio en masse for higher paying companies."
13,Twilio,A sinking ship,2022-02-21,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Supportive manager and teammates; some smart co-workers; good perks such as untracked PTO, mega backdoor roth, multiple time offs a year, lots of company swags; good WLB","Pay is below average,
Lots of turnover this past year with tons of the C-level execs, VPs, ICs quitting, 
Not so transparent c-level,
The quality of the new hires keeps going down, 
The company burns a lot of money on events, parties, celebrity speakers, conferences, etc. but also manages to underpay employees,
The company and the extremely vocal cohort of employees (typically on the slack channels) very often make very bold statements on sensitive, touchy social and political polarizing subjects and this has made the company an uncomfortable place for everyone who doesn't agree with them"
14,Twilio,"Amazing company, culture, and future",2022-01-07,5.0,Sales Enablement Business Partner,"When you come to Twilio, you'll quickly see that everyone here is a collective community with the same goals in mind and are always ready and able to lend a hand and help you on your journey. Each and every employee is considered in every decision that's made and you know your voice is being heard and that you can create real impact here that's heard from leadership down. Twilio prioritizes your well-being and puts their employees first. It's the type of work environment I only ever read and dreamed about before coming here. You have control over your career path and there's nothing standing in your way to get yourself to the next level in your career. Our growth has been a literal rocket ship and the sky is the limit with how we can continue to grow.",Some of the back-end processes are still a bit behind -- typical for a company that's growing at this rate.
15,Twilio,Amazing Company,2022-03-03,5.0,Account Executive,"Absolutely love the company. This is the first time I would ever say this, but this is a company that truly cares about who we are as people, mental health, work life balance, equal pay, and the list goes on. our CEO truly lives by Twilio magic and encourages employees to be the best version of who they are.","stock market has decreased, but will bounce back."
16,Twilio,A toxic culture that is not magical,2022-03-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,To work remotely that’s it,"Don’t believe the smoke and mirrors that Twilio is a great place to work, it’s a toxic environment. The only magic is how employees just disappear.  People leave everyday—managers and leadership the worst I have seen and it’s rampant across the entire company.

Yes, you will see new jobs posted all the time, it’s not due to growth but  to fill roles that most employees leave within a year.

Tread carefully and do your homework talk to people who left, talk to people who work here, people leave companies for many reasons, but at Twilio, burnout is inevitable, no work life balance and utterly dysfunctional.

The attrition level is frightening, it’s never addressed always swept away."
17,Twilio,Amazing & Inspiring Company - Great Culture,2022-03-01,5.0,Account Executive,"-Amazing remote culture 

-Great leadership 

-Perks are incredible (fitness, cell-phone, WFH setup)

-Truly inspired by the values and employees that are hired

-Pay is VERY competitive in the market","None, honestly best company I’ve ever worked for."

19,Twilio,Probably will be great again in 2 years,2022-02-20,2.0,Senior Product Manager,"Perks
WLB
For the most part, employees are good people and hard workers
Growth outlook","Well...

Salary, even with recent changes, is not so great. RSU and stock volatility make the salary worse.
They're paying the piper for failing to plan for the rapid growth. Excessive churn in valuable employee cohorts (the people who built stuff and the people hired in the last year).
Their revenue producing products are seeing margins erode significantly from competition, impacting future growth.
Internal mobility is impossible given how siloed organizations and BUs are."
20,Twilio,Great Company Culture!,2022-03-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Empowering team culture and the Twilio value is real! Fast growing company with great opportunities.,No appealing perks like big tech companies; Data pipeline needs to be cleaned up and re-constructed
21,Twilio,Amazing high tech high growth company on the cutting edge of communications,2022-02-04,5.0,Principal Solutions Engineer,"Amazing business strategies being implemented. Acquisitions have put Twilio on the top tier across the board regardless of how you'd like to reach out to your customers. Overall, very respectful of your time and personal growth. Best company I've worked for so far.","Primarily a developer platform and it can be intimidating to those non-developers, but the onboarding and resources really help a lot. A million things going on at once. Tough to keep up, but the more you know the more valuable you are."
22,Twilio,Good place,2022-03-30,2.0,Pincipal Engineer,i loved twilio when i worked there.,nothing i can think of.
23,Twilio,Not Sales Friendly & Poor Infrastructure,2022-01-18,2.0,Sales Representative,Twilio has good benefits and really smart employees who you can learn from. They also have a good reputation so their name looks good on a resume.,"If you are in ""sales"", expect to do minimal selling and a lot of maintenance/account management. Twilio is self-service, but many customers do not know how to do the build themselves/leverage Twilio to the best of their ability and our support team is not great at helping. You will also deal with 5-10 billing issues a day because we can't invoice correctly. 

The training when you start is 3 days long to learn about the Twilio platform, but they don't cover anything when it comes to learning Twilio systems/the ins & outs of Twilio. This is important because the hardest part about selling Twilio, is Twilio. We have extremely poor infrastructure/systems. 

They also are misleading when it comes to career growth and their is no straight forward answers/paths built out on how to advance."
24,Twilio,"Solid Company, expected growing pains at this size",2022-03-25,4.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"Transparency, quality product, strong leadership","growing so fast, there is no ""culture"" your culture comes down to your individual team and leader, which is hit or miss"
25,Twilio,Major growing pains,2022-03-17,3.0,Sales Sales Enablement Manager,"The CEO is a passionate and inspirational leader. The companies moral values and stance on social issues is something that I think is truly unique and something other companies, especially this size, should aspire to. The product is excellent and there are lots of really amazing people.",Some poor leadership choices are burning people out and due to this there has been high turnover.
26,Twilio,"Amazing product, people, and customers",2022-01-05,5.0,Mid Market Account Executive,"This is the first company I've worked for that meets the trifecta: amazing product, really smart people that actively want to help you win, and great customers that love to use the product in very creative ways.

I feel that my sales impacts not only Twilio's bottom line, but help shape and mold the world around us and make it a better place.","Twilio is still scaling and has grown a lot since I started two years ago - with that said, there are some growing pains and internal processes and procedures could use some work, however the organization does make meaningful change to improve the experiences of both employees and customers."

A few bad seeds"
28,Twilio,Hectic and top-down atmosphere,2022-01-13,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Lots of opportunity if you're ambitious. Our CEO has a good heart.,"Long hours, especially for the months surrounding the SIGNAL conference. Meeting heavy culture - even as an IC, I would be in meetings sometimes from 8-6pm straight on top of my actual job. I felt like I was shuffled around a lot between teams and projects because our strategy was changing so often, although I would say the most painful changes were unintended consequences vs. strategic decisions (e.g., 4 managers in less than 6 months). There are certainly pockets of highly political/toxic people, but if you end up on a good team and heavily advocate for yourself you'll be fine. Our CEO/leadership has to remind everyone to be nice to each other periodically. Twilio will not take care of you. I can't say that I'd recommend working here for someone in an early stage of their career."

Great place to grow a career and if you are in sales, exceed your quota.",Sales team is still building the machine so some processes are still maturing but every quarter things improve and leadership take cares of you when things are a little wonky.

37,Twilio,It's Finally a place to call home,2021-07-08,5.0,Technical Recruiter,"I'm a recruiter here at Twilio that started off as a contractor and got converted within 6 months. So while it was scary to be a contractor, my hard work paid off and I really feel like my manager has my back. I would say pay is pretty competitive and I love that EVERYONE employed at Twilio gets stocks. We have great perks like gym, phone, book, desk set up reimbursements. 

But what I really love about this company is that I don't feel like a resource and I actually feel like I'm making a difference and that I 'count'. This company carries a lot of empathy from what I have seen. We had a snow storm in Austin, TX in Feb and they gave everyone $1K to go get a hotel room to stay warm. We also have two mental health weeks to take off in August and September that was just implemented. Basically the entire company shuts down. 

I feel very lucky to be employed at Twilio and the people I have placed have told me that they to feel lucky and that they hadn't been this happy at a company in a long time so I know it's not me as I always solicit feedback from people I have recruited here.","As a recruiter, we are growing at a RAPID pace so there are tons of jobs and it's a lot of work but to be honest, I love my job so it doesn't seem like work to me."

Twilio really does focus on employee wellness and fair compensation.","Literally the worst director level leaders I have ever experienced. They lack leadership skills, communication skills, and decision making skills. It made the job intolerable. I knew I couldn’t contribute in a meaningful way there because of this. I felt forced to look for a new job opportunity."
40,Twilio,Fast paced to chaotic,2022-01-05,3.0,Director,"Well paid, benefits, well leveraged business development because of market dominance and media exposure.
For the younger crowd its an exciting company environment full of perks.
It's good to have in the curriculum since other employers are aware of the tough selection process among other things that distinguish their candidates.","Toxic environment. Seems that in their attempt to hire the top of the top, the organization has homogenized into a crowd of psychopaths that brutally compete with each other for promotion. When something goes wrong, which inevitably does in fast-paced bold business plans, finger pointing begins and career sabotaging between peers develops with the proficiency that only the top of the top can execute. VPs will invariably and infallibly manage up and sacrifice a lamb within their teams when something goes wrong."

Benefits, fertility, wfh perks etc...","The Talent Acquisition team will bleed you dry. There is zero people care. Metrics are so high it's as if they had all the tools necessary to be bougie. Apart from their formally attractive stock, you are no longer paid enough to be harrased with gap to goals . GTM TA specifically is where talented recruiters go and leave needing therapy."

77,Twilio,Unlike Any Other Sales Job,2021-12-19,4.0,Account Executive,"Great company with lots of growth still ahead. Senior leadership is top-notch, they were/are some of the best talent in tech. Equity package is pretty good too, even in sales. 

There's a lot of opportunity to make money as an AE at Twilio but you're not running traditional sales cycles. You make money by convincing those who are already spending to spend more OR by finding a needle in a haystack to take their spend from nothing to something. The former is often a little more project management than it is sales and the latter is very arduous and time consuming.

The company is growing 50%+ YoY has a public company with 7k+ employees. That's the fastest growing B2B tech company of this size of all time, right up there with Salesforce, Slack, etc.","1. Performance is highly dependent on your accounts. Large deals at Twilio require high volume so think B2C tech companies (apps mostly) with huge followings, users, etc. like Robinhood, Chime, Acorns, etc. There are so many of these accounts to go around so whoever gets and holds these accounts is all but guaranteed to have pre-determined success. 
2. It's also very difficult to sell Twilio into non-tech companies. Developers are essentially a requirement and if you have a patch with a lot of old school industries like manufacturing, you're SOL. 
3. Also there's Lots of favoritism in the MM org. You can tell when certain people get decisions in their favor, great accounts year after year, optimal territories, and/or are slated for promotions despite lacking the quantitative metrics, merits and experience. It's a huge morale killer.
4. Some of our most impactul C-levels just left the organization so interesting to see how that unfolds but Jeff has always been good at building an incredible leadership team around him so not too worries on that front. 
5. The stock has skyrocketed in the last 2-3 years, especially during the pandemic so the equity growth and company value will take some time to catch up to it but I can still see this being a"

79,Twilio,Twilio hiring experience,2021-09-24,5.0,Technical Account Manager (TAM),Twilio is very detail oriented. They were meticulous in their interviews and really made sure I was a perfect fit with their company and aligned with their core values. Everyone was very kind and helpful. I had plenty of time to ask questions and learn about the position and was supported from start to finish by various members from the recruiting team. The recruiting team and managers communicated with me flawlessly.,The only con is they use Hireright when a background check is needed and they are very difficult to work with.

84,Twilio,Knives out,2021-05-31,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- SendGrid was great but the experience after the Twilio acquisition went rapidly downhill. Compensation and benefits are good; stock and ESPP were especially sweet as the stock price really took off. 

- Free food and beer in the office (in the Before Times anyway) were a nice perk, although Twilio started gradually whittling away at that and other perks. 

- Company continues to grow robustly in spite of flaws.","- The veneer of inclusivity and sensitivity and whatever the hell Twilio Magic means belies a real viciousness that took me by surprise after I’d been lulled into believing the facade. Unfortunately I took leadership’s Ned Flanders surface act at face value, only to find out it was a fraud. I wasn’t all that enamored of the SendGrid leadership that took their huge piles of money and left after the acquisition, but they were much better than their Twilio counterparts. There might be some managers in the organization interested in coaching their reports toward career development but that was certainly not my experience. Oddly, threats are not especially effective as a motivation and coaching technique. Weird, I know.

- Twilio engineering had the reputation of growing too quickly to implement the kind of process and discipline needed for enterprise-level software development and it showed in the platform’s instability and number of outages."

I've seen people have a really hard time onboarding with how complex our product is and how quickly you need to adapt. ""Drinking out of the firehose"" is a common expression, and feels quite accurate when starting (but also for the first full 8 months). Also, growing pains suck (although they are expected with how quickly we're growing rapidly) so a lot of processes change overnight.

There's a huge market opportunity where we're addressing real customer challenges in ways that make people's jobs easier. Love that we use our product for social good and appreciate the opportunity to make a difference in more ways that one. There's a lot of new management and they are people who have worked at scale and can help us as we continue to grow and evolve. Good people, lots of challenging work, and great market opportunity!","2019 was a year of growing pains. We doubled our workforce and don't have the infrastructure and processes that support our size and scale. We need to go slower to go faster long term since we're feeling the growing pains that come with this level of growth.  We sometimes fail to live our value of ruthlessly prioritizing and try to do too much at one time. Have many first time managers who are learning on the job which is hard, especially when you're working with a distributed team."

It's become a sales company and only cares how much its reps are crushing it. The product side has become a confusing mess of mismanagement, bureaucracy, politics, and competing sideways initiatives. Twilio  has the bureaucracy of a company ten times its size. None of its management knows what their jobs are or how to do them. The company has an inkling that something is wrong and is beginning to make some good firings, but the quality of incoming management is ever lower, so it's not helping.

The company is so enamored of social justice initiatives and abstract corporate values that the culture has become very cult-like, and is getting in the way of them actually running a company that takes care of its people."

While there are some good managers on the SendGrid side, mine was spineless  and we've done nothing but spin our wheels. 

Product direction is totally missing on the SendGrid side. It's like we are waiting for Twilio to tell us what to do but he um nothing is being said. 

Many mangers are unqualified and there is next to no (is there any) accountability for managers. I've seen more than one valuable employee be let go by mangers that, well, are simply not fit to be managers.

SendGrid used to have decent values. Hungry, Humble, Happy and Honest. As hokey as that sounds, when I joined, we lived mostly by them. (Honest was always weak. I attribute this mostly to Managment's get-in-line and conform or get out mantra (hence the valuable employees we've lost). I digress however. Now we have ""Twilio Magic"".

Twilio’s intent to ensure people of color & under represented minorities feel valued is also always there. The social impact we make in .org is incredible. It’s a bit baffling to see people are disinterested in Twilio investing in junior talent. Junior talent has to start somewhere & the fact Twilio is willing to invest, mentor & develop is amazing. I wish we could hire MORE junior talent - we are already a very top heavy company as it is. I also have a hard time believing someone got “fired” because they wanted to work on diversity. Twilio is always asking people to step up & contribute to diversity, be an ally, etc. 
Don’t believe everything you see on the internet - Twilio is a wonderful place to work, the culture is incredible, the majority of Twilio’s employees have the intention to always do the right thing.  
Twilio allows you to volunteer 20 hours/ year, which is awesome for social impact & giving back. 
Twilio is a growing company & culture, just because things can’t stay “the same” it was back when we were 300-400 employees, doesn’t make it a bad place. I love this company and the opportunity it has provided me over the last 4.5 years.","- Growing pains. Nothing to be scared of. It’s where you can make the most impact of helping “to scale” - but it can be painful having to adjust at times. 
- Getting people in the mindset of ruthlessly prioritizing. It seems after planning, things always do a “shift” mid year for something we didn’t predict to happen. 
- Feels some employees are just going to complain to complain, nothing will make them happy no matter what happens."
269,Twilio,Really Disappointing,2019-10-03,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Growth, huge potential TAM, some strong capabilities throughout the company.  Good work depending on what group you join.","It's so disappointing to discover that all is not what it seems.  Engineering leadership is non-existent.  Product is such a mess, it will take years to sort through.  Merger integration is shaky at best.  Executive leadership, the top two, will destroy the place.  Wildly ruthless and disrespectful on a regular basis.  Talk to any woman in leadership in particular.  Stock price has plummeted.  Much further, and departures will add up.  Loyalty to stock price, definitely not to the leadership.  Diversity?  Clear opportunity to hire a POC on the Board and who did they hire?  Another white man.  No substance or investment behind diversity whatsoever so stop pretending you're the voice for the industry.  All remarkably disappointing."

Great reputation with customers.,"Comp plan is convoluted and includes carve-outs, margin limits, windfall clauses, and decelerators. You can close multiple million $$ contracts and only get credited for a few hundred thousand $$. What reps get paid for does not align with how customers want/need to purchase creating unnecessary sales friction. 

The structure makes it obvious management does not see the value of sales and works to limit compensation. It is demoralizing."

-Budding sales culture
-Good alignment with marketing
-Employees are friends with each other outside of the office","-More focus on looking good in front of the right people vs. actual performance

-Culture of judgment where you could be alienated for a mistake 
-Secretive, ""big brother"" leadership style where little info is shared with individual contributors

296,Twilio,Great place to work!,2016-03-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people here are smart and driven. I like how the company does a very thorough job onboarding a new hire. They provide onboarding series that you can attend that are hosted by the executive team where you can learn about the history of Twilio and the different departments within Twilio and how they operate which I found really beneficial. Another cool aspect is that for the non-technical folks, there is a week bootcamp that you can attend where they will basically teach you how to create an app on the Twilio platform.

This is a great open environment where everyone is pretty friendly. The management here are transparent with what is going on and everyone wants to help you succeed. The CEO hosts a biweekly company all hands. The team I work on is great where I have a manager and a team that are not only supportive but is providing me insight to help me develop and grow and allows me to take ownership and autonomy on what I want to work on and do with my role. 

I've worked at many companies before both large and small and I'm really thankful to be here at Twilio because for me it's been a great balance.","Typically start up growing pains where more infostructure needs to be put in place and processes developed. It's definitely the type of environment for those that are driven, curious and willing to speak up/ask questions and execute on ideas. You have to be willing to adapt quickly as with most start ups as it is a fast paced environment. 

Not sure how they came up with the lunch schedule but its only 2-3 times a week which I wish was everyday but there's plenty of snacks available."

2. The people - smart and genuine people work here and its easy to be inspired to be greater.  ""All-in"" mentality and most people will help. 

3. Twilio works. Customers love Twilio and want to talk about what they build. This company is transforming the future of communications.  Our earnings call keeps getting more and more impressive each quarter.  My LinkedIn is blowing up with people that want to join.","1. Lots of internal inefficiencies - learn to ""be ok"" that there isn't a process to everything (or most things)

2. Easy to be overwhelmed and overworked. There is always something to fix or take ownership on. There isn't always a clear path. You can get a little emotional if you don't anticipate this.

Customers are happy and are under the impression that product is awesome

Intelligent people with significant business and technical acumen

Catered lunch and snacks","Twilio Sales org is a new branch of Twilio. The internal processes are downright garbage and morale is terrible. Management has no idea how to assign territories, create accurate comp, and will put you on a PIP immediately if you don't make the near impossible ramp quota. This happens because the product is incredibly difficult to learn, and you need to spend hours outside of work daily - this will take you about 6-8 months to even feel comfortable positioning the product on the phone. But by then, you'll already be incredibly stressed out about your performance.

Morale is terrible and management realizes all the problems I have mentioned, but does little to do anything about it. The changes they want to implement take forever. 80% of revenue for Twilio comes from marketing and it's a self-service platform, so the company's focus on Sales is pretty much nonexistent. The onboarding is trash for sales.

If you want to be in sales here, do not believe in work/life balance. It doesn't exist if you want to be a top performer. The compensation is not worth the effort in my opinion.

Again, if you're an engineer or interested in product, DEFINITELY consider Twilio."

Some new management has displayed immature behavior, stonewalling & giving the cold shoulder to some, while loudly being friendly to others. It makes the work environment uncomfortable. Other management changes have included replacing someone with amazing experience with another person with very little. This feels hostile and it feels like all the work I’ve done since starting means nothing to these new people. I had hoped to stay here for years, but I’m not sure I want to do that. I’ve tried to talk to multiple people in management about my concerns, but have been brushed off. I used to feel like I actually mattered here. Not the case anymore."

-	Because of the focus on shipping product there is huge technical debt and a very shaky code foundation that has resulted in costly customer impacting outages.  There is a lot of lip service about fixing the problems but it is trivialized over shipping new features.  This is very serious and begs the question about the long-term company viability.

-	Developer burnout trying to keep the system up and ship product.  Developers are expected to work all night on production problems and do their day jobs.  There is a real lack of quality in the product.

-	Management shenanigans have eroded their once prized culture with some very key people either being forced out or quitting out of frustration with direction or lack of career advancement.

-	Cronyism in new hires.  The hiring system was set up to keep this from happening but with new management they are bring in their friends.

-	Management  manages by Twitter, short term thinking and micro management rather than setting direction.  

-	An undercurrent of distrust between internal Engineering teams and between Engineering and the other teams in the company that is again leading to erosion in the culture and setting up favoritism.

-	Senior managers believing in their and the companies built up propaganda, the feeling of invincibility."

Company employees truly live the core values and they drive the culture in a positive direction. As a software developer the mission to build products that are used by fellow developers to fuel the future of communications really resonates with me.,"The growth in all measures, especially headcount and revenue has been difficult to keep up with. The company has tripled in size since I've been here (3 years when there were 200 employees). Some people who've been here for longer than me have seen headcount 10x since they joined when the company was 50-60 people. While growth isn't inherently bad, it can be difficult to keep up with the changes each year. Eventually (say, 4-5 years from now) I'm sure bureaucracy will creep in but for now we move fast and constantly ship awesome new products."
317,Twilio,Amazing and effective engineering culture,2016-01-19,5.0,Software Engineer,"* Management really values engineers’ time and supports them when they want to pay down technical debt or focus on scalability.
* Small teams structure like at Amazon emphasizes ownership and teaches you many skills hands-on— writing the code, deploying, and ops management. (There is on-call for some software engineers, which may be a con for you).
* Very seriously takes some of the principles of agile / modern software development, such as committing to and checking-in on betterments from retrospectives, and using “we” phrasing when referring to outages and incidents. ""Be Humble"" is a corporate value and it is lived out pretty well.","* Interviews take up a lot of time, 1-2 hrs a day really add up.

318,Twilio,"So much potential, but falls short",2015-12-09,2.0,,"- The company is doing really well. This means that there's almost always something new, fun and exciting to work on.
- The industry/space is really interesting! There's a ton to learn about things you likely never knew anything about.
- The Twilio brand name is strong, particularly in the Bay Area
- Work-life balance is good. Sure there are some late nights, but overall this is a company that allows you to also have your own life.","- Extremely limited opportunities for career growth. This varies slightly across various departments, but overall this is not the place to go if you're looking for fast career growth.
- Inexperienced managers. Many managers at Twilio are first time managers and are young and inexperienced. They may have been great as IC's, but they're horrible people managers and do not know how to inspire or motivate.
- Compensation is low relative to market.
- By far the worst though is the company culture. This is a place where you'll routinely find your coworkers playing ""F*, marry, kill"" about other employees. Most social conversation revolves around who hooked up with who and rating the 'appeal' of other coworkers. If this type of thing makes you uncomfortable, you should stay away!"
319,Twilio,Great work Environment,2015-09-08,5.0,,"-Culture has grown from the ground up, so the nine things (read: company values) are real, rather than nice words forced upon the company by leadership.
-Small teams mean that you actually can have impact and ownership here.
-There are a lot of very accomplished people with impressive backgrounds at Twilio. However, most still adhere to the ""be humble"" company value, so it is a great environment in which to learn from really smart people who genuinely enjoy helping those who may have less experience in a certain area.
-Great opportunity for career growth since the company has grown so quickly. 
-Great leaders, credible investors, quality products.","-Standard growing pains of a rapidly growing company-some processes are not in place, some communication is sub-par, etc. 
-The culture is biased to action, so sometimes the company jumps into initiatives without a fully developed plan. This could be a positive, as some people (and most at Twilio) prefer to jump into problems and figure them out as they go. If you are a person who like a methodical, step by step plan Twilio might not be the best environment for you."
