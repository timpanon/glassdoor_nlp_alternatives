0,Veterans United Home Loans,Best place I've ever worked!,2021-07-11,5.0,Support Analyst,"Company culture, care for employees and flexibility. Never have I worked at a company that truly cares about their employees and embodies the values they preach more than Veterans United.",I don't have a con about VU!
1,Veterans United Home Loans,Awesome!,2022-03-29,5.0,Loan Coordinator,This company is amazing! I took a position with a lot of responsibility and some stress but it's completely worth it. I get to work directly with veterans from the start of the loan process to the end.,None that I can think of.
2,Veterans United Home Loans,"Lots of perks, lots of people get fired",2022-03-22,4.0,Loan Specialist,"- snacks, gifts and catered events w/ alcohol
- education and licensing for mortgage loan origination
- flexible scheduling
- ability to make extra bonus money each month depending on how many files you send out
- doesn't require experience in mortgage industry
-overall its really satisfying education veterans on their home buying opportunities, especially when they go on to close on a home or become aware of their benefit eligibility","- full of white dudes, very little diversity, especially in leadership
- impersonal leadership, on my termination call, the production lead stated the wrong reason
- does not pay out PTO when you leave
-your job is to make phone calls all day and sometimes this can be stressful or you may encounter rude people
- people are frequently fired for various reasons and I had constant fear for months of getting fired
- your manager will probably be a 22 year old white man with no management experience"
3,Veterans United Home Loans,Love what I do!,2022-01-12,5.0,Customer Support Specialist,I don't hate going to work anymore. VU's culture of enhancing lives extends to the employees as well as the Veterans. Without my work family (yes as a former jaded retail worker I can call my co-workers family and mean it!) I don't know what I would do at times! This company has changed my life for the better!,I honestly can't think of any. My bosses give me time to get my work done efficiently and if not I can ask for help without fear of someone penalizing me for it. I don't worry every day when I come in if I am going to be fired. So nope! Love my job!
4,Veterans United Home Loans,Veteran Friendly,2022-01-12,5.0,Manager,"I've been here almost 5 years, and I'm shocked everyday with this company. This place is like a community, and I've never worked anywhere like it. The stuff VU does for the community is beyond what one would expect from a mortgage company, and I've watched my coworkers be supported through some really tough times in their life. I've never had a job outside of the military where I felt so loved and cared for by my peers/leadership. I also have never worked somewhere that was so invested in offering resources/trainings to become a better version of ourselves, and as leaders. Some folks worry that companies say they're Veteran friendly, but this one actually puts actions before words. I've never felt more supported, and think it's beyond awesome that my current military coworkers even have some extra benefits so they aren't worrying when called to duty. My goal is to retire with this company, because the values are unlike anywhere else.","I'm so blessed here, I don't have any cons to contribute. Maybe the size makes it where everybody may not know everybody that works here. However, there are so many groups to take advantage of that actually foster that connectedness."
5,Veterans United Home Loans,Not the company they proclaim to be,2022-03-28,2.0,"Closing Specialist, Account Manager, Wire Specialist","flexible depending on they department 
free snack","Besides the mean girl atmosphere in the Production Department, I have been yelled at by a loan officer to the point that I ended up in Urgent care with a panic attack and on heart meds to this day because of it and the stress I was placed under. When moved to a new department and learning a new job the other departments that you have to work with are not patient or kind during that learning curve. There is a lot of pressure put upon the employees in some of the departments and very little forgiveness or understanding regardless of what their VU values claim. I have witnessed a lot of what I would call age discrimination and absolutely no consistency with they way they treat their employees. You may come out of training and get a team lead that rides you hard in a very unkind way and expects you keep up with all of your work within 3 months of being out on the floor but yet one of your peers who came out of training with you will get a different manager in the same department and their manager will be very kind and understanding and tell that employee that they are not expected to keep up with only being out on the floor for 3 months and will let them work overtime to keep up. The care nothing about being consistent and treating each employee fairly. HR knows about this issue but still no one fixes it and I have seen it A LOT. 
They claim to be a VU family however I have witnessed a top preforming employee get forced out of a job because her family, who babysit her infant, had planned a trip overseas for a month so she asked to work from home during that time so she could watch her child and work, which we have the capability to do and have done many times, and they told her no and not only that but then emailed all the other women on the team who had small children and let it be known that they should not ask either and childcare is not their problem. Since there is a shortage of infant childcare in our area, the woman had to leave the company and they would not even let her finish her two weeks. We had been working from home all through Covid so this makes no sense. 
If you are young and cute you will probably be ok if you get in good with the right people but God help you if you don't. I have heard many that have left the company say they have PTSP from working there. I could go on and on with many more stories but all I really want to do is forget this place. I do not recommend this company."
6,Veterans United Home Loans,Dedicated to making your life better,2022-03-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Culture is amazing, great bonuses, friendly people, encouraging staff, fun events.","Not everyone buys into the culture, which can make it difficult to balance it (especially when it’s your boss."
7,Veterans United Home Loans,A company that gets it right!,2022-02-25,5.0,Paid Social & Display Coordinator,"This company is a paradise in a desert. Good pay, great benefits, great perks and I am able to balance my work load and life demands.
I've worked in Columbia for 10 years at a few different companies and I can say this has been the best and my favorite job yet! The employees are nice and generous, management is easy to work with an the company shares my values in so many ways.","Maybe a little more communication from company leaders? During a time of uncertainty in the housing and banking industries, it would be nice to know where we stand compared to other companies."
8,Veterans United Home Loans,VUHL,2022-03-31,4.0,Customer Service Team Lead,"Great culture! Good benefits, especially the 401k match and random company contributions to 401k. If in a production role, I hear the commissions are fantastic. Employee-financed foundation that benefits local and national organizations.","No possibility for remote work. Too much middle management. Could improve their diversity and inclusion, but is still leaps and bounds ahead of other companies in this area."
9,Veterans United Home Loans,Fantastic company,2022-03-26,5.0,Loan Officer,"Culture, atmosphere, people, employee perks",I really don’t have a con
10,Veterans United Home Loans,Things I have heard…,2022-02-22,3.0,Manager,Not the point of this post,"I’m a manager and overheard conversations of other managers. I didn’t want to share this with HR, because I need to keep my job. 

Long story short, I over heard, not in the conversation nor providing any consultation, managers planning to terminate an employee due to unsubstantiated reasons. They were looking for reasons to terminate.

One manager is in a relationship with a female employee; however, a direct report of his, a younger employee, is attempting to build a romantic relationship with the female. Now, the male is threatening to share the manager’s relationship with the manager’s wife.

This is toxic environment is affecting our team.

This is occurring in the technology area."
11,Veterans United Home Loans,You won’t find a better company!,2022-01-12,5.0,Senior Loan Officer,"I’ve been with VU for nearly 6 years. My time here has been amazing. It has by far been the best job I have ever had. No place is perfect, but this is about as close as it gets. Hard work is rewarded and recognized. I’ve yet to see someone apply themselves to their job who didn’t reap the rewards of their efforts at VU. Please take the negative reviews lightly. I have seen people come and go. Most were not a good fit because they weren’t hard workers. Hard work doesn’t mean we are working 60 hours and never have a break. There is plenty of balance for time off and being with your family. There are seasons where you’ll have to work harder, but you’ll also be rewarded for it.",There are no cons. I wouldn’t entertain an offer from any other company.
12,Veterans United Home Loans,Amazing Place to Work!,2022-03-20,5.0,UX-UI Designer,VU feels like a family and is a great place to work.,I cannot think of any.
13,Veterans United Home Loans,Not a great place to work,2022-01-25,1.0,Account Manager,"Decent pay depending on the job.

Able to wear sweats to work.","Overly stressful environment. I knew loan officers there in their mid-20s who were already on blood pressure medication due to the stress and ridiculous workload. I too had hypertension as a result of working there.

I would listen to happy music on my way to work each morning to at least get my mood right because I dreaded it so much.

The CEO put out a video that told all employees if they did not care enough about their fellow employees, then they did not need to work there anymore. And by caring, meaning they have to be your close friend and spend time with them outside of work and help them move, etc. Not just being kind to them at work.

There were off-site mandatory corporate events on a regular basis involving unlimited alcohol and spouses were not allowed at the events.

It is a cult-like atmosphere and unprofessional full of uneducated individuals who only had high school diplomas or other lowly degrees. There were underwriters with just a high school education.

It was near impossible to get a job there without knowing someone already working there and there was major favoritism in hiring for higher level positions based on who someone was friends with."
14,Veterans United Home Loans,Don't ever want to leave!,2022-02-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The workplace culture is amazing! People truly care about one another and the company's values are really lived out in what they do. They recognize you as a person and not just an employee.,"Some might say it's a con that the main locations are in Columbia MO and there are not a lot of remote opportunities or opportunities elsewhere. I personally understand the reasoning, as they want to build a workplace culture like no other and it would be difficult to do remotely. However, the thought of moving and not being able to stay with the company is a fear, as I never want to leave them!"
15,Veterans United Home Loans,Great Company,2022-03-13,5.0,Customer Support Specialist,"Understanding upper management, they are very flexible and care about how you are doing as a person as well as a professional.",I can honestly say there are no negatives I have experienced.

Also, there’s a thin line of work life balance, but definitely dependent on yourself… you want to make more money so you work more.."
18,Veterans United Home Loans,Great Place to Work (but actually),2022-03-10,5.0,Human Resources,"Feedback, Professional and Personal Development Opportunities, Great Relationships, Free Snacks, Casual Clothes",Its a fast paced and ever changing environment so you have to be comfortable with changes.
19,Veterans United Home Loans,Do not Recommend,2022-03-05,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Perks are nice. If you love alcohol this is the place to work. Most functions have alcohol. Free food is nice.,Don’t ever question when you want more knowledge. Leadership does not like to be questioned. Very top driven to make sure management is taken care of while those actually trying to help Veterans are made to meet so many unethical sales attempts that bullying and fear lie in many but they are too afraid to speak up
20,Veterans United Home Loans,Awesome place to work!,2022-02-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Open door policy, lots of opportunities for professional/personal development throughout the year, support from management to explore career growth.","Surprise 401k drops are great, but sometimes it would be better to receive cash bonuses instead. That's not even a con, just something I'd prefer. :) Would love to see more people of color encourage to follow the career path into upper management as there is not enough representation there."
21,Veterans United Home Loans,Great company bad work life,2022-03-26,3.0,Closing Specialist,Company does a good job of trying to take care of employees through different events and swag but be prepared to work. A lot.,Work load is a lot
22,Veterans United Home Loans,Opportunity of a Lifetime,2022-01-10,5.0,Production Manager,"I started at VU when I was 20 years old as an Intern and stumbled upon the company while living in Columbia attending Mizzou. I knew nothing about the company and had no professional skills. Everyone I've ever worked with/under has poured into me and created a life for me that I never thought I would have. You are surrounded by genuine people, who truly care, and you are compensated extremely fair for your efforts. I often tell my father about some of the great things VU does and he usually responds, ""You better never leave that company!""","If I had to comment on something, it's that Earth City smells bad. Zero complaints about VU."
23,Veterans United Home Loans,Great,2022-03-29,4.0,Senior Graphic Designer,Fun community minded work place,Nothing I can think of
24,Veterans United Home Loans,Great company,2022-03-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great place to work. Welcoming. Very nice.,No big downsides I’ve seen so far.
25,Veterans United Home Loans,Nice Place to Work,2021-10-08,3.0,Software Engineer,"For the most part software engineering managers allow teams to make decisions about how they work so there is usually good fluidity in work style for that group of people, most teams are great to collaborate with and ask questions of, immediate management is usually open to conversation about things that you feel should be addressed and try to help come up with solutions, events are enjoyable and have genuine effort put into them. The company overall has a focus on making it a good place to work and puts in a fair amount of effort to do that.","Large portions of the company operate in a very different ways, at times there are issues that arise from having a corporate size without having a corporate structure such as there tend to not be standards around things that are make-sense (software engineering specific examples: how much and well things are documented, alerting, on-call). Overall a great place to work but it has its downsides that people tend not to speak about for fear of not being a ""culture fit"" and being passed up for positions that they want in the future. Also a large number of the reviews are either from hr/marketing or there have been initiatives to send out requests to review the company so the company is pretty intentional about who they are asking to review the company on this site."
26,Veterans United Home Loans,Great people who really care,2022-03-07,5.0,Technology Analyst,"Lots of perks
Competitive salary for Missouri",None. Hard to quantify the value of good culture.
27,Veterans United Home Loans,Negative Experience in Production,2022-01-30,1.0,Loan Officer Assistant,"Diverse workforce, consistent 401k drops and fun group activities.","Production is gambling with your career month after month. I exceeded expectations my first month on main floor in production, then contracted COVID at Veterans United which affected my performance. I was given a 30 day notice of termination and was not provided a performance improvement plan after my numbers dropped. The two factors that affected my numbers were illness and the market slows down in Dec and Jan. There was no grace for this. Anybody who already has a solid career, I do not recommend leaving your job to work at Veterans United, especially in production as you are just a number to them. I was very lucky my previous federal position was still open so I was able to go back to my previous job which is way more complex. I'm in it to serve and I love to originate."
28,Veterans United Home Loans,Culture of care,2022-02-05,5.0,Account Manager,"Executive leadership is top notch, they have huge hearts. The culture trickled top down as employees work together, not against one another. They create an environment that can’t be matched in terms of happiness and fellowship.",Work life can get tricky at times with the cyclical nature of the industry.
29,Veterans United Home Loans,One of Kind Company,2021-11-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Joining the VU family is one of the best life decision I have ever made. Veterans United Home Loans is truly one of kind company and they treat everyone as family. We have grown a lot of over the last few years and I can tell you our amazing culture never wavered throughout all the growth and changes. Our people is what makes us who we are and is the reason why we have been such successful mortgage company. I can't say more good things about the company I work for. Living out our employee written values, Be Passionate and have Fun, Deliver Results with Integrity, and Enhance Lives Everyday, and doing what's best for our veterans borrowers is an expectation across all departments. VU is my family and I have found my forever career home.",I don't have any cons to add.

That might not sound like a lot, but it really is!","I've worked in the same position for just over 2 years with no pay increase. Not really sure why our department doesn't get even a cost of living increase. Not a deal breaker for me, just kind of curious."
34,Veterans United Home Loans,I can't imagine a better place to work,2022-01-12,5.0,Associate Director,"The culture here is unmatched.

4. VU takes care of it's people, so the people take care of the business. 401K drops, snacks in the kitchen, game room, team lunches & outings, celebrating major milestones(personal and professional) We work just as hard as we play.","1. People sometimes hear about the fun things happening at VU and assume that we don't work every day. Just to be clear, we grind--the fun happens as a result of that. 
2. We've been successful from a growth perspective, so it may not be as easy to establish relationships with every human in the company. But there's so many safety nets to combat that & create a sense of belonging."

It’s a weird place. The CEO ends emails with “love you guys” then the same day your manager threatens everyone a jobs if numbers are slightly off.

This company claims to love and care about their employees but it doesn’t show.

Also, some departments got a Christmas bonus and others didn’t. That doesn’t do anything for moral either.

I’ve seen a constant drop in morale every year I’m here. This place has become toxic."

79,Veterans United Home Loans,It's a meat grinder,2021-12-14,3.0,Loan Coordinator,"They pay fairly well. Although the separation in pay grades from loan officer to loan coordinator was made clear when it came to treatment. Multiple loan officers referred to coordinators as their assistant's without correction.

They try to innovate, maybe a little too fast. When hired, they trained my class for 3 different positions before settling on one. Every hiring class has a wildly different training experience. 

They do A LOT. Team outings, meals, tee shirts, hats, boots, free snacks. It can be stressful when you don't like combining your social life with work. And for the most part every event has alcohol. Great if you drink. Rough if you're sober.

Free Y pass.","There's definitely a correlation between who is determined to not be ""a good fit"" for VU, and who is visibly queer. On top of the fact despite having diversity and inclusion small groups, somehow the St. Louis office is 90% white. 

As a Loan Coordinator you're expected to be online and responding to questions 9am-5pm, while often times loan officers opt to only come in for part of the work day. This is a problem when you need help from them.

They're always re-working something. While it can be a good thing, it often left a sense of unease amongst teams. Keeping up with VU changes felt like a job in and of itself, outside of the normal changes that come with working on government backed loans. 

If the customer is mad- they will call you, and they will scream at you. Be it because they don't want to give you financial information, or you're just not able to make 3rd parties move any faster. 

They tell you it's a work hard/play hard roll, when it does not have to be. Putting all the pressure on the LC's to handle 40-50 loans at a time with a rotating door of underwriters, closers, loan officers, and more makes it pressure filled. Leaving major items up to ""underwriter discretion"" does.

All in all- this job can and will run you down."

The company is so involved in the local community, too, and the executives place the most emphasis and care into the human beings who work here. You are almost guaranteed to find satisfaction and be rewarded in your role, and if you can't find it in the job itself, you will find it in other places. Veterans United is MORE than just a job or an employer; it's a family! We look out for each other and care for one another day in and day out. I have met some of the most incredible people here and have made life-long friendships, and I mean truly life-long, genuine friendships. There is an entire department dedicated to company culture, and they provide some life-enhancing opportunities year round to fill our cups with development both in and out of the office. These opportunities include book small groups, hobby-focused social groups, fun events for employees and their family members, an extravagant Holiday Party, and much, much more. Employees also have the opportunity to give a percentage of their paycheck to our own non-profit, the Veterans United Foundation, that does AMAZING things for people and non-profits across the country. Overall, Veterans United cares deeply about the human experience and the well-being of its employees. They take care of us and invest in us, and people work here for the long-haul. It's an incredible place to work!","Being such a successful company as a whole means we put in work! Long days and overtime are common, even though leadership does their best to promote and encourage taking breaks and finding balance between work and life outside of the office. It could also be argued that the pay is not amazing, but most employees are compensated fairly and appropriately for their specific job. There are plenty of opportunities for growth and bonuses, but that comes with hard (sometimes very hard) work to earn it."

Almost every employee donates 1% of their pay check to the VU foundation and VU gives it back in BIG ways. They have handled COVID and the pandemic amazingly. Sending all employees home at the beginning and working very carefully to get some back in the office while still keeping everyone safe and able to work from home. They check in about every month to make sure we are doing ok, those who are working from home still, and if we need anything. Bonus, they love to send us small gifts from time to time and will even mail it right to our house to keep us smiling. 
They are good about reaching out to tell you what a good job you are doing or to congratulate you on any big progress you've made. 
They're good at promoting from within, I've seen lots of people move up within the last year and they always reach out to us to let us know when new roles are opening up. 
They have never had layoffs.

To maintain this, they're very selective in the hiring process and place extra emphasis on the whole-person concept over skills alone. Their passion extends to employee's families as well, as their often included in events, giveaway's etc. A good example of this: Every employee's child in the company receives a hand written birthday card and a gift. They go the extra mile in every facet, and it shows in how content their employees are. 

All this while maintaining the title as the nation's leading VA loan provider and objectively crushing the competition. Many companies who are successful in their respective business have a hard time balancing profit and culture. VU has perfected it.

Team lead and managers did as much to help answer questions as possible, but they are overwhelmed themselves
401k","My experience at VU was a disappointing shock to me. In past positions at other companies I have always felt that even when the position was stressful, I was trained to handle it adequately. At VU, this was not the case.

 I went through training for three different positions within a year, because they kept moving me (along with many others) due to company needs. 

The training is inadequate. Though lots of time is spent on very specific items, such as taxes, there is not enough loan specific training and training on the full process of our position - in other words, we would focus on a skill, but end up feeling unprepared for our position as a whole. Trainers would imply to us that there is a correct way that they have to train us, but that once we are working our own pipeline, we may end up doing it differently (either skipping stuff because we are rushed, or being told to do something differently by our eventual team lead). Multiple people will advise differently on the exact same topic, making it difficult to learn what the current, true rule is. 

Trainers advised us over and over that our position was very stressful. They advised us that ""you won't find a closing specialist that hasn't cried."" This was not disclosed to me during any part of the recruitment process. In fact, the work life balance was highly touted, and the actual position description was avoided, because the recruiter did not know exactly which position I would placed into. 

The workload varied throughout the year but during a significant portion of my time at VU I was doing overtime to keep up with my workload, never taking breaks, and crying multiple times a week. I was truly clicking as fast as humanly possible and never giving my eyes a break, just to keep up with all my emails. 
The duties of each member assigned to a particular loan were not always clear. Many times it was hard to figure out if I was supposed to be doing something or if another member of the loan team was trying to get me to do their job for me. Communication was hit or miss, with some loan officers responding immediately, and some ignoring me until I cc'ed a manager. 

It seemed there was a motto of We can't train you on everything, you just have to learn gradually. But this type of method of learning is incredibly stressful when people are making demands that have to be met RIGHT now or else a loan can't close. If I didn't know how to do something, and couldn't figure it out, I was dependent on finding someone else to help, in a rush. Though most people would try to help, it was a stressful situation. Many swear words in the office.

Taking time off work felt impossible. Though teammates are supposed to pick up your work while you are gone, it always results in a mess. A million emails when you come back.

I felt like I was in this strange culture where some people actually liked their jobs but everyone else was miserable, but somehow the whole culture is around making everyone think VU is amazing even when it's not. The people around me were so depressed and I heard constant complaints. Some would say they hadn't peed all day because they were so busy. People in training were so stressed that they would say they cried about things.

The industry is just so incredibly difficult and complex - so I understand it is difficult at any mortgage company to learn how to be good at your position. But there are so many frustrating things about the way VU runs, and they can't just keep growing and growing and never developing truly experienced workers and only having turnover, because there need to be enough well trained people to help new people."

148,Veterans United Home Loans,"Not Perfect, Just Awesome",2020-12-29,5.0,Videographer,"Communication: they honestly are working to resolve issues and you know it too. From the top down, folks are passionate about helping each other succeed and thrive. It’s really something special. They want to help you grow in your capacity so that, for instance, if you’re promoted to management, they are actively working to make sure you have the skills you need to fill that new role. 
People: they’re a lot of fun and it really helps it be a lower stress environment. It’s really enabling creatively to have that nudge.
Values: I love how closely the values align with my beliefs and that it’s really awesome to be encouraged to put other people first before the job/work—something I still have to work on!","Honestly, it’s really hard to find reasons you shouldn’t work at VU. My thought is that it wouldn’t be a good place to “just do your job” and stay away from others. There’s too much familial spirit to just let you work in a corner and not be bothered with others."
149,Veterans United Home Loans,Boiler Room for Retail and customer service workers,2021-08-26,1.0,Loan Officer,Benefits start day 1; clothing giveaways; Happy Hour,"This company is a cult focused on the Boiler Room mentality. The fringe benefits (free food, t-shirts, socks, beer and alcohol) is a front to keep a ""them vs. us mentality"" when it comes to employees. The interview process is designed to show a prospect that their current employee doesn't ""care"" for them as a person like VU does. The problem is, VU doesn't care for anybody but VU either. They pay low commissions as they entice customer service empyees typically earning 40k to accept a flat 60k pay. This base is high for the industry, but when you're closing the loans expected, you're only making 30% of what you'd make on the open market.

They force all empyees to sign a non-compete, which if challenged would be completely unenforceable as it is way too broad...essentially it states you can never have another job if it requires you to do ANYTHING you're currently doing (this includes talking to customers, using a phone or computer, working in a team, etc). The non-compete does NOT mention anything about the mortgage industry, just leaves a blanket open statement.

The management team will often say ""I've drunk the Kool-Aid"", like it's a point of pride. This statement best suits the organization as it is most closely associated to a cult. Unfortunately, the statement is derived from a popular cult by which the cult followers were forced to drink poisonous Kool-aid and die, or they were shot dead with AK47s. This organization wants to have an appearance that everyone is family, they require you to be friends with your co-workers outside of work, they have stated many times that they would love to see the line of work-life balance gone and you don't know what is what. In the end, when you realize this isn't the right job, company, etc, you are fired on the spot, can't complete your loans under contract, they shut off all benefits that day, and essentially treat you like a deserter of the cult.

So, in summary, this company is like a circus ringmaster, raising a lion in captivity so the lion doesn't realize they are more powerful. For those looking to have a secure pay, and become a robot and ""yes man"", this is a great position. Don't ever leave. If you have aspirations and want to challenge yourself, this is the worse position for you."

The pay is competitive and there's always room to grow and move up within the company. Lastly, the ability to work from home during the pandemic has been amazing. I feel well supported in my role at home, and know I can reach out if I am having any issues. For example, when I first started working from home I had an unstable internet connection, so I was given a mifi router from the company to sustain an internet connection during the work day. Such a big stress relief knowing VU IT was there to help!","The work load cannot be done in 40 hours a week, so I am constantly working overtime. OT is unlimited, but its less appealing to get those extra hours when I don't feel there's a choice. I am told by my team leads that this work load is for my own growth and benefit, but my family and personal life have suffered as a result. For example, I have less time to help with the kids as they navigate online school. Lastly, not all VU employees embody the company's mission of enhancing lives. We should be treating ALL people with respect, not just the veterans our company serves. I don't get the impression loan officers and POCs understand what we're dealing with in processing. I work as hard as I can to serve our veterans and my loan team, and I consistently feel disrespected and undervalued by my own coworkers."

They'll say overtime isn't mandatory, but staying ahead of your work is. This means roughly 50+hrs per week to stay on top of your work load. Not much time for relationships/activities outside of work, which is sort of a damper on your mental health. If you work at a normal or below normal pace, it seems like its easy to fall behind into the vicious cycle."
234,Veterans United Home Loans,Seriously the best company,2021-01-10,5.0,Loan Officer,VU is truly a company that cares about it's employees and makes you feel like you belong.,The job like any other can be stressful but VU gives you the tools to succeed.

After finishing my first year  I can say that it is and more and I'm not prone to exaggeration.
A fast-paced, growing environment with no end in sight, VU is the first company for which I've worked that puts such a heavy, day-to-day emphasis on their company values- so much so that they are a large portion the annual employee review.
Management is very transparent:  part of the company-wide emphasis this year has been Trust- in yourself, your team members, and the Company as whole- all are encouraged to extend trust and work to develop trust with others.
Compensations are generous and random- from walking into the office one morning and getting a box of candy at my desk with a note from the CEO telling me (and every other qualifying employee) VU just plunked $1000 into my 401(k)-  Seriously???  To naming all employees Employee Of The Year at the Christmas Party and putting ANOTHER $3000 in our 401(k)'s-SERIOUSLY???  VU is serious about each employee's future and they show it by leading the way in committing resources to each employees future, not only their own.","There can be a sense of employee entitlement at times-because the company is so generous the expectation level increases.

Management has a true open door policy and they are never to busy to stop and just chat for a few moments and that includes all of the executives and owners even. I truly feel part of a family working here and every person truly cares as much about each customer and the experience we give them as we do each other.,"There are no perfect companies in the world and everyone has room to grow and improve all the time. I can say without a doubt though that Veterans United is as close as you will find to it. The only negative that I would point out here would be that sometimes being a company that is spread out so much, it can make it hard to keep communication going on issues and culture can definitely be difficult to stay on top of, but they are doing a fantastic job of doing it. They constantly look for ways to improve not only for employees but for customer experience too."

The VAMC is very good about working around your schedule, whether it be in the summer or during the school year. 


If you want to get the chance to work for a company that is very involved in helping out the community and the people it serves this is the place to be.  There are many chances to get involved too.  

The VAMC has tons of fun events, including a company golf tournament, picnic, bowling outing, Christmas party, and we recently had a night at the local comedy club in town.  Everyone is a lot of fun to work with.  


There are a lot of non-traditional perks that I was able to get in on including free catered lunches on Monday, massages on Fridays, and free drinks and snacks.","You really get thrown right into the mix.  From the first day you're there the expectations are high.  This can be a little nerve-wracking, but it really pushes you to make the most out of your internship experience.  There is also always people there to help you out along the way."
