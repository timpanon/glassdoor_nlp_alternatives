Expectations are very high. Some think impossible to maintain the pace. Micro management in full effect. Process process process. Every step is scrutinized. Be prepared to be under a microscope for everything you do. Multiple people involved in every step of the sales process. Everyone has an opinion. Sometimes no matter what you do, it’s not good enough. Tough culture to adjust too:"
7,Zscaler,Positive culture from the top down,2022-02-09,5.0,CISO Chief Information Security Officer,"-Leadership truly cares about employee health, well being and personal goals
-Positive culture that drives everyone to work towards the same goal, enhance cyber security across all industries and GEOs 
-Fast paced without added stress
-Innovative, forward thinking, strategic, thought leadership",I haven't found one yet
8,Zscaler,Great Compensation and Work/Life Balance,2022-02-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great considerations for work/life balance
Great compensation, I've received significant raises I did not even ask for to keep me above regular market rates as they rise
Industry leader in a niche market that is growing like crazy","Still middling in between a startup and a fortune 500 company, but most of those kinks are getting worked out already"
9,Zscaler,"Fast paced, but with an emphasis on work/life balance",2022-02-08,5.0,Technical Account Manager (TAM),"Despite the fast pace, ZS really spend a lot of time on wellness and making sure we're all balancing work with the rest of our lives. Usually when you think of start-up culture, you think of long days, nights, and weekends. Being on the support side, and working globally, I have had to take a few off-hours meetings, but I'm consistently told by my management to leave early on a Friday to make up for it, or take a half day.

The management across all orgs are all tuned into this culture as well. The org isn't siloed at all, and everyone is willing to step out of their role and help at any given time. The company feels like one big team all working towards the same goals.","The pace is fast, and the staffing is lean, which is sometimes great, but when you run into issues it can be tough to get people focused on them, as opposed to moving on to the next project. Being lean also means QA teams and documentation teams are often slower than the release schedule, which can present some challenges."
10,Zscaler,Sacrificing Ethics in the Name of a Higher Stock Price,2022-03-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you were hired from AppDynamics, or someone from AppDynamics has decided they like you, then you’re likely going to be successful. 

Stock was nice (until it dropped by $100 and has yet to recover)","You’ll be working less than the industry average regardless of role. Get an internal promotion? Now you’ll make 2/3 of what an outside hire makes in the same position. 

Benefits are mediocre compared to other tech companies in the same position. Except for Stock. 
Which, hopefully, you can stick out 4 years to see most of without needing to take a sabattical from the lack of work life balance here draining your mental health. 

There was a huge hiring front of leadership from AppDynamics following the appointment of the current CRO. This has created a huge culture issue within the company and the exec team has done nothing to address it. 

Work/Life Balance is a pipe dream peddled by the executive team. Do you have a salary? Expect to work 65 hours a week minimum, even in an individual contributor role. 

Hiring sales people like crazy, without scaling Sales support teams (marketing, Ops, channel, CSM). Support is minimal because everyone else is spread so thin. 

Literal product support sits overseas and garners frequent complaints from customers. 

A surprising amount of dollars seem to go toward the sales enablement team( look at the most recent SKO for reference) but I don’t know a single person who really understands how any of our sales tools work. 

The stock price is God. Every single thing revolves around it, at the expense of culture, common sense, and decision making. Things change constantly with seemingly no explanation. Decisions and tool purchases feel RUSHED simply to appear cutting edge to the market. 

And for the love of God, before giving any more money to people.ai , someone in this company figure out how to make their tool work in the ZS ecosystem if it’s going to be the Bible for tracking sales activities."
11,Zscaler,Not perfect BUT sexy platform + high energy hits all the high notes in the best kind of way,2022-02-01,5.0,Customer Success Manager (CSM),"The people behind the Z are simply amazing top tier talent coming from all the big names with an environment that feels like a startup. You feel like you are part of something tangible and real. With everyone having a stake in the company, the momentum is like a bullet shot in space. 

1. Everyone has a stake in the company (stock)
2. Top notch onboarding and training for new hires
3. Clear messaging of our mission
4. Everyone coming through the door is a fan!
5. Start up mentality but flexible work life balance
6. Compensation/Bonus structure is generous","Not so much as cons but benefits are about 5-10% more expensive when compared to larger orgs....yes, I realize thats captain obvious."
12,Zscaler,"Amazing Team, Great Product, Customer Success is the #1 Goal",2022-01-31,5.0,Regional Sales Manager,"- The people here are incredible with a very flat organization. Not often in a large, publicly traded company can you reach out to anyone with any title.

22,Zscaler,Great Company and Great Culture,2022-01-08,5.0,Partner Services Manager,"ZScaler has been a wonderful experience so far. Some of the Pros:
Very Competitive Salary
Shares in the company
Great and inclusive culture
Very well executed processes across the company
A wealth of resources to help you learn and grow
A major focus on employees taking care of them selves. This is the first company I have seen that encourages everyone to take mental health breaks.","No major cons but rather what I call “Good Problems to Have”:
Company is growing at a very fast rate that we can’t hire people fast enough. It can be challenging keeping up growth."
23,Zscaler,"Great Talent, Great Culture, Great Technology",2022-01-05,5.0,Sales Engineer,"If you are looking for a company where you can see yourself grow professionally and personally, then Zscaler is the place. The culture and talent is like no where else seen. 
I came from infrastructure, network & security industry for more than a decade. Zscaler has built a disruptive technology which is very hard for anyone to replicate. I would consider Zscaler as the 'Apple', 'Salesforce' or 'Tesla' in the CyberSecurity market place. 
Leadership understands the pain of managing in the infrastructure; and have found a solution which delivers a simplified and uber-secured experience; rather than throwing one more security appliance on to your stack.
Recruitment process was very transparent and tough one to crack. Best I have experienced till date. The Onboarding is taken seriously and it's all for good reasons. 
Company benefits are industry standard; but most importantly they offer an awesome ESPP plan with 2 year rollback lock price.
We are in growth phase, all ideas are welcome and listened to.","Since the company is in growth phase, the stock is very volatile. It was considered as one of the highest ranking growth company in 2021. So the only con I would consider is that the equity value differs a lot. If you don't pay attention to that and focus on building the business case than I suppose rest will all build history."

25,Zscaler,Great potential.,2022-01-13,3.0,Regional Sales Manager,Strong visionary executive leadership. Great transformational technology and solutions. Strong sales enablement team and world class SE’s.,"I don’t think it’s a systemic issue, but there is a fair amount of mid-level (AVP/RVP) to frontline manager (RSD) dysfunction, which leads to trust issues and ultimately micro-managerial behavior. Again, I think / hope what I’m seeing is isolated and not a widespread culture issue. The customer-first core values preached at the top are often lost in translation during the sales process. Often pushing customers to work within our sales process (which is supposed be all about the customer, but it’s really just about us getting a sale) and timelines, not the customers. This can be highly effective for a first sale, but exudes a traditional transactional SaaS selling motion, not a long term strategic partner."

Amazing product, but huge learning curve for people not selling into Cyber/Network/Infrastructure prior. 

Amazing resources with field marketing, channel partner managers, tech alliance managers, sales enablement. Everything you could want to help you succeed.

Potential to make life changing amounts of money.","Not as ""rah rah"" as other tech companies. Yes there are big dreams company wide, but sales reps tend to stay in their lane and focus on themselves.

You have to be extremely fast paced, organized and methodical. Not much room for error in some of the bigger deals/opportunities and people can feel like they are drowning sometimes.

They say they're ""scaling"" which just means hiring so many people that there isn't enough work to go around, so you're stuck doing busy work for a majority of your day.

Everyone is friendly, helpful, they try to make you feel welcome, they get involved if they think they can assist you or an effort, and l truly have felt set up for success. I have all of the support, people, training and resources l need to do my job, and if there is something l need that l cannot find l am either pointed in the right direction and/or it is built. Everyone is collaborative & open to feedback. Plus, starting a full time remote job during COVID (particularly as a people manager) is tough, but Zscaler has really done a great job to go fully virtual and stay connected.","Like any fully remote company there are existing pains. People tend to work hard but in a vacuum, which results in silos. This sometimes has created duplicative efforts/work. Communication could be better. Company initiatives and goals beyond revenue targets would be great to understand in depth, as they are not expressed in a way that helps drive individual team goals. Benefits packages are another point of stress. Great job getting diverse candidates, more women in leadership, etc., but in order to attract more women & diversity l think taking a closer look at things like maternity/paternity leave are very important. Particularly for a Bay Area based company this package is not competitive, and what l would call to be lower than standard."

- Large headstart in front of competitors
- Minimal office politics.
- Lots of creative, hardworking and friendly people.","Nothing unusual - just more work than can be done with the amount of people. But teams are constantly growing, so we're headed in the right direction!"
77,Zscaler,The worst possible place to work at,2021-09-02,1.0,Software Engineer,"None, beside the stocks. Which is also debatably.","The worst possible people. Yes, these guys will make your life miserable. I worked as a new grad, and they constantly would give tasks the required immense product knowledge, and then make sure you don’t receive help, to find a reason to fire you. This was specifically my team. Since they my manager was inexperienced and didn’t want any new grads.. still terrible way to deal with it. STAY AWAY… from the ZPA Java team."
78,Zscaler,Sales rep in midwest,2021-07-21,5.0,Regional Sales Manager,"Incredible energy, fast-pased software company so should be ready to Ready, Shoot, Aim on some things. Unique architecture from any other in the market. Solid comp plan.","For sales reps there's a bit of education to be prepared to be giving to prospects b/c while we are a 14 year old company, there are still a number of enterprise companies you will call into that don't know about or understand Zscaler. Once they get it, they really get it versus the legacy incumbents your go up against."
79,Zscaler,Good single product - Sweatshop/Militaristic Mentality,2021-07-14,3.0,Account Manager,"Good product in SWG category, but they pay the analysts a LOT of $$$$ for that rating.","Once deployed, CIOs/CISOs realize it is not the complete offering they were sold. They then must rely on partnering with other cloud security offerings to fill the gaps. Not truly a ""cloud offering"" as much of their budget goes to building physical data centers to match MSFT footprint. This limits on-demand scalability which ultimately results in latency (not ideal conditions for financial transactions). Management DEFINITELY has favorites, which is not fair to newer employees. Overpriced."
80,Zscaler,"Good company, annoying evening calls",2021-08-12,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company has pretty good vision, CEO, and growth outlook. Office is nice, and coworkers have been generally friendly to me.","The only downside that I can think of is that sometimes there are evening calls with offshore times, sometimes starting at 10pm or later."

If you’re a pro you’ll do well here.",Just like every company scaling to get to $1B+ there’s a lot of operational maturity that will come. You have to know how to find and leverage internal resources to be successful.
84,Zscaler,Was a great place to work until it all went south,2021-06-27,2.0,Senior Training Manager,"Zscaler technology, products and market fit is amazing. It has established a dominant position and is growing which has paid rich dividends for employees who joined before the ipo.","Certain teams have grown and continue to grow, it depends which team you are in these days. Trainings and TME was fun until they were handed off on platter to head of sales without even asking training teams and since the departure of chief strategy officer in January, Product team is reduced to set of order takers and product leadership is in shambles.
Advice for anyone joining training, tech docs or PM org, do not join. If you are joining sales or engineering org, that's the place to be."

Also entering new frontiers with zcp (though playing catchup with palo alto networks with me too tech)","Exactly same problem as others have called out. Good product team until recently when wrong leaders from legacy companies were hired who brought their own army of sub par people.

PM managers are busy labeling their subordinates work as their own to get more credit (writing email to ceo without acknowledging those who are doing work) but same people lack depth when technical questions are asked.
There are 2 layers of management and then a functional PM and those are now leaving one by one. Expect more yes men and few doers in future, feel bad for engineering though.

It's toxic and stay away, unless you have godfather who are joining from certain companies (even then introspect and ask yourself if it's worth it)"
87,Zscaler,They want you to win,2021-06-14,5.0,COMMERCIAL SALES Engineer,"Everything revolves around the success of the employee. The interview process is long to make sure that they get the right fit. You just have to trust in the system that is in place and you'll be successful. Competitive pay, good benefits, amazing technology that's easy to differentiate themselves from others.","Because they want the best employees, the interview process tends to be a bit long and in depth. Be prepared for technical interviews well as a panel presentation. They give you the topics to study beforehand, however. No English teacher with a red pen mentality."

The leadership team hires the best talent (smart, sterling character, collaborative and problem solvers). Everyone is aligned and rowing in the same direction, so we can go even faster together as a team. We also have a lot of fun.

Specific to my organization, the SDRs have high IQ and EQ, are outgoing, very driven and eager to learn and to help their teammates. It's an awesome group to be part of, with a lot of creative individuals that share their ideas/tips and proactively push themselves and their teammates to improve daily. Passion and excitement is evident.

The SDR leadership team is also phenomenal, coming to Zscaler from other high-tech companies. They're great at coaching individuals to maximize strengths, learn key skills, and overcome gaps, and they genuinely enjoy doing it! 

Finally, the company recognizes the value that SDRs bring to Zscaler, both to drive more pipeline and more new logos, but also to serve as the talent bench for our sales teams. The career path is real, as we've promoted 8 SDRs in the last 6 months to both sales and renewals roles. It's well known that the sales team here is second to none and they love mentoring SDRs too (this is very valuable to people early in their careers).","We go very fast, so be ready to bring your best every day!

Fragile future : Becoming IKEA, of building products, with top-down dates, will lead to quality, as its more driven to deliver quantity and speed.

People are open to observations from the 'new guy' as well as dumb questions that inevitably get asked from the 'new guy'. I'm really looking forward to my next 90 days and beyond!","Some areas for improvement could be internal documentation management is confusing and fractured - there's a lot of documentation, but it's everywhere and not clear what is definitive and most up to date. The surge in new hires means there are a lot of new people to the sales process and selling the solution without a complete understanding of either the process or the solution. A lot of hands are required to sell, which is confusing. The sales process is well thought out at the high-level, but at the lower levels, needs more work."

There benefits list makes it sound like the perks are included, what they mean is they offer it with premiums.

Culture appeals to thoughtful, empathetic, and process driven personalities that embrace accountability.","Company is growing fast. Remains to be seen how the back office functions will keep up. The sales process is highly disciplined and might not be for everyone. Working at Zscaler is 'more than just a job', it's an experience.

247,Zscaler,Excellent working environment,2020-05-18,4.0,Transformation Analyst,"Zscaler is an exciting company with a clear mission and a clear market need. While this public company is embracing a lot of big enterprise process, it still has a ""disruptor"" feel as it takes its cloud security message to a market that hasn't necessarily understood a better way of doing enterprise security. It's a refreshing place to work. Very smart people doing some pretty cool tech.",None right now that I can find.

- The new culture created and fostered by Dali Rajic (CRO) and his former AppD team is that of a hungry and winning group of A-player talent with something to prove. 
- I've never worked with a team who has the ability to move so fast, so effectively. 
- Not only is the talent high, expectations are high, but the support to get you there is unwavering and abundant. 
- The structure provided to help get you started is established and growing. Very impressive enablement structure.","- A lot of change brings on a fair number of challenges. While all intended to lead us to great things, some are feel less than great while you're still trudging through it."

- Well positioned to take advantage of the ongoing cloud transformation as companies moves from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud
- Some nice traditions that are still observed, e.g. annual beach day, Holi and other cultural celebrations
- Absence of politics for the most part, but something to monitor as the company expands rapidly
- Excellent upper and middle management in most functional areas","- Lack of diversity in some departments
- Average to mediocre benefits (401K matching, cellphone stipend, no cafeteria at HQ)
- Lack of visibility and manager focus on career growth pathway
- Sometimes management's message on customer satisfaction and operational excellence can come across as lack of employee empathy especially in light of the challenges created by COVID-19"

The technology is great, it really works, and I'm happy to be part of this ride we're on. Reminds me a lot of another great tech company, back when its culture was strong and innovation was at its peak. I'm looking forward to seeing what the leadership has to bring in the coming months.","Sometimes it can feel a bit overwhelming with the number of projects and fast-paced nature of the deadlines, but that's to be expected when the company makes a strong shift towards a better direction.

The product just works and its allows customers to have a great balance of Security and Customer Experience.  The people are always willing to help and leadership has a great vision.  With our new leadership on the sales side we have a great process in place to maximize our efforts and to enable us to partner with our customers.",Nothing yet...happiest I am been as an employer
258,Zscaler,Solid company with high focus on customer success,2020-04-06,5.0,Regional Sales Manager,"1. Everything is about customer success.  2. Problems we fix are big and hairy.  3. Exec team ""walk's the walk"".  Not just hot air.",1. 100% focus on customer means it can get intense and hours long.  2. Growing fast so if a person doesn't have a track record of succesfull self-management then they can get overwhelmed.

261,Zscaler,"Horribly Culture, Misleading Marketing and Product Sales Strategy",2020-03-31,1.0,Sales,"Base way was decently competitive, benefits were ok.","CEO is far too involved in everything and has no trust in any employees. Believes the product is so easy and sells itself that sales staff are treated like they don't matter.

They keep hiring sales people and reducing territories, no one can make quota long term. Place is like a revolving door of people leaving or getting let go.

A lot of misleading marketing about products.

Culture is horrible, CEO's brother in law is in charge of your travel and will put you in a lousy hotel to save $5 or have you on flights with connections."
262,Zscaler,Great Place to Work!,2020-03-04,5.0,Sales Operations Manager,"The market is primed for what Zscaler has to offer and it's exciting to join a place that creates cutting-edge technology. Any company that is a disruptor is always exciting to be a part of especially when they are making the investment in top GTM talent and leadership. 

Everyone that works here is passionate about what they do and the excitement is contagious and pushes you to become better in your role every day.",None that I can think of.

264,Zscaler,Growing pain,2020-02-26,3.0,Senior Program Manager,"Exciting technologies, inspiring CEO, good top-down communication","Departmental silos. Dismal, inexperienced middle management in some areas.  Simple things (updating external web pages) involve months of cajoling and inter-departmental negotiations on deliverable timeline and processes.  New hire 90-day check-up from HR consists of a  5-minute meeting because she knows that she cannot exert change anyway."

Zscaler works hard to set you up for success as an individual in your career as well as a team player in the Zscaler family.","There is still inner politics like at most tech companies.

267,Zscaler,Sales Roles are a Ticking Time Bomb,2020-02-20,2.0,Sales,The chance to work with high end network and security technology that is truly disruptive and transformative.,"The management team tries to manage the small accounts and the large accounts to the same metrics and operational rhythms.  

Because you know - Fortune 100 buy exactly the same as a  100 person company.  

The solution is so difficult that ZScaler has built a hero cult of ‘closers.’ Most of the heroes show up and throw up the same slides and refuse to listen to the client.  

Marketing is so confused that they launch a new and totally different campaign every 2 weeks."

270,Zscaler,Great People Focused Company with Open Communication,2020-01-12,5.0,Technical Account Manager,"People focused with good autonomy of work. Open communication is encouraged, so it's easy to reach the right people to solve a problem. Tickets and good structure are preferred and trackable in most cases. However, collaborating and solving issues is best done directly without a ""chain of command.""","For those working remote like me it can be more isolating, but active communication by Slack, web meeting, and email helps bridge the office social gap.

276,Zscaler,Great Company and Great Work Culture,2019-12-11,5.0,Staff Software Engineer,This company is growing at a fast pace in one of the best technology segments. Work culture is great and there is very open communication between all the layers. Work-life balance is awesome. There is always something new to learn.,The stock price fluctuates a lot.
277,Zscaler,"4+ years in, still being challenged to get better!",2019-12-06,5.0,Director,"This company continues to grow and continues to invest in getting better.  New leadership is top notch and the focus is on growing revenue and customer bases without sacrificing the culture.  I cannot think of a time in my career where I have been surrounded by people willing to do their own job + more.  Fast paced, reward for risk, and ok with failure as long as you are willing to learn.  Humbled to be leading a team where my directs are often better than I am on the job.  This company has not lost its passion for leading edge tech, taking care of customers, and constantly educating everyone in how to dominate a marketplace.  Right time, right leadership, disruptive tech, and unlimited growth opportunities if you can handle them.","Expectations are high and the pace is frenetic; still run like a start-up.  You must be agile, able to take criticism, and comfortable working within a bit of ambiguity at times.  This company expects you to take an idea or role and run it as if it were your own company.  Not for the weak and the pace does not let up.  If you need to be told what to do, this might not be the place for you."
278,Zscaler,Still Great,2019-12-04,5.0,Senior Director,"Been at Zscaler for 4 years and have not regretted the move.  This is turning out to be one of the top 2 places I've ever worked.  The employees are what make it a fantastic experience. You go home and feel good about not only what you accomplished, but how you accomplished the job.  It's still very much a start-up mentality with little to no politics, just good people focused on doing a great job without a lot of ego. However you want to measure success Zscaler has it - products, revenue, growth, disruptive technology, great place to work certification, and the list goes on.","I've read the negative reviews on here and honestly, I have not had the same experience.  Sometimes makes me wonder if we work at the same company.   Zscaler is what you make of it and certainly isn't for everyone.  The pace is really fast and expectations are incredibly high.  You have to be able to thrive (not just cope) in a founder led environment without a guidebook to tell you what to do all the time.  Most of the cons I've experienced are growth related - having the tools and resources you need can be a challenge."
279,Zscaler,Just keeps getting better,2019-12-06,5.0,People & Culture,"I joined the company pre-IPO when there was massive excitement  and potential. I have to say not much has changed 3 years later. Back then, there were predictions - global and domestic growth, revenue projections, product and market demand, etc. ....and they've all been fulfilled. Today's Zscaler is proven and solid. We're 100% obsessed with customer satisfaction and that seems to guide all or most of the decisions within the company, as far as I can see.","Honestly, none that I can think to mention."
280,Zscaler,Why I love Zscaler,2019-12-06,5.0,Recruiter,"Culture is great, feels like family. 
Commitment to our employees, to our customers and our partners.

Amazing technology and customers who rave about the value that we deliver are only a few reasons to take a good look at Zscaler when looking to elevate your career","None that I can think of as long as you like being challenged and working in a fast paced, high growth company"
282,Zscaler,Great place to be!,2019-12-04,5.0,Senior Sales Sourcer,The people are hands down one of the greatest assets to Zscaler and I have been impressed by everyone I have had the chance to work with. The company really values it's employees and you have the chance to be part of something really exciting happening here. Tons of growth and excitement around where we are at in the marketplace and what the opportunity is ahead of us to take over more market share.,"At this point I don't have any major cons. Zscaler moves fast and there are tons of moving parts so if you are not ready to be agile and adjust, this probably wouldn't be a great match."

285,Zscaler,Zscaler Company Review,2019-11-05,5.0,Corporate Events Manager,1) The people I work with a truly awesome people and make me laugh everyday. 2) We get free lunch every Thursday 3) The front office staff always puts on great events 4) Great stock options and employee benefits,I wish we had unlimited PTO.... As an employee your constantly stressing about not having enough and what that causes to happen is not taking the vacation you need to reset
286,Zscaler,Good technology supported by flawed organization with poor outlook,2019-11-11,3.0,Sales Engineer,"- the product is a good cloud platform. There are no competitors who can claim to do this and have the stats to match
- people who joined before the IPO got a great pay-out and the company benefits are gradually improving, like 401k matching, sick days.","- technology shifts made Zscaler and will break Zscaler. IPv6, DoH, TLS 1.3+  are all breaking platform functionality and increasing required workarounds
- recently announced features are lame-ducks on delivery - ZDX is to reduce support ticket CASB functionality is feature poor, not competitive
- Zscaler has technically smart people with zero understanding of effective enablement and a sales team which doesn't have any market understanding all the way through to having no basic IT skills
- training and marketing material is focused on creating and delivering a message for delivery by the Zscaler CEO and no one else. Even master decks look like from 2013 and as a mix tape of other decks
-  this is a poor foundation as product expands and new hires are started. Execution erodes while personalities with little output fill the void of those who are fired or move on to something better
- the IPO was successful and many employees lazy waiting for last heavily discounted ESPP payday
- there are few paths for progression in any part of the organization that don't require office politics"

4. No barriers on who you can reach out to because the management hierarchy walls don't exist within Zscaler. This is attributed to the open culture which has been cultivated over time.","1.

There is no one who even does a baby shower for pregnant women nor congratulate after birth. A colleague was pregnant and no one did anything for her like I saw at past employer places. 
It is a top down approach only where promotions are only given to YES men. People hired in management  are only through their connections rather than merit based. 
There is no encouragement on internal movement either. The amount of politics in some organizations is something I have never seen before."
311,Zscaler,What's Not To Love?,2019-06-17,5.0,Solutions Architect,"The company has two market leading and amazing products that secure users access private and public Internet applications.  There is huge value in customers adopting the pair of products.  The Product Management PM team is second to none in understanding the problem of connecting globally distributed users to globally distributed applications.  The culture is one of integrity, frugality, hard work, and fun which match to my own values.",I really have to think hard on cons.  I do see some hints of focusing on the process over outcome starting to crop up with growth but minimally.  The processes have good intentions but perhaps not a direct measure of outcomes.

317,Zscaler,A Pretty Special Place,2019-05-14,5.0,G&A Team Member,"While I’ve been at the company to see it grow from 500 to well over 1,000, something that remains the same is the strong culture of hardworking, friendly and genuine people that are always willing to help. We don’t have execs or leaders who are above doing something whether it means helping set up tables for an event or taking the extra time to explain something to a more entry level person. There is a strong sense of integrity here and from time to time our company values have gotten challenged, but in the end our leadership proves that we don’t just slap our values up on a website or a PowerPoint, we actually live by them.","Some challenges are that processes aren’t always in place and aren’t always followed if they are in place, however, sometimes that’s the fun in working here - you get to make the process. Teams are open to new ideas and are willing to hear you out. One major con would be that there is a no work from home policy. There can be flexibility if you need to stay home for say something being delivered or someone coming to your house to fix something, but for the most part, teams are discouraged to WFH “just because”. Hopefully this will change over time."

331,Zscaler,Excellent place to work,2019-04-02,5.0,Software Engineer,"I have been working at Zscaler for almost 3 years, as an engineer, in the San Jose headquarters.  Therefore, I can only speak to my experiences regarding the engineering side of the company.

This is an excellent place to work.  The engineering teams are incredibly dedicated and tight-knit.  People here work very hard, but more in the sense of wanting to do a great job and not letting your colleagues down, rather than because your boss is breathing down your neck.

There is an intense focus on doing what you have to do to keep our customers happy.

They treat you as an adult here.  You can have flexibility as far as ""face time hours"" in the office if you need it, but of course you are expected to get your work done regardless and behave responsibly.

This place is not for everyone.  If you're not that dedicated to your job, it's not for you.  If your attitude is ""I work hard from 9am-6pm, but after that I shut it down and make it difficult for anyone to reach me,"" this place is not for you either.

But if you have the passion and the dedication, and enjoy working with like-minded engineers in a (mostly) bureaucracy-free environment, I strongly recommend this company.

Also, it's not all work and no play here.  There are plenty of celebrations and fun events (on-site and off-site), formal and informal gatherings in the break areas, once-a-week free lunches, endless free snacks and drinks, etc.  I think it's the right balance.","I have heard that the pay is just average for the Valley.  But I cannot personally vouch for this, as I'm satisfied with my salary (no idea if I'm average or below-average) and don't know what others make either."
332,Zscaler,Best company I've ever worked for,2019-04-01,5.0,Sales Engineer,"Love the team spirit, and the exceptional talent that is here at Zscaler.  I've worked many Security and other IT jobs over my career, and this is one of the best companies I've worked for.    Hard at work, hard at play, it's just a great place to be.","Company is growing fast, and that itself and be an issue with change.  But if you manage that well, it's only to increase what's good in the Pros above."
333,Zscaler,Great Company for Challenging Rewarding Work,2019-04-02,5.0,Senior Regional Security Engineer,Zscaler is not afraid to reward hard work that translates into successful outcomes in customer engagements. Excellent sales and technical leadership for transformational network and application access.,On boarding with Zscaler is challenging as the platform has many features that span the complete suite of secure cloud computing.

416,Zscaler,The Right Architecture at the Right Time,2018-01-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Zscaler has designed their service from the ground up using a multi-tenant cloud architecture, enabling the service to cost effectively scale higher and add new functionality faster than others who just added appliances into data centers and called it a cloud service.  This architecture has enabled Zscaler to capture more of the market as companies shift their apps to the cloud and want to move their security services between wherever the users are and the resources they are trying to access.

Management believes deeply in the mission and is focused and driven with a high bar for entry and high expectations after you join.  For me, this is a positive.  

The company has been growing very fast in the couple years I have been here, which is both a positive and a strain.","Growing so fast makes it hard to recruit and train new people while continuing to get the job done.

Our regular Monday breakfasts and Thursday lunches, and our various planned and impromptu activities (ice cream social, churros & hot chocolate, bbqs, cultural celebrations, etc.) provide an opportunity for us to get to know our fellow employees and encourage cross team communication and collaboration.

Leadership is extremely poor and the CEO cannot seem to get out of his own way to allow people to do their job, not to mention trust anyone to create success. Everything is slow to happen here and budget approvals are nearly impossible to get because everything comes down to penny pinching. Pay is low and Zscaler's intention is to low ball everyone as much as possible and deny raises when they are deserved. They also like to hire someone to do one job function or manage one territory then pile on more once they are hired. That person must ""prove themselves"" until the next evaluation period to secure the title or raise they deserved that previous year. They cannot keep good talent and have seen extremely high turnover. Working at this company is like being in an abusive relationship where you are gaslighted,  slapped around and made to feel like you are not worthy. Many people stay here longer than they want to and cannot wait to leave, just counting the days until they vest."

New leadership seems to have culture back on track","Crowded market trying to compete with existing, appliance based security products that customers that may not love what they have, but are wary to move away from.  The devil you know...
Company claims a large number of customers but appears that a percentage of those are actually ex-customers having dropped the service, yet are still counted as customers in the marketing slides.
Customers complain of complicated deployments, outtages too often.  As a Cloud-only company the top priority should be stability and UX.
Sales seems to be a dizzying revolving door, mostly from reps leaving vs being let go.  Most companies are intrigued with the solution, but when it comes time to purchase, most find it too risky to move away from existing solution, or deem it a low priority project.
Micro management, daily updates in Salesforce lead to too much time spent on CRM vs selling.  On more than one occasion temporary change in a forecast has led to an immediate call from the manager, even when the change was temporary.

433,Zscaler,Reported for fake reviews - here's the truth,2017-01-09,1.0,Inside Sales Representative,"For customers that are able to get it deployed without a ton of issues, the product itself is very solid and robust.  When going through a demo with a customer showing what the solution is capable of, I frequently hear things like “wow!” and “that is awesome!”  Though difficult to deploy (much more on that below) the technology behind Zscaler and the capabilities of the solution is most impressive.","Customer support is terrible, especially during the initial deployment phase, and returns are through the roof high.  When you close a sale, you then have to hand hold the customer and support through the entire deployment process to keep things in line, and then escalate, escalate, and escalate some more when things get out of hand, which happens on almost every deal (not exaggerating).  Many (though far from all) of our deployment technicians are technically capable, but are very difficult to understand, have terrible communication & customer support skills, take forever to respond to inquiries, etc.  I’ve had multiple customers commenting on their deployment experience saying things like “the entire thing has been a sad comedy of errors” and “it’s getting silly, to put it nicely”.  The return rate is the highest I’ve ever seen at a company.  After you close a sale you’re then sitting on pins and needles hoping it doesn’t come back.  This isn’t so much a knock on our deployment team as it is a commentary on the refusal of leadership (specifically Jay) to adequately staff and train the reps.  Multiple requests have been made that would help resolve this issue which Jay has shot down.  

As if the massive returns were not enough, even if everything we sold stayed sold, the team would still be well below 50% of their number due to a combination of a refusal to invest in marketing and an insistence on setting wildly outlandish quotas.  Executive leadership expressed to Jay, with data supporting their case, what quotas should set at.  Jay stubbornly refused and insisted on quotas that were more than double what was proposed.  On a team of more than a dozen tenured seasoned sales professionals, not one made it even halfway to the number this past fiscal year.  (Again, not exaggerating.) 

These returns have had a very negative impact on our relationship with channel partners.  Word has gotten around at CDW & SHI not to waste time selling Zscaler as there’s a good chance it’ll be returned and you’ll have a customer satisfaction issue on your hands.  There are some things going on at a high level to grow these partnerships, but at the ground level where the rubber hits the road, it’s ugly.

Another true story regarding returns: It has happened more than once where a rep would close a deal, then leave Zscaler or move to another role, and then when the deal got returned, the rep that was then covering the territory when the return came took a hit.  They never got paid for the initial sale, yet got dinged when the return came.  That is not right, yet it has happened more than once.  Add this to the list of other shady & unethical things others have reported in their reviews.

If you happen to work in sales for Zscaler, be very sure to keep track of what you earn and triple check your paychecks.  More than once a reps commission check was wrong.  We would have to call out the error, fight to get it corrected, then they acted like everything was fine all along.

One shining light in all the deployment issues was the director of deployment, who was phenomenal to work with and did the best he could with what little funding and resources he was allotted.  He recently left the company, and I can’t say I blame him.  At least when things went south with a deployment, which they often did, we could count on him.  Not any more.  

He’s far from the first director/executive to leave.  The turnover rate at the executive level is unbelievably high.  The CFO that was supposed to help the company go public recently left.  Several area directors have left.  There’s been a high turnover rate with SE managers, CMOs, VP of sales, VP of sales ops, etc.  So many executives leaving is clearly a telling sign.  Why are they leaving?  The word from many of them has been that Jay is an extremely difficult CEO to work for.  He micromanages everything, sets ridiculous expectations, does not empower you to do what you need to do to be successful and meet said expectations, and is stubborn and arrogant beyond belief.   It’s funny - the “Z” in “Zscaler” stands for “Zenith”.  We’re the “zenith of scalability” and when it comes to web security, we offer a level of scalability that others don’t and can’t.  It’s amazing how Jay can understand the importance of scalability in that sense and yet not understand how his micromanagement style is preventing his company from scaling the way it should.

This mass exodus of executive leadership is not a new thing.  Though I believe the recent/current round is likely the worst the company has seen, it has been the modus operandi to have a major shake-up every couple years.  As some have put it “At Zscaler I’m never at a startup - I’m always at a re-startup.”  Jay burns through one round of leaders and then rather than learn anything just replaces them with another set until he burns through them the same way.  

I’ve noticed a trend here on Glassdoor where after an honest detailed negative review is given, a very generic positive review quickly follows.  It seems that something dishonest is going on here to prevent future candidates from seeing the truth about the organization they are considering joining.  For example, sort the reviews by date and notice how two detailed reviews titled “""This a promising company with significant problems on multiple levels"" and “""Difficult place to work"" were quickly followed by the very generic ""Proud to Be at Zscaler"" and ""Happy at Zscaler"".  If that’s not enough, notice the reviews on December 14, 2016.  Roughly a dozen five-star reviews on the same day?!?!?  Clearly dishonestly and unethically gaming the system, and reported to Glassdoor for such.  

As an interesting aside, whoever it was on the Austin team that wrote “""Proud to Be at Zscaler"" is either no longer around or on their way out as they are shutting the Austin office down per Jay’s refusal to invest in mid-market.  The aforementioned former CFO told him that he wants this thing to take off and go public, he has got to invest in mid-market.  The former CTO he hired from GE said on a webcast in front of the whole company that mid-market was the biggest area of opportunity for growth.  Many other leaders in the organization, and throughout the industry, have stated the same thing.  Their response?  Refuse to invest in mid-market and kick that team to the curb.  

If you click on “rating trends” above, you’ll notice things peaked around May/June of 2015 and have been on a steady decline ever since.  This can be attributed to several things, but here’s what I see as driving the rating trends: Leading up to and including the May/June 2015 timeframe, there was a lot of excitement.  A new global VP of sales had recently joined.  A new CFO that was going to help us go public.  A solid CMO that was literally smashing our appliance based competition.  A phenomenal sales director was building out the mid-market team to help the company get a steady stream of smaller deals to get to the predictable/repeatable/sustainable place shareholders want to see.  There was a feeling throughout the organization like “this rocket is about to really take off!”  Then everyone gradually started seeing that it was all for naught as Jay stubbornly refused to take any advice from the new leaders he had hired and would not enable them to do what he hired them to do.  It was all downhill from there.  

When it comes to tech companies, Zscaler will go down as one of the greatest blown opportunities by a founder/CEO in history - an exact “what should’ve been but never was” scenario.  He literally had everything he needed to fulfill the vision and then some.  All he had to do was get out of the way.   The right product, at the right place, at the right time, with the wrong leader.  The blockbuster IPO that was touted for so long was not a pipe dream or empty words.  It truly could’ve and should’ve been that way.  

What I have expressed in this review is far from my own isolated opinion.  Most everything I’ve said is right in line with the general consensus of many if not most Zscaler employees.  Anyone who paints a different picture is most likely either being deceptive or is still drinking the kool aid.  Don’t buy it.

Everything I’ve said here has been said internally a thousand times."

442,Zscaler,"Overall okay, but not for mktg or comms",2016-09-23,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Technology is great, probably the best in that space
-Jay truly cares about taking this company IPO
-Some of the best colleagues I have ever met
-New office is a great upgrade from the original office (location could still be better though)
- Most departments are run well and are well represented with senior management, that cannot be said for mktg and comms though
-Free lunch every Thursday","-Culture is lacking. HR is trying to fix it, but with how the company is run morale and culture are very low
-IPO is no longer discussed, and with the CFO leaving there doesn't seem to be a road map
-Mktg/comms: If you are thinking of working at Zscaler in either of these teams, run. Each CMO has about a 2 year stint and is then replaced, and this has been consistent for the past several years. Current CMO micromanages people to make them feel inferior and like they are entry level employees, rather than individuals that are seasoned in this industry. CMO is more interested in keeping tabs on when you are coming/leaving/taking lunch/ working remote than your quality work and what you are getting accomplished. The current CMO has created an environment where it is impossible to please him, and the company has lost a lot of great talent because of him.
-Office is an upgrade from previous location, but it is basically still in Alviso. Not much around it, and is not in the right location. If you want to be in Silicon Valley, but in the heart of the Valley
-Compensation and benefits are not competitive in the industry, getting a raise is very difficult. No matching 401K, no paid maternity leave, health insurance is okay. No ""perks"" in the office except for free snacks and drinks, which are rationed so they don't have to buy as many."

The people they hire are top notch professionals with great experience.","This organization lacks real sales leadership. It starts with the top rolls down the hills to all the sales reps. We all realize that no sales organization is perfect, but this was probably the worst environments. We were treated as step-children, never fully be adopted as a long-term strategy of the company.

448,Zscaler,Not a great place for sales and marketing,2016-07-01,1.0,,"Great technology with large, well-known Global 2000 customers, industry recognition and market traction.","Where do I begin?

For anyone in the sales and marketing orgs, beware that there is high turnover with the CMO and CRO roles turning over every 2 years or less with their high-performing staff soon following (and leaving the employees who can't get jobs elsewhere).  Even the CFO has left recently putting into question the IPO timeline they have been continually touting.  

Even with a great technology, the company gets in its own way in terms of executing well to capture market demand.  The company started a team to go after the mid-market, for example, and it should have been a market they could have won but recently they dismissed the whole sales team and it's clear they will re-group and only serve the large enterprise.

Finally, Jay is an accomplished serial entrepreneur but is a micromanager.  It might have worked with a smaller engineering organization but it doesn't scale to 200+ sales and marketing employees globally.  As a proof point, EMEA tends to do better than North America because those teams are more free to execute!"
449,Zscaler,Sales,2016-06-25,1.0,Sales,"Great Product. They do somehow lure in top talent from around the industry with fake promises, including an IPO that is never going to happen, especially with the recent departure of the CFO. CEO is very good at ""playing the games"", a la Gartner Magic Quadrant and somehow gaining Unicorn Status.","CEO is a control freak and as cheap as they come who uses his credit card to book travel through Expedia for the company so he can get the points. 
Mass exodus of employees over the past month including the CFO and 4 CMO's in the past few years."
450,Zscaler,This a promising company with significant problems on multiple levels,2016-04-12,2.0,Sales,"- Without a doubt, Zscaler's core technology is superior to nearly everyone we're competing against, particularly when you compare the Zscaler Cloud against more traditional appliance-based solutions. If my review were based on the tech alone, it would easily be 4+ stars

- Product Management and Development team is really responsive, both to internal suggestions and to customer feature requests. Numerous significant feature enhancements have grown rapidly from feedback from real customers, which is awesome to see at a company growing this quickly

- Internal communication from product management / product development teams is typically really good - those groups are staffed by really strong engineers who are doing fantastic work on a rapid refresh-cycle

- Product pipeline is very strong, with service enhancements and new SKU's coming at a steady clip, and all in response to actual customer demand 

- Partnerships with resellers like CDW, SHI, etc. are growing rapidly

- New Headquarters building is great, and a significant improvement over the old location","- The entire Sales organization is imploding, and senior management are apparently unwilling or unable to do anything about it. Quality people are leaving at a steady pace and either being replaced by lower-level talent or (in many cases) not replaced at all

- Overall communications from upper management tends to be awful. Sales org employees *never* know where things stand, and typically have to turn to the rumor mill to get a sense of what's going on. Zscaler has a serious cultural problem with poor internal communications (other than from engineering / PM teams as noted above), leading to seriously poor morale and high staff turnover

- Current Sales Org leadership has adopted a severely antagonistic stance toward their employees, announcing brutal changes that severely reduce the potential earnings of commissioned salespeople, and concluding the announcements with, ""...and if you don't like these changes, you know where the door is, please show yourselves out.""

- Sales management have repeatedly set sales quotas wildly out of sync with pipeline, resulting in sales teams missing their quarterly quotas by 50, 60, even 70%, with no quota relief. All concerns about quotas are treated as a personal failing of the employee, rather than a systemic failure of management

- Marketing efforts have been highly ineffective. Executive team took nearly a year to hire a new Chief Marketing Officer after the previous person left

- Exiting managers after share the same advice with trusted subordinates: ""avoid taking any sort of middle-management role at Zscaler - you will be micromanaged to death from the CEO down, given no room to grow or develop your team, and then pushed out for failing to hit wildly unrealistic goals""

- Stock options are extremely skimpy - if you are granted any stock when you are hired, you'll never see another share however long you stay

- ""Benefits package"" is painfully bare-bones - if you're hired here, expect significant and recurring out-of-pocket medical expenses, no retirement funds matching whatsoever, etc. I've seen fast food jobs with cushier benefit packages

- HR team is highly ineffective. Expect no support, encouragement or guidance from them

- Many of the ""5 star"" reviews you'll read here on GlassDoor are specifically requested by Zscaler management, and many of them incorporate specifically-selected language from internal-only training presentations and videos. Zscaler management are very aware of their coveted ""Unicorn"" status and actively encourage employees to leave glowing reviews. I don't care *who* you work for - if you can't think of a single specific ""con"" to share about your complex and struggling late-stage startup, your review is worthless

- Look through the history of Zscaler reviews posted here, and you'll notice several which prompted responses from Zscaler executives. Example: note that the criticism that one reviewer shared of the Sales organization was met with assurances by a high-ranking officer that states, ""... our VP of North American sales is a superstar and has been at the firm since the beginning of 2014. We are bringing large numbers of great new salespeople into the company - and we expect to keep them for the long haul."" In the time since that reply by the executive was posted, the person he was referring to was fired (or was pushed out), the executive who posted that reply was fired (or was pushed out), and numerous other salespeople and middle-managers were fired or quit. Not exactly reassuring"
451,Zscaler,Happy at Zsclaer,2016-04-25,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I'd say Zscaler is a 4+ star company with solid potential to be a 5 star company.  

It's a late stage pre-ipo company with the typical pros and cons that go along with that.  If you like that type of environment you'll love it here.  Know that it's not a like a Google or Facebook that spend enormous amounts of money on free everything everywhere. But it's also not an uncaring environment that takes advantage of its employees.  I'd say its a good balance that is run smartly.

Yes there is free food, snacks and drinks.  They bring in lunch for everyone on Thursdays and celebrate milestones with happy hour type celebrations. But that's not what makes it 4 stars - What makes it cool is people actually stay and hang out together.  They don't just grab food and go back to their desk. You can see that people are friends and like to spend time with each other. 

The network security market is the place to be and the cloud approach is clearly ahead of the game.  There is no question that in 5 to 10 years' time cloud based security will be the primary approach to network security.  It's a good feeling to be at a company with products that are ahead of the game.","Again, its the typical late stage pre-ipo stuff like lack of tools or people to get things done as quickly as you'd like.  If you are used to that you know how to deal with it.

Core benefits are competitive but having some of the fringe stuff would push the rating higher - more generous time off policy, lower out of pocket expenses, education reimbursement, etc.  I suspect more will come as the company grows."
452,Zscaler,"Great product, smart employees, poor compensation package, ethically questionable",2016-04-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Innovative product which competitors can only hope to mimic through workarounds and shortcuts. Competitors might match on basic features but not performance, feature richness, ability to scale, or reliability.
- Strongest product management and engineering team I've worked with - forward moving, communicative, with a clear direction.
- The hiring process on the whole works and there are a lot of experienced employees who can execute on the vision.","- Miserly stock options with no ability to gain more through service/rewards/recognition. If you weren't at Zscaler prior to 2011 you are outside the circle.
- India based support, while technically competent, provides a poor experience. Larger customers are pushed to premium support to offset this while smaller customers complain constantly.
- Executive micro-management breeds contempt and inability to function. Replacement CMO took nearly a year to hire while the pipeline became bone dry. Upper management communicates unreliably and the rumor mill is often weeks or months ahead of any significant announcements.
- Poor compensation package - no 401k matching, cheapest healthcare plan available (expect to significantly pay out of pocket). Stock options don't make up for this disparity.
- IPO has been carrot on a string for too long - start opening up that this isn't happening until late 2017 at the earliest."
453,Zscaler,Difficult place to work,2016-04-15,1.0,Sales,"The cloud-based product is unique and has a chance to make a significant mark in the security field.
Many wonderful, talented people working here.","Others have said it before. This is Jay's company and he is not the person to lead it into the future. He has a small group of trusted insiders and many of them are in that circle because of their ability to pull Jay's strings. Many people are frustrated, not only by the lack of what seems to be an IPO that is constantly pushed further and further in to the future but because of the seemingly constant need to navigate the political waters of Zscaler.

Zscaler may still succeed because they've built something unique. However, making money is not the only measure of a company's success. Jay doesn't balance culture with the other aspects of running  a company. Unfortunate."

Look up the Bloomberg article with Ceo on that.  Hiring so many sales people but shrinking territories.  Direct sales are not happening.  Marketing is terrible.  PM team is failrly weak.  Total unfocused path.  These guys bought Gartner and Forrester (and flat out lied at times to them).  Stock options are an illusion.  Look up what CEO has done in the past with his older companies.  Best COO Lane Bess left - why is that if they are going IPO soon?!  And ask about the 'board' .  CEO and his family control most of the shares.  Bess left and has a seat.  So no really oversight.  The CMO worked at a company that got shutdown and he got booted from Google.  Otherwise no security experience there.  CFO claim to fame was raising money in her last company.  Hmmm I wonder what she is being tasked to here?  Ops team and custome support are pretty bad.  They fired so many people - they just 'disappear' like they were in old school Russia!
