- Comp: Base salary is pretty good; RSUs are low compared to other companies (although stock price doubled); 5 year sabbatical is cool
- Working / locations has gotten very flexible during the pandemic...nice
- Trend towards managed verticals (sneakers, collectibles, motors, handbags, etc) is good
- People who work for the local biz unit (i.e. UK, North America) report high job satisfaction and seem to have a good quality of life
- Short term biz outlook: Good, lots of 'found money' from advertising and managed payments","Some things I don't like:
- Shipping code: OMG things move so slowly; Lots of old legacy code
- Operations: This company needs a COO to fix things; API dev sandbox doesn't work; Quarterly planning bureaucracy is ridiculous; Small changes require way too much discussion
- Very poor diversity: Staff isn't representative of our buyers and sellers; There seems to be a huge bias in product and eng towards hiring people from India (usually by managers who are from India)
- Many of the eng and product team don't use eBay and therefore don't understand customer needs
- People who work in product and eng report lower job satisfaction (not terrible, but lower than local biz unit) indicative of work load + pain in shipping code
- Product mgr turnover was high in 2021; Lots of people I know left
- Long term biz outlook: We need more buyers...losing the youth market"

So many sellers we’re screwed over. Great agents started getting fired for silly reasons. People who were crap, got higher positions because they “knew someone” and outside people filled positions that some of our internal people were next in line for. Eventually eBay made it impossible to follow through with members, we put up with overseas agents lying and promising to customers and we take the fall, we have no time or opportunities to follow up and make sure things we promise get done. We are micro managed by “leaders” who are completely policy based and can’t think outside of the box, they micro manage top agents and then try to get them fired, if they think independently and do what’s best for eBay and the customer. The very thing they will hire you for at first. There is agents meanwhile that have constant issues while working from home, they will abuse leaves etc… but those people are never let go. Instead we have leadership who is insecure about teammates that are good enough to threaten their jobs and we harassment that goes unreported because we’re being intimidated by someone in power. It’s not a good place to work anymore. Just wait…. The downfall is coming."

I have been promised a promotion 4 different times in a year with no differences. My performance has been praised, with nothing but a ‘nice’ to show for it. Very demotivating. 

When reaching out to management for questions or concerns, if you are lucky enough to get a response, it is often responded with a false promise to follow back up. 

They rave about their amazing benefits, when I have had much much better benefits at every other company I’ve worked for. I’ve never paid so much for Dr visits in my life. WITH insurance. 

They do not care about their employees, unless you are management and allow no sick leave without dipping into your paid time off. If you don’t have enough- they will put that in the negative before they just let you be sick, so your time away from work is minimal. Colleagues have had to miss their own fathers funeral due to this. Otherwise they would have lost their job. 

We also been promised for over a year that we would be able to change our schedule to a different shift start time or days you work, which is also has never come to fruition.

This company has nothing positive to offer, aside from the work from home option."

You are not even a human being if you are in QA. The whole company looks down on QA as some sort of second class citizen that they want to get rid of as soon as possible and the executives will say it to your face if they don't know you're in QA.

It's a bad place for development, too. They have a bunch of proprietary technologies they use and learning those is a gigantic waste of time. First, you're learning to use badly written code, poorly designed user interfaces, and tools sets that can only be described as antediluvian. It's madness. The technologies you are learning to work with are used by no other company in the world because it's proprietary. When I was there they had their own version of cloud services for internal use. It was terrible and you need to be using an industry standard platform like AWS or Azure if you want career growth outside eBay.

1. Management does not care about you. You are a work horse for them and will continue to put pressure unless you set limits. 
2. No clear path for advancement.  Literally none. You can ask your manager about this in every 1:1, that is if you’re lucky enough to have the same manager for more than 6 months (see #3), but you will have to be the squeaky wheel to get any kind of traction on a promotion. 
3. Constant restructuring and turnover. This creates a pretty tense work environment when you have to shift your roadmap and working style ever ~6 months because people either leave or there’s another “reorg”. 
4. Roadmap planning is different every year…probably again because of #3, and it’s always rushed. You’ll be expected to start work on Q1 projects and not have a finalized roadmap until Q1 has already started.  This already sets up up for failure and causes you to miss deadlines.
5. Bigger projects tend to lack end to end vision.  Mainly because the planning process is so rushed that design/product/etc is never given enough time to fully explore all the use cases which leads to missing use cases and broken features…and ultimately upset end users."

- Inability to make a decision and stick with it. Decisions are constantly revisited causing teams tremendous churn
- Payments leadership team says the right things to employees, but doesn't act accordingly (e.g., WLB has been in the toilet for 2 years, yet all we get is a no meetings day - that is actually filled with meetings - once a month? PayPal does proper days off once a month)"

389,eBay,The most toxic place I have ever worked,2021-03-16,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,some descent engineers who usually leave as soon as they get a job in faang,"1. There is no career growth opportunities for people with technical background. Most of the science teams at the level of directors/VPs are led by non technical people. In my organization, the average time for non technical people to get promotion was around 1-2 years but for technical people was more than 3. 
2. A large number of technical teams have non technical managers. Such managers have a hard time evaluating the quality of the work that their employees has accomplished. Instead, they rely on gut feelings and biases to give promotions
3. The performance review and calibration is so flawed that managers can easily game the system. No one checks the accuracy of performance reviews and managers can easily fabricate the evaluation forms and get employees fired
4. If your manager wants to give your position to his friend or just simply does not like you, there is no one at eBay (including HR) to stop that from happening. There are numerous times that HR assisted managers in creating a paper trail and getting employees fired
5. Although HR claims that they are interested in diversity and inclusion, they do not actually care about such issues. If you have issues related to that, HR puts you in the layoff list.
6. If the team culture is toxic and your manager does not care, there is no one at eBay who helps"

First, noticed and discovered while as an AWF after carefully watching my manager and department and many other teams that there is a silent and undetected corruption in staffing and budgeting by leadership (Senior Mangers, Directors, VP level), which occurs due to lack of oversight and continuous monitoring by ebay (they became informed). 2) No oversight and transparency from ebay for monitoring hiring managers integrity to hire and fire (especially AWF employees). 3) No oversight by ebay (before 2016-17) on hiring managers using random unfamiliar contract agencies to secretly hire and fire alternative workforce (AWF, known to be treated like second class citizens yet do the same job/work). 4) No oversight by ebay on the time limit to convert AWFs to full time (hiring managers have control and leave AWF status unknown for long duration which is job misclassification as a non-consultant or non-project based work (should be a labor violation)). Lack of diversity in core area of ebay (engineering and technology) where about less than 2% are Black and Latino in engineering related job roles (software developers, Quality, data scientists/ analysts, Product owners/managers etc.) and almost none in director or VP leadership.

482,eBay,Focused on Innovation,2020-10-30,5.0,Data Analyst,"eBay and its employees encourage each individual to think of improvements and innovations on the product to make it a better experience for the customer. Regardless of what team you are on, from engineering to finance to audit, there is always someone willing to hear you out on an idea and if it has merit to it, directors are more than happy to listen and even push some of these ideas further up. This open mindset fosters imagination and ensures that people's voices will be heard. 

In tandem with the open mindset, the culture at eBay is very diverse and super friendly. They emphasize that work is a TEAM game not just an individual one, which makes it not only fun when you work with others but also more productive. 

Technology, applications and other software tools used at the company are always improving and for the most part utilize the latest resources available. This especially appeals to the younger population who come out of school learning with a skillset using particular tools or programming languages. 

Great company with initiatives to improve the platform in the future through the use of enhanced technological innovations.","Some processes (very few in my experience) leverage tools/programs that are a bit older, however a lot of these processes are being uplifted"

Pay is decent at $16.50/he with shift differentials. Working from home is a big plus. They send all necessary equipment.,"Literally everything about the actual job. Went through a four part interview process for an entry level position which was not as described in the actual job posting or by the recruiter. I was actually pretty excited about working for eBay when I was hired and about 4 weeks into training. Trainers and coaches really try to sell eBay as the greatest company you could work for the first couple of weeks of training. Honestly started to feel a little culty, but you believe them and you feel excited until you realize the training is a joke and it doesn’t prepare you at all for the job. The amount of information that is thrown at you is overwhelming and you are expected to be an expert in all aspects of eBay. Was told everything changes frequently so don’t get too comfortable. Everyone in the training class felt ill-prepared prior to taking calls. The knowledge base is very difficult to navigate. Have to navigate through multiple programs while on a call while trying to understand the member’s issue within impossible time frames and metrics. Unless you actually buy and sell extensively on eBay and know about their policies beforehand, don’t apply. Or do and get paid for training and dip out."

The behaviors exhibited by team leads and managers are blatant HR violations, but they are allowed to get away with it because they have each others backs. If another leader did not go along with this way of thinking, they were targeted and attacked psychologically. 
Direct reports are looked at as nothing more than children who are not given a right to opinion or any freedom of expression. As a team lead, I have heard numerous times where leaders bad mouth the people they are supposed to be leading, talk down to them in meetings, and black ball them from promoting within because they (the leader) did not like them. Managers are clearly aware of what is going on, but they fall into the same toxic mindset of ""protecting their own"" because it's easier to hire an entry level agent than hire another leader.
There is no system of checks and balances with leadership which allows them to continue to abuse their power and position. Corporate tries to let people know that they can call HR, but the team leads and managers make people feel as if they will be fired or blackballed for doing so, so hardly anyone ever does. 
Each week, it felt like another person was going on a mental health leave and after talking to numerous people, they all agreed that their leadership was a major contributing factor to their rapid mental decline. I have seen the brightest, warmest people turn cold and careless in a span of a few months and it completely shattered me.
At one point in my life, I would rave to anyone who would listen about why I loved working here and was looked at by most employees as ""the face of eBay Austin"", but things quickly changed as this place continued to progress into a nightmare that got worse each day. The people who are supposed to lead by example and foster growth have dragged this company down to a level I never thought imaginable."

588,eBay,They don't care,2020-07-29,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Health benefits and *some* free snacks,"This place is filled with the most negative, toxic, self-centered ""leaders"" I have ever seen. Cliques are a major issue in the Austin location and if you're not with them, you're against them.

Team leads are degrading, only care about your numbers, and lie about practices and policies to get you to fall into compliance. It is clear who the favorites are as they get special unequal treatment and extra leeway in their performance. You have to literally be best friends with your team lead in order to have any possibility of advancement. Trust is non-existent here.

We had a leader that actually fought to keep us supported and developed, but sadly he was alone in his efforts and his peers quickly turned on him and harassed him daily. As a teammate, we should not have been able to pick up on this, but we all saw it happen. We still have a coach who cares about us, but she is facing the same treatment and is being made to look like the enemy. It's only a matter of time before they chase her out too.

Our managers don't care about what's happening to us (the people actually taking the calls and talking to the customers), they only care about keeping their team leads dirty secrets and making sure they stay safe. We can all see what's happening, but nobody is able to speak out as we all need a job, especially in todays climate. I have friends who have gone home and cried after clocking out because of how horrible it is here."

They give you a policy to enforce with customers but if you follow it and your customer gets mad you , you get counseling on what you should have done instead of what ebay trains you to do. So you are basically taking calls from  a bunch of entitled people who will curse you out until you do what they want and you have to take it from the customers until you Manager (TL/Team Lead) decides to take over the call and only to just give the customer what they want.

In the past year, management has changed so frequently that we find ourselves not being able to differentiate over who can help and who is as just as lost as we are. We’ve been forced to support departments we’ve had zero training in but get reprimanded for not giving customers the best experience when we truly do try. Our bonuses, our career development and our sanity gets challenged daily over things we cannot control. Higher ups refuse to listen to the literal cries for help. During my time here, I’ve never seen more people need to take leave for being stressed, depressed or both. Also, it would be great idea to stop telling your employees to “drink the eBay kool-aid.” This originated from a negative event and the toxicity of the work place is eerily similar as your coworkers just talk about how bad they want to leave from the second the walk in."

These seem to be predominately knee jerk reactions vs. long term strategy based off data, innovation, and collaboration. Employee moral was very low throughout most of the time I was with eBay, due to a gross lack of communication and team building during major transition and layoff periods, a constant change in strategy requiring constant pivots, to the point employees are mostly fixing and reacting to changes, and due to a complete lack of regard for company culture. Suzy, the former America's CMO actually told many employees that the last thing she should care about is culture; that instead employees should be grateful to work for eBay. Employees are worked so hard, given tasks that easily make up 70+ hours of work weekly, and while leadership encourages employees to speak up if they can't handle their workload, when they do they are told that ""this is just eBay. Take it or leave it"". During the most recent round of layoffs, eBay randomly put employees in positions that did not at all align with their skill set, previous roles, or career ambition, and actually demoted a good amount of employees with these changes."

Benefits are OK - maternity/paternity is great if you use them, fertility is amazing - otherwise it's middle of the road.","Most management above the base supervisor level is disconnected from the day to day functions and needs of employees. Decisions are without a clear understanding of their eventual impact. 

Rapid changes in policy and expectations breed contempt and low morale from the front line employees. 

Unkept promises with regards to work functions and load are taking a toll on employee loyalty. 

Consistently bad resource planning means that, even if you've been 'promoted' into a position where you're dealing with higher value customers you're still getting inundated with general support contacts which then, in turn, lowers the effectiveness of your ability to support your own customer group by increasing wait times and creating an artificial urgency in getting people out of the contact so that you can move on to the next customer.

Apparent disdain for customers in general - making policies that are decidedly unfriendly to the seller populace and not being transparent with the reasons for doing so - providing talking points like ""it's the cost of doing business"" which does nothing to assuage the frustration and anger felt by long term incredibly high value members when they feel that they are being treated unfairly. 

Dramatic shifts in expectations for work performance - going from ""we don't care about your handle time"" to ""You must get your customers off the phone in an average of just over x minutes or else we'll start moving towards getting rid of you."" is frustrating. Making these changes during the holiday season made morale take a nose dive and they're not doing anything to really discuss this, acknowledge it as a mistake, or make up for it in any way. 

The sole value of an employee is their stats - handle time, customer sat, schedule adherence, etc...  There is a growing feeling that teammates are merely cogs in a machine and that anything they do extra  is seen as taking away from these stats and, while lip service is given to their benefit, no compensation or recognition is provided for that investment or engagement. This leads teammates to simply go in and do their work and leave.

There is no recognition for employees that take the time to learn more information about other lines of business and successfully apply that to their customer contacts. In fact, the more you know, the more crap they throw at you, so it's almost worth it to just stay at a base level. The pay is the same anyway. 

There is no differentiation between sick time & paid time off. The standard line given is that eBay gives competitive PTO, which I guess is right, but you can't actually get sick without having the potential for some disciplinary action taking place. Other employers in the area have sick time and have built in policies for exceptionally short term (3 days or so) family care so you can take care of your sick kid. None of those things impact your attendance. With eBay, if you're sick and don't pre plan it, you get an occurrence. If you wrack up 3, you start to lose options for promotions and other benefits. 

The culture has deteriorated over the course of the last several years. At first, this was the most fantastic place to work - even if customer contacts were frustrating, the management team had your back and there was a spirit of cooperation that was present at all levels of management. Now that cooperation is at the teammate level and everything higher than that discourages going out of your way to do the right thing for a customer or a peer. 

What was once a refreshingly positive work environment and a company I could feel proud of is now a mere shadow of its former glory. It's going to take removing some senior leadership and replacing them with a strong leader with a vision of culture and organizational health and effectiveness to turn this around. I don't have high hopes."

Getting my degree meant nothing to them, I finally left for another company that paid me more than double (no exaggeration, double!) and eBay doesn’t utilize the talent that they have.

I felt completely trapped there. It took forever to get out because of the reputation of eBay as a company. This is where a designer's career goes to die.

It was demoralizing to watch every single good idea or good design that anyone came up with be pushed off to the side. “We don’t have the budget.” “It’s too unconventional.” “It’s too risky.” This company is too afraid to do anything meaningful and too afraid of having a perspective or an opinion to survive."

- Work-life balance
- Most people are very helpful and easy to work with","- Boring projects, menial tasks, little freedom, too many processes. Don’t let the location trick you, eBay is not a Silicon Valley company -  this is a horrible place to work at as a passionate developer who want to build and ship things. If you chose to be a developer because coding is your passion, you’ll absolutely hate this place. But you’ll love it if you care most about retirement and benefits.
- There is no diversity in engineering teams, 90% percent of people are from the same country. Company is known as an H1-B shop. People say yes to everything, because almost everyone’s life literally depends on eBay - they have to stay at the company for 8+ years to get their residency.
- Old tech stack. Some teams adopted newer tech stack but  they still use eBay's own front end framework for some reason (Marko). It’s fun to work with, but no one will recognize it on your resume. If you are a full stack or front end developer this is worrying.
- Risk-averse, slow moving, bureaucratic

I worked at eBay for 6 years, and my immediate team was the always the best part of the work. While John Donahoe and team made mistakes that led to the division of eBay and PayPal, they had a steady hand on the wheel and were unfailingly professional and respectful of the staff. Post-separation, there were high hopes for Devin Wenig and team, but while they have smarts and talent, they're also primarily focused on being technology moguls (veering towards tech bros) and in the news along side other SV leaders. While they talk a good game about eBay's purpose (supporting the creation and growth of small businesses), in the end their profile with media and the stock price are what the focus on (and always in the short term).

Every day, I come into a job, that is looking more and more like other places I've worked. Moral is low, the excitement to excel has ceased. You come into work and you're confronted with what you did wrong, or a situation a member is upset about. You then get the chance to justify it or explain the situation, but ultimately, its going to be the cost of your bonuses. You and your team, get reviewed together too, so if one person is doing poorly, its everyone who suffers. Furthermore, they fish for feedback from members by sending emails to ask for them to respond, so if someone had a call with an agent and it went poorly, and then we email about their experience and they say it was horrible, and you get that email to respond too, then their experience is then attached to YOU, not the person who took the call.

1003,eBay,eBay re-invented themselves in the past 2 years,2017-10-13,5.0,Product Management,"eBay totally re-invented themselves after they separated from PayPal. There were significant changes in the upper management as well as a cultural change. The company is now all about innovation, empowering people and leveraging the ideas people from diverse backgrounds bring to the table.

A key thing that changed is also the approach to strategy. Instead of changing the strategy every year and focusing on different customer segments or business areas in different years, there is no a long-term strategy that focuses on key areas. 

Also, the focus on the customer is now really there. Customer Service was leveled up and empowered to really serve customers in an effective way.

It's been an amazing and highly motivating journey is on and I am impressed such an ""old"" company is able to get such a transition done.",The second office location in San Jose at 1st Street isn't as awesome as the main office. A lot of work is taking place though to bring the facility up to speed.

1005,eBay,Single Worst Experience of Entire Career,2017-11-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Newly-renovated cafeteria.  Free breakfast every morning.  Valet parking.,"The time I spent at eBay was the worst experience of my entire career by a significant margin.  Before I started at eBay, I had heard from friends that when eBay and PayPal separated, all the normal people went to PayPal while all the lunatics stayed behind at eBay.   During my time there, I learned the hard way how true this was.  

I worked for an absolutely toxic manager who had no business managing other people.  She still worked at eBay even though this was well-known around the company and she had a number of HR complaints against her.  Not only was she grossly incompetent, she also was pitifully insecure, malicious and morally bankrupt.  A manager who exhibits even one of these characteristics would already be difficult to work with.  A manager who has all these qualities made for an experience that was horrific beyond comprehension.  If you suggested a different approach on a project, rather than considering the merits of your suggestion, her first instinct would be to accuse you of questioning her expertise and undermining her authority.  She also would do everything she can to try to destroy you.  She once fired a teammate because he had the audacity to disagree with her in a meeting in front of management.  She also was not above making up lies in order to make this happen.  For me, the last straw came when she ordered me to do something illegal because she was mad at one of our business partners and wanted to get back at him.  She also tried to set this up in such a way that I would be the fall guy if anyone found out.

This experience was not unique to me.  I had many colleagues who faced similar bullying, mistreatment and abuse and who left as a result.  In my experience, the culture at eBay was toxic and pernicious across the board.  On an interesting side note - the entire company also seems to have a huge chip on its shoulder.  Employees delude themselves into thinking that eBay and Amazon are somehow competitors.  (For anyone who does not know, Amazon left eBay in the dust years ago.)  I do not know which is more worthless - the Kool-Aid eBay serves its employees or the crap that is sold in its marketplace."

I like what I do.","Having worked in 4 departments and undergoing countless management changes, I can say with every confidence that at eBay middle management has no oversight and runs wild. Their official function is to be in lengthy offsite lunch meetings, not to support their employees. Most team leads are unaware of how to use internal systems and are unaware of business practices and policies. Coaches (Jr. Management) are rarely available, and are often equally unknowledgeable. Employees are blamed for staffing issues and lack of appropriate volume forecasting, and as a result queue times are unreasonably high at all times.
Advancement opportunities are slim to none, and internal internships have all but been eliminated. Management is almost exclusively white, male, and Mormon, and any HR issues raised by employees about management are immediately closed without action or resolution, stating things like ""[supervisor] says that never happened""."

There is a lot of work to do and projects are available in all departments. I've been able to add so many tools to my belt purely by volunteering. At other companies, the scope of your role is much more defined limiting your chances to make huge strides in your skill set and career. 

Work life balance is great. Most people leave by 5 or 6 and the work from home policy is very lenient. Work is also very friendly towards parents. eBay offers a paid sabbatical every five years of work and you see people on many teams going on their second sabbatical.

Salary is competitive and the ESPP and 401k program are nice to have.","The biggest con is that there is a real culture issue. There are a ton of unmotivated and untalented staff. You could describe the attitude as defeated. Whether its related to processes that take too long, the feeling of an insurmountable disadvantage to Amazon, or a lack of grit, there is a negative skew to the general attitude of the staff. eBay has been putting more emphasis with the employee satisfaction surveys but there is ways to go.

1089,eBay,Interview Process,2017-06-27,1.0,,I was contacted by a recruiter and had really great conversation that led to my onsite interviews after my phone screen. I've always wanted to work for eBay so hearing the initial conversation went well was exciting.,"I was connected with a coordinator from eBay who sits in a remote office. She reached out to me scheduled my onsite and I was able to confirm a date and time that week with my schedule. I thought this is quick and efficient, great! The following day I got an email abruptly mentioning the team needed to move things around and had to reschedule my onsite to next week. I thought sure, I can be flexible so I gave her an alternate date and time. She came back with a new generic template with my onsite schedule and document attachment to the email. 

So the bad part begin--normally coordinator would send and attach your interview schedule with your name and who you're meeting with the day of your interview. Because she copy and paste things, I saw another person's name on my interview schedule, so I knew it was an error and quickly google search the name. Turns out it was another person interviewing in the same position as I am and took my original assigned time. Bummer.

It made me stress and thought the entire candidate experience went down the drain quickly at thar point, I felt like a second class citizen to other applicant. I confronted the coordinator and the excuse was there's a bug in the system (no apology what so ever). You don't send other people's info to a another candidate period and don't own your mistakes."

* People recognize it (Although they seem to be sad that you are working there and start asking why you are not working at Amazon)
* Good work life balance
* Some colleagues very helpful and knowledgable
* Free breakfast","* They mostly hire average people. If you are above average, you will have a hard time growing. Your ideas get shot down, you get resistance from low performers.

*Most senior people wont help you learn the process and tools and there is very less documentation about them. I believe this is a way to keep your seat: Do not write documentation so you cannot be replaced easily by a better engineer.

*If you are average or below average you are in paradise. You will get promoted even if you just do minimal work but stay in the company. No incentive to care about the product, the code , or whatever you are doing.

* They don't keep up with the technology at all. For almost every tool, they use a  custom in-house built one which is 3x worse than an open source one everybody out there is using. 

* After spending years here you will learn almost nothing  new because everything is custom made. It is only relevant if you stay at eBay. If you leave, that knowledge is not valid anywhere else. That is why senior engineers are trying to save their seats by politics and not allowing new engineers to learn.

* To write one line of product code, you need to learn about 10 custom build frameworks which do not have API documentation. You just keep asking around, creating help tickets."

Another con is that eBay doesn't know how to hold on to their highly experienced (top ranker) employees. I've seen too many of those people leave. Oh, and you'll be doing a lot of lateral movement and several months to years of internship for a low tier position. Basically higher responsibilities with the same rate pay.

Management is so favoritism based it's sickening. I watched people I could walk circles around in stats and knowledge of the company and it's policies, but they were moved up after doing minimal work because they kissed the bosses butt every day. Because I wouldn't play their game of politics you immediately get stuck in your role because they won't write a good referral to you (it's required for most roles), and you don't get any projects that allow you to grow and network. In the department I left, people were having mental breakdowns on a regular basis because not only do you have angry customers, management is the worst it could be with just thinking you're a number. On a team of 20, at that time, 7 of us went on disability because of what they put us through. Management never could figure out why we were all leaving, even though our happiness surveys were all brutally honest.  

Had multiple meetings where team leader told us if you had a break that was even 1 second longer than the 15 minutes, you were stealing from the company and they will fire you on the spot. Also had meetings where management would scream and yell about how awful we're doing with business scores then demand we be the happiest people on earth or they were writing us up because they're tired of the low morale. (This is the best way to make people happy, yell!)

Company can't figure out what it wants to be. When I started we were never going to be a phone company, but after Meg left we immediately became a phone company and every team started to inbound phones and everyone decided we weren't human anymore, but just a statistic that had to have the stats they wanted. 

They started hiring management from other companies and they were making the rules based on what they did at Discovery/AT&T/AMEX/wherever and not based on how eBay's rules were. Went to HR to quote the employee handbook multiple times, but HR basically laughed and said the supervisor gets to make that rule up and the handbook is only a spirited guideline. 

When you tell management about how you're actually feeling about the company, they just stand there and tell you why you're stupid. Example:
""You keep changing what metrics matter on a weekly basis, and it doesn't allow us to ever know what our stats should be until after the quarter and bonuses were assigned.""
""We tell you what the stats should be.""

I could write the rest of the night and not be done, but i'll stop here. I'm guessing you got the point."

-Fake culture that doesn't ring true. They brag about nobody having offices, not even VPs.

The reserve parking spots for VPs, but label them with something random to ""hide"" it from employees - ""delivery parking, logistics parking, etc).

1433,eBay,A lot of Re-orgs & Gender bias,2016-01-06,2.0,Senior Member of IT Group,"Work-life was great (in my dept). Free soda, game room, fun activities from time to time, great pay and bonus, nice benefits.","Lay-Offs:
eBay laid off 7% (~2400 people) in 2015 and then a few months later bragged on LinkedIn about the ""amazing"" batch of 200+ new-hires.  I was a top performer in my role (received several raises, top review scores, and a promotion) but was laid off just weeks after receiving a ""Spot award"".  Within 1 month, I found 2 job postings for my position.  Do not be fooled... Employees are just numbers and a means to an end.

Re-orgs:
Despite the yearly practice of conducting the Pulse Survey, there was little trust amongst the employees that leadership would actually address the identified issues.  Mgmt put a lot of time and effort into selling the ever-changing vision.  As objectives and directions change, departments and team get reorganized. This happened at least 1-2x per year. Leaders are often put in charge of new and/or larger groups than their experience and knowledge would allow them to effectively manage.  Managers then become overly distracted and distant from the work being completed.  This results in leader being so removed that employees don’t have the support they need to get tasks completed.  

Gender Bias:
As many would agree, having gender neutral business practices, affording opportunities to all employees regardless of gender, is preferred.  However, when these actions begin to step into the realm of reverse discrimination, there is a problem.  Although affirmative action efforts are designed to avoid discrimination, it manages to produce the discrimination for the perceived historical majority.  It has been regularly observed by myself and other that under-qualified candidates are being selected for advancement in order fulfill a quota, instead of selecting individuals with the best qualifications."

Still a highly reputable company for your resume. 
Depends on which team you are working with, you may get chance to working on very interesting and innovated project. 
Majority of people working with you are friendly and decent, of course there are aggressive and self-fish people which you will run into in any company.
Company revenue and profit are very good in comparison to the number of employees and other companies in the industry.","1. Heavy internal politics and bureaucracy which get engineers involved in daily life. Things are getting done slowly or sideways , some efforts are totally waste. Every half year there will be reorg on the Director or VP level in almost every department. How could you expect them to improve the product as none of them is being hold responsible for long run for new/old product quality.  
2.  Quite a few managers on QE side play just people manager and non technical. 
Yes there are some mangers are very hands-on and technical knowing the real problems, but they are mainly on the developer side. Quite a few first or second level engineering managers on QE side have absolutely NO coding or design or not even decent level of general industry or software development knowledge.  They have been in the company for 10 + years and were prompted from manual testers. Some of them do not have any outside eBay experience and some even only work for the same product line for 10+ years. So don't expect them be very supportive on innovation or really understand engineering difficulty and solve the real problems.  They are more there acting like project managers but only care you finish it not how you finish it or it is done in the right way.  Because of their knowledge limitation, they also not be able to fairly judge team-members work load , contributions and ability.  
3.  This may differ by team. But most senior QE engineers are self-sustained expect to do lots of manager level job for project & people management (but without given actual power). Manager is almost non-existence and don't care as they are working on ""more important"" project or some ""process improvement"" or ""planning"". Working on day-to-day work won't get them prompted so they pushed the ""less important"" work to their employees. Manager is only there to send a thank you letter when project is finished. 

4. Many projects were done by taking short cut to meet deadline, making the product is hard to maintain and improve later on . Many projects don't even have code review or ERD."

It used to be focused on bonding together to tackle the challenges and solve the problems. Leaders who listened and inspired. Now it seems to be shifting to a culture led by fear. When the going gets tough, find someone to blame. If you don't like what you're hearing, just reorg and listen to someone else. It's about what have you done for me lately versus trusting the reputation and integrity of the people you hired with the responsibilties you gave them. Planning is short term and risk taking seems to have been removed from the play book. This blame falls squarely on the shoulder the CEO, Devin Wenig. He says he wants to build the new ebay culture, but he has endorsed this negativity by the senior leaders he hired and the behaviors he has allowed to perpetuate."

The state of the business is less certain after the PayPal separation, so there are rumors that there are promotion quotas. A bad manager can make or break your experience. A dysfunctional project team can make or break your experience—as is true anywhere. The problem is that it's hard to move to different projects here, especially if your team is understaffed. If you don't work on a high-visibility project, your hard work and contributions aren't seen as promotion-worthy. 
Management and leaders are slow to make decisions and change priorities and their minds constantly. There doesn't seem to be a genuine interest in or understanding of customers at the leadership level. Most of the leadership heads don't use eBay regularly.

If you are liked by upper management, then they will work with your schedule but 90% of employees are on a shift bid program.  Tools are always being changed and causes major issues with customs and employees.  eBay is dying from within.  They are trying to grow every which way, Spending money like crazy on programs that do not work and then making the employees suffer for their bad mistakes.   They are a internet company with the worse IT department I have every seen, bad tools, non-updated computers and software (running on Windows XP, Internet Explorer 8 and Google Chrome that was outdated two years ago), badly designed desks, and chairs that are broken and old (8 hours in a broke chair 5 times a week makes for long days).
Was in the same department for 6+ years, I am not a hot girl or a brown nosser so I never got to move up.  Just someone that showed up hour early to work, never was late, had 120 vacation hours when i left, worked hard everyday I was there.

In my 8 years there I knew 5 or fewer good supervisors.  For the most part they are terrible, have different interpretations of the policies and adhere to them differently.  If a supervisor doesn't like you they will watch you like a hawk until they have enough to get you fired.  (Meanwhile they are almost never fired or demoted for poor performance.)  

The only way to get ahead there is to kiss up and hope you're well liked.  The morale in many departments is very low and people are frustrated but nothing changes.  Many people stick around due to great benefits and OK pay even though they are miserable.  eBay's great benefits make it hard for people to feasibly leave.  

Promotions are very hard to come by unless you take a specific path (even then it's difficult).  If you don't have a desire to become a coach, supervisor, manager, you may be out of luck.  eBay has tons of cool jobs, but it's nearly impossible to get to those without going becoming a supervisor first.  Many people don't want to become supervisors but have great skills in other areas, so they're held back because there's no path for them to get promoted."

Also if you want to move up within the company, you will have to do a lot of lateral movements first before they will ever consider a promotions.

Since i was in the Appeals Dept. we were constantly getting yelled at all day and getting calls mistransfered to you and you could get a survey on that. If its a bad survey that will effect your bonus. A lot of teammates would transfer to the Appeals dept so they don't have to deal with the screaming customer and it would not effect their survey which would not effect their bonuses.

Oh i don't even think of missing a day, they will give you an Occurrence and you are only allowed 6 Occurrences. If you are passed they you will be terminated, no matter if you have a family issue, sick, or a funeral.

Also if you would like a day off even if you have PTO, Its a pain to get that day off even if you have PTO. 

Recruiters are a joke as well, they will tell you that they will work with you and your schedule if you had any particular needs. They say you will have one weekend day off, in which none of these were true. They give you false hope and promises.

I knew very few people who were actually happy at eBay and even those who were could see the dysfunction surrounding them.

Really bad senior management. The company’s “vision” is overly broad, making it meaningless. No one wants to rock the boat so the difficult conversations needed to turn the business around are not taking place.

Culture of favoritism. Promotions are based on who likes you enough to fight for you not your actual merit as an employee. It is definitely a boys club with lots of men who do not treat women with the same level of respect as their male counterparts. If you even bother going to HR about unfair treatment, you will end up worse off than before.

Very political. People don’t hold business partners accountable because they don’t want to get negative feedback from them, which would hurt their chances of being promoted. You have people and teams fighting over who gets credit for work. It can be a huge challenge to get people to share information that you need to do your job. 

Way too many consultants. eBay pays big money to have consultants (and the Strategy team), who don’t understand the business, make pretty decks. The company needs to execute well not sit around talking about shinny ideas that don’t deliver."

I suspect a significant causal factor is that a large majority of engineers are immigrants from more community-oriented cultures, which generally promotes a more respectful and familial environment.  I loved all my colleagues at eBay during the time I was there.  The hardest part about leaving was saying goodbye to these fantastic folks.","Unfortunately, eBay's business outlook is extremely uncertain. After the recent PayPal spinoff, it seems like the new eBay executive leadership is generally more ""corporate"" and less able to drive true innovation. We've undergone a significant brain drain since 2014, with many of our best engineers leaving the company at a very noticeably higher rate.  This has the potential to be a fatal downward spiral, with the talent loss (at both top and lower rungs) making it even harder to attract and retain other top talent.  eBay still has a very inspiring purpose and mission, but I'm definitely worried about its ability to compete effectively going forward."

Politics of a large company
Lack of credibility of higher management

Legacy Java stack with domain specific reinventions of open source libraries that are worse in every way. Attempts to improve the stack get lip service but no competent infrastructure support. There is no serious movement to update the stack and fix things. New libraries and wrappers are written to interface with broken and disfunctional legacy systems so even using the new stack doesn't actually increase code productivity.

Almost all of the smart engineers have left or are leaving so you won't get significant mentorship. As a junior engineer I am actually reverse mentoring senior engineers, architecting the entire project, and implementing a supermajority of everything on my project! Also promotions and wages aren't matching what startups are offering to pay now. Due to constant reorgs promotions are hard to come by while less qualified individuals get hired at higher ranks due to age.

It's sad to see that managers are considered higher in ranks over software engineers so in the end even when software engineers know the right thing, they are forced to do what their managers want. 
Some managers even micro manage your day, like asking your status 2-3 times in a day, checking on your code commits on a daily basis, and sometimes even being rude by asking what did you do today at the end of the day. 
There's too much technical debt and none of the managers are interested in working towards clearing that mess, meaning it will keep getting bigger and bigger. 
I have also seen some managers reviewing code of the architects and giving feedback as if like peer reviews even though they are not the other person whom the architect had worked with directly at code level.

If you are a talented engineer with a desire to learn something new or do something of value run away from here because you will be doing very dumb work and surrounded by even more dumb people. However, on the other hand if you want to just draw a stable paycheck and get promotions by pleasing your boss then run in and join.
Very little solid engineering done here, most people are focussed on making half baked products, doing demos and poster sessions and throwing them out of the door. When other engineers who use your product complain provide workarounds and assurances that the problems will be taken care of in the next release. Of course a re-org or something similar will follow and very soon the problem will fall into another clueless engineers lap. 
Most of the top execs in eBay are moving to Paypal since they think eBay is a sinking ship.
I worked in what was considered as the most technical team of whole of eBay the condition in the rest of the company is even worse and talented engineers are going insane.
Along with technology, the management philosophy and techniques are also outdated. eBay blindly promotes people who deliver half baked products in timely fashion to managers who then force their developers to do the same. eBay still doesn't realize like the other Bay Area companies that strong developers work for autonomy to implement their ideas and creativity and not simply for a paycheck. Being outdated it still relies on paying more money and doesn't do simple things like providing food which is now common in most Bay Area startups. Not to mention that most of the managers are technically clueless or micro managers.
I personally don't know even one developer who is happy if not outright frustrated.

The plan is the plan as far as they are concerned and they seem to also not be ok with bad news. Or failure. It happens, and it shouldn't be something people need to be ashamed of.

It was overall a great job!,"Coming back to eBay after leaving to try out a career change: Hired for M2M APPEALS team. *Worst Job I have ever had* Experience: Customers wait around an hour to speak with you because of high turnover. The majority of the time you then have to tell the already angry customer bad news. Example: eBay made me take a return on a $300 item and the buyer sent me back a box full of rocks! (You then explain ""this is the cost of doing business, we cant prove this is the case"", the seller is now out the money and item). *Transferring Teams: You will not be able to change departments unless the wait time is handled. It has been up to an hour or so wait to call in for almost a year. Even with a posting for my old job open, Im not allowed to apply. *Pay: This team currently starts off at the same pay as the other departments I worked in even though it is a Much harder job by far.

Conclusion: Do not accept a job in the M2M Escalations or Appeals departments, unless you are ready to have hundreds of very upset callers in queue for you. If you love telling people ""no"" this is the job for you. EBAY OVERALL: Awesome company; my first two positions there were absolutely great. Just wait till something outside of M2M is hiring and you will love the company."
