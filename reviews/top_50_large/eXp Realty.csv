0,eXp Realty,GREAT COMPANY! AWESOME & KNOWLEDGEABLE BROKERS!,2022-03-31,5.0,Real Estate Agent,"I love this company! I have worked for a few different brokers, large franchise names and smaller family owned brokerages and I have to say that the people that work at eXp are very knowledgeable and provide great assistance! The pay is great and the stock share is great! There are multiple revenue streams available to earn a lot of money.","For real estate agents, this may not be the best choice for brand new licensees just starting out. I say this only because most agents have no idea where to begin after you pass your state exam. Sometimes newbies need to have the physical one on one interaction for training and learning the ropes. This does not mean that a new agent cannot succeed here because there's a lot of them that have. You just have to stay motivated and ENGAGE in as much as you can."
1,eXp Realty,The 800 lb Guerilla in the room when it comes to real estate models.,2022-03-31,5.0,REALTOR®,"Offers multiple streams of income. Revenue share model allows agents to share in the revenue of the company. eXp Realty is under eXp World Holdings, publicly traded on Nasdaq, which also owns Virbella, and the Success Brand (Success magazine, Success coaching, and Success lending). The Virbella platform allows for a completely seamless, virtual office, in addition to Workplace (Facebook) and Regius centers. Now operating in all 50 states as one company (no franchise) and 20 countries, collaboration and business across states lines is not only possible, it's likely, and FREE - no costly expansion team agreements. Low split and fees, and each agent has a sponsor. Mentors are also available. Over 50+ hours of live training in Virbella by ICON agents (top agents in the business currently doing business) 50% of the revenue of eXp World Holdings is returned back to the agents (written in the charter)","Sponsorship is not a requirement for mentorship. All the resources,training and leads are provided on demand, however if you do not implement or like to find blame in others, this is not the model for you."
2,eXp Realty,Best Real Estate Decision I've Ever Made,2022-03-20,5.0,Real Estate Broker Associate,"Leads, Collaboration, Cutting Edge. In 4 years of moving over to eXp Realty, I've more than doubled my sales business and created multiple streams of income outside of my sales. I'm on my way to ICON for the 3rd year and can't believe how blessed I am financially and emotionally to call eXp Realty my home.","For me, none that I can think of. We are cloud based, but I rarely went into the office before. Now, I'm in my office attending weekly meetings, meeting with my Broker or other agents, within moments from my computer. I also use the Workplace (FB for businesses) regularly to ask questions or socialize with fellow Agents."
3,eXp Realty,best place to be a realtor,2022-02-21,5.0,Realtor,"Helpful and supportive staff for the agents to be successful.
Revenue Share allows agents to transition to a Team Leader or mentor role to give back to the new generation of agents and offer AMAZING benefits that cannot be found elsewhere within the industry.

Let me be the one who clears up the MLM misconception: in an MLM. I (The Agent) would have to buy a product from my boss, for this example let's use knives. my boss bought the knives for $5 and sold them to me for $30, now it is my job to sell $30 knives with a value of $5 to someone else, thus creating the pyramid. 

At eXp the Revenue Share comes out from the % eXp takes and gives it to the person named as sponsor, the agents lose NOTHING from the % the agents were going to receive.","New Agents: please research VERY thoroughly who you will select as a sponsor. this is a permanent choice, your sponsor gets revenue share and sh"

Cloud based Virbela software allows you to attend over 40+ hours of classes taught weekly. Every Friday gathering to hear a brief company update (since we are all shareholders) and Iconversations - a panel of the top agents in the entire brokerage who are interviewed and share their tips of success (better take notes as you may be paying hundreds of dollars to hear this advice from seminars and conventions!)
Receive shares of stock when hitting various milestones , revenue share, health insurance
The most epic annual real estate convention of them all eXpCon in Las Vegas! They make you feel like you're a million bucks!","Sponsoring brand new agents from another state and those newly licensed agents aren't properly mentored and end up lost and might move on to another brokerage.

WFH w/ tech provided.","Almost impossible to get time off where you can totally relax; huge agent counts with little support as far as admin goes; constantly feel like a hamster in a wheel.

It's always ""thank you for your feedback."" Your hands will ABSOLUTELY be tied by their asinine decisions that you are not even consulted on. They try to ""help you"" run your state but have no clue what it takes. They hire and move people into positions they are NOT qualified for and expect you to train them even though they are paying you peanuts based on your experience and skill set. They will also unceremoniously replace you when you tell them you are leaving for a better opportunity. You are 100% disposable and they DO NOT care about you."

Ability to earn a great income by working smart and earn in many ways through stock and mentoring others and so on. The trainings, the conferences, the broker, it all works to help you improve and grow your business.","Important that you are self motivated. No one tells you what to do or when to do it. There is an outline that suggests what you can do, lots of works shops, but YOU must take action everyday to earn the business. It doesn't just come to you. 
You must be willing to ask questions, show up and be actively involved in your business.
You are in charge of all the finances of your company, so YOU must know how or learn how to manage the income and the expenses. 
EXP REALTY is a cloud based tech company. You will need to have a computer, to be able to attend meetings as an avatar online in the eXp World. 
NONE of these are cons but they could be if you are not open to learning new ways of working and being someone who is self motivated. 
I will say, sometimes the clients can be challenging. So understanding pyschology and behaviors can be very helpful. Also, it's important to stay positive and cheerful even during the most difficult circumstances. We have 9 core values. Honesty and ethics are two of them. Always be truthful."

Upper management are accessible. From your state broker all the way to the Glenn Sanford at the top. Glenn often interacts in the online platforms which is is great. You never have to wonder if your thoughts about something are heard or not because he's right in there in on the platform with everyone else.","The hate from agents at other brokerages. They love to hate on eXp on social media and give out info about eXp that often times is flat out wrong. If you're considering eXp, but the haters have you second guessing stop and consider their motive and where that hate is coming from. I'll give you a hint. They don't really understand the company and they fear eXp's success will negatively impact their bottom line. Instead of making their company better the only thing left to do is try hard to make the other guy (eXp) look bad. It's very reminiscent of middle school. To the haters...rise above or come aboard! Just do better. Either way, it's not too late."

- Cloud-based brokerage, meaning fully remote, paperless transactions, etc.
- 50+hrs of training each week from top producers in the country
- Free stock gifts for reaching milestones

Then after a few years, the other brokerages will shift to an eXp model, and take the roles of Disney+, Hulu, Peacock, etc.","- You get out what you put in. Anyone that thinks they will be hand-held will feel likely feel confused and isolated.

It is a lot easier to train and manage agents with the systems in place with eXp. I make more money with less overhead then I did when I owned my own brokerage,It appears there were some agents in the beginning who only focused on recruiting and it turned some agents off. There are really a lot of top agents and teams that are producers and DO sell real estate.

88,eXp Realty,eXp Realty opinion,2022-02-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,best real estate company in the world,more difficult to attract agents than I thought at first
89,eXp Realty,Transitioning from Sales into Business/Agent-Owner,2021-10-25,5.0,REALTOR®,This model has allowed us to expand into other states. Increase referrals between agents. Partner with and attract agents into our group which is like having a Multiple 6-figure income and a base pay. We now own over 4500 shares of stock (EXPI) The best part of eXp's model - and this is what 99% of people don't understand is this: We have the ability to help other agents build a tremendous business - instead of just chasing a commission check. @SeanandBlanca,The agents who struggle at eXp are those who need to be surrounded by people. Or those who can't or will not plug into the systems or training. This model is for agents who seek knowledge and success - no one is going to spoon-feed you at eXp (but there is unlimited opportunities)
90,eXp Realty,Glad I made the move,2022-01-12,5.0,REALTOR®,"Who knew 2 years ago the advantages of being with a cloud based brokerage. I enjoy the best training in the business without having to leave home. No walls, no borders and no excuses to becoming the best!",I really miss going to the office and drinking cool-aid.)

This brokerage is looking out for the agents as well as our clients. There is so much benefit to being a Realtor with eXp, I dont' know why anyone would go anywhere else!","The only thing some people may miss is going into an office every day and physically seeing co-workers. You can still go into the virtual office and talk with co-workers, but the desk and chair is yours, it doesn't belong to someone else (and you don't have to pay for it)."
94,eXp Realty,New Agent Perspective,2022-03-07,4.0,REALTOR®,great company culture! Teams really about making you successful,Remote work and peers can sometimes be very short with communications. All about building your circle correctly

Great company to work for if you want to be a robot with low pay
Wonderful place to work for if you want to be a submissive yes man/woman
If you are a physically “good looking”, female, you will get invited to company events even if they have nothing to do with your department! 
If you like constant re-organization, new bosses, new policies and procedures (or lack there of) and constantly changing job duties, this is the place for you.","The corporate politics is beyond out of control. The mind games and feeling like a pawn in a game of chess in a losing game can really mess with your head.  
When you need help and it takes 6 months to hire one person because the “President” has absolutely no authority, there is an issue. 
No purchase plan for employees 
The company is “agent success obsessed” but forgets that the corporate staff needs to be supported and could take a lesson in focusing on the employees success also. 
The low pay because employees work remote is not going to fly much longer. 
This company is not for the forward thinking person, unless you are in upper management. For those not in management, you are a robot doing what you are told and has better have a smile doing it."

They've offered a model that takes care of the immediate needs and sets us up for the long haul. If you utilize the tools and resources in place. You will never need another brokerage. No other company offers the opportunity to make well over 100% commission. They offer more than a great brokerage to operate your real estate business under. They offer each agent the opportunity to change their life and lifestyle if the agent wants to.

I read a negative review earlier, and I believe this person was simply mislead into a place that wasn't ever going to be good for them. The fact is, I love everything eXp is, but this Broker isn't for everyone. We have no office, or as the review said, ""bricks and mortar"" haha. But why would you want that? Offices are silly. Clients want to meet at homes. Every time I tried to meet a client at the office when I was elsewhere, clients always said, ""why can't I just go look at the home?"" eXp cut the office out, it's useless. You can get all of this training and live support in eXp World without wasting gas at an office you don't own. You have no boss, but you're an independent agent, you shouldn't want one as they don't pay you any money, they take it. We are tech based, very tech based. If you aren't a tech person, eXp may not be the best fit. If you like to ""go into the office"" everyday, we probably aren't for you. For me? I love it, and the 80% commission with a low cap is pretty sweet too.","None outside of minor critiques. Overall, I wake up everyday and do what I love with the latest technology to do it with.

They have quick response times when you have a question. I am learning more and more about all of the benefits of being an agent owner at eXp Realty.,"The downside of working with eXp Realty is there are so many tools to learn, you would need an assistant to learn them all. Time management is essential. If too much knowledge is a bad thing, thing you are with the wrong company. Not knowing how to run a successful real estate business is not the fault of eXp Realty."

Management doesn't care about your well being, only want you to give more. Meetings all day (no time for breaks) even when calendar is blocked. No team building, no training. Heavy turnover in Accounting due to harsh working conditions.

I really loved them all.","Trans managers who are not trained in or know anything about the state compliance rules in which they manage. So called""leads"" who turn into cliques if you know more about real estate than they do and they will intentionally try to get you fired. Managers will not listen to compliance, they listen to the leads and basically call anyone else a liar. Staff meetings no one asks questions, there is nothing remotely collaborative and discussions are considered arguments if you have any knowledge about real estate at all. You do not get praise at all even if you set all time records and are amazing but you constantly get slapped in the face for minor mistakes. DO NOT TAKE THE SURVEYS AND TELL THE TRUTH!!! They say meetings are confidential but do not fall for it. Management needs an overhaul with people who actually know real estate and a compliance specialists does not just obtain their license. Bad outlook for such an innovative company and it all ends with hiring managers and not leaders."
213,eXp Realty,the brokerage that actually builds your business,2021-08-09,5.0,Realtor,"Exp workplace app where everyone in the company can network. There are referral apps and I have received 5 referrals from that app. I am a first year agent about to finish with 15 deals done and 10 million in sales. A big part of that is because of the referral group. The stock is great too as long as you understand short term volatility is high and beleive in the long term, I have made a lot of money with the stock. Our state brokerage is great too extremely responsive and helpful.",as a first year solo agent you don't have as much struture as you probably need.

I had been with Coldwell Banker, a small boutique and Keller Williams. eXp offered existing, proven technology, a cutting edge platform and the ability to build wealth (not just income) with revenue share and stock. I have both earned and purchase stock and finally feel like I have a retirement plan outside of what I built on my own. I wouldn't trade it for anything.","It isn't for everyone. It is cost effective, but requires you to be a self-starter. If you're the type of agent that is looking for a company that provides everything for you, then please don't join.

There is literally no cap to what I could potentially make with revenue sharing.  I find myself getting caught up in day dreaming or dreaming bigger than my now which for me can be discouraging at times.  It's also a huge driver for me because I want to get to those goals of making 5 to 6 figures a month through the revenue share.  I want to hit the ICON agent status every year.

The position I was offered was not what I was looking for, but it was an opportunity to work from home and I got so impressed with what I had learned about the company, that I thought I would jump in and see what happens. I got promoted and officially hired by eXp in 4 months. Fast-forward 1.5 years, I am still in love with eXp and I am so happy I made the decision to join! The company has a brilliant business model that is proven to help it grow at an accelerating rate. The leadership is very intelligent and humble people who actually listen to employees and contractors, and continuously put great programs in place for robust retention and people’s professional and personal growth. There is plenty of opportunities for career advancement. 
 eXp is a 100% virtual company with fun communication platforms which makes it perfect for COVID-19 times. You never feel isolated or lacking the social aspect. It is quite the opposite - the amount of collaboration and communication you get every day is more than anyone could get in a brick-and-mortar setting. But what I value the most is the culture and values this organization promotes. I love how friendly, caring and supportive everyone is at the company. We work very hard, but we also have fun and we build close friendships at work. That is why we call it “Our eXp family”. If you are agile, open-minded, and like learning, eXp is an amazing place to work for.",Very high pace work but you get used to it.

After a vacation trip with my family My father encouraged me to become a flight attendant and travel the world. Real Estate in 1985 had high interest and affordability issues. In 2001 when 9-11 occurred I left the airline industry and came back to the family business. I became a broker and opened my own company called Delmarva Resorts Realty at the Delaware beaches. In 2018 I explored moving my company to EXP so that I could move myself into retirement. In my second year at EXP my business exploded and I was able to pay off my credit card debt. I am on track to to spend winter in sunny florida!

340,eXp Realty,I love it!,2021-07-23,5.0,Real Estate Agent,"They equip you with everything you need to succeed. All you have to do is put in the work to make it happen. The training is world class! I’ve learned so much about real estate, and I’ve only been in the industry 1 week. It gives me an edge on my competition, because I’m able to negotiate contracts at the level of agents with far more experience.",I haven’t discovered any yet.
341,eXp Realty,eXp changed my life,2021-10-05,5.0,Realtor,Multiple streams of income. Awesome tech tools,None that I can think of

345,eXp Realty,AMAZING benefits,2021-05-10,5.0,REALTOR®,One thing that gets completely overlooked is the healthcare that is offered through Clearwater. If you are a productive agent you actually get rewarded. The amount of stock my family and I have received from the ICON program has been life changing. The revenue share program can give you an opportunity to earn passive income for the rest of your life. From my research the EXP Realty fees beat all of the other major brokerages fees. I really don't understand why every agent isn't with EXP realty.,"If you're not going to recruit/attract any agents or you are only going to do 1-5 deals a year that are not luxury properties, EXP probably isn't for you. I would just join a very small brokerage that charges low fees. I can't think of any other cons."

They have hundreds of hours of training available, mentors if needed and weekly meetings that you can ask questions and share knowledge and input.","If you are NOT self motivated or a self starter, then you may have problems working here as you are in charge of your own success. The company provides the tools, but you have to take the initiative to find your clients and generate business. They do provide some tools even for this, but to be successful, you still need to do more."

356,eXp Realty,Disappointed,2021-10-22,2.0,Licensed Realtor,Brokerage has a national presence,"$85 monthly fee PLUS 20% commission and transaction fees. 
Overly and unnecessarily complicated tech-suite. Technology should be tools that simplify processes. Exp is not streamlined, so there are almost a dozen sites to log in to that offer or request tiny tid-bits of information."
357,eXp Realty,Grow your business even while you sleep,2021-09-14,5.0,Realtor,The focus on agent success is unsurpassed!,Not good for Ride-a-longs. You must be willing to work on/in your business.

371,eXp Realty,Great agent success toolset and support.,2021-04-19,5.0,Licensed Real Estate Agent,"The ""eXp World"" platform, while at first glance seems to be a corny ""Sims game"" is actually a quite powerful tool that streamlines the training and support system that the company has built. The availability of subject matter experts to address questions or issues you might encounter while working through any deal is super valuable.","It's a large company with many different moving parts, so it is easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information and tools that they make available to you. This may be an issue for a new agent or anyone who has trouble focusing and prioritizing what they need for their specific business model plan."

I am very happy with my decision to leave my former broker and foresee endless opportunities working with eXp.","I guess the only thing that has been a con for me is that navigating through eXp World has been a little challenging with the lag.

I LOVE the stock that I receive! We also have revenue share whenever someone joins under a listed person as their sponsor.","While there is more training available than most brokerages, you must be eager and self disciplined to attend and gain the benefits. I do wish we planned more local events to connect with our local agents. Our area has really tried to do that once a month.

The biggest con is that some agents have gotten very sales pitchy because they can make really great passive income with revenue share. It is great but people do not enjoy being ""sold"" to and it makes people really off put with our company sadly."

441,eXp Realty,"Great co-workers, pays below market,  CEO is an innovator not a manager, and Nepotism is practiced frequently",2021-06-30,2.0,Senior Accountant,"Working from home is great, great software supporting work from home, and no zoom calls. There are pockets of growth opportunities throughout all departments due to high growth. Great coworkers and a work environment that allows you to have relationships with coworkers in a remote environment, I always felt like I was part of a Team. Large enough company where multiple departments are available to reach out to for advice, as long as they h e time to respond because everyone is typically over worked.","Work life balance is non existent for operations teams like HR, Accounting, Legal, and Finance, the teams are also underpaid when compared to other similar industry teams. The CEO has said in meetings that the Accounting and Legal team is a service department for sales so they aren’t expected to support rather than guide, which in application translates to teams like Sales and Marketing reaching out to Accounting and Legal with unrealistic timelines and expectations and no regard for work life balance, and if you don’t turn around an agreement within their timeline they will move forward without your input or against your advisement and if something goes wrong, you’ll be asked to report on why and told to prevent it from happening again. The C level team participates unnecessarily in the hiring process of middle management and entry level positions in order to encourages and wear down HR to interview and hire their personal friends. Additionally, the CEO is an avid reader and innovator and fascinating, however he tends to pick his favorite book at that time and try to apply the philosophy of the book by telling others to do so, but he fails to empower teams under him to run with the philosophy and the agenda of implementing a new process or philosophy will fail to launch and just cause busy work. Then six months later he will read a new book or learn of a new software and have his team pivot yet again, example is holocracy and using holaspirit which people in meetings would sarcastically joke “oh! A new program to update and forget about, yay!”, or On the Ready which micromanaged how we set up Trello boards between teams but then fizzled away. Additionally, the other C-level that support the CEO are critical of him and don’t lend actionable support, but tend to say what the CEO wants to hear but not perform, which I think lends to failure to launch new initiatives and unnecessary internal strain on staff."

479,eXp Realty,I Cannot Recommend At This Time,2021-05-18,3.0,Accounts Receivable Team Lead,"Work from home
Seriously amazing coworkers","1- Overworked.
To say that eXp is growing at a fast pace is a gross understatement. Personally, I love staying busy, but our department was left severely short-staffed for a prolonged period of time which caused a major problem with burnout on our team. 
2-Feeling Unappreciated.
At least three people on our team, myself included, were each expected to perform the duties of two (sometimes three) staff for the aforementioned prolonged period of time, with no recognition and no additional compensation. At least two of these team members were then in real danger of being terminated when higher-ups felt that they were ""slacking"" (due to trying to perform the duties of 2 or 3). I was so ashamed of eXp.
3-Insufficient Tools.
Hopefully this will be getting better as it seems the company has finally realized how woefully inadequate the tools staff have been expected to work with are and there are improvements in that area coming down the road. In the meantime, tools are painfully insufficient and manual.
4-Lack of Management Accountability.
There seems to be nowhere safe to go to provide feedback or express concerns about your direct manager without fear of retribution. For the record, I found out, personally that the ""confidentiality"" of Employee Net Promoter Score (ENPS) Surveys...not confidential.
5-Lack of Thorough Planning
The MO of eXp has been to make changes to policies and procedures without the input of the teams tasked with implementing those changes. 
While occasional oversight is understandable, with eXp it is the rule and not the exception. It is incredibly embarrassing to have leadership announce a new initiative that will involve your team, yet you knew nothing about it! On a regular basis teams were tasked with implementing changes in policy or procedures without the tools or processes in place (or even available) to make it possible!"

516,eXp Realty,BEST BROKERAGE by far!,2021-01-11,5.0,Realtor,"I have so many great things to say about eXp! I interviewed with many brokerages before I chose eXp and this is why: The very low-no up front cost, LOWEST commission split until cap, and mentor program have been absolutely incredible!! I’m a brand new agent and I was initially worried about starting with a company like eXp but I have been so happy with it! I was given a mentor and she is incredible and so helpful! I have learned so much! They have free online classes to take on your own time whenever you want! 
The BEST thing about eXp and the reason I I will probably stay forever is that they offer STOCK options. It is a HUGE money making opportunity. My upline hasn’t even noticed the very minimal amount coming out for each transaction and now has over $40k JUST in stock 😱 and she’s fairly new to eXp AND real estate! EXp also wants everyone to succeed because as the company grows and succeeds, we all make more money! And because of this, everyone is willing to help everyone and everyone shares their amazing ideas. As opposed to most of the other companies who are known to be competitive and cutthroat. EXp is so supportive! They also supply websites with free lead generation like KVcore. Another amazing unbeatable factor is that it’s a virtual cloud brokerage, so I can sit and take classes and learn while sitting on the couch in my pajamas. It’s truly the perfect work from home brokerage where you can also get help from thousands of agents all over the country ALL THE TIME! Another plus is that any agent that joins eXp underneath you, you also make money off of! I don’t spend my time recruiting agents as I became a Realtor bc I wanted to do Real Estate but this is just a REALLY nice bonus!","So far I have nothing negative to say. If you don’t like to work from home and prefer to pay more money for an office then this would be your true con for eXp.

 To succeed in the Real Estate world at all, you have to be a MAJOR go-getter, self motivated, constant hustle and grind kind of person. You cannot be afraid to leap out of your comfort zone and definitely can’t be quick to give up!"

563,eXp Realty,Left High and Dry,2020-06-15,1.0,Product Launch Specialist,I never got to experience any,"I was hired at EXP as a Product Launch Specialist in March 2020 after a three month hiring process. Multiple people left the company in that time so I was bounced around. Finally at the end of March I was extremely excited to start for the company and accepted my offer letter. It was a perfect match- where my background aligned 1:1 with the role, and I saw a lot of possible quick adjustments to their platform with my knowledge that would really improve the user experience for brokers, and bring new ones on. At the end of March coronavirus quarantine hit and my start date was canceled. It's unfortunate but what was happening nationwide at the time and understandable. I was told we would be postponed. I knew that meant indefinitely. Fine, things happen. I can understand that. It was a shame because I moved cross-country for the position, and they canceled six days before it was meant to start. But again, I understand. 

What I don't understand is that since that time, they have been hiring for multiple similar roles at both EXP and VirBELA and did not once call me or consider me, or the nine other people they canceled on that date. They should do right by us and we should be first in line for any new positions. I don't know if it's a failure by Mike Vein, Kirk Lattner, Laura Styles, or the whole HR division. But treating people like they don't matter and are expendable, is the reason this company has NO BUSINESS being near the 'Top Places to Work on Glassdoor' and why you should avoid them."
564,eXp Realty,The World of “exp”,2021-05-15,1.0,Administrative Support Coordinator,"Work from home, no drive time.","Not paid for overtime hours, lots of “out of pocket expenses” being a virtual world the accountability of people’s words and actions are not held to the same standards as a professional work environment.

575,eXp Realty,New Agent,2020-04-29,2.0,Real Estate Agent,"Access to classes online, l have always got some sort of response via email. Older agents do really well! Modern business model",I’ll be honest I haven’t had the best experience. I am a brand new agent who feels I was mislead on all the resources and trainings I would have. I have taken as many online classes as I’ve been able to and have mainly trained myself with online coaches. I join as many calls as I can a week. It’s like learning a complex business by listening to a podcast. Be aware as a new agent you will have your fees AND an additional 10% plus another 10% for your mentor and “mentoring fees” I wouldn’t write this review if I hadn’t exhausted all my resources. Many times reaching out as a new agent I have been met with a dismissive attitude. Even from my state broker. Who has this giant chip on her shoulder for some reason. I’ve owned a business before so I don’t need hand holding but if the overall attitude is that new agents aren’t important than why bring them on? I’m doing really well because of my drive not because of the support from eXp. My intention was to be proud of the brokerage I joined but if one more person at this company speaks down to me or doesn’t construct a professional email I’m going to have to go somewhere else. Learning a new industry is hard enough and people need people in this type of business. I just wish this felt more like a tribe.

647,eXp Realty,Was Great When I Started,2021-01-27,3.0,Onboarding Specialist,"Loved the fact you can work remote anywhere in the world.  I love the virtual world . It gives you the office feeling and culture without having to go into an office (I think more companies need to adopt this). 
When I first started it was great place to work with great managers that cared. Core values were followed,  communication and training was great, and employees valued.","After changing of very high positions,  company started going down hill. People were transitioned to new roles without being asked if they wanted them HR records weren't looked at, putting people that have bullied others in management positions. Theres a huge lack in communication and core values aren't being followed. Company is also pushing for the make or break it attitude when hiring and is completely lacking in training.  Training went down to practically nothing and is vague.  The make it or break it people make alot of mistakes,  cleaned up by others, while management honors the one that created a mess and steps on the people cleaning up the mess and making the wheel turn. 
Good employees are stepped on, while employees that continuously mess up get promoted, mainly cause their butt kissers, but can't do their job.  People aren't getting raises (even prior to covid). Seems the very higher up management (CFOS,  president,  etc.) are hiring their friends and some of the friends can't do the job, but keep the position. 
Seems the employees don't matter anymore and your not going to get anywhere unless your a favorite. It's now alot like high school with cliques and if your not in the management clique,  your getting treated poorly."

848,eXp Realty,"Waste of time, racist, on Pacific Time, Broker barely accessible in NYS.",2020-11-05,1.0,Real Estate Salesperson,"The feeling of not being watched, but at the end of the day you have no real team, support.","I started working here in February. When Covid hit, I requested they waive the months fee of $80 (after I had upfrotned nearly $300 to join) since COVID put my state in Total lockdowns and people were dying daily in large numbers. Given they make millions a month on sheer dues  of 29,000+ agents they figured I was causing a wave and would risk their profits from dues. Those that left were mainly people of color in NYC, who were also new and realized that this company is greedy and is largely racking in profits from dues. I was immediately booted off the workplace, revoked of my license, access to my email, my data, my costs of over $400 was wasted as well as my time. They said ""I was not in culture"" what should I never request anything, or should people in a company not have a voice, and if they choose to articulate it, are they not in culture? Meeting with the ""leaders"" were condescending, calling me cute for being outspoken, and trying to ""make me heard"" with no tangible actions. This is better to be reported to the BBB.

 That was all the tip of the iceberg. I was sold as a new agent that I would have the ability to make more money with EXP, but upon starting as a new agent you have a 60/40 cut for the first 3 deals. And then you have 80/20 till you pay $16000 in commissions to EXP, for that year! So next year it's back to 80/20. Mind you if you have no actual support for deals and your mentor is obsessed with you spending time to recruit Instead of working on getting deals, you close nothing. 0*80% is still zero and thats what this is. It felt disgusting. 

Anywho not great for new agents. Very protective of their image, they have a whole department for it run by Jani Burke.  People are booted out of the ""workplace""for not being ""in culture"" aka not actively fangirling delusionally over EXP!"

I wish this model was available to me sooner in my career. The old traditional brokerage model never made sense to me (coming from a corporate and business background). I never fully saw the value in  it and while there are different franchises and names, they all over some variety of the same broken model.  What I love the most about eXp is the connection I have with other agents - I was worried that I would feel isolated but it is the exact opposite. This company attracts contributors and because it is one company using the same platform, I can connect with agents across the USA and soon to be the world. This is the biggest benefit for me.  The tools, resources etc are just an added bonus. And of course, the ability to have multiple ways to build wealth is amazing.","The company is growing and as such, there are some glitches here and there. But that is to be expected and nothing that cannot be dealt with."

948,eXp Realty,Missed the mark,2020-11-01,3.0,Real Estate Agent,High Commission Split Stock Incentives,Disorganized Not Going To Work Long Term
949,eXp Realty,Worst Decision of my Real Estate Career,2020-09-09,1.0,Real Estate Agent,"You can get customer support very quickly through their virtual world. Things like accounting, etc.","Lack of broker support. High fees for what you get, which again, is mostly quick support when you have an issue with accounting. No office (you have to meet clients eventually). 

Was left out to dry in a dispute with seller. Didn't feel my broker showed leadership in this situation."
950,eXp Realty,Would definitely not recommend!!!,2020-12-09,1.0,Realtor,Can take much of the training when you want,"Tons of fees, you must have strong online presence"
951,eXp Realty,True Retirement plan,2020-05-18,5.0,Realtor,The scalability of this company is unsurpassed. There is no other Real Estate company with such a powerful retirement plan.,You have to work it hard.. but you do w/ any company
952,eXp Realty,Indifferent,2019-12-27,3.0,Realtor,"If independence and little need of support are what you're looking for, eXp could be a good fit. The portal, CRM and stock options are a perk for the fees, but I wouldn't recommend this brokerage to new agents.","It really depends on what your business goals are. For a well established agent with proven systems already in place eXp could be great. If you need more coaching and support, this may not be the fit for you yet. I don't think my managing brokers could pick me out in a crowd of 10 people and were indifferent about people joining or leaving the company. This worked fine for a year, but I've decided to leave for more proactive involvement. Some of the training is great and easy to attend, just know that most of it is on a national level with few local opportunities."

It's a decent paycheck until the next job come along.","Lack of processes and procedures.  High staff turnover.  Top heavy, only those at the top are treated to bonuses/perks.  Will not get recognized for your hard work.  Hard to balance work life - long work hours.  Forget taking a vacation, no one to handle the ""need immediately""while you are off."
956,eXp Realty,BEST DECISION EVER,2020-06-09,5.0,Entry Level Realtor,Revenue share for Agents and Agent owned corporation,The only con I could come up with is none.

958,eXp Realty,AMAZING!,2019-08-25,5.0,Realtor,"The BEST culture I have ever eXperienced in 14 years of doing real estate.! 
Financially it's a no brainer! Seriously!
EVERYONE is VERY supportive and helpful!  
There are opportunities to earn a passive income!
It's a publicly traded company! That means stock!
ALL the coaches out there say to market YOURSELF ... eXp is a supporter!
eXp provides all the tools any realtor would need to be successful ... and if you're not successful, it's not because if eXp!  

Once you have seen the full presentation ... it's hard not to say YES!","If you're NOT a self starter, this company is not for you.  If you spend time in the office instead of showing homes to buyers, meeting sellers at their home ... then eXp is not for you."
959,eXp Realty,Fantastic place to work with everything you need to succeed .,2019-12-11,5.0,Real Estate Broker,"Top of the line technology with endless training opportunities.  The mentor program is excellent, the agents are always willing to help and the BIC's are always available when you need them.   In the first 6 months I saw my business increase 150%.

970,eXp Realty,Wonderful Place to Work,2020-04-10,4.0,Product Manager,"Dynamic environment, growing business, commitment to doing what is best for the agents. Work-life balance.  Compensation. People.","The Corona virus has had a negative impact in the business that will be long time to recover, but they are uniquely poised to do it.

972,eXp Realty,Happy Employee,2020-04-29,5.0,Payment Processor,"Always Work from Home, such a Great company to be apart of",NONE! I Love this company!!
973,eXp Realty,My experience with eXp was 100% the opposite of what I expected.,2020-05-12,1.0,Realtor,"The concept is good, training is good if you have some guidance","The rev share has inexperienced agents recruiting and than dropping the ball. I was told not to contact one of my managing brokers because he was no longer with eXp and that was not true. Found out a week later, in a date meeting, that he was indeed the person I needed to contact. If you have a question or a referral it can take days for someone to get back you. because the sponsor that recruited me was/ is more interested in recruiting and complaining about having to do anything I had a very negative experience with eXp. I would be Leary and clarify that the person attempting to recruit you has it together, knows what they are doing, is Honest, Trustworthy and has real estate sales experience beyond your own and can answer questions about eXp and actually wants to see agents succeed within the organization. I had closings every month before eXp my business slowed and dealing with my sponsor was an unproductive nightmare.  My sponsor had me buy her family dinner and insisted on ordering on her laptop when I offered to order form my own device she insisted and when I asked to remove my debit card information from her laptop she got angry and said, you either trust me or you don’t. Being new with eXp and depending on her for some help with onboarding and trusting her at all was a huge mistake. Tech support you can submit a ticket and schedule support it can takes days to get tech support assistance. Be careful of who you choose to sponsor you when you join eXp. I would have switched sponsors but was told it is more trouble than it is worth. It was easier to transfer my license to a brokerage that actually has great people and if I have a question they are pleasant and my business is already doing much better. 6 listings and can focus on productivity and my clients."
974,eXp Realty,Great Company,2020-04-25,5.0,Real Estate Agent,Technology and online support infrastructure,lack of options to network in person

981,eXp Realty,Great place to be a Realtor at,2019-08-23,5.0,Realtor,"If your looking for training and a great place to be a part of, this is the place. eXp Realty, LLC by far is the best brokerage out their with 25+ hours of training per week, great compensation plan, brokers who stick up for the realtors and the collaboration platform which is second to none. No other brokerage has the collaboration that eXp Realty, LLC has. 
Great People, Great Leadership, Great Place to work ask Glassdoor and Great Technology.",I can't think of anything.
982,eXp Realty,Good,2020-07-23,4.0,Realtor,Nice to be there on cloud,Not recommended for new agents
983,eXp Realty,Worst Decision ever made,2019-09-23,1.0,Realtor,"Started off great, as I came over with a Team and our TL made it sound like the best decision ever, were we wrong. From day 2, it went downhill, so there are no Pros to report.","'Almost' everyone cares more about revenue share than the actual business. They tend to forget what we are here to for, and that is to assist the Home buyer and Home seller buy and sell their homes. Not buy and sell a real estate company. The culture does not exist because each Agent is out for themselves, and themselves only. Not why I received my Real Estate License. Due to the Agent's, we aligned with constantly calling me asking how many Agents I have added to my downline almost daily, I had enough and it was time to go. Money doesn't drive me, helping my community does."
984,eXp Realty,Best job to work from home,2019-09-16,5.0,Administrative Support Coordinator,"Self paced, independent work schedule, wonderful management team that is readily available, great benefits, ease of communication with anyone at any level of the company.",Not enough hours in my day to do all I can for our agents.
985,eXp Realty,Somthing,2020-07-13,4.0,Licensed Realtor,"Everything is online, don’t need to have office payment",Not really good for new hires
986,eXp Realty,Four years ago I thought about getting out of the business,2019-12-13,5.0,Realtor and EXp University Agent Faculty,Incredible culture and infrastructure for employee and agent growth. We are building more than just businesses... we are building lives.,I have not encountered one single con to being with eXp Realty
987,eXp Realty,Good culture.... too much going on,2020-05-09,3.0,Real Estate Agent,"People will help you gladly.
There is something new to learn at this place",There are many fees and it feels like they are trying too many things at once.
988,eXp Realty,Love everything eXp stands for,2020-01-15,5.0,Realtor,Keep being innovative and creating new ways for the agents to grow.,There is nothing that I would consider a con.
989,eXp Realty,"Outstanding company with an open information sharing atmosphere, this is unlike any brokerage!",2019-11-08,5.0,Realtor,"Revenue Share, Highly Technical, Training Galore, Excellent Brokers",That agents from Brick and Mortar Brokerages don't take the time to give it a chance.
990,eXp Realty,Finally a real estate company that allows an agent to be a true partner in ownership and growth.,2014-12-04,5.0,Broker,"One of the best positive aspects of EXP Realty is the fact that there is nationwide collaboration in the cloud environment. This means that the traditional real estate company of local sharing of ideas is no longer the best opportunity for a real estate agent to get trained and collaborate with other agents. The cloud environment at EXP allows for an extremely efficient experience when conducting business. Everything is paperless, the admin and technology staff is easy to access without having to get in your car and the opportunity to learn from our recorded classes taught by local experts on our own time is key to quality of life and time spent with family.",My only con would be the time it takes to get used to the cloud office. Just because it is not like a normal office and since our industry is so used to going to a bricks and mortar office locally it takes a little bit more time to get used to the fact that all you have to do is log on to your computer to access an amazing staff of transactions and technology support people not to mention all the leadership that is there helping you grow your business.
991,eXp Realty,"Great job for someone who can self-manage, adapts well to change, and looks for flexibility",2019-11-14,5.0,Payment Processing Specialist,"Work/Life Balance

There is a high level of empowerment and support for employees.,"The rapid growth of the company has led to many new levels of leadership and changing structure. Although it is difficult to navigate a growing staff, I'm glad we aren't like so many other companies facing decline and layoffs."

998,eXp Realty,Innovative Real Estate Company,2019-11-28,5.0,Realtor,Liked the online virtual office and services,I can't think of any at the moment.  Overall a good experience with EXP.
999,eXp Realty,Getting a little too corporate,2020-01-15,4.0,Realtor,"Great communication, Great tools and technology, Great commission splits",Every time we turn around they are lowering the benefits and payouts of stock options. Saying its part of the sustainability plan. Makes me wonder how long term they are thinking and if they will eventually get rid of stock options
