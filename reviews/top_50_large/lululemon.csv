Very big push for personal connections but also adding on so it feels manipulative"
11,lululemon,Employee Beware,2022-01-28,1.0,Health Educator,The discount is great comparatively to other stores in the retail industry.,"-Leadership is not supportive of the part-time workers or those workers that work on the floor the majority of the time. Saw workers often get taken advantage of to extend their shifts - sometimes to 12-14 hour days during the holidays. Most store leadership doesn't even work on the floor and leave their staff to deal with difficult guests. 

-Often employees were allowed to come to work sick during a pandemic because there was no one else available for coverage. This happened several times throughout COVID-19. 

-Company preaches that they care about the employee experience, but they do not. Store leaders are often not versed in employment laws nor do they care about employee well being. 

-Typically cut hours tremendously and staffed the store short on busy days. Leadership never covered call offs. 

-Filed several complaints against management with regional Human Resources (who lives on the other side of the country and had never visited our store in person) and was removed from the schedule consequently for speaking up as an advocate for my team members. 

-Leadership gossips about team members calling those that hold them accountable to do their job ""difficult"". 

-Customers treat you horribly - often demanding you to do things against store and company policy and leadership would just break rules rather than educate the guest on the appropriate rules."

That year we topped over 2 Billion in digital sales by Q3 if I recall, for reference we made our accumulative first Billion by 2019 and they cut digital bonuses because “covid” its almost funny that the only part of the org that brought in revenue they cut those works bonuses. When I left so were many other of the really good engineers as we all knew the market would pay way higher and we were in higher demand now with covid, only people still on digital are people that are the less driven engineers.

153,lululemon,Opportunities are few.,2022-01-28,2.0,Educator,"Fun people to work with (non-management).

If you are young, out of college, want a discount and don't plan on being with the company longer than a year, two max (in a part time role) go for it. 

If you are full time, or above, the responsibilities become incredibly overwrought and you are barely paid a dollar higher than those working in non-management roles.","The internal surveys for employees are consistently mediocre at best. There is no difference of opinion and the management use the ""feedback"" system to regulate those who might disagree or cause ""conflict"". 

Lululemon performs and preaches a ""progressive"" culture, but that is more brand than it is reality. A fellow employee once reported a workplace violation to HR, and NONE of the people who witnessed it were contacted. The case was closed with no resolution, and THEY were reprimanded for asking why nobody was contacted. The company overall is designed along similar lines. Overall toxic ""positivity"" culture that is used to micromanage or target workers who don't fit the mold. Leadership (Assistant/Store Managers) can be, and are often, incredibly difficult to work with. I've never experienced such a strict hierarchy that is so resistant to change.

The company is built upon a system of ""feedback"" which allows the company to micromanage performance and actively encourages leaders to document (seek out) ""flaws"" in their employees. Natural bias makes this a very toxic system, yet there is no accountability for the inevitable turnaround of workers. I have worked for the company 3+ years. With the exception of one, every single full time or ""key leader"" (lowest manager you can be) I've worked with has left the company because of their experience.

It is incredibly difficult to get a better paying, let alone ""office"" job in the company. I have seen multiple people denied career opportunities (getting permanent status for health care benefits) because of management tanking their transfer or career mobility. Management roles are often contracted, precisely to micromanage employees and exhaust labor, or eliminate those who don't do well to their standards. This makes long term life planning, and over all career planning, depend entirely on highly variable and relative factors. If you have a difficult manager, you are at a more difficult vantage for career options."

I was sadly mistaken,"Local-level management is indifferent, immature, lacking empathy, and is ill-equipped to manage and many of their decision practices are inconsistent and arbitrary. The mental wellbeing of it's employees is the furthest thing from their minds and they do little to promote an environment where you feel supported. I often question my self-worth given the lack of regard they have for me as an individual. I read another review that stated 'For a company that ""promotes mental wellbeing,"" they do not live into this practice'. I couldn't agree with this more."

318,lululemon,"Can Recruit, Cannot Retain",2022-01-02,1.0,Key Leader,- Employee discount makes clothing decently priced.,"- Narcissistic co-workers at each level with no disciplinary action taken for bad behavior.
- Treat white females better than minorities in leadership positions.
- Higher levels of management will beat you behind closed doors (I heard yelling through the door and was glad it was not me one time. Then again, I have been threatened with being fired for acts I did not commit multiple times. Then pushed to initial the logs/documentation as a method of agreeing that the accusations were true. I refused.) 
-Lots of narcissistic projection and flying monkeys, along with gaslighting.
- 6 narcissists in the camp, holding the rest of the business unit hostage.
- Yelling and bullying received from each level...it comes from below, sideways, and above.
- Observed management lying to educators and key leaders. I was told I was in a safe place to voice my concerns. When I was transparent, apparently my ""statements"" were recorded, manipulated to make me look bad, and then written in my log file to cast me in a bad light.
- Some are allowed to gather and talk while ignoring customers...for hours; yet others are punished for speaking to colleagues. Double-standard.
- Falsifying and blatantly ignoring physical evidence (written letters, video tape surveillance, etc.) and witnesses in order to fire employees. Writing lies on logs and twisting what was said in order to fire employees. 
- Over-emotional employees: basing decisions and throwing tantrums without applying sound logic or reasoning.
- Being the punching bag for leadership while no one is watching.
- Narcissistic, young individual contributors gaslighting the higher management successfully. Painful to watch. Lost respect for management being so ignorant and easily mislead.
- Higher levels of management projecting what they are bad at onto others. Stating others are not good leaders when it is actually themselves. They do not do their job. But are angry at others...accusing the hard workers of not doing their jobs.

I was once acused of stealing anpack of facemasks that had my name on them that I left in the break room. Management doesn't care about racist micro agressions, or racist attitudes towards black employees. White employees are able to do whatever and leave when they want but if a black employees tries to call out it's an entire issue. This was witnessed several times. I had several calls and exchanges with management in my two years there. The CEO is nice but doesn't give a damn about the Atlanta market because our store was suffering because of bad management and nothing was done.  Development plans do not exist, you will remain an educator unless you are popular with management. I can honestly go on for days about how horrific this place was to work at.

- good friends
- working for a company that cares about staying healthy","- The management at my particular store was not good, the leaders treated their job as if it was the only thing that mattered. It's retail. People would be scared to let the manager know months in advance that they had to change their hours for a doctor's appointment.
- Managers were very fake and had their favorites. Also had double standards (ie covid travel rules were strictly enforced for the employees but heads were turned when the ASM went on vacation and posted about it on instagram)."

758,lululemon,Love turned to disgust,2020-09-04,2.0,Store Manager,Benefits are decent. Product IS GREAT and the best there is. Can be a fun environment.,"The wild expectations of our store teams to execute what is required with very little labor hours to spend is unacceptable. Roles and responsibilities of every job now that we were back in store post-closing due to covid are truly remarkable. The expectation that is put on the SM/ASM/KL bench is far beyond what we are getting paid. There is no relationship or collaboration between 'corporate' and the store teams, therefore, there is no knowledge of what the store teams need to execute on a day to day basis. From monitoring capacity, to maintaining physical distancing, cleaning checklists every 30 minutes, to scheduling constraints, and this is on top of doing our 'job' of selling great pants ; there needs to be better work to be done to limit the burnout from the GREAT employees that we have, and re-grounding in what the principles that lululemon stands for. People are NOT happy, they are tired, scared, and feel highly under supported. More/greater expectations with drastic pay cuts, which are to be understood, but something needs to be adjusted or changed.

lululemon has stepped away from what was once a beautiful, fun, supportive and empowering career, to feeling constantly beaten down, defeated, 'never good enough', and underpaid.

Forget having a day off. Emails, texts, and communication come through 7 days a week with sometimes less than a 24 hour turnaround to execute."

817,lululemon,This is the least inclusive company I have ever been in contact with,2021-07-06,1.0,Lululemon Key Leader,"There were absolutely no pros at the location where I worked.

*I would give 0 stars if it allowed for that","I worked at lululemon on two separate occasions. After leaving the first time I thought maybe I had not given the organization a fair chance, so years later I returned. I began as a part-time educator and worked my way up to a full time Key Leader and ended up being with the company for two years until I absolutely could not take it any longer.

They constantly claim inclusivity but that is only true if you agree with upper management and have the exact same values as them, anything less is not accepted and you are forced out of the organization by passive aggressive bullying. 

They did offer some pay during Covid when stores were closed and this was considerate of them. Once the doors re-opened all bets were off. Working in a leadership role was detrimental to my mental health. I would leave the store and actually be inside of the store always feeling less-than because I did not align with the values of other leadership. Because of this I was forced to take their criticism and feedback, often crying in the back room of the store because of a particular assistant store manager who ruined our entire operation. Leadership would ask you to give feedback but when you did give it to them they would make excuses or say that your feedback was not relevant and totally disregard it. I often tried to voice my concerns and feedback within the store and they would tell me it ""didn't land correctly"" and then make excuses for their behavior and say that nothing they had done was incorrect or wrong.

The store manager was so disengaged from what was going on inside of the store that she left most of it to the ASM who ruined the entire operation by choosing her favorite employees and showing favortism outwardly to them in front of others. She would take certain people in the back to chit chat while leaving others on the floor to run it alone.

It was OK for employees to come in and speak about defunding the police, politics, ask people if they were vaccinated, etc. but if you showed a slightly different view or disagree you were shunned. 

I feel that I was forced out of the organization by the ASM and the SM, as well as an SM from another store where I interviewed. I will never recommend this organization to anyone that I come in contact with because of the way that I was treated. It was absolutely horrible."

Management in remote areas left to themselves and can easily create a bad culture at the store with out regional managers knowing.
Managers can either be amazing or horrible, I worked under both. The horrible managers took their insecurities and blamed coworkers.

1059,lululemon,No company of this size should be doing anything less than absolutely everything they can for the world.,2021-02-13,2.0,Key Leader,"Awesome employee discount. 
75% off the original price of marked down items.
Full time employees get 60% off of full-priced items.
Part time employees get 40% off of full-priced items.","The pay for the workload is wildly unacceptable.
Educators (entry-level employees) are expected to pull the most weight for the team, with intense sales tactics, practices, and goals. It is aggressive, but not rewarding.
Most educators start at $12-$13/hr in Arkansas, and they are solely responsible for the financial success of the company.

As a Key Leader, you make a couple dollars more hourly than the educators you are leading, which honestly feels wrong, as they are the ones busting tail on the sales floor daily.
You are expected to take on all other assets of the business and fully ""own"" areas like community, social media, product/merchandise etc. For $15/hour, there is an extreme amount of behind-the-scenes work expected of Key Leaders.

Assistant Managers and Store Managers do not actually care about your well being or the fact that you are only guaranteed 25 hours weekly as a ""full time"" employee. Everyone Key Leader and below who works at this store has a second job, just so they can break even on bills. 
The bonus structure for Key Leaders and Educators is based on how well the store financially performs compared to the goals set by lululemon for that store. 
The bonus structure for ASM's and SM's is based on how well they have ""managed"" the store, which basically boils down to making sure they don't give their employees too many hours (or honestly barely any hours at all). The ASM's and SM's almost always receive a large bonus each quarter, along with being guaranteed 40 hours of work each week. The Key Leaders and Educators get maybe 6 very small bonuses each year, if they are extremely lucky.

Don't even get me started on how this company has exploited people, practices, and cultures for its impressive capitalistic gain and success. 
lululemon is responsible for changing the face of yoga from something that was once free, and offered to all as a life practice for personal growth and healing, into a wealthy, white, American stereotype, all because of corporate greed."

They have this folder: Educator Timelines. If are 30 seconds late you get written up and it stays on your record forever in the company.

I am constantly corrected not on my work performance but that I should do more yoga or run more and I would be happier this from people without small children and a manager who has no outside responsibilities. As a single parent, it has been so difficult to work with this odd culture that is not supportive of any beliefs except their own.

Lululemon truly changed my life and I struggled really hard when I left the place to move on to a full time (hired not temp) position. The workouts and the trainers and the staff are so friendly and they really try to do things for the employees like luncheons, or having breakfast there at the start of the shift.","No set schedule. They may tell you that you will work X to X, but there is SO much mandatory overtime. Not good for a family. Also, the turnover rate is the worst thing. I was told so many times that I was on the chopping block because I wasn't running fast enough when I would be sent to another department to train which leads me to my next con. I have zero problem with cross training, but you can't expect somebody to master another department within a few hours. I certainly feel like there is a little bit of discrimination against heavier people who cannot move as fast as somebody fit. I was certainly turning my lift around working there, but sometimes they really made me feel down with they would say I was on the ""chopping block for not moving fast enough"". Also was there more than 90 days without missing or being late once and no offer for full time. Many employees had been there for 8+ months with no offer of full time"

You get paid 2 weeks vacation but it’s paid partially over all 52 weeks so when you take a week vacation you are now out a weeks pay. Although you got an extra $20 a week in each paycheck.... 2 weeks are paid and 3 are allowed to be taken your first few years .

1424,lululemon,Good experience minor issues,2019-11-20,4.0,Seasonal Sales Associate,"I had an absolute blast working at Lululemon. I loved the team and everything that the company stood for. I will admit, when yo are working at an expensive clothing store you get sucked into toxic company culture. This could be buying really expensive items or really pushing for a sale. I did like that in the beginning of each shift we had a ""clearing"" where we talked about anything that was stopping us from performing our best or concerns, to focus on and doing the best at your job. The discount was good, I believe 25-30% off regular items and 70-75% off of sale, so you were definitely rocking those aligns. 

A common misconception people have about working seasonal is holiday. It's almost inevitable that sh*t is going to get crazy. But if you have a good team and a cup of Starbucks, its manageable. You meet your best and worst guests during that time. As I said, it depends on the person and company. I enjoyed my stay because my beliefs aligned with the company and we had a good team.","If your able to channel your ""inner white girl"" your fine. You'll be mentioning those three F's about products and can tell the difference between aligns and wonder unders. 

I don't believe its possible to move up in the company unless your SUPER cool with management. Some parts of it is ""clicky"" but I'm sure you can find your people."

The company itself has good values.,The store I worked at didn't uphold to company values. I was told that educators are the most important role at Lululemon because we are the ones connecting to guests and making sales for the company but never treated like we were important.

If you are passionate about fitness in the ""community,"" then this is a great opportunity to become networked and educate guests not only on product, but lifestyle and culture of Lululemon. The discount is awesome as well as other discounts to local fitness studios. Depending on your city, you will get $125-150 worth of stipend money to use at studio fitness classes of your choice. There are some incentives to workout and lots of team sweats. Having access to Youlu and Zipline is nice whenever you have questions about company policy, recent product education, or need to download a document (e.g., payroll calendar). If your store hits their sales goals, then you will receive a bonus on your paycheck, which does help a lot.","Hmm...I think that the work-life balance was not so great since managers would require ""most"" educators or key leaders to work both weekend days in addition to late nights until midnight during the week processing inventory. The scheduling was never consistent and certain privileges would be afforded to others. For instance, some part-time educators were given the privilege to only work once a week to accommodate their jobs and schooling while others were required to work more than once a week despite having the same level of responsibility and obligations outside of the store. However, they'll only do this if they don't like you. My store happened to have a high turnover since the expectations were too high for people that just wanted to work part-time and have flexible scheduling. 

Getting time off was extremely difficult and our manager would implement a ""blackout"" period during certain times of the year outside of holiday if there were too many people requesting time off or vacation even if it was unpaid. 

While I loved the team sweats and workout classes, I felt like if you didn't go to workout classes during the day (9-5) when everyone else did, then you were a bit ostracized from the rest of the team and it would be harder to make connections with them. Because I had a full-time job and school outside of the store, I felt like a lot of my co-workers judged me for not wanting to spend time and ""connect."" Well, I am going to bluntly say that working out from 9-5PM on a weekday is not a reality for the majority of people who actually need to work or have career ambitions. 

Overall, the culture can be toxic and cult-like if you don't have the time or financial resources to participate in their community sweats or other parties/events. I felt like this job would have been perfect for someone who just wants to work for fun or doesn't have other obligations like a rich person."

Never straightforward with their feedback. Constantly beating around the bush by using fluff like ""success meetings"" (which means you're not doing so hot"" or ""leadership logs"" (which is documentation of all the things you do wrong).
Managers do nothing most of the time. They stand around and talk to each other when on the floor like they're forbidden from helping guests. Then when bad reviews are left about ""workers talking to each other instead of helping"", they blame the educators as if that's not all they do, because customers can't tell the difference between a manager and an educator.
Moving up in the company has nothing to do with work ethic and skill. To move up you need to be friends with the managers and go on ""sweat dates' (workouts) with them as often as possible
Not flexible for students. Very strict availability requirements even for part-time employees.
Very difficult to get vacation time because the managers always insist it will be too busy that week to have people go on vacation
Blackout periods from Thanksgiving until mid-January.
Bonuses are extremely variable. So much so that the goals seem arbitrary.
Long, required monthly meetings where 90% of the time is wasted on ice breakers , why the managers appreciate each other, and a game, after which the remaining 10% will be ""training"" which is just a repeat of the same training as every month."

1832,lululemon,Good benefits and opportunity to be a part of fitness community,2020-02-10,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Benefits -Good offering of stock share, 401k, health insurance, discount on products, monthly stipends for fitness classes and fair bonus structure at the managerial level 

Community involvement- depending on the store and manager paid time to workout and mingle in the fitness community and often discounted prices for classes at fitness studios. Good way to get your foot in the door to the fitness world. 

Discount on product for men in your life and sometimes a fun work environment and personal development opportunities 

Maternity leave plan after 2 years or longer in role is paid for time off on top of FMLA","It’s retail. Some managers and employees treat the job like they are changing the world and run it like a 9-5 career. When they are selling pricy workout wear. It’s no different than any other retailer. The culture can be a little eye roll ridiculous at times. Border line cult like. 

Young employee base can be immature and click like. Playing games and such at staff meetings feels more like middle school camp. Going out together and non required but highly encouraged team events. 

Managers in their 20s/low 30s don’t have life and career experience to understand what “work life balance” is and make it a challenge for employees to work around kids and family and 2nd job schedules. 

Current policy requires Very little grace and understanding in schedule requests of employees by managers and vacation policy is ridiculous unpredictable 

Managerial level rolls could be more flexible for remote work for administration work and work from home for administrative duties and less floor shifts.  

No paid sick time of sick time off. Must work when sick or get written up.  Same with grace period on running late or when unplanned issues occur - sick kid, flat tire, traffic. 

If you drop down from a manager or like rolls to educator they greatly reduce your pay despite time in roll. Same when moving from a higher pay class area (California) to somewhere with lower cost of living. 

Educator (regular employee) bonus structure and pay is border line poverty and most employees have second jobs or bank rolled by someone else. It is not a living wage. 

Long shifts for the sake of long shifts."

They don't know how to care for their employees or support them in their growth. There tends to be a lot of favoritism throughout stores. Also if you aren't an active participant in the hottest workout classes that the leadership team in your store is obsessing over then you are somewhat ostracized.

You are always staying busy and no day is rarely the same.

Does not feel like retail, which is refreshing.","Overall the culture is starting to decline - the company is doing great on paper and thus in the stock market because they are sucking every last minute out of their staff in the stores without compensating them extra (and in fact, making it more difficult to bonus). I left a professional company that had done this and unfortunately thought lululemon was different..

Impossible to get all of you work done in a 40 hour work week, but discouraged to work overtime.

If you work at a high volume store or a store that is open from 11a-6p and very low volume, your pay and responsibilities are all the same. If you’re considering a position you should attempt to get into a low-volume store for lower stress level and a better trade off when it comes to work-life balance.

Opportunities for moving up are very limited and very dependent on who you know, and sometimes that even doesn’t help. In fact, at times It’s difficult to respect those who you are calling/contacting higher on the ladder because they are so disconnected to what happens at the store level, even with the most basic details like what we need to run our bare-bones business."

The discount and the workout stipend are a great perk as well.","Once people surpass the role of Key Leader into Assistant Store Manager and beyond, they act as though the rules don't apply to them. Sure, they are now salaried and Store Managers have paid vacation so their rule book is technically different, but it's incredibly frustrating to be one of the employees driving sales on the floor watching your manager take dozens of vacations and sit in his office with the door closed while the grunt work (especially during the holidays) can often be brutal. If the manager isn't around to witness what's good and bad on the floor, there's no way you can actually respect their advice for how to increase sales, improve guest experience, etc. when holding reviews. I can't say this attitude is the same for all managers but I've encountered a handful who play this game. There is a fine line between earning the perks you have received and not forgetting where you came from and it seems pretty common for them to cross it and never look back.

This is standard for retail but the job growth is basically non-existent. If you start as an educator you have a chance of being a Key Leader if you work your butt off, but ASM and SM roles come around once in a blue moon. The part that is different at lululemon is that they act as if exciting career opportunities are abundant and all you have to do is ask and ""get curious"" about them, but the fact is unless you're willing to move to Vancouver to work on the Operations side of the house, you'll be an educator forever."

I was older than most of the other educators AND management, and I was mid twenties, and wow was that made clear! I also have children and was a single mother at the time, going to classes outside of work was pretty close to impossible, and I was constantly being questioned about my lack of commitment. I also didn't feel the 'cheerleader' mold, but in no way am i unfriendly or unapproachable, and found it hard to maintain the constant fake smile I was encouraged to withhold. My manager took it upon herself to hire personal friends and make them key leaders with no experience, over many of us who had worked there for over a year. Management and keyleaders were usually found sitting in our back room or outside of the store gossiping. I was eventually accused of having a bad attitude (which was the same laid back and quiet ('bad') attitude i had for 2 years of employment there. I was written up for a completely vague reason which i never understood. The manager lied to my face when i arranged a meeting with her, telling me she had no idea about my write up or the reason behind it. I was fired days later, with her signature on the paperwork. Lucky me, i was then the unemployed single mother who desperately needed to keep that job, exasperated because i was essentially fired by a clique straight out of Mean Girls. I didnt want to sit with you, anyway.

No wonder this company is going to sh*t."
