I've also never worked for a company that is so open about mental health. It is beyond empowering for those who have disabilities. We even have a dedicated mental health committee and mental wellness days to recharge and return, ready to rock and roll.

-Strength of the Product 
-Servant Leadership

Add genuine people to the mix, and things start to get really interesting very quickly. We (Leadership, your peers, your technical-counterparts) demand excellence, and look to do it better, cleaner, and faster than others. 6sense is a home of winners, and that culture isn't going anywhere.

Are you ready to win?",Our healthy paranoia can be overwhelming at times. I'll refer back to the point I made in the Pros around demanding excellence- that means more than 100% effort.. This organization is NOT for everyone- nor should it be.

35,6sense,6sense is a Career Fountain of Youth - Feeling Invigorated!,2021-05-28,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"The success of any org starts with having the right leadership team in place. 6sense has the strongest executive leadership team of any org I have been a part of and they set the bar high. From the CEO down, our leadership fully embraces the ""Take care of your people and they will take care of your customers/you"" mantra. 

Personally, I experienced multiple crises in my first few months here and the org was super supportive. Even several leaders reached out to me directly to check in, see how my family and I were doing, and see if they could help in any way. I've never experienced that before, especially being so new. 

The company also prioritizes discussing and implementing initiatives around mental health, work/life balance, workplace equality, and more. In fact, every All Hands starts out with our CEO walking through gender and racial rates across the entire org and across the leadership team. I don't know many (if any) companies that hold themselves that accountable to supporting workplace equality.

Beyond that, our product actually works like we say it does. So often companies pitch a product that either doesn't actually do what it says, is unstable, or difficult to navigate. The 6sense platform does what we pitch that it does, is super reliable, and user experience is fantastic, which makes it that much easier for us to onboard customers and get them adopting it. 

Across the board, our customers are super happy and I think everything I mentioned above plays an important role in that. And working with happy customers makes any job that much more enjoyable.

TL;DR: Great leadership, Great People, Organization Empathy, Great Product, Happy Customers.","Nothing that really stands out beyond normal growing pains (knowledge sharing, keeping up with who are primary internal contacts due to fast growth, etc.)., but it's evident that the org is actively listening and working to address these."

Now that I'm here, the people I'm doing that with are what make it such a great place to be.","This is a SaaS growth company.

Refreshing! I enjoyed researching the company because their content is so energetic and even funny at times (I loved John Barrows). Tina's experience was so fun that time flew by and I already feel like she is someone I cannot wait to have a beverage with in Napa.,I don't have any yet and look forward to their judgement around where I can serve within  their wonderful company.

That means things move fast, there are a continuous flood of deadlines and issues to solve, documentation is sparse, project requirements are often vague or in flux, and you have to be able figure it all out and work through the confusion and uncertainty rather than rely on anyone else to give you the answers.

92,6sense,Fresh Prince of 6sense,2016-02-09,5.0,,"Now, this is a story all about how,
B2B Marketing got flipped upside down.
And I’d like to take a minute,
Since you seem a bit tense…
To calmly explain how I became the prince of 6sense.

In New England America, born and raised,
In the classroom was where I spent most of my days,
Reading, creating and questioning all along,
Will I ever find a career worthy of writing a song?
When a couple of guys & a gal, who were up to some good,
Created an intent-driven solution, which I’d wished someone would.
I had an inspiring conversation, of which I won’t be too descriptive,
The outcome was calling home to say “I’m going to work in predictive!” 

I came in hungry to learn and with a contributor’s mindset,
I feel the passion of my peers and have not had one regret.
We’re a positive group of people, exposing signals of purchase intent,
So Marketing & Sales can act, but only when its relevant.

The team is open and collaborative, no siloed groups here,
We’re in a competitive industry, but never succumb to fear.
Giving back when we can, big supporters of Girl Rising,
Doing our part to improve the world, but that shouldn’t be surprising.

We have dogs in the office and a culture second to none,
Whether it be yoga, meditation or free beer… we have fun!
Working with brilliant people and solving problems big & real,
Come aboard for the ride… you look great in teal!","Good problem to have, but we're growing faster in head count than we are spatially expanding... need more conference rooms & bathrooms."
93,6sense,You'll learn a lot,2019-12-05,5.0,Software Engineer,You have a lot of independence and responsibility early. Good people. Good place for growth and learning,Your work will never be done. If you don't manage yourself mentally you can burn out.
94,6sense,Great place to work,2016-06-01,5.0,Personal Assistant,"As the personal assistant to the CEO, I wanted to share my perspective on the company, its culture, and its leader. Never in my life have I ever had an employer truly care for me the way Amanda does. I consider her family, and I have learned so much from her about being positive and becoming a strong woman who believes in myself. Like any CEO, she has a personality that is unmatched - and having a strong, positive, and passionate leader is inspiring and uplifting. She is extremely hard working and believes in what she is doing - her confidence is contagious and she makes me want to work hard not only for the company but because hard work is very well rewarded and recognized within the company. I am trusted and always feel like my hard work is thanked and thats my favorite part about working for Amanda and 6sense.","As with any startup, you truly get out what you put in - and thats true for ANY silicon valley company. Dont expect to come to work and be ignored. If you want to collect a paycheck while putting in the bare minimum, don't work at a startup."
95,6sense,Happiest I've Been - 3 Years In & Counting!,2019-04-19,5.0,Senior Consultant,"I've had the opportunity to work for many top start ups and even a big unicorn that have all had award winning cultures. 6sense has topped the chart and that's why I've never been happier even after passing my three-year anniversary.

Some highlights:
- An incredible executive leadership team who cares deeply for their employees. Never have I felt more empowered to own my professional growth than my time here at 6sense. Beyond professional development, leadership has demonstrated compassion and generosity to many employees when life happens pulling attention away from work. Their actions speak louder than any review can put into words.
- Great benefits (competitive pay, fantastic insurance coverage, snacks/meals, company events, the list goes on...)
- The best product in the industry year after year and an aggressive roadmap that continues to raise the bar. 
- Recognition and career advancement opportunities.
- Colleagues who check egos at the door and are genuinely fun to work alongside. 
- Volunteer opportunities and a company value to support local communities.","I encourage all candidates to ask themselves whether they thrive best in a smaller or larger company setting. Growth-stage companies like 6sense tend to have less org structure, offer less specialization, and put more emphasis on each quarter's results. Because of this, employees are expected to wear many hats and quickly adapt to new industry, market and technology changes. Visibility is high so it is difficult to sit back and observe from the sidelines."
96,6sense,"Great people, product, culture, company",2019-04-29,5.0,Sales,"6sense has changed dramatically (for the best!) in the past 24 months in large part due to a renewed focus on customer success and building product to support our customers needs.

Leadership has instilled a culture that empowers people at every level to own their work. Employees at every level work incredibly hard and feel accountable to their peers and customers

Customer success is #1. One of the favorite aspects of our ""partnerships"" is that the sales team remains involved post-sale to supplement the Customer Success, Technical Account Management and Data Science teams to provide best in class customer support.

The product is very powerful. 6sense was the leader in the predictive analytics space and recognized a need to uncover more data for customers and also to create a platform that can activate data easier across email, display, web personalization, sales, etc....the new ABM Orchestration platform helped double the size of the 6sense customer base, revenue, team in 2018.

6sense invests in its employees through annual field kickoff event in Napa, president's club for top performers.

New office is big, open and promotes collaboration!","With the increase in quantity of deals, we need to find a way to automate the quoting/contracting process to improve deal velocity and free up resources."
97,6sense,Incredible Journey,2019-04-20,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Biggest pro of the company is the execs being ready and willing to adapt when necessary as well as being open and responsive to critical feedback. That more than anything else has kept the momentum going for all these years.

Some pro highlights that apply:
- Fast moving, always something to do
- Incredible career growth opportunities
- Fun work environment
- Highly collaborative cross-team visibility, more than I've seen at any other companies/startups
- People care about each other's well-being, including outside of work
- The company swings above its weight class, gets a lot of work done for such a small team
- Opportunity to work with some of the smartest and best people in their fields
- Very particular about maintaining the good company culture we currently have
- People set aside egos for the sake of company success","Some pretty normal growing pains that are stage appropriate. Having to scale out headcount and processes always leads to some disruption since we need to maintain operational efficiency down the line.

There is a ton of work to be done with company growth outpacing hiring (good problem to have), so if that isn't something you can handle then you may need to think twice about working here for the time being."
98,6sense,"Amazing Company, Culture and Team!",2016-04-27,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"I have been working at 6sense as an Enterprise Account Executive for the past 4 months.  My last two positions were at very well known software companies.  My experience so far has been nothing but positive.  I love the team and leadership.  Amanda our CEO is extremely passionate, driven, caring and wants us all to succeed.  We celebrate every milestone of a deal and I'm never selling a lone.  I have access to the entire Executive Team if needed as well as an amazing board.  

The company culture is top notch.  I work with some of the smartest people and have confidence in their abilities.  The people who work at 6sense care and it shows.  

Yoga and meditation practiced on the reg!  And an amazing healthy array of Whole Food Snacks are delivered on a weekly basis. Oh and Friday lunch is on the company! 

I also love working for a start-up, I am involved in much bigger conversations around our messaging in the market and feel like my recommendations are being heard and I'm making a difference.",Early start-up pains which are normal.  Still building out processes to scale but having fun doing it.
99,6sense,Cool  Startup,2019-10-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Cool startup to work with,Things are getting slowly structured.
100,6sense,I love working at this high-growth startup,2016-01-29,5.0,Customer Success,"6sense is in a perfect position to be the leader in a hot and quickly growing technology space - predictive analytics for B2B marketing and sales. Using big data to create a more sophisticated approach for growing pipeline is on the mind of every CMO, CRO and sales leader. It is clear from analysts to executives that this is a market poised for rapid growth. The time is now to join a company solving this problem in a original and effective way.

Culture is a critical ingredient to what makes 6sense a great place to work. We are a passionate, positive family and we drive each other to bring our best every day. 6sense is a company where every team member is encouraged to contribute in a BIG way to the growth of our product, customers, culture and position in the market. No one voice overshadows another. If you work here, you WILL make an impact.",None come to mind. But we have a creative and driven company. If you expect to sit on the sidelines or not take a thoughtful approach to your work then this not the job for you.
101,6sense,Working at 6sense,2016-11-23,5.0,Software Engineer,"The best thing about working at 6sense so far has definitely been the team and the culture at the company. Very early into your time there, you realize that it is like a small family where people are extremely friendly and helpful, and genuinely care about each others progress.
The work environment is very nurturing, but at the same time there is no spoon feeding. Help is provided at every stage that you need, but there is definitely a good amount of expectation of delivery from your end. 
The culture at work exemplifies the bay area work culture where there is very little importance given on your presence in office (no need for 9-5) but on the work that is being done. 
If that is not enough, there is a clear vibe in the office where everyone knows that they are working on a solid product with proven results and everyones mission is to make the product succeed. All in all, great place to work!","Fortunately for me, there haven't been any cons for me to mention."
102,6sense,Love being here...,2016-12-22,5.0,Data Scientist,"6Sense provides its employees with many opportunities for professional growth: 

- You get to own your projects: You can think of ideas and how they could add value to the product and start executing them within a very short time. Thus, spending less time on the overhead of starting a project. You're expected to be active and not only wait for requests on things, which gives the opportunity of curating projects that need the skills you want to lear and help you maximise your learning and growth.

- The people are hard-working, passionate, fun. Everyone from different teams is very accessible for cross-team collaboration. The management is also very accessible and responsive, ande they care about their employees.

There are many other pros that I love about working here... Many of them have been mentioned already in the previous reviews.","Sometimes it gets noisy making it hard to focus, especially because of the location of my desk.
But it's nothing you can't overcome with a good set of noise-cancelling headphones.

A typical open-floor plan problem."
103,6sense,Truly Unique Work Environment,2015-12-14,5.0,,"It seems every start up in the Bay Area talks about their ""culture"".  So how can you really know what that means? At 6sense, the core team has brought in their friends and colleagues that they have known, and trusted, for years to join the team. The result is a highly collaborative, positive and thoughtful environment. The core team truly loves one another and are also excited to welcome new team members to the 6sense family. ""Family"" is an over used term, but when, as in my case, you bring together people who you have been shoulder to shoulder with you building past successful companies - it's not a tag line  - it's real and you can feel it the minute you walk in the office.","It's easy to get ""out of balance"" with regard to work and personal life. Everyone wants to win so badly for each other - you have to be mindful work/life balance."
104,6sense,"Amazing tech, world class team",2017-10-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"6sense is known in the space for having had the best technology for a while (amazing engineering and data science team), and the  momentum seems to be building pretty rapidly. Forrester wave leader position, a host of new products, an exciting roadmap. What's also great is an entirely new go-to-market team. New CEO is great at driving the strategy, we've got new blood across sales, marketing and customer support, all with great track records. It feels like all of the pieces are together to make this into an important next-generation marketing technology company. Fun to be along for the ride!","Not sure if this is a con, but it's not for everybody - we're small and  scrappy, so you have to roll up your sleeves, be entrepreneurial, and make it work. If you're used to and dependent on a massive army of supporting teams, processes, assets, etc, it's probably not the right fit."
105,6sense,Wouldn't Recommend,2016-04-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,interesting space with intriguing concept of predictive technology,"The technology is not ready to scale and hasn't been able to win new customers on a consistent basis. Demand is also lacking. 

These technology/demand challenges might be acceptable, especially in a start-up environment if all other things were right. However, the company culture has been detrimental to the majority of people's willingness to embrace these challenges and most people seem to be operating out of fear of leadership rather than motivation. 

It's been my experience that there is a major disconnect between the senior leadership club and everyone else, especially with leaderships constant bantering of how great everything is. Facts speak louder than words so I am just one data point but I would imagine any candidate who does their diligence on the turnover the past 6 months might question why? 

It feels like most people are being told what to do, rather than inspired to do. 

Also, the CEO's backhanded response to another HONEST review is a common MO of not letting people have a voice. As far as the CEOs assertion that there are so many other positive reviews,  I might suggest there was a specific edict at the company off-site to have executives write reviews.... This is why the majority of them all happening on two specific days vs osmotically over time as you see on most sites."
106,6sense,"'Your culture is your brand' - Tony Hsieh, CEO Zappos",2019-04-18,5.0,Director,"When I think about 6sense, the quote in the headline comes to mind. Throughout my time at the company there has always been a focus on creating a supportive, genuine, transparent  culture. As we've grown, we've been able to attract the right people at all levels to keep this alive. 
Personally I have never been as challenged or given more opportunity to grow and excel in a role. It has been a career accelerator joining 6sense. Anyone joining this organization will experience working with an incredible group of people and with hard work comes amazing rewards.",The pros of joining 6sense outweigh any cons  ie. maintaining a good work/life balance. It is easy to be absorbed into the work we're doing but it's on the individual to prioritize time and this is encouraged by mgmt
107,6sense,"Big Data, Big Fun, Big Opportunity",2015-10-19,5.0,,"- Great product. Best in league.
- Very interesting space: big data, predictive analytics, and enterprise.
- A lot of opportunity from within to innovate and contribute. Your work contributions are felt immediately and have high impact. 
- There aren't 20 layers of management to go through to get something done.
- Collaborative, fun, and supportive work environment and culture. Not for folks who need their big egos polished.
- Very smart and hard working people but notably very easy going.
- A CEO who is an expert in the domain and you can approach and offer feedback to.","- Nothing notable to report. Typical startup issues don't apply as that is experienced everywhere and if you don't enjoy those issues, you shouldn't work in a startup atmosphere."
108,6sense,Couldn't be more excited about working at 6sense,2018-04-03,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"THE TEAM: above all, the 6sense team is incredible - such a smart, talented, hungry, driven, capable, impressive group of people. I'm honored to be a part of it!

THE SOLUTION: we are taking the B2B account-based marketing world by storm and we are NOT stopping anytime soon! Our solution is next level and driving huge success at massive enterprises. I truly believe in what we do, making it so much fun to present and sell

THE LEADERSHIP: If the 6sense leadership team tells me to jump, I ask how high. It's a group of people I trust incessantly and know they will continue to build on our amazing team and product","It would be wonderful to have a pristine office with a world of amenities, but that's not quite the case...yet :) Like any start up, we all wear multiple hats, it's fast paced, high stress, but very rewarding."
109,6sense,A company you want to work hard for,2016-01-28,5.0,,"Coming from a vc background, I've experienced many startups and for a long time I never thought I'd be open to working at one here in Silicon Valley. That all changed when I found 6sense. This is the kind of place that really drives you to want to work hard. Everyone is encouraging, hard work is recognized by management, and it truly feels like a family. The executives work hard to build a strong culture and there is a lot of communication and visibility from the top down. Plus, there's the usual perks like good snacks, emphasis on wellness, and an awesome living room with comfy couches and a dog friendly office!",There isn't really any downside. Great place to work.
110,6sense,"Awesome workplace, great CEO and amazing team",2016-01-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have worked at startups before and after my last gig never thought I could find a culture and team so smart in my future, but I was so wrong. The 6sense team is not only hard working, but it's the no ego that makes this better than any previous jobs.

It's rare a startup gets to work with so many enterprise companies and seeing how each department comes together to make a customer successful is phenomenal.

The exec team recognizes hard work in every way possible. The company values are not just on a piece of paper, the team ensure we are identifying how someone's action upheld those values.","Nothing specific, small things that are not really a problem."
111,6sense,Awesome Workplace,2016-04-26,5.0,Software Engineer,"I left 6sense because I had the opportunity to launch my own company, and it has been a dream of mine for a very long time.  The moment was right, and I went in on the venture with close friends.

The only reason I bring up the details above, is to be clear in this review that I was actually very happy with the company.  I noticed a couple negative reviews over the last week, and I would like to address those reviews in addition to some points that I'd like to make.

First of all, the leadership is very positive.  The CEO is kind, filled with fire, and cares quite deeply about the team.  While I worked there, she consistently expressed her gratitude for my contributions, and she personally reached out to me regularly to make sure I was involved in the company.  She truly cares about the people she works with.  I would say there is NOTHING self centered or self absorbed about her.  When I came to her about my new opportunity, she genuinely cared and showed support.

I would definitely disagree with the recent set of negative reviews, especially the personal attacks on the CEO and leadership.  Keep in mind, a couple employees did recently get laid off (I'll stay neutral on this) but this is the nature of a startup, so take those reviews with a grain of salt.

On the technical side, I would say the platform has quite a bit of potential.  It is already accomplishing amazing feats and is only going to get stronger.  There are definite scaling issues, however, that is always going to be the nature of a startup and is a good problem to encounter (and is definitely solvable and is being solved).  There are a lot of interesting challenges to work on - with enormous datasets.

This brings me to my next point: the CTO and technical leadership.

The CTO and founding tech team are some of the smartest people I've ever worked with.  They each gave a lot of attention to my growth, and I would say that my skills and accomplishments as an engineer were catalyzed and multiplied by their involvement with me.  The CTO showed strong leadership, and he made it a point to grow and trust the people under him.  He is one of the smartest individuals I have worked with.

Most of the founding team came from hulu's early, early days and are extremely experienced.  They are definitely a knowledge pool, and great to work with.","I see Jira as a tool that big corps or enterprises use that follow a process-oriented, top-down approach to work.  However, I had to use this at past companies I worked for, so it wasn't too big of a deal, and 6sense is not operating in a process-oriented top-down system."
112,6sense,Great place for Data Science,2016-08-04,5.0,Data Scientist,"I was the second data scientist and eighth 6sense employee. I've been with the company almost 3 years and my time at 6sense has been fantastic. I am leaving soon to seek out new challenges so I want to get my experiences on the record.

Technical

I have had the opportunity to grow tremendously as a data scientist and a programmer at 6sense. Data Science is a fun, collaborative team and now that most of our process is automated, we spend much of our time on R & D work which directly and dramatically improves the product. Data scientists at 6sense are full-stack: we build our own machine learning pipelines and deploy them to production. We started using a combination of Hive and Python and these days are doing more and more in Scala and Spark; as a mathematician and functional programmer, I'm a huge fan of this.

The head of the team is both a great data scientist and a fantastic manager. As a data scientist, he is extremely pragmatic, has serious technical chops, and is in his element when he can be creative with tools and techniques. As a manager, he makes sure that people get to work on the things that excite them and encourages team members to learn new things and grow their skills. He has a trait that is very rare in tech: empathy. He is an attentive and empathetic manager. He is also funny as hell and cool as a cucumber even in the face of changing deadlines and external pressure. 

Business

6sense is a leader in its space because we have intelligent, experienced, and creative business leaders at the helm. The CEO and heads of Business Strategy, Sales, and Product (as well as Data Science and Engineering) understand the market, have forged valuable business partnerships and strong relationships with customers, and are pretty much killing it.

Culture & Environment

6sensors are smart, warm, and funny. People are sarcastic in a friendly way, no one takes themselves too seriously, including executives.","The office is open and it can be hard to escape the noise of others. It's not horrible, especially with noise-cancelling headphones. When the company moves to a bigger space, hopefully there will be some pods and small 1-3 person meeting rooms."
113,6sense,Great place to work,2015-10-28,5.0,,"Management keeps employees informed of all developments in every function within the company weekly which is important. Start up perks like comprehensive benefits, pantry full of snacks, unlimited vacation and free lunch once a week. People are friendly and definitely knows how to make new employees feel at home on day one. The company also promotes healthy living and well being (body and mind) with meditation and yoga classes offered weekly.",The main kitchen is in the center of the office so you're always somewhat distracting someone which I think people has gotten used to. Hopefully our new office will take care of that.
114,6sense,Couldn't have asked for better!,2018-07-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Amazing team -- incredibly hard-working, intelligent, warm & welcoming since day one. We know how to buckle down  during crunch time, and how to celebrate our wins as a family. Since I've started, it's been a steady flow of huge achievements, and this just goes to show that the company has a commitment to its large scale vision, and that we're going places. Can't wait to see what's next, and be a part of this tremendous upward trajectory!","Honestly -- can't think of any, the normal start-up struggle. The constant activity is something I see as a positive - something's always going on and everyone wears multiple hats (excuse the cliche) to do their part and more. I find this to be inspiring, as it motivates me to work even harder."
115,6sense,"Rockstar CEO, amazing leadership, solid team of geniuses",2016-01-13,5.0,Sales,"One of the best companies and products around in the marketplace. The culture, leadership, and product is top notch. Even before I joined 6sense, I heard from various channels and trusted advisors (unsolicited) how 6sense is leading the predictive intelligence market. After a long but rewarding interview process, I couldn't be happier I am on board. What Amanda is doing with this company and her vision is a different than traditional valley companies. 6sense isn't what I expected, it's 10x better. The value really shines when you look at the impressive customer list. Game changer.","Nothing specific, happy camper, can't complain."
116,6sense,Still lovin' it....,2016-01-29,5.0,Sales,"i love working here for a ton of reasons; one of the main reasons is the leadership team.  I've never before worked with a team of people so dedicated to success, hard-working, intelligent, integrity-rich, humble and just great all-around people.  we spend a ton of time with each other and i couldn't have chosen a better team to be working with as we grow.

also, having just gone through a family health situation, knowing our CEO and team was fully supportive of putting family first makes a HUGE difference.  It's these experiences that tell you that you are working where you should be working!",uhhh... still coming up blank.
117,6sense,Culture + Technology =  Success Predicted!,2016-10-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Strong culture, strong technology, big upside. Company is leading the B2B predictive field and have a shot of being large and a great company. CEO and CTO care; business is personal. 6Sense is the CEO's life -- she is a hard-working, dynamic, one-of-a-kind entrepreneur and leader. Total commitment to winning on all levels (culture is super important).",Requires deep and recurring commitment. Management expects a lot and people are held responsible. You can't hide at 6Sense; after all the company is based on math.
118,6sense,Two Years in and Never a Dull Moment,2018-11-29,5.0,Tech Team Member,"I recently hit a two-year anniversary at 6sense and feel that it’s finally time to share a review.  I’m a member of the Tech-team.

A lot has happened in the last two years.  The team has doubled in size (though we still have that startup feel!), we’ve had a few big executive changes, acquired another small startup, and have had many amazing product revisions.

To stay brief, I’ll quickly share a few highlights of why 6sense has been a great environment for me:

People/Culture: I know it’s cliche to state that the people at your company are amazing and that they are one of the best parts of the job, but I truly feel this way here.

This team motivates me to work harder and better.  It’s an incredibly talented organization filled with bright people.  But more importantly, everyone here really cares about each other.  The start-up family feel exists here.  And this translates to many other cultural acceptances.  Your kid got sick at school? Go home and take care of him.  Your younger sister is getting  married across the country?  Get over there a few days early and help the family get the last minute details finished.  Nobody here is counting days off.  The team trusts that you are getting your work done.

Leadership / Growth:  Our leadership team is very experienced and our org structure is very flat.  The leadership team is not closed-off or intimidating.  They are sitting in the desks right next to us.  They’re there to white board data pipelines and  visualizations with us.  They’ll travel to some customer and prospect on-sites with us.  Because of this we all receive incredibly valuable feedback  and insights from them which is very important for personal and professional growth.

Product: Obviously I’m a little biased since I work here, but I do think that the product the team has built here is in the top of this space.  The speed that this team can onboard a customer successfully, the insights that we can provide immediately, and the impact that we’ve made on many sales and marketing teams show that our product works.  Very grateful that value is being derived from all of our hard work and very proud of the product the team has built.","This is a startup and we definitely face some of the “struggles” that you see at a small, fast-paced company.

We all work a lot, 40 hours a week doesn’t happen here.  Big release happening next week and there are still product bugs?  Your probably spending a few later nights during the week or on Sunday trying to smash them out.  Good news is that you can do this from the comfort of your own couch or if at the office, you have other team members grinding through it with you.  We’re constantly trying to develop an even better product and this comes with continued hard work.  This company does not rest on its laurels."
119,6sense,A place to learn and prosper,2016-06-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The company is solving a technological complex problem which none of the competition is doing and hence we are almost always winning deals. The average deal size is huge compared to the competition. Most of the people here are great work and party with. The team is always energetic and ready to take on the next challenge.,The office is a little crowded not by people but random equipment scattered around. Folks are complaining but it's being taken care of.
120,6sense,The way all workplaces should be --,2016-05-01,5.0,Engineer,Fast paced and growing with a lot of room for personal professional growth;  a sense of community/team effort and support from leadership down/across the board. Everyone's voice counts.,Big customers with equally big demands but manageable in the end -- start up = hard work
121,6sense,engineer,2016-09-28,5.0,Software Engineer,"Great company. I passed the six month mark and I cannot be happier. The product is solid and the company is in the scaling phase, so there are a lot of technical opportunities. The team is awesome and it is a good mix of people. People work hard, but there is a lot of respect for people's personal time, something that i would call rare in a start up which to me translate to more time with my family and the ability of taking some classes after work. With that said, pop out a karaoke machine and you will be partying till the morning after, as people here takes having fun very seriously.

What makes 6sense special though is that the more time i spend here the more i like it, which is the most I can ask. This is probably due to actually feel that i am learning new things as I work and that keeps me interested. 

In terms of culture the company is aspiring to become a family for the employees. That gives me a quite a bit of freedom, which translate to me trying to start a small kitchen program to provide food once a week (or at least i hope). 
Being such a small company (in terms of number of people), makes for a very well connected group of people and makes it easy to have a large impact on the company outcomes.",The only big open space for communal working isn't the best as it is in the middle of the kitchen area. It would be nice to have a space that is enclosed for people to work together while playing music in a social way instead of headphone.
122,6sense,We *Actually* Like Each Other,2019-04-28,5.0,Anonymous,"One of the most common themes is everyone seems to like everyone, which is so refreshing! We're growing quickly and have doubled in size this past year. We have a fun, collaborative culture, and we get things done as a team. It's truly a flat org based on meritocracy. Management team communicates often and with transparency.","Sometimes stretched for resources. Budget due to nature of a startup, but that makes for creative entrepreneurial challenges and opportunities."
123,6sense,Fast paced start-up with the product and team in place to execute on our vision,2018-02-19,5.0,Account Executive,Great culture where everyone is willing to roll-up their sleeves to get things done. Best transparency I've ever experienced at a company from both Leadership and Product... everyone is aligned on our strategy and roadmap so each team understands their role and how they contribute to the overall trajectory of the company.,What you should expect from a company this size around limited resources and formal processes
124,6sense,2 years at 6sense and still loving it,2018-03-23,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Great product, getting better every day. Internal culture that is a mix of family style interaction and self driven attitudes. Flashy new CEO and sales team to drive quick expansion. Mid of a shifting of focus for the company to a new bigger goal. We got Premal as VP.  It is an exciting moment to be at 6sense as the growth we were preparing for is finally arrived and everyone is feeling it. The company is very transparent about everything, and i really mean everything! There is a lot of enthusiasm in sharing information across the different parts of the organization, as every part of the company has so many success stories to share. We have meetings between orgs to make sure everyone knows about the new exciting developments. 

Now some specifics on the engineering team. The team has a good balance of very experienced engs and newer engineers full of energy and self drive. The team has weekly sprint standup to show off progress and depending on the team there are other standups during the week. Our CTO and VP are simply excellent and they are very direct in their communication when things are good and when they are not. The engineer team has very little structure which is good for a young company. We do not have free lunches every day :(, but i tend to prepare lunch many days a week and that is available to anyone that wants it. It is served on a first come first served basis, so you gotta be fast otherwise people goes for second rounds and the food is gone. 

We do have an informal tiki bar in the basement, where we occasionally throw karaoke parties. 

In general if you like the work hard party hard lifestyle, this place might be a match. If you are a person that needs to be at a company that gives you a feeling of empowerment in your day to day work, this is not the place for you, as here there is not time work on  feelings, you are simply empowered and trusted to deliver and push yourself to excellence.","Growth challanges means a lot of work and a lot of personal responsabilily which sometimes feel overwhelming. Even though the eng team is pretty small (sub 20) it moves very fast and it is hard to stay up to date as things change very quickly. Are these really cons? not sure, they are more like challenges.  Adding new talent in the eng team is slow as we keep a high hiring bar, and hiring is simply beyond competitive in the bay area."
125,6sense,"Great product, great people, great place to work",2017-10-19,5.0,Sales,"Product: The product is solid and has clear differentiation from the competition, which was validated by Forrester in their recent wave.  The product team and engineers are all very, very experienced and I'm impressed with how they continue to push out new features and product enhancements.

Leadership: There have been a few new leaders that have joined the company to compliment the leaders that were already here.  I will say that the caliber of leadership that has been brought in and the existing leadership is very, very strong and is setting the course to take 6sense to the next level.  A number of the new leaders have held C-Level positions at other tech companies and have been successful in growing them from small startups to large enterprises with successful exits.  They are also culture people, a lot of fun to be around, very passionate and care deeply about their employees and success of customers.

Culture/People: Culture is huge for a small, high growth company and 6sense.  The team hangs out together and works late together.  Some of the most enjoyable memories are when you're working late into the night on a project and the various teams come together in the common area to work together and talk about what it is that their doing.  The leadership has made a point to build a culture based on Fun, Accountability, Mindfulness, Integrity, Love, Yes, and...","Busting at the seams a bit with the office space, which makes it somewhat noisy at times."
126,6sense,TGIM. The distance between your dreams and reality is called action.,2019-04-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"To paint some color on my headline, I look forward to going to work. As I sit here writing this on a Sunday evening, I'm genuinely excited to go into the office tomorrow. I love Mondays. Seriously. Why? 

I love what I do. I'm seen, heard, acknowledged, appreciated, valued, respected, and know my work makes a difference. No day is the same, each with its unique set of challenges. My contributions are limited only by my imagination - meaning, you're empowered to learn, grow, create and build. 

As many other reviews have mentioned, the people are simply the best. 
We collaborate, innovate, iterate, and accelerate. We deliver. We dominate. 

Words that come to mind to describe our people and our culture include generosity, curiosity, patience,  accountability, ownership, ambition, forgiveness, compassion, empathy,  presence, responsibility, courage, humility, kindness, laughter, and fun. There's cross-functional mingling. We socialize - often times after work and occasionally on weekends - and there's no judgment if that's not your style. We'll continue to invite you. We're inclusive. 

This is a place where you can - if you're proactive, hungry, and willing - to really take ownership of your career and create a role that's truly fulfilling.

“Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.” – Ralph Waldo Emerson","As a smaller company, we're lean and often resource-constrained and stretched. Processes, systems, and hires you might find at larger companies are lacking, to put it mildly. But I've turned what I viewed as cons and outright maddening frustrations at times into opportunities…opportunities to practice patience, resourcefulness, critical thinking, communication, and leadership. 

If your manager or the Executives don't know about something that may not be working for you, they can't fix it. Instead of lamenting with your peers about what ""isn't working"", consider doing something about it - address it, communicate, have a conversation, step up and offer ideas to improve or create solutions. 

One of my favorite aspects of working at 6sense is that ideas are welcomed and encouraged. If you're bold enough to ask or offer suggestions (with execution) - more than once - and follow through, your possibilities for contributing are limitless. Let go of your expectations of how things ""should be"", what you think might happen, or how something might be received. Instead, be BOLD, step up! You, your team, our customers, and 6sense will be all the better for it. 

If you're looking to coast, this probably isn't the place for you. If you've got grit, determination, a desire to contribute, and you embrace the nuances that come with being a part of a startup - check us out."

Continue to learn from my colleagues day in and day out.
Great product that serves a multitude of use cases for our customers.

129,6sense,Highly challenging and highly enjoyable,2019-01-17,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"A highly driven and highly intelligent team across Sales, Marketing, and Product, each of which also somehow manages to be kind and enthusiastic about one another.  This combination of curiosity, ambition and team camaraderie translates to a very strong team culture.","Like any high growth organization, you have to be comfortable pushing boundaries and thinking outside the box.  This can, understandably, be intellectually exhausting on some days... but oh so worth it to know you're having an impact."

131,6sense,Data Scientist,2015-10-19,5.0,,6sense is a great company for data scientists. Predictive analytics is the heart of the company. There is data from many third-party sources and many types of models depending on the project.,"It's very fast-paced and priorities can change quickly. If you want to ""take it easy"" it's not the place for you."
132,6sense,"Fast Growing, Innovative and Collaborative",2019-03-17,5.0,Senior Director,"Fast paced environment, constant change and exciting challenges, small enough that individual effort can make large impacts and we have an amazing product.",Processes don't always keep up with growth and change.  This environment is not for all personality types.
133,6sense,Sales,2017-10-19,5.0,Vice President Sales,"Passionate team, market leading product, and an exciting roadmap ahead. 6sense has been incredible so far for me. I love it here.","Everyone is incredibly busy, which isn't terrible, but in order to be successful we need keep hiring the right talent and scale."

Lots of growth opportunities.","Expect longer hours than similar roles at more established firms, but the work is more inspiring and fulfilling. It's no different than any other start up in this respect."

136,6sense,Caveat emptor & then some,2016-04-29,1.0,,"There is a solid vision, market and paying customers.  Moreover, a handful of very nice people doing their best to execute in a challenging environment (internal drama/politics, hearty/established competition).",CEO is questionable & dominating.  Ego & controlling tendencies make it unlikely she will lead the company to a big growth & a positive exit.  Regrettably great vision is not enough; complex problems are rarely solved with single-threaded leadership.  A typical founder’s folly is a play: unwilling to fully listen or incorporate the broader team’s experience/input.
137,6sense,Business Development Representative,2018-02-07,5.0,Business Development Representative,"The company culture is unique and invigorating.
All employees are very professional and exhibit a strong work ethic.
Very strong team dynamic from top to bottom.",There are no cons I
138,6sense,Avoid for now,2016-05-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Hard working team. The office is close to the CalTrain station.,"Everything mentioned in the other reviews is true. There have been a few poor attempts to address the negative glassdoor reviews, but the office is still dirty, and the CEO is still not a good leader.
The real problem is that  haven't closed any great deals in a long time. We keep coming up with stop gap solutions and try to make them work. We've built a great product, but maybe it's just not yet time for predictive. After a few pretty weak quarters sales-wise, morale is pretty low."
139,6sense,Great company,2017-05-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great product. Smart, positive, energetic staff.",Same growing pains as with all successful start ups.
140,6sense,Crowded space - not a clear company focus,2017-05-30,2.0,Anonymous Employee,The space is growing quickly and the upside can be significant. The platform has a lot of potential.,The executive team at the time (Dec 2015) was not familiar with the space so applying large scale data science logic to marketing data did not translate. The platform created had a lot of potential but the data scientists were not experienced enough to get what was needed out of it.

I think the people are really good at what they do but are on a mission that has no value or truth.,I would rather not be so negative. I will leave it to say that 6sense is not the company I was told it would be or the journey I had hoped it could become.

You can even ping the co founders and they will reach out to you for anything and everything with a smile. 
The HR team in India is very good. Usually in other companies, after you join you will not have any connection/interaction with the HR's. In 6sense, HR team is doing a great job by keeping the vibe alive with a lot of activities and discussions. You can reach out to them for anything and they will take care of it. 
There is no micromanagement. You do your own stuff. 
Company outings and perks are amazing. Employee benefits are top notch.

In most of the companies, you will see customer success/support teams are treated like trash, but not at 6sense! 
- The first thing I observed/really liked about 6sense is the diversity and respecting the individual and not specific teams. 
- Your contribution and identity are considered and valued.
- The HR team/management is approachable, they do care about their employee. The onboarding experience was good. 
- The job role is challenging as the company/team/product is evolving, and there are no processes, you will have to learn from your mistakes and try to create a benchmark/process around it, and this is the best experience I can think of.
- The company is doing well financially, and COVID19 has turned out to be a game-changer in ABM space, we all 6senser can sense where 6sense is heading for the future.

166,6sense,Amazing people and an ocean of opportunity,2021-02-27,5.0,Data Analyst,"It’s a fast growing, fast paced company that enables a ton of opportunity if you can take the initiative and work hard. It is a small, but growing team with some really helpful and smart people. You’ll get to work on startup typical super challenging problems that will for sure tickle the mind and get the juices flowing.","Roughly 2-3 days per week will be long, hours will be odd. But people will be accommodating of your time and personal commitments.
Everyone is quite busy, but always there to help. This may lead to not a lot of oversight and you’ll be expected to own all parts of your work - this might not suit people who don’t prefer working with a high degree of independence"
