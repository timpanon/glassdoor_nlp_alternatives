She brings nothing but the best to the table and I highly recommend her if you want the job done right! I cannot thank her enough for all of her help. I wouldn't be where I am right now if it wasn't for her hard work. She was determined to help me find something that was a great fit and she exceeded my expectations. I have also worked with her during my tenure at MGM and she provided some of the best candidates for the job. Very impressed.",I don’t have anything bad to say about this company!

89,Akraya,One of best staffing companies to work for!,2015-01-20,5.0,Computer Systems Analyst,"This is one of the best companies in the bay area. They go out of their way to make you feel at home. I have had great experience with them. 

Two years ago, I was laid off and was struggling in a tough job market. Akraya took me in and treated me like family. Their recruiters and account managers like Parth and Ekta worked very hard for me.

Their management team has strong leadership. Their Founder Amar, President Sonu and CEO Pankaj have a clear vision for the company and laser-like focus in executing it. Other members of their executive team like Bryan, VP of Accounts, and Keshava, Head of HR, run a flawless operation. They are courteous, punctual and always deliver on their objectives. 

They have regular social events to help make their employees feel at home and everyone genuinely gets along. Akraya is a diverse and young company, in many way she embodies the iconic virtues of an American company. It was founded by immigrants and was made successful by the ingenuity of its employees. The people at Akraya come from many different religious and ethnic backgrounds. Akraya successfully assimilates them and creates a vibrant organization. 

I 100% recommend it.",Lot of work and can be demanding.
90,Akraya,Excellent interview prep,2019-10-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The team did a great job prepping me for the interview by using their understanding of the client and helping prep and focus on the important parts of the job description - a real game changer!,Enrollment involved five different people which felt a bit confusing
91,Akraya,Great Experience,2019-07-11,5.0,Business Analyst,Fast Response to all Queries.,Not getting any at the moment
92,Akraya,Good place to work,2019-10-10,4.0,Account Manager,Freedom to communicate with the management; great team to work for,Benefits are not in par with other companies
93,Akraya,Akraya is OK - typical contracting company from my experience,2015-05-29,4.0,Project Coordinator/Project Manager I,"Akraya is ok as far as contracting companies go, not the best or worse.  They offer health benefits and try to help ensure timesheets and any other documents are submitted on time.  They also have very timely responses for any of your inquiries.","Working at a contracting company can leave you feeling like you are on your own and have to fend for yourself.  They don't always know much about the company they're having you work at, but they are the people designated to tell you about the end of your contract, etc. I did not like that Akraya told me the job they were submitting me for was very close to the city I live in, just to find out that they knew very little about what the company i would be working at was actually looking for (my interview was over an hour away from the city i live in but luckily the company was looking for me to work remotely or in the Cambridge office - i guess thats where the confusion around the location came from).  At the end of the day you are left feeling pretty much like a cash cow and like you are only contacted when they need something from you."
94,Akraya,Tons of Opportunity - Great Place for the Ambitious,2015-01-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I love how much influence a single employee can make in this company. 
It's an incredible start-up culture with the revenues to support innovative change. Management is very receptive to new ideas and even encourages each employee to put their thoughts for change in a Suggestion Box. The company is very transparent and will share all victories and losses with an open ear to how we can improve and sustain our success.
For a person who is incredibly ambitious, this company is the perfect place to apply your energy and watch the fruits of your labor bloom.",This ambitious culture can breed some overworked personnel - including the CEO who is often in the office until way past bedtime.
95,Akraya,Amazing company to work for,2019-04-23,5.0,Client Delivery Manager,"Akraya is a great company to work for, its core value and purpose to give back sets you up for success, it's not only any company who does staffing, Akrayan here is delivering 3X karma to client, candidate and community. It might look I work here so I am writing this, but that's untrue. 
The company truly is one of the nicest to work for, it gives you the right combination of achievable challenge which keeps you enriched and engaged without feeling pressured.","I don't have anything in particular, but some more internal employee benefit will be nice to have. Will be nice to have on premise lunch"

lof of fun times too in form of office picnics, happy hours, bowling and such activities. India ops is very lively from this perspective. company also provides mediclaims are subsidized  rates.","HR could look into improving annual Paid Leaves number by a slight margin. although not a dampener,  this could boost morale and possibly improve attendance ratios if tied up with leave encashment."

Great work-life balance and strong sense of culture!!

I joined Akraya 5 years back and since then I have had great professional experience one could have. Akraya puts trust in its employees and gives a a great career path to its employees and ensures that mutual goal is achieved. It has been a fantastic journey so far. You get the best mentorship in the industry and they ensure that you grow in a direction where it is beneficial to you and and the company. Resource Managers, Recruitment director and VP of account management always make an effort that employees are happy about their work and would always pitch in to help in any matter. 

Recruitment Director and CEO are ""The best"" in the industry and are always welcoming new thoughts, processes and recognizes talent. They trust the decision of subordinates and never micro manage. They are well known in the circle and share as well as implement some of the best practices and processes in the company.  

There have been ups and downs in the company but which company doesnt goes through that. Founder of the company addresses the employees that ""You learn from your mistakes"" so don't hesitate to try new things and puts trust in his employees. Company is very transparent in its approach and in every monthly meeting the revenue for the month and profit/loss is announced. Company recognizes the performers and takes efforts in guiding employees who are not performing well and ensures that right guidance is provided.  Company has the perfect hierarchy in place by keeping best interest of the employees.  

Looking forward to grow with Akraya!!!!","It would be great if company sponsored lunch is provided and more vacation time!! :)
More Flexibility."
