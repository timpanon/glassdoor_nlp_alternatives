89,Akraya,One of best staffing companies to work for!,2015-01-20,5.0,Computer Systems Analyst,"This is one of the best companies in the bay area. They go out of their way to make you feel at home. I have had great experience with them. 

Two years ago, I was laid off and was struggling in a tough job market. Akraya took me in and treated me like family. Their recruiters and account managers like Parth and Ekta worked very hard for me.

Their management team has strong leadership. Their Founder Amar, President Sonu and CEO Pankaj have a clear vision for the company and laser-like focus in executing it. Other members of their executive team like Bryan, VP of Accounts, and Keshava, Head of HR, run a flawless operation. They are courteous, punctual and always deliver on their objectives. 

They have regular social events to help make their employees feel at home and everyone genuinely gets along. Akraya is a diverse and young company, in many way she embodies the iconic virtues of an American company. It was founded by immigrants and was made successful by the ingenuity of its employees. The people at Akraya come from many different religious and ethnic backgrounds. Akraya successfully assimilates them and creates a vibrant organization. 

I 100% recommend it.",Lot of work and can be demanding.
90,Akraya,Excellent interview prep,2019-10-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The team did a great job prepping me for the interview by using their understanding of the client and helping prep and focus on the important parts of the job description - a real game changer!,Enrollment involved five different people which felt a bit confusing
91,Akraya,Great Experience,2019-07-11,5.0,Business Analyst,Fast Response to all Queries.,Not getting any at the moment
92,Akraya,Good place to work,2019-10-10,4.0,Account Manager,Freedom to communicate with the management; great team to work for,Benefits are not in par with other companies
93,Akraya,Akraya is OK - typical contracting company from my experience,2015-05-29,4.0,Project Coordinator/Project Manager I,"Akraya is ok as far as contracting companies go, not the best or worse.  They offer health benefits and try to help ensure timesheets and any other documents are submitted on time.  They also have very timely responses for any of your inquiries.","Working at a contracting company can leave you feeling like you are on your own and have to fend for yourself.  They don't always know much about the company they're having you work at, but they are the people designated to tell you about the end of your contract, etc. I did not like that Akraya told me the job they were submitting me for was very close to the city I live in, just to find out that they knew very little about what the company i would be working at was actually looking for (my interview was over an hour away from the city i live in but luckily the company was looking for me to work remotely or in the Cambridge office - i guess thats where the confusion around the location came from).  At the end of the day you are left feeling pretty much like a cash cow and like you are only contacted when they need something from you."
94,Akraya,Tons of Opportunity - Great Place for the Ambitious,2015-01-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I love how much influence a single employee can make in this company. 
It's an incredible start-up culture with the revenues to support innovative change. Management is very receptive to new ideas and even encourages each employee to put their thoughts for change in a Suggestion Box. The company is very transparent and will share all victories and losses with an open ear to how we can improve and sustain our success.
For a person who is incredibly ambitious, this company is the perfect place to apply your energy and watch the fruits of your labor bloom.",This ambitious culture can breed some overworked personnel - including the CEO who is often in the office until way past bedtime.
95,Akraya,Amazing company to work for,2019-04-23,5.0,Client Delivery Manager,"Akraya is a great company to work for, its core value and purpose to give back sets you up for success, it's not only any company who does staffing, Akrayan here is delivering 3X karma to client, candidate and community. It might look I work here so I am writing this, but that's untrue. 
The company truly is one of the nicest to work for, it gives you the right combination of achievable challenge which keeps you enriched and engaged without feeling pressured.","I don't have anything in particular, but some more internal employee benefit will be nice to have. Will be nice to have on premise lunch"
96,Akraya,best working environment,2015-09-28,5.0,Programmer Analyst,"of all the companies i have worked for in the last decade i find akraya to have the motivating & nurturing environment every recruiter looks for.

lof of fun times too in form of office picnics, happy hours, bowling and such activities. India ops is very lively from this perspective. company also provides mediclaims are subsidized  rates.","HR could look into improving annual Paid Leaves number by a slight margin. although not a dampener,  this could boost morale and possibly improve attendance ratios if tied up with leave encashment."

Great benefits and perks and a fair salary.","Very fast paced industry, requires a lot of multitasking. Akraya is in a state of expansion right now, so the organizational changes can be a little confusing at times."
98,Akraya,"Great place to work, learn and grow, Beyond Amazing !!",2014-10-15,5.0,Resource Manager,"Company where employees come first, takes care of each and every employee!

Super benefits, I just love Pool and Ping-pong table along with free cleaning service, Snacks and parties and much more :)
Leadership team is always available to talk and guide, Open door policy.
Managers show interest in career growth of every individual and work towards achieving it together.
Great work-life balance and strong sense of culture!!

I joined Akraya 5 years back and since then I have had great professional experience one could have. Akraya puts trust in its employees and gives a a great career path to its employees and ensures that mutual goal is achieved. It has been a fantastic journey so far. You get the best mentorship in the industry and they ensure that you grow in a direction where it is beneficial to you and and the company. Resource Managers, Recruitment director and VP of account management always make an effort that employees are happy about their work and would always pitch in to help in any matter. 

Recruitment Director and CEO are ""The best"" in the industry and are always welcoming new thoughts, processes and recognizes talent. They trust the decision of subordinates and never micro manage. They are well known in the circle and share as well as implement some of the best practices and processes in the company.  

There have been ups and downs in the company but which company doesnt goes through that. Founder of the company addresses the employees that ""You learn from your mistakes"" so don't hesitate to try new things and puts trust in his employees. Company is very transparent in its approach and in every monthly meeting the revenue for the month and profit/loss is announced. Company recognizes the performers and takes efforts in guiding employees who are not performing well and ensures that right guidance is provided.  Company has the perfect hierarchy in place by keeping best interest of the employees.  

Looking forward to grow with Akraya!!!!","It would be great if company sponsored lunch is provided and more vacation time!! :)
More Flexibility."

100,Akraya,Akraya - WBW,2019-02-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Akraya's Women Back to Work (WBW) is the one of the best programs for women who are looking to return to work force.  

I have about a total of 11+ years of industry experience and took a maternity break for a couple of years.  When I heard about WBW program, I immediately got in touch with the Akraya team and they helped me out to find an opportunity.

They are very dedicated in helping out women and finding the right opportunity for them.",Nothing at all till now
101,Akraya,Lead,2016-04-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Founders are good people. Senior management in the US for sales and human resources are the best. They know the staffing business very well and you want to work for them. The clients are very good. Co-workers make it a nice environment. Great what the company does for charity.,"Company doesn't change. Off shore management is out of touch. There are favorites that are played. Recruiting is junior level but said to be senior. Account Managers who have been with the company a long time don't do enough and don't care. 

Company is cheap. Pay and commission is too low. Not good tools. Online training is poor. 

Turnover is very high. Leaders change much too often and never know who will be next."
102,Akraya,Stands by Core Values,2019-05-06,5.0,Business Development Manager,"Akraya is a fantastic company to work for!  The company strives for work-life balance, giving back to the community, and always delivering our best.

110,Akraya,Not what I thought it would be,2014-03-17,2.0,,"Housecleaning, nice people, fun parties.","Seems like it's all a rouse. They tell you things in the interview, and make promises they have no intention of keeping. When reminded of what was promised, you get a lot of push back. CEO has stepped down and a new CEO in place who doesn't share the same vision and a lot of the people, including me, who've been here many years feel that all that made it a great company, is now gone."

Net 45 upon receipt of invoice which they would only take monthly (thereby extending the payment terms another 3 weeks).  Late payment of work without any advanced notice.   No proactive communication to contract workers about potential issues.   I was not the only 1099 contractor they have played the game of ""stop paying the contractor"" while continuing to bill and collect money from the client at the contractor's expense."

The Founder & Past CEO laid a solid foundation & the current CEO is carrying a great vision (which not many staffing agency would have).. Not many staffing agency believe in developing their recruiters, not many company see a future Manager in a recruiter BUT Akraya does.. Akraya has a record of developing some fine recruiters who were fresh graduates and now are Resource / Recruitment Managers (Some of them are even settled in the US now – “Thanks to Akraya”). The Management believes in hard work and knows how to reward deserving employees. 

The Management has always provided constructive feedback to the staff ensuring that the organization operates smoothly. Especially with the new group of leaders (headed by a phenomenal Recruitment Director) the company is progressing to achieve new high & they have made sure that leadership development happens at multiple levels within the Organization – Not just below the C-Level.

The company has the required infra, tools, and the team which will only help in getting better. The company goes an extra mile on the employee engagement part and its fun to see a lot of activities happening on frequent basis.",just a bit of fine tuning to the process and policies will give rapid growth.
215,Akraya,"Best place to work ""just in"" US",2015-01-20,3.0,Lead Recruiter,"It used to be one of the top companies in Pune for US recruitment but not now!!!
Flexible WFH that used to happen earlier","To start with there have been strumbles in the managment. Many VP's and directors were hired and let go. No vision for the so called recruiters who develops and takes the company to heights. Cost of insurance that the employee is eligible, premium is cut from the employees salary stating that its a facility from the company. (Most of the employees do not realize this as they have no idea ). No employee relation or employee welfare policies. So called HR is clueless about the things happening in the organization.  No fix policies. Policies change every other day as per the managment's convenience. No fix holiday calender. Day shift director announces holidays as he likes and when he wants it."
216,Akraya,Good only for US based employees,2014-06-24,2.0,Senior Recruiter,Good exposure to staffing industry.,"Only the US office seems to be fun.  India office in neglected like anything. Employees face so many problems but hardly one bothers to address their issues.  Management in day and night shift is pathetic.  There are always some issues with the facility and the concerned person doesn't do the job properly and there is no denying to it.

Ladies washroom is shared by men from other companies... SERIOUSLY!!!  What could be a possible explanation to this?  Why can't men from some different organization use men's washroom.. if they have to use it anyway.

People who want air conditioning are deprived of it and people who do not require or are sensitive towards cold are made to sit under the AC.  What is the logic behind this!  Can someone explain?  The US management visits India twice or maybe thrice a year and some senior people from India management bully their subordinates and ask them not to make any complaints against them.  The management in India is literally dictating the office.  WAKE UP!"
217,Akraya,Excellent so far. Abundance Learning.,2014-12-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It’s been more than 2 months working with Akraya. It was a tough decision to move from Delhi-NCR and relocate to Pune, especially when you have a working spouse and school going child. However, I am happy with my decision now.

Akraya is professionally managed and run by learned folks. I see knowledge flowing everywhere. Our CEO, Direct HR, Director Finance all excellent in their own field and every time I learn something new from them.

Akraya believes in cultivating people and take them to greater heights. I see people contained and happy to continue with fresh energies every day. Real time exchange of information, constant and constructive feedback, proper hierarchies, a perfect healthy atmosphere for someone to shape up their career.

I definitely look forward a steady and long career with Akraya.",It’s too less time to comment on Cons. Haven’t found any yet.
218,Akraya,Worst - Not at all Recommended,2018-02-15,1.0,Team Leader,The only good thing is that they allow you to breathe.,"They make you work like donkey with no recognition but instead you get criticism, the firm is being handled by females which is good that they are creating opportunity for females but there is preference for that as well. Either females must be good looking or they must be ready for anything or everything in return or they must be relatives of someone from management.

And most important those females who are leading this company are empty minded or too stubborn, they can loose business but they will do what they like, they ask you for changes but never implement the changes you suggest in return they will debate on that.

If I have to rate Akraya I would rather ask govt. to shut down just because they are not creating employment instead they are making your profile bad...

There is a long list and if you guys are ready to play with your future or want to know more what else is going inside Akraya please join them or else don't join and not recommend to anyone in your generations.

This is wahat I experinced in my tenure:
Work which cannot be completed in 24 hr but they want to be completed within a shift.
No incentives (Seems like begging them)
No oppourtunity
No Recognitions
They even don't support suggestions.
we  have to limit on Smoke/Bathroom/Medical and many more natural occuring emergency.
Unwanted and useless ,micro management."
219,Akraya,Feeling sad about this company,2014-10-16,1.0,Anonymous,Its a past now. To add pros for Akraya I have to use past tense now there is nothing good to say about this company.,"Akraya definitely need a big change to get its lost charm back. The recent managemnet has ruined the work environment, now everyone is working under pressure to maintain numbers.
Inspite of daily and monthly meetings mangement has introduced weekly meeting couple of moths back which is useless and this show their insecurity and how directionless they are. Inspite of introducing useless policies, please focous on improving healthy and secure environment amoung employee. Identify real talent and promote them, which will motivate others. Now a days lots of favouritism is going on in company which is really a critical situation for any company to grow and obviously for those empoyees which are not part of that favourite community and works very hard. 
I think in recent 1year there are very few good reviews about this company and whichever are there, they are to counter bad ones and given by favourite community people.

Things are definitely not going good. Still lot of time to fix things."
220,Akraya,Tough Fight to Survive,2015-06-16,3.0,Senior Technical Recruiter,"Good Management Support, Immediate action on queries, Remarkable efforts from Directors. Good work is well appreciated. Few teams have good internal bonding. Loads of fun activities. Good people to work with (Except some :)). They welcome you well and give even better farewell. Good hold on few big customers resulting in team performance and keeping recruiters motivated. Happening environment.","Hmm, some Seniors and RM's will reflect lack of knowledge and patience in their work and etiquette. Except 3-4 clients rest all are @ the verge of extinction. Except salary or incentives other work related motivation factors are still untouched. Some recruiters who can do good are not provided with a platform to perform. Administration - Below average. Company is still revolving around same traditional idea of Staffing services and moving slow in other area of growth."

They had good clients with great professional mentors.","Akraya's condition is detoriating day by day. Their all the top notch client has gone, upper management  has all the lethargic people who don't want to work. They have onsite RMs & AMs who all are working from home. They don't do anything apart from comfortably sitting at home & making money. The management is only pressurizing  recruiters who has to work on 3-4 month old position as they are not left with any good client. This is the only reason their good recruiters left the organization."

226,Akraya,Worst recruitment firm....,2017-04-12,2.0,Senior Technical Recruiter,Join this company..... If you love politics and you don't care about your career.,"Here's the big list of cons,rational and unbiased.

1.No growth opportunity : even if you are good performer you will stay where you were (salarywise) 
2.No annual appraisal : yes you heard that right. Do good and get nothing in return. 
3. Politics at its best : Akraya has made its mark for being the political capital.  Company is running on few onsite folks. In a company of less then 100 . You cannot expect more. 
4. Hire and fire
PS: This is no place to work.
Better stay unemployed"

231,Akraya,Team Lead / Resource Manager,2015-06-02,5.0,Lead Recruiter/Resource Manager,I worked for few months with this company and had good experience. I was working remote from Delhi and was very satisfied as the management was supportive. I had to leave because of some personal commitment.,Nothing major that to be chalked.
232,Akraya,Very Partial Company,2015-01-06,1.0,Recruiter,I recently joined Akraya and i don't see any good thing in this company. May be it will take some time too see any good thing as i have joined recently.,Management is partial towards new employees. At the time of joining they will say you that cab facility is only for female employees but after joining i saw that males employees are also using it. I can't understand if you have made policy of using cab for females employees then how come male employees can use. if they are using it then please change your policy and allow cab for every employee. why can't you stick to your policy.
233,Akraya,Great experience,2015-03-18,4.0,Senior IT Recruiter,"A very good workplace for women; no glass ceilings, it is a good platform for women who want to grow as leaders in the staffing industry.
They ensure flexibility in terms of clients, if the recruiter is not comfortable or productive with a particular client, they give flexibility to work with other clients.
There is no hire and fire policy, a recruiter is given maximum opportunity to deliver results.","Infrastructure: Not too bad, but still needs to improve :)"
234,Akraya,Recruiter,2019-05-21,4.0,Recruiter,"Great clients – VMS & Direct both. Structured Team and management. One important thing about working in Akraya is your ideas are put up on the table to discuss and if worth then they get implemented too.  Professional Development – training, Brainstorming, and various workshops are conducted which helped me to grow as an individual. Work Culture is Positive and enteric – you feel like coming to the office every day.","Akraya is still growing big, with that there could be some small cons but nothing noticeable - the process is getting continuously refined."
235,Akraya,Not as good as it once was.,2015-01-21,2.0,Recruitment,"Start-up like environment. Everyone knows you and the doors of C-level folks are always open to you, at least in the US office maybe because only the managers and HR sit onsite, delivery team is offshore. 

There is a lot to learn from your interactions with these folks who have been in the industry for decades.","They don’t do background checks of offshore employees!
They don’t have a proper HR Manager offshore to address employee concerns.
They have policies (not on paper) which are not same for all employees. They give work from home to some employees as they like; they change your teams without even asking you. Policies should not have exceptions.

You (employee) like me - I (mgmt) like you.
Make us look good (likes, shares, reviews - as told by marketing) – You are loyal, I see potential in you.
You complain, I don’t hear you. You raise your voice, I don’t know you. You disobey and tell us we are doing it wrong, you’re not our friend anymore! 

It is a mutual admiration society. As long as you don’t bring up anything negative about them and keep telling them they are the best, you will be considered a loyal employee. Even if your peers and team members think you are not good, you will be praised by mgmt. as long as you suck it up to them.

They (management) are set up for failure. They've been experimenting since the last few years and have got it wrong every year. Every year, there are major changes in leadership. Not one (maybe, one) C-level/VP has stayed for more than a year. If the leadership is so weak, think how rest of it will be.

They have lost some of their good recruiters and sales due to the micro-management, strict and biased policies they've been trying to implement. They let this happen to an extent where some of the existing employees realized that the company couldn't afford to let them go anymore due to the high attrition and made good use of the opportunity to get what they wanted, which is fine because a lot of the employees (not mgmt. level)  are under-paid compared to the market standards.

Management on the Recruiting side is really unfair and cannot manage efficiently. Their decisions are often blinded and in favor of their favorite people. If you’re one of the favorites, they’ll bend the rules for you. You come before rest of their team as long as you are a favorite. 

The management seems to be only interested in the growth of employees who are profitable. Others don’t even get an opportunity to grow.

They have Recruiters, then Team Leads to manage the recruiters, then Resource Managers to manage the TLs and Recruiters. And on top of that, they have Recruiting Directors & Account Managers to manage the RMs and their teams. The poor VPs have to spend more time in managing the AMs rather than working on strategies. And everyone has a different management style, it is too much structure and chaos for a company their size."
236,Akraya,Sr. Recruiter,2018-05-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Akraya… Akraya… what has happened to you ☹

It is true you cannot always read someone’s mind, but I fail to understand how in the world are you so successful in taking gigantic wrong decisions?

Its simple analysis, the average recruiter you hire has 4 years of recruitment experience and that’s post his graduation (do the math yourself). And to manage them, whom did you hire? Someone who has lesser experience than the recruiters and doesn’t come with a strong educational background?

You built this world class company (statement from the President of the company) but it seems you forgot how you reached here. Whom do you entrust the responsibility to run the show, a novice?","You had (and I believe you still have) a very strong recruitment structure in place, what was the need for trying to adopt a RPO module. Have you forgotten that you are staffing firm and not an RPO?

Fundamentals like – hiring process, building strategies, setting up a health environment etc are way too different in a BPO / RPO.

You ought to have a strong Recruitment Leader instead of just adding another HR and Ops person.  Who can guide those individuals and in whom they can trust that he will develop them to become better professionals. Not someone who will play some gimmicks and then fade away..

In the past when someone joined Akraya, they had the assurance that you will come out becoming better recruiters and better professionals. What now???

It doesn’t matter me today coz I have seen the best of Akraya, we build this company and I felt proud when people spoke good about Akraya.. But I am sad today to see you in this condition.. Please do not forget your foundation, don’t make your pillars weak.. As a leader your responsibility is to keep strengthening them so that your foundation remains strong or else someday they will also walk away from you!"
