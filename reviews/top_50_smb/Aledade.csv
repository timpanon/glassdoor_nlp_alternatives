0,Aledade,Fantastic place to work!,2022-03-28,5.0,Executive Director,Aledade has some of the smartest people I have ever had the privilege to work with. Everyone I have come in contact with is quick to share their insights and knowledge with me to help me succeed in my role.,"As a growing company, change will be a constant through the next few years. If you don't work well in an environment full of change, then Aledade probably isn't the right fit for you."
1,Aledade,Overall great company.,2021-10-29,5.0,Senior Analyst,"You work with some of the most passionate people you’ve ever met and everyone is open to making sure you can do your job well. It’s a very great culture. Most of middle management is very open to helping newer in career people get the types of experience that they want, assigning projects that are interesting and manageable, but still challenging to help you grow. It’s a challenging but very engaging and supportive working environment. Pretty decent benefits and an great PTO offerings. Work-life balance is also great. Work definitely can come in waves, but overall, it seems most people, especially the analysts, have manageable workloads. The flexibility is also a nice benefit. It’s a highly remote company and it’s always okay if you need to log-in early or late or step away from your computer. Most of management recognizes life happens and we are all still human.","The biggest con I have witnessed is pay. Pay is not as competitive as anticipated, and although I have not gone through an annual review for pay increases, I have heard from multiple people that the structure and increases that are offered leave a lot to be wanted. There are a lot of growing pains of shifting from start-up to being an established company, but I find it a fun part of the job. In addition to this, it seems pretty hard, especially for analysts, to rise in the ranks. They have a career track from analyst to senior analyst, but don’t really tell you what comes after senior analyst and it appears very uncommon that senior analysts get promoted after that into higher roles."

I love the incredible diversity and inclusion I find in my every day work and on my team and believe in the work I am doing.",I do not currently have any cons.

3. company's culture is about contribution to society","as as young company, some of the processes are being scaled and / or standardized. This is a minor issue."

13,Aledade,A place where making a difference isn't an empty phrase,2021-12-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people, benefits, support, training, provided tools, diversity, work/life balance (it's not just words here), and more. The onboarding was spot on and educational. There is a true spirit of camaraderie everywhere. The Aledade Nation extends all over the country and across many different specialties. Each team works together to meet the main goal of changing healthcare in America for the betterment of people.",Honestly? The only complaint that I could think of is that my company MacBook Pro doesn't support more than two external monitors. Yep. That's literally the worst part.
14,Aledade,Review,2022-02-28,3.0,Fellow,Fast paced interesting industry-changing work,Unorganized and hard to get promoted
15,Aledade,Wish I had loved it…but I didn’t,2021-12-01,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great mission 
Fun, down to earth CEO","I really really wanted to love it here based on all the Glassdoor reviews. HR asks new folks to review Aledade on Glassdoor within the first couple weeks of joining, so you are seeing a lot of reviews from employees who have been at the company for just a few weeks. I found that to be really odd as I don’t even review appliances on Amazon after such little time! I would take these reviews with a grain of salt and ask a lot of questions of your team during the interview process. I was warned during my interviews about a lot of drawbacks of joining the company/specific team and I wish I had listened more to those warnings. 

- I would say the number one issue for this company is that there are a lot of really inexperienced people from top to bottom. You scratch your head a lot of times as to how certain people are in the positions they are in. There doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason to titles/salaries/promotions. The company would be much more efficient with the right people in the right roles.
- If you’ve worked at a startup previously you may be disappointed in the culture here and the product (not design-centric). 
- Being a mostly remote company, I felt like there could have been a lot more thought into making new remote folks feel like they are a part of the company. Company onboarding consisted of watching uninspiring videos for days upon days and team onboarding was not thought through/chaotic. The whole experience made me feel really disconnected from the company. 
- I agree with other reviewers that if you speak up about how things can be improved you may not love the treatment you get afterwards or be prepared for it to be completely ignored (one or the other). Fellow employees also told me they didn’t even feel comfortable being honest during the anonymous yearly company survey.  It’s all a shame as the mission and vision are really wonderful. 

I really wanted to love it here…even like it. I wish I had not had the experience that I did here."
16,Aledade,Great place to work,2022-01-05,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Culture, work life balance, benefits","Fast growing company, salary is on the lower end but profit sharing and other remote aspect make up for it"
17,Aledade,Awesome Place to Work,2021-11-10,5.0,Practice Transformation Specialist,"Amazing benefits, incredible work culture, and an endless amount of resources. This is a company that is very open to change and improvements. They definitely make you feel like you're apart of the change and an essential asset to the company. They salary matched for my job but I would have taken a pay cut if I had to work for this company. They also really emphasize work/life balance.","Some growing pains from continual growth, but nothing that's overly stressful."
18,Aledade,Genuinely the best job I've ever had,2021-10-13,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Note that all of these points are from the perspective of Engineering, and may not apply to other departments.
- Phenomenal work-life balance. I hardly ever work over 40 hours, on call time is minimal and fairly rotated, and after-hours incidents are rare.
- 100% remote if you want to be, for most roles. The company has always promoted remote work where possible and our remote tooling, VPN, cloud, etc. are excellent.
- Job is exactly as was described in the interview. No bait-and-switch with unexpected roles/responsibilities.
- We _know for a fact_ the code we ship does good work for society, often saving patients' lives.
- Our tech stack is modern, and the company is willing to spend money on good tooling if it gets the job done better.
- Management is knowledgeable, setting a course but letting us determine how to execute it. Very little micro-managing.
- Company culture is friendly, welcoming, and rewarding. Hard work and major contributions are recognized and shared with the whole company. The CEO will know you by name.
- The company at least tries to care about social issues and under-representation in tech roles. In particular, we have many women in director roles, something that was rare at my old jobs.
- Compensation is competitive.
- The company's financial future looks solid.
- I haven't even considered looking for a new job since starting.","- While the company tries to recruit under-represented people for tech roles, we still could do better. As we're rapidly scaling, we should be hiring more women and ethnic minorities, but I haven't seen representation improve in the several years I've been here..
- When I started a few years ago, the company had about 100 people, about 20 of them in Engineering. We're now at something like 600 people, and still growing. Growth and scaling are good; I just worry the company culture might change with our success. I sure hope it doesn't."
19,Aledade,Don’t be fooled. It was never really a great place to work.,2021-12-20,1.0,Unappreciated Undervalued Employee,Remote workforce gives SOME work-life balance if your boss isn’t a micromanager with something to prove (using your time and hard work of course)!,"Where to start. I worked at Aledade for many years and thought I had finally found a home there. The mission was great, the people were friendly, the owners seemed to care about you. It wasn’t until my original boss left that I finally saw this company for what it is, a bunch of overpaid execs with their heads up their behinds who ride on the backs and brains of their very underpaid employees (from Analysts to Directors). I was blessed with an amazing manager for the first couple of years, which makes all the difference at Aledade. However, they are few and far between these days, as they hire more and more external candidates for leadership positions, who don’t really subscribe to the culture, as it was. Noting that they went from overly promoting from within (many times at a fault) to no longer giving anyone a chance to grow here. The company will take what it needs from you but you can forget about anyone taking your advice to improve anything. I found it funny when people would pitch the same ideas I’ve been trying to push through for years, like “how about a demo site of our product for our clients to practice on or our teams to be able to train others to?” A simple and obvious ask for a company who built and maintains their own product. Yet, it still does not exist today. Instead the product team spends the majority of the year fixing bugs and doing whatever leadership wants, like adding new features that no one asked for and will probably never use. The one thing they put the most amount of effort in at Aledade is the most underused by our clients, because it cannot be integrated with an EHR. The most frustrating part is that they will do pretty much anything leadership wants even when it’s clearly an idea that wasn’t well thought out or even necessary, yet they have the entire organization rallying behind it to make it fly (looking at you, CMO with your Practice Model Redesign). It’s maddening!!

Their entire operating model is broken beyond belief. So much so that they actually created a new team called the Operating Model team (how unique 😏) to fix it. However, there is no urgency to fix major systematic issues, despite the amount of work-around’s people have to create just to get their job done. There is no compassion for the amount of extra and sometimes impossible work that employees have to endure, simply because other teams won’t fix the problem identified, even when they are presented with a solution. They’re literally given the answer and still don’t do anything.  Accountability is selective. There are some teams who are asked to do the impossible and others who are allowed to pick and choose what they say yes/no to. 

Leadership is a joke. They are tone-deaf to pretty much everything, yet will get up at all-staff and lie to your face about all that they are doing for you because they “care”. Pretty sure that the compensation review that was supposed to raise the salaries of underpaid employees (yes, they knew damn well they underpaid almost everyone) never happened. Also, beware of ‘tiny tears’ moments, where the owner will cry on camera at all-staff…..he’s a sensitive guy when it suits him…but let it be known he only cares about a select few in the organization. You will learn who that is very quickly. Everything else from him is just an act!

It’s also important to keep in mind that this is a company seeking to go public. It’s all about the aesthetics right now. Meaning, you would be no more valued than a bowl of wax fruit on a staged table. The mission is no longer what it was. The mission is to make the owners and stakeholders rich! I say, spare yourself the cult-like atmosphere of this place and find a company that will actually respect you and your expertise. They don’t do that here. I have seen too many talented people leave because of it. Getting out was a matter of protecting my mental health. Nobody should have to endure that."
20,Aledade,Exciting high growth company with an amazing culture and mission.,2021-11-25,5.0,Executive Director,"Great leadership, culture, mission, incentives are well aligned. Great bonuses tied directly to shared savings. Amazing benefits including fully paid maternity and paternity leave.","Late stage startup in process of scaling, not all processes are fully standardized or optimized, but moving rapidly in that direction."

22,Aledade,"Smart people, good mission",2021-12-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Amazing teammates building products that really make a difference.,Expectations are high (maybe not a con)
23,Aledade,"If you work in Product or Engineering, run away as fast as you can",2021-10-19,1.0,Product Manager,The company has a great mission. Flexibility / Remote,"Don't believe the happy talk you see on the website or on Glassdoor. Aledade is a services company - the technology mainly exists to convince credulous investors to value them as a software company (on revenue) instead of as a services company (on EBITDA) . The application and related systems have almost no effect on outcomes, primarily because they are little used. Worse, Aledade is an ""emperor has no clothes"" environment in which everyone knows that there are problems but no one dares speak up. The product team is a classic feature factory with no idea why it is building something or what outcomes it is driving. Bottom line, if you are good at product or engineering you can do WAY better and still work for a mission driven organization."
24,Aledade,Amazing company,2021-11-30,5.0,Pts,"Incredible company with strong values, it's an incredibly ethical place to work.","So far, I haven't come across anything negative about the company. I also haven't met anyone who's had anything negative to say."
25,Aledade,Great engineering team and company mission,2021-05-12,5.0,Tech Lead,"The engineering team is great. Engineers are all fabulous to work with, and we continue to hire really great people even as we ramp up the hiring.

Engineers work very tightly as small teams, 100% remote, and communication is generally really good within teams. The meeting load isn't bad for individual engineers.

The general company mission is inspiring, too. The company's focus very clearly is on helping patients and doctors, and that focus comes very consistently from top-level leadership.

Fabulous work/life balance. I've only been pressured to work extra hours in emergency situations, and in those cases, I've been given time off to compensate.","The cons are mostly pretty typical scaling issues. We're seeing progress on all of these, but still worth a mention.

* top-down roadmapping that leaves teams without much ownership
* lack of architectural vision to meet scaling expectations
* cross-team communication as we the number of small teams grow
* engineering management is a getting overwhelmed by the growth"

Benefits are great by US standards
Salary is exceptional
Workplace is remote-first, and there are numerous resources and groups to help you integrate with the team.
Hours are very flexible.
And of course, the mission is commendable.","There's a lot of meetings. While many are marked as optional, it feels weird to not attend - at least for new hires.
While hours are flexible, and partly because of all the meetings, I always feel like I need to put in more hours and I probably need to.
We're in the middle of updating the code base, which is a bit awkward for new hires to jump into."

Cares about employees and their professional development, but also cares about their personal lives. Highly collaborative cross-team approach. Strong management team. Flexible and understanding. Very competitive benefits and compensation.","Remote nature makes it harder to ""mesh"" in the company. No ""social"" engagement or ""happy hour"" type of events for teams, even during onboarding. Lack of a structure in some teams makes it harder to learn the resources, what is available, who to talk to, etc."
31,Aledade,Wouldn't recommend,2021-12-20,2.0,RN Care Manager,Alidade offers a different environment than the typical healthcare setting since it is a startup,There seems to be a significant gender gap in this company. Wouldn't recommend.

I don’t consider that a con, especially since team members are cognizant of the need and working towards solutions."

40,Aledade,Used to be great,2021-08-16,3.0,Vice President,Aledade is doing great work and there was a great passion for the work across the organization. At times colleagues were supportive.,"Somewhere in the journey, they lost their soul. As a small company, there was an all oars in the water mentality but with growth came the middle managers who were more about striking fear in the hearts of their charges such that many Aledade employees worry about their job security every day. It is an expectation to be underpaid and worried about your future if you work here. You should consider yourself blessed to be able to work here. Not really my jam."
41,Aledade,Exciting work,2021-05-23,5.0,Software Development Engineer,"Dynamic team with smart people
You can tell people here (at least people I encountered) enjoy what they’re doing.
Product is built upon a mission in mind (better healthcare), thus you always feel your work is meaningful 
Professional development time

People receive recognition for the work they’ve done (small or large)
Team is split into small teams of engineers to concentrate on specific domains
Definitely fast-paced","Quite above average number of meetings (although some are optional, but like others said, you don’t want to miss out on important discussions)
Codebase needs cleanup, and we’re in the middle of cleaning it up with transitioning to new technologies

Leadership is inspiring, and the commitment to our values and mission is genuine. I've enjoyed working with my team and it feels good to know our work helps people. The company listens to feedback from its employees and clients and strives for continuous improvement.","Long hours, difficult work (could be a pro, if that's how you're wired), and it can be frustrating having to switch gears to new priorities repeatedly. I will say the company does actively work to address issues that come up and sometimes the need to ""pivot"" is real and it's just the way it goes sometimes."

I'm continuously surprised how genuinely happy every person is at the organization, especially those who have been a part of the team for a long time. Everyone is mission driven, inclusive, and it's wonderful to see the direct benefits of the work we do on a continuous basis. The way we work seems to be a giant conversation with every voice heard, an intellectual discussion, and we don't cut corners. The interview process was as pleasant as one could ask, with timely decisions and appropriate questions based on the role. The work/life balance is respected and prioritized.","A majority of the team is remote even when it's not covid time, so I'll likely never meet a lot of the colleagues in person."

54,Aledade,Life-changing Company,2020-06-16,5.0,BI Data Analyst,"Aledade is at the forefront of a movement that is changing how we as a nation approach medical care, and is doing so by bringing together the greatest group of innovative and driven folks I have ever had the pleasure of working with.

Aledade is a very, very flexible workplace where work/life balance isn't some flimsy notion people joke about - instead it is celebrated and encouraged. Upper management understands that an energized and appreciated-as-humans workforce can climb any mountain, together.

As an analyst, it is very easy to silo yourself in a world of code and visualizations, but Aledade truly shines in the fact that analysts are relied upon to participate in the creation of goals, help drive success by developing tools to meet them, and afterwards are publicly appreciated for their expertise and vision - something that didn't happen whatsoever in other companies I have been with.

Final thing - Aledade understands having the best people for the job means being remote-work friendly. Aledade views remote work as a normal part of life, not some novel fad or something to be endured but disliked and is therefore embraced from the CEO down. Accommodating its employees to be their best self first for their own well-being and then for the company is Aledade's bread and butter and they make that bread and butter very, very well.",None. Aledade is an absolute breath of fresh air. I will retire from Aledade - it has been truly life-changing and I am proud to call myself an employee.

56,Aledade,"A mixed bag of driven people, decent projects, dubious pay, and oppressive social networks",2021-05-08,3.0,Analyst,"-Small company feel overall. You meet the CEO on your first day and you may even have meetings with him or other high level employees, regardless of your level
-Fast-moving and challenging. If you like challenges and delivering much-needed solutions to problems, Aledade delivers
-If you need something to do your job, you get it. You don't have to go through annoying approval processes and fill out endless forms. Tell your manager you need something and you get it
-Strong community. If you like the idea of your colleagues being an extended family, advancing social causes, and feeling part of something bigger, Aledade does that
-Very flexible. Do you need to sign on a little late or leave early? Do you want to work from home forever? Need to take a meeting in the car while driving your mom to the airport? No problem
-Stock purchase program. Probably not the best stock purchase program out there, but the fact that it's offered is a big plus","-Pay. Raises are pitiful to the point that you'll be embarrassed to tell your family you got one. Multiply that exponentially when you receive a raise as part of a promotion. Promotions should feel like a trampoline, not a staircase. More responsibility and increased expectations for a raise that doesn't feel at all rewarding. And they pat themselves on the back for this, despite the complaints
-Similar to the above, but the company is clearly getting their ducks in a row for a sale or maybe even an IPO. They are corporatizing more and more everyday and keeping salaries tightly banded, clearly trying to look like the prettiest health tech company on the sale block next year. This makes them completely out of touch with the needs and wants of the people who are making their company worth buying 
-A bunch of echo chambers within an echo chamber. You will get bludgeoned in company meetings, emails, and chatrooms with cult-like fanaticism for the company and various sociopolitical causes, making you feel out of place, even if you casually agree with a lot of it. If you like competing to see who can be the most woke or have the most irrational devotion to anything the company says or does, Aledade delivers.
-Fast-moving and challenging. If you like to clock in at 9, take a 1 hour lunch at 12, and punch out at 5:30, Aledade is not for you. You will work a lot and work hard
-Really weird team structures. If you're used to traditional team structures and hierarchies, you will be left scratching your head
-Ultimately just another soul-sucking company that cleverly disguises itself as caring for its people above all else"
57,Aledade,Great interviewing and onboarding process,2021-07-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Passionate, mission-driven organization. Interview process was clear and efficient. Remote onboarding has been a good experience as well.",None so far that I can tell.
58,Aledade,Every Team Member is Important,2021-04-30,5.0,Practice Transformation Specialist,The culture of this organization is most impressive. The leadership approaches each challenge as a team and everyone contributes. Most importantly everyone is considered and valued. The workforce is very diverse and innovative. We are doing great work and the growth of this company reflects that.,"Growing super fast, so some aspects of the hiring/training process require a little patience. They are working at process improvement, but that can take time."
59,Aledade,"Great people, great mission, mixed bag of other stuff",2021-05-11,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"You'll work with a bunch of really empathetic and kind people dedicated to making the American healthcare system better.

Work-life balance is respected, and the company has a mature remote work culture.

As an engineer, you'll have no problems getting the tools needed to do your job, and middle management is pretty good at taking care of us and helping us get better at our jobs and advancing. Internal promotions happen often, and you can really grow here as an engineer.

Despite any cons, the company is successful, and will be in for an interesting ride over the next few years.","Life on a product-facing engineering team can be tough. You'll be told your team has areas you're responsible for, but there's a good chance you'll be bouncing around from project to project every few months, with little to no time given to dig into and really own a feature or a domain.

And those projects you were told to work on? They're rarely well-scoped, the outcomes are almost never data-driven and the problems rarely well-defined, and by the time you and your team understand what you're doing, it'll be time to slap together something real quick, and move on to the next thing. As a product engineer, you'll have little to no input as to what your team works on, but you'll be held accountable for anything that doesn't go right, even as your stakeholders seem to face no consequences for delivering a barely-baked idea. There also isn't a ton of innovation happening in the product engineering space, and leadership can be resistant to change, even if it brings improvement (or brings the software in line with modern technical standards).

Benefits are starting to feel skimpy, especially if you're in a major metro area. The company still has no sick leave, the education benefit is small and hard to use, and HR seems totally out of touch (to the point where they just implemented a new, god-awful PTO and payroll management system with zero feedback from employees). 

Salary is lower than what you'll make at similarly-sized and ""tech-y"" companies.

Despite a lot of talk, engineering leadership has totally failed to make any real inroads at hiring a more diverse team."

The flexibility of working here is also unbeatable from anywhere else I have been or heard about.,This company does not care about employee retention - they only care about upper level executives staying within the company. Promotions are not standardized whatsoever and HR is absolutely unreachable when a problem occurs. HR will actually avoid answering your messages. They do not pay nearly enough for how much work we do and there is no overtime even though 90% of employees are working much more than 40 hours a week.

- Career growth opportunities are abound in terms of experience and learning, but opportunities for formal promotion are limited due to the size of the company; ~300 people.  If a title is more important to you then what you are doing day to day, this might not be a good fit."

Mission-driven company, from leadership and top management all the way down through the rest of the organization
A fast-growing company, and one that is keeping a close eye on maintaining the same culture and values it had when it was a younger startup
A results-oriented workplace that sets a high bar for performance but also respects work-life balance","Colleagues can be spread across the country, so it can sometimes take more effort to check-in with your coworkers (and going to the all-staff retreat is essential)

109,Aledade,A hard job but a good job,2019-05-20,5.0,Medical Director,"This is overall a very good place to work. For a company working to succeed in a relatively short period of time, it can be intense at times. I work hours more every week at this job than I have at prior jobs, but I really appreciate the control I have over my own schedule; as long as the large volume of work gets done, no one ever questions me if I leave early some days to go watch a school play or a kid's soccer game. I also don't mind the long days, because it's interesting work, and what we are trying to accomplish feels like it matters. The benefits are good, I like my co-workers and people generally treat each very well.","Changing health care is not easy, and working here requires independent thought and the ability to take initiative; just showing up is not enough. This has been a surprise to some (now former) employees.   

The company is still working to build processes, so not everything has the system in place that it should, and getting initiatives moved forward often hits bottlenecks and leads to frustration."
110,Aledade,Great small company with a mission,2018-01-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"For a small company they have great benefits and pay. Leadership presents a clear path to business success and growth during all hands meetings and seems very transparent with the employees about company growth, revenue and profit, funding, etc. Since the teams are small, everyone has a voice and opportunity to make a large impact on the business. They are remote-friendly for many positions and offer lots of other benefits for on-site employees like gym access and commuter benefits. There is definitely a drive to deliver and work hard, but the company culture is very calm and balanced in terms of expected hours and work-life balance. Generous PTO and family leave, especially for a small company.",No different from most small companies...it feels like there could be potential to lose sight of long term product improvements that are needed because teams can sometimes get consumed by focusing on short term requests. Continuing to drive improvements to the technology back end and overall product experience will be key to supporting the behavioral shift they are assisting with in the healthcare industry.
111,Aledade,Love this company and it's mission!,2019-05-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I love this company. I love the mission and the work I get to do each day to improve the lives and outcomes of the people that are served through our partner practices. I work in the field and find the environment challenging but energizing. I love the tough problems and am granted the autonomy to work on solutions. The teams communicate well across different areas of the company if you're willing to reach out to those that you don't normally interact with day to day.,"Working in the field can feel a bit ""alone"" at times as a large portion of the company is remote. We do lots of video conferences and chats but not being in person with other team members can feel like a challenge. But also - I get to work a lot from home - so it's not really a ""con""."
112,Aledade,"Innovative organization, caring leaders, inspired and empowered team",2019-05-20,5.0,Executive Director,"Overall, my passion for healthcare has been renewed because of Aledade. I chose healthcare administration as a career field because I can ""do good"" in helping people within the healthcare system while not having the aptitude or drive to become a clinician. Spending many years in hospitals and with payors, I'd become jaded in my outlook for what healthcare can do, and was simply a cog in the wheel of the machine. Aledade allowed me the opportunity to do good for others while  thriving in my career. I love being an Aledader, and I would recommend this fine organization to anyone.

Here are some of the pros of working at Aledade
- nimble organization, can make and implement decisions fast
- strong and caring leadership team
- vision toward future success
- defined and shared culture
- innovative company
- competitive pay
- work/life balance
- development opportunities",- the growing pains of a startup tech heavy company can lead to burnout if not managed
113,Aledade,"No formal training, vague expectations",2019-05-21,3.0,Fellow,"It's a flexible work environment and it's a great place to learn about healthcare and feel inspired in the mission.  A lot of responsibility is given to employees and with that, opportunity. It seems that this is a great place to work for those with graduate level training or degrees.","With lots of responsibility, come almost no training and resources to actually complete a job in a timely manner. Busy managers can't make more time in their schedules to guide the entry level fellows they chose to hire. If you are a standout employee who came to the company with certain technical skills already, then merely show these off to those in power and you'll be blessed and Aledade will once more be a great place to work. For the rest of us, put in those long hours (or scramble to find more work) for a meager salary and hope that you come a little closer to fulfilling some career goals. Their new HR Dept. is trying to foment some company enthusiasm, so you'll see these reviews popping up now from otherwise happy employees, just know that there exists some unhappy ones too."

Young employees are given an immense amount of responsibility which can facilitate career and skill growth if you seize these opportunities.","The company still lacks many processes to support making decisions and completing projects. As a younger employee this is often frustrating when you want to see a project through. We are encouraged to ""own"" our work but then when we do the resources are often not available, which is confusing and difficult."

119,Aledade,"Great Image, Poor Leadership and Values",2018-01-21,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Fun environment, the company tries to embody a West-Coast start-up culture with a public policy twist. Very ambitious growth strategy. There are many very strong conceptual thinkers and the technology solutions being developed are very modern in design and functionality.","The issues with Aledade stem from the hubris of the leadership team.  Farzad, is more a marketing icon and is tangentially involved in a few parts of the company but does not comprehend the daily challenges of staff. In fact company survey results are skewed/manipulated to show that the company has a positive atmosphere which anyone who has been there for more than 6 months can attest to being erroneous. The manipulation of data to serve Aledade's whatever intended purpose is very common. I would highly discourage any external parties to accept any data that Aledade reports at face value.  Employee's are at the whim of legal gray areas, although employee's may be explained one thing during the hiring process, reimbursement is slow and legal language may also be reinterpreted at a later time. If you're considering a field/operations position understand that you will be working an average of 70+hours per week, with little to no credit for accomplishments. If you're considering an engineering/analytics position be prepared that your projects will suffer from several iterations of  new requirements during development. Projects are rarely completed on time and products also have a very low rate of successful deployment. Features requested may never be used. Many solutions suggested by the engineers and supported by the field teams are stuck down by the operations leadership team.

I encourage potential candidates, investors, and partners, whom may be reading this with skepticism, to consider my claims in context with information that is available publicly about Aledade. Aledade took 2 years to make savings in  any of their ACOs, neither amount of savings was exceptional. Aledade has received several rounds of investment at the same capital level, ($20-30 million) with very few new investors in any of those rounds. High staff turnover rate, this information may be difficult to come by but is a strong external indicator."
