0,Apeel Sciences,Great Company,2022-03-29,5.0,Senior Product Manager,Fantastic mission based company. Culture is important and employee focused.,It's a start-up so there's a lot of hours to put into the job.
1,Apeel Sciences,"Great People, Rapid Growth, Constant Change",2022-03-25,5.0,Manager,"* Impressive people throughout the company
* Great products & strong IP
* Big opportunities ahead for those willing to dive in
* Work feels important and urgent","* Scale and pace of change can be overwhelming for new employees
* Women underrepresented in top leadership roles
* Total comp is below market and not keeping up with inflation"
2,Apeel Sciences,"Great company, but if you're in the field, you barely work with them.",2022-02-24,4.0,Former Employee,"The benefits were very good.
Most coworkers were a pleasure to work with and really driven to eliminate food waste. It was easy to reach out to people, and if you had an idea that was low cost, you could normally execute it.","Getting support from corporate was difficult.
Communication channels were very poor.
The all company meetings started to turn into a sales circlejerk, but the sales department was the least pleasurable department to work with, because they didn't respect the field employees.
The company has shifted to focus on revenue growth, without improving the current operating structure. 
There is a lack of career opportunities available, as outside hires are typically preferred, and they encourage you to mtake your own opportunities without a title change.
The field employees are very stressed, because the suppliers expect perfection, but as a startup, that isn't possible.
Things are very political, and if you can't get in front of the right people, you probably won't be recognized."
3,Apeel Sciences,"Ok, but no upward movement if you're not in the click",2022-03-29,2.0,Technical Lead TFS,"Great pay, good benefits, flexible schedule","Was promised advancement opportunities that never materialized, If you are not in the ""California click"" you have no chance of advancement"
4,Apeel Sciences,Travel in Apeel,2022-02-14,5.0,Supervisor,"With locations in Europe, South America, and North America the company offers plenty of locations for employees to travel. Although travel isn't always guaranteed travel is usually offered to those who want it.",Traveling positions require dedicated individuals who are able to travel at a short notice. This can make it difficult to plan for things in advance.
5,Apeel Sciences,Great place to work for the right person!,2022-02-10,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Smart, fun, passionate coworkers.
Great mission & great product you can feel good about.
Benefits are great. 
Hybrid work for those near HQ and remote for a lot of positions.
Start-up with lots of potential.","Pay is relatively low. Biggest con is the pace of career growth. 
Very culty. I imagine a lot of mission driven companies are like this, but that’s a con for me. 
Senior management/executives hyper focused on revenue. Hoping they find a balance in years to come."
6,Apeel Sciences,Mission Driven,2022-01-05,5.0,Accounts Payable Coordinator,"My immediate team is interested in continually improving their processes and being efficient.
The benefits and compensation are good and the company’s mission is easy to get behind. 
They are also proactive in communicating and abiding by public health guidelines with most staff able to WFH. 

Taking PTO is encouraged, especially around the holidays and it’s a nice example of wellness focused culture!","There is a lot of change and growth to get used to. Not a personal con of mine, but understandably, it can be difficult to break work habits."
7,Apeel Sciences,"Good product, fulfilling mission, lacking execution",2022-01-27,4.0,Senior Manager,"- Supporting the sustainability revolution in produce, with the potential to make a big environmental impact.
- Great colleagues who are willing to help each other (mostly).
- Really exciting industry with lots of potential.","- Goals and results often don't meet, mainly due to the inability for the company to reinvent itself and gain traction in important areas.
- Pay is out of line with the market. Must be willing to dedicate yourself to the mission at the expense of market rate pay."

10,Apeel Sciences,Working for Apeel Sciences,2022-01-26,4.0,Technical Field Specialist,"Apeel is an amazing company to work for! They have a mission to increase the shelf life of fruits and other produce which will cut the amount of waste and feed more people. I hate the thought of people going hungry, so its an awesome experience to be a part of whats hopefully a cure to that problem!",Apeel is growing at such a rate that communication and training can be spread out across several channels making it very difficult to stay up to par. We as TFS in the field experience so many changes to our procedures that if you are off work for a couple of days you can come back and be out of the loop on things. There is very little hands on training and most everything is done through Litmos instead. This again can make things extra challenging to get everyone on the same page.
11,Apeel Sciences,"Exciting opportunity, management challenges",2022-02-06,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Awesome, mission driven company. Apeel’s work to reduce food waste is phenomenal.

Great benefits and employee programs.,"Company seems to be shifting it’s focus to solely on revenue and cutting costs, and employees seem to be considered somewhat disposable. Uncertain future with regards to working remotely or hybrid, company claims to be flexible but it ultimately comes down to manager’s preference."
15,Apeel Sciences,"Great potential, poor planning",2021-07-26,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Great company mission and values
- Kind people & colleagues 
- Great office environment 
- Lots of excitement and passion for the product","- No work/life balance
- Lack of awareness of employee health from leadership
- No organized path for career development/for promotions
- Leadership doesn't communicate clearly or transparently to staff"
16,Apeel Sciences,Nothing short of amazing!,2020-12-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have always heard about how amazing Apeel is as a company, the rumors are true. The onboarding experience was amazing! I joined the company while being remote and the onboarding experience and communication made me feel comfortable and prepared from start to finish. The onboarding experience was interactive, informative and I feel that it prepared me fully for life as a full time Apeeler. The Saturday before Onboarding, I received a box of swag to my door. Nice touch! 

Apeel is definitely and exciting company. Their mission aligns with my personal mission which is ""working with nature to create a greater abundance for all"". Everyone at Apeel lives by this mission and it is clear in the work done by all. I admire the humility of the leadership team..... there is no hierarchy here. Everyone contributes to the companies mission and success. I keep wondering when I am going to see the cracks but things just keep getting better and better. There is so much room for growth and I feel pushed and motivated by my manager. Apeel really cares about its employees and it's mission and it shows through the companies continued success.",I really haven't experienced any cons thus far!
17,Apeel Sciences,Apeel has done remote work and culture amazingly!,2021-02-01,5.0,People Operations,"While remote, Apeel has created and maintained an incredible sense of company culture true to what I've heard it was like pre-wfh. People are friendly, happy to hop on Zooms or calls to discuss things live and appreciate people's work (our Kudos slack channel is so great!). Company values are talked about often and highlighted in all company-wide meetings. Our leaders have been authentic, transparent, and available throughout this time as well. Apeel went remote before any other companies were doing so because they wanted to protect and act in the best interest of employees' safety, and they have made it clear, through their return to work strategy, that we won't return until fully safe. It's so appreciated that the company is not planning on rushing back to the office or making promises of return dates that are not guaranteed, as other companies I've heard of are doing. Overall, I've been incredibly impressed by how amazing this company has continued to be in this remote working world!",n/a - I love it!

- COVID restrictions limit interaction with employees, but online interaction is stellar and people are staying safe. 
- Salary is lower than expected, but bolstered by pre-IPO stock option grants. 
- Staff is new and somewhat inexperienced with the size of company we're becoming so many needed processes aren't in place. But all are motivated to collaborate and develop new processes needed for growth."
