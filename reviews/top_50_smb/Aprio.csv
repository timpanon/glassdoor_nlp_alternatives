15,Aprio,"Aprio,Llp",2022-01-31,4.0,Senior Tax Associate,Great office vibe and team,Extra work during tax season
16,Aprio,"Exciting place to be, great company culture",2021-09-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Aprio is a company where ""culture"" isn't just a section on the ""About"" page on the website. The company culture is practiced and celebrated from the top down, which is hard to accomplish but makes all the difference in the world. The firm is always looking towards the future, which makes it an exciting place to be more so than a traditional firm.",I wish the company offered a 401k match.
17,Aprio,Amazing firm that values employees,2021-11-03,5.0,Tax Associate,"Work life balance is amazing here, everyone respects and realizes that you have your own life outside of work. Clear career progression as well.",None that I can think of.
18,Aprio,"New to the company, but great so far",2021-10-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Have only been with the company for a short time, but already see great things. Lots of employee engagement, solid company values, and a good work environment.",Not seeing any cons so thus far. Everything has been as good or better than expected.
19,Aprio,Beware of the Glassdoor Reviews; HR Pressures People From the Day They Start to Leave a Review,2021-10-15,2.0,Tax,You can be remote for the most part. They have good technology and they are building a nice new office in Atlanta.,"I joined Aprio in part based on their outstanding GD reviews; however, I quickly realized these scores are inflated. You are pressured to leave a positive review for the company and HR closely monitors GD. It is really hard to feel like your review is anonymous, so it is hard for people to be completely honest. I received links to leave reviews from HR. From the beginning, that was a huge red flag. I think HR should actively use GD as a tool, but I think it is dishonest when they directly ask people to leave reviews. They should allow reviews to come naturally and address feedback honestly. I think they are deceiving themselves into thinking everything is rosey with their strategy. Eventually, this will backfire and they will only be able to say to themselves ""well, we have great GD reviews"".

The firm wants to be something it is not (a B4). The reality is, most of their clients are actually really tiny. You would be shocked how often the PBCs I received from clients were them writing out their income and expenses on a piece of paper (nothing wrong with this, but be proud of who you are). Almost all of their growth is non-organic and through acquisition. They bragged hard to me about their double-digit growth over the past few years. However, their growth is not that their strategy is better, their product is better, or they are somehow disrupting the market. No, the vast majority of their growth is through acquisition. They are buying their new revenues. There is nothing inherently wrong with this strategy, but the way they present their success is disingenuous. When you buy a firm, a lot of times you are bringing the people in that firm on board. You are not necessarily creating ""new opportunities"". 

Finally, like a lot of companies, they are full of corporate speak. Corporate speak are things that companies say that sound good, but are actually meaningless or they don't truly believe. It is like checking a box."
20,Aprio,Okay...,2021-12-10,3.0,Auditor,Culture was fun and some management was great to work for.,"Alot of great people left. 

Feel that staff should be rewarded with increased pay or bonuses instead of pizza parties and general food."

32,Aprio,Outstanding Job Aprio!,2020-08-31,5.0,Tax Associate,"While we have all experienced challenging times over the last 6 months, starting a new job during these times could have been very difficult, however, that wasn't the case with Aprio. As a company they have went above what I would have expected to insure I was welcomed just as I would have been during normal office working conditions. Just some highlights, all training was completed virtually, we had virtual happy hours to introduce myself along with other new hires, we held weekly office meetings virtually to stay informed, we have virtual lunches and meetings with executives of the company in large and small settings and they even sent a nice swag pack to our doorsteps. There's so many other things that they have done to insure the well being of their employees as well, just as wellness platforms that encourage you to stay active and they have spent a lot of recourse on making sure the mindset of their employees is at is best by inviting several well known-physiologist in to speak at different virtual events and even went to the extent of offering different settings that different individuals may have fallen in to. They truly illustrate the fundamental Think One Aprio.",Most of the training was packed into solid 8 hour days for the first two weeks which may cause an information overload to some.

52,Aprio,Plus/minus,2021-06-24,4.0,Tax Manager,The company provides excellent benefits. Recently added was a health and wellness Healthie app and program. Always doing things to help promote the well being of its employees,It is not always what it says it is going to be
53,Aprio,Not the best place to work,2021-01-19,1.0,Senior Associate,Great learning and development team. You will learn a lot. IT and support staff are super helpful.,"We worked non-stop, and when the company switched to remote because of COVID that meant working even longer hours. They laid off people which then meant we had to pick up additional work left from everyone they let go. A lot of office politics and power struggles between managers. This company only focuses on staff realization and total hours work. Pretty much all of 2020 was expected to work 12 hour days. The health insurance is terrible, no 401k match, and the profit share is like a couple hundred dollars maybe and you have to work there 7 years for it to be fully vested. They also give really low raises. The software they use is legacy so its not even compatible with new software. Which means you have to manually do a lot of things and the processes are outdated and take forever."

Giving back to the community which has done so much for me is important and I'm glad to be working at a firm that feels the same way.","It's an accounting firm.

Aprio truly seems to have a family environment which can be rare for some of the larger CPA firms.",None so far to this point.

Most people are nice - some are not, particularly when asking for help
Salary was great","Partners don't communicate with each other & pick favorites
Managers give little to no feedback whatsoever
When feedback was given, it was generally good, leading me to believe that I was excelling
Will work you to death during busy season & then let you go once it's over
Very clique-ish, don't expect to be welcomed
Have a terrible reputation for overhiring and then firing you once busy season is over
Believe their reputation.  They have it for a reason.
I wish I had known these things before I accepted my position.  I would have kept looking."
