0,Articulate Inc.,"Great, everything you read online is true.",2022-01-13,5.0,,"Great benefits (unlimited PTO, health stipends, 401K, HSA contribution, great health benefits, WFH set up is incredible) 

Great, competitive pay. 

You can tell the management/upper managers TRUST their staff to do their job. Sounds simple but so many companies don’t and they prefer to micro manage their employees - Articulate doesn’t. 

The work seems fulfilling. The products are great & customers trust our products. Everyone is truly so happy to be here & everyone loves this company. Morale is so high! It’s amazing.","None yet. The company is 100% remote & always will be - some people don’t thrive in that environment. If you need a manager to constantly follow up on you, you won’t like it here."
1,Articulate Inc.,"Human-centered, progressive place to work",2021-10-15,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Articulate has evolved over the years into a culture that looks out for its employees in as many ways as possible. The unlimited PTO, 4 months off if you have a kid, birthday cupcakes, sending people meals when sick / having a hard time, health & retirement benefits, employee resource groups, continuing ed opportunities, and a hundred other things all contribute to an inclusive environment that has people taken care of so they can do their best work without having to stress out about the vicissitudes of life. Apart from the great benefits, Articulate has shown time and again that they're willing to throw out bad ideas when the time comes, and that's how they've been able to evolve into what they are today. What's great is that the culture is set from the highest levels, enshrining expectations of diversity, inclusion, and belonging and human-centeredness at the core. It's refreshing.","From a code perspective, not regularly improving code in legacy products makes for a sometimes not nice experience. I disagree with the constant push for new things over solidifying and improving what we already have, but then again, that's what often gets new clients and keeps the organization afloat. This is a tale as old as time, I know..."
2,Articulate Inc.,Articulate is Unbelievably Amazing!,2021-10-15,5.0,Director of Events,"Articulate is hands-down, the best place I have ever worked. There are so many positive aspects about working for this incredible company, it would be impossible to list them all but I will share a few highlights.

One of my favorite things is that we are a FULLY REMOTE company and will always be remote. We have never had an office and we never will. How amazing is that?

Our community of employees/co-workers is like nothing I have ever experienced in past organizations. I continue to be astounded by the caliber of people that I have the good fortune to engage with on a daily basis. The entire team is genuinely impressive, caring, committed, trustworthy, and super smart - all in all, a stellar group of humans.

Lastly, our employee benefits are over the top! I frequently tell people about how fabulous the company is and how well we are taken care of. People can hardly believe what I tell them, but it's true! Our benefits are icing on a decadent cake. It's clear that our leadership DEEPLY cares about every single person on the team. I often pinch myself because it all seems too good to be true.","It's hardly a con, but working from home requires self discipline to maintain balance."
3,Articulate Inc.,Apply Today!,2021-12-28,5.0,Content Writer,"Articulate is an awesome place to work. The company culture is rooted in trust, mutual respect, and getting it done together. I've enjoyed working at Articulate since day one. Articulate is a fully remote company, so I am able to work from home. The flexibility allows more time with my kids and pets. Plus, no commute and no unnecessary meetings allow me to get my work done efficiently and effectively. The work is fulfilling and I feel like I am contributing to the greater good as an Articulate employee.","Sometimes I do crave more socialization, but I am typically able to build that into my day by working at a coffee shop or at a friend's house or by connecting with colleagues online."
4,Articulate Inc.,The Way Companies Should Work,2021-10-19,5.0,Technical Writer,"* Treats employees with respect and empathy
 * Only place I've ever worked where ""open-door policy"" and ""unlimited vacation"" are actual policies, not just buzzwords 
 * Flexible schedule truly lets you find a work/life balance, whatever that means to you
 * Generous compensation and incredible benefits
 * Clear communication from the top. The executives are free and open with information. 
 * Focus on diversity and making the world, not just Articulate, a better place
 * Amazing people - the irony of being 100% remote is that I would totally hang out with all my co-workers if we were in an office together. 
 * The annual retreat is legendary!","* Must be self-motivating. Articulate treats you like an adult and expects you to get your job done without having to lurk over your shoulder. 
 * Having the office in your pocket (or on your laptop) can lead to not giving yourself enough time away from work to recharge.
 * Must be comfortable with most of your work communication being via Slack. Meetings are only done when necessary!"
5,Articulate Inc.,Life-Changing,2021-10-15,5.0,Order Management Specialist,"- Fully remote - it's a no-questions-asked vibe. You don't have to seek permission or advocate for why you are working in a different location. Show up, support the team and get your work done. You are trusted.

- Truly amazing folks that care not only about the product/workspace but about making the world better. Across the company, leadership is open, honest and incredibly receptive to feedback. 

- Our CEO Lucy is AMAZING! ☀️ 

-Benefits that drop jaws! Amazing initiatives in regard to mental health and wellness. 

- It's an enjoyable and caring place to work with folks who have a lot of heart. Articulate develops outstanding E-Learning products; being a part of our growth feels really powerful.","-100% paid healthcare is always nice, but there's so many great benefits to offset this as well! 

- Potential envy from friends and family when you gush about how grateful you are to work at such an incredible place :')"
6,Articulate Inc.,Finally ... a company with integrity!,2021-07-19,5.0,People Team,"- Human-centered organization (HCO) framework that guides how we work and make decisions.
 - A narrow gap between our words and our actions; we won't always get it right but we listen and keep trying. First place I've worked where it feels like we have a soul and we genuinely care about our people and our impact.
 - Fully remote with an understanding and welcoming of all the things that happen in your home office (kids running behind your chair, chickens squawking in your back yard, etc.).
 - Competitive pay, diverse benefit offering.
 - Lovely humans, I truly enjoy the people I work with.
 - A lot of fast-paced growth ahead of us - so many opportunities to build scalable infrastructure for an HCO, not just for any ol' corporation.","- Decision making could be pushed down into the org more deeply; I expect this will naturally happen as we scale but it can bottle-neck things right now.
 - We have a culture of nice which can sometimes inhibit feedback/opinion sharing. I've been in companies who have the exact opposite culture so I'd definitely take nice over the inverse ... but it can feel like you really have to pull/dig for the truth."
7,Articulate Inc.,Best Job I have ever had!,2021-10-15,5.0,Order Management Specialist,"My team and my company are the best I have ever worked for. Totally supportive and very Human-Centric. While totally remote, there is a focus on becoming a team and getting to know each other. I have never felt that I was out there all alone. There is an outstanding onboarding so that you both know what to expect and what is expected of you. I have never felt like ""just an employee"" but instead have felt a cared for, valued and contributing part of a team.","It hasn't been easy to move up in the past as it was a fairly flat structure but that is changing and there are many more opportunities both now and coming up in the future.

If you need the stimulation and face-to-face of an office, or to be micro managed. this might not be the place for you. Articulate does expect that you will be productive and contributing without having to be checked up on."
8,Articulate Inc.,Really organized and inclusive company,2022-01-05,5.0,Software Engineer,Great culture and people. Autonomy and excellent feedback from lead engineering manager. Also a lot of transparency from the business side.,Onboarding was great to get to know the business side but didn't get a lot of feedback from where I should be with engineering. The onboarding was more new hires and stuff unrelated to what I was hired for.
9,Articulate Inc.,Simply the best.,2021-10-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I am so glad I found Articulate - I feel like I hit the jackpot. This is hands-down the best company I have ever worked for. I love our products, our people, our culture, and the incredible work-life balance that I've never experienced at previous companies. I'm truly excited to show up for work every day and give it my all, because I believe in this organization and what we're doing here. Leadership is transparent and ethical, listens, and supports your career journey. Everyone is kind, and is genuinely passionate about helping others - whether they are fellow teammates or our customers. I really, really love it here!","I haven't come across one downside. Remote work may not be for everyone perhaps. That being said, the company provides numerous ways to remain engaged and connect with your colleagues."
10,Articulate Inc.,6 Years and Still Happy,2021-10-15,5.0,Manager,"* the people, the people, the people
* remote employment done well
* employee resource groups
* growth opportunities no matter your role
* engaged executive leadership
* commitment to eradicating silos
* commitment to creating a safe, inclusive workspace
* examples of vulnerability and accountability that lead us to cultural maturity","It can be hard to train *yourself* to maintain a good work-life balance and to take advantage of all the benefits that support it. I love my work and appreciate my benefits, so I feel compelled to work hard to keep us successful and to show my gratitude. It can be easy to forget to break away. But when I do, I'm fully supported and encouraged."
11,Articulate Inc.,"A great place if you love working from home, amazing co-workers and unlimited PTO!",2021-07-19,5.0,Motion Graphic Designer,"The benefits and pay are exceptional and so are the people. I am still friends with people who have moved on to new jobs because everyone here is really thoughtful and kind. If you get a job at Articulate, you'll start to meet new people and think, ""Oh if this were an in-person job, this is the person who'd be my friend, that I'd get drinks with after work."" But soon you'll realize that most of the people are like that. The fact that this company is entirely remote also makes for better engagement than when some people are in person and some aren't. It creates a totally equal playing field for everyone to show up and do their best work. 

I recently had surgery and throughout my 2-week recovery, my team let me know they were thinking about me with kind messages and a care package. And my project manager reassured me multiple times that everything was under control and my sole focus should be on getting better. I honestly missed everyone. I love working here!",If you don't like working from home and need to be around people to feel connected this won't work for ya.
12,Articulate Inc.,I'm still pinching myself after 3 years...,2021-10-15,5.0,Inside Sales Manager,"Articulate is a truly amazing place to work that not only claims to be a human-centered organization but lives up to it in every way. They continuously put employees first and believe in work-life balance. The benefits they offer are above and beyond industry standards.

The products we sell are highly regarded in the e-learning industry and are something you feel proud to stand behind. I've overall just been blown away by this company and the leadership!","We are growing at an extremely fast pace and with that can be some growing pains - but so far, we are navigating it well and it's really just more exciting than anything else."
13,Articulate Inc.,The Best Place I've Ever Worked,2021-10-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company culture is amazing and truly unlike any other place I've worked. The Human Centered Organization (HCO) values are embodied by employees at all levels. I love that the entire company is fully remote so everyone can work where they feel the most comfortable. There is a true commitment to DE&I. As a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, I have felt safe and encouraged to be myself from day 1. The work is interesting, the pay is great, and the people are so kind and genuine. I truly don't ever see myself choosing to work anywhere else.","If you don't like remote work and need to be in an office to feel productive, you may not like it here—Articulate is 100% remote."
14,Articulate Inc.,"Amazing company, benefits, and culture!",2021-10-19,5.0,Senior QA Engineer I,"Diversity, 100% Remote, Benefits, Culture, Pay, and most importantly Articulate is truly the most amazing company that I've ever worked at. Articulate offers benefits that I've never even heard of before, which is awesome! They really do care about every person who works at Articulate. I honestly don't see myself ever looking for another job. I want to work here at Articulate forever!","Cons at Articulate?!?! Got to be kidding me, but honestly I know everyone and every company is always working to be better. Maybe the one con I would mention is being recognized and/or praised. However, with this being said Articulate is already working on implementing employee recognition!"
15,Articulate Inc.,Articulate is Authentically Awesome,2021-10-18,5.0,Senior Customer Success Manager,"Probably the top reason is the people. Just the finest collection of humans that I have had the pleasure of belonging with. Our amazing collection of humans is fully supported by our Human-Centered Framework. Beyond the people, I get to work with really amazing clients helping them maximize the value they achieve through our innovative e-learning platform.","This is not a micro-managed environment - so you have to be a self-starter, trustworthy, and accountable."
16,Articulate Inc.,Articulate is honestly a gold mine of a company to work for,2021-10-15,5.0,Software Engineering Manager,"- Lots of opportunities for career growth
- A company that truly cares about Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, and not just for the reporting numbers.

- Rapid growth and success comes with it's own challenges of scaling culture, even when everyone is doing all they can to do it well"
17,Articulate Inc.,It's all about you,2021-10-18,5.0,Global Customer Insights Manager,"From the top-down, this company is like no other.

18,Articulate Inc.,Incredible Org With Incredible People Who Make Incredible Products,2021-10-15,5.0,Technical Writer,"µAn incredible organization with incredible people who make incredible products. (Try saying that fast three times.) In my experience, this is an accurate tongue-twister representation of what it's like to work at Articulate. Here's why:

1. Talented, collaborative, and supportive teammates. The people here are truly incredible, and I'm so thankful to have formed a special, lifelong bond with certain folx despite being thousands of miles apart.

2. Meaningful work. We get to empower people to live better lives and equip them with knowledge. How awesome is that?

3. Warm, transparent, and driven culture. ""Human-centered/human-centric"" aren't buzzwords here. Those words and their actions are taken very seriously. We have strong ERG and DEI programs, wellness resources and activities, generous and flexible benefits, and more. Plus, I love how incredibly intentional and down-to-earth each executive is (which is great since leadership and communication trickle from the top). Monthly business updates are informative and fun at the same time—recent example: our CTO introduced his new pup after reviewing the product roadmap.

4. Innovative products. There's a reason why course developers rank our products as the ""most important” and “most frequently used"" tools. Our software improved so much from various iteration cycles since I started years ago, and I know it'll keep getting better as we onboard more eager and amazing humans.","Before transitioning to my current role, I struggled with what ""driving your career"" really means. As someone who likes structure, it seemed like a nebulous concept, so I never knew how to best approach the topic. I think it's vital to have access/a path to career coaching and mentorship opportunities. That was years ago, though, and we've grown a lot since—both literally and in our career growth process."
19,Articulate Inc.,Amazing work life balance,2021-10-20,5.0,Software Engineer,"Being 100% remote is amazing!
Every level of management truly recognizes the importance of work life balance.
Excellent parental leave policy.
Great benefits that just keep getting better.

I never thought I was the sort of person to stick with one company for my whole career but I don't see any reason why I would leave Articulate.","Working remote requires a level of self motivation and discipline that some may struggle with.
Career advancement opportunities are a little limited but as the company continues to grow I expect this will improve."
20,Articulate Inc.,Feels like how all companies should be run!,2021-10-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Deliberately thoughtful and supportive team and cross-team dynamics. Everyone is happy to help each other and do not make you feel vulnerable for not knowing something.

Fully remote and home life is an expected part of everyone's experience of working with each other. We all take the time we need to do things in our home without being judged for not prioritizing work at all times.",Fully remote work can feel isolating at times. Worrying that you don't seem like you're doing enough can be tough for new people.
21,Articulate Inc.,The best of remote work!,2021-07-13,5.0,Customer Success Representative,"I am unsure that I can list everything that I love about working for Articulate. I've worked in SaaS for 6 years now and always felt like a number even in the smallest company. Not here. Concerns are heard and actions are taken! We are actually a human-centered organization. I love my team as well as the company overall. This is NOT your typical remote work.

- 100% remote always
- Flexible work hours
- Unlimited PTO that our team actually uses
- Open career conversations regardless of which team or role you plan to end up on/in.
- The benefits were already great and have become even better recently.
- An employee-based DIBs (Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging) committee. A great place to be a bigger part of the company cultures.","The growth is a little painful because we are doing big things but need much bigger teams. Nonetheless, it is temporary and we are hiring!"

Work from anywhere - truly! I've been able to travel, visit with friends, all while taking my work with me. 
Focus on growth - personal and professional. Lots of opportunities for you to learn about everything from different roles in the org to your own role in larger social issues impacting us all at work and in our lives outside of work.","Missing out on in-person conversations. For extroverts, you have to find another way to build that energy reserve with people in person."
45,Articulate Inc.,The work is amazing...but the people is where it's at.,2021-07-14,5.0,Engineering Project Manager,"I'm incredibly proud to work for Articulate every day. Back in 2013, my hometown of Moore, OK was hit by yet another devastating tornado. I reached out to Adam Schwartz and he immediately donated on behalf of Articulate. 

This gesture (along with many untold stories in my 12+ years here), is exactly why I love Articulate.

Over the years, I've worked in various positions from Support, QA, to now Project Management. Although my daily responsibilities have changed, the absolute core of what I do is help people. When I worked in Support, I was helping multiple people a day learn how to use Articulate's products. Even today, I get pings from customers that have found a random E-Learning Heroes post from years ago that helped them move past a roadblock.

While working in QA, I was able to have a direct impact on the products that reached our customers. Whether it was the Consolidated Narration Window in Presenter 360, optimizing hundreds of different audio formats to test the EBU R128 audio optimization feature, championing accessibility, or even committing code to help optimize the speed of our marketing sites, I was given the autonomy to do the things I felt was best for our customers.

Today as an Engineering Project Manager, I've been entrusted to help teams across the organization continue to ship amazing work. Although I'm not directly involved in the development or QA, I'm in a position where I can help people focus on what they do best. From limiting context switching to pushing conversations around trimming scope, I get the opportunity to engage and build relationships with people that I've never worked with before.

As I tell everyone that joins Articulate, the work that I do is challenging, important & fun. However, that's not what gets me out of bed each day. It's knowing that the relationships that I've built here will last well beyond Articulate. It's knowing that the opportunities and conversations that I've had has positively shaped the person that my family knows outside of work. It's knowing that folks like Lucy Suros & Adam Schwartz have my back & will support me no matter what hand life deals me. And with that, I'm forever grateful & proud to work at Articulate.

So if you're one of the many people out there that are tired of working for an organization that doesn't fulfill your needs, doesn't allow you to work remotely, doesn't support your well-being, doesn't offer 17 weeks of baby bonding leave, doesn't offer tuition reimbursement or support your desire to volunteer, doesn't cover the cost of mental health sessions, doesn't contribute 3% of your salary to a 401k whether you contribute or not, or doesn't enable you contribute in a meaningful way, please consider taking a look at the Careers page at Articulate.

Things like student debt repayment, $3k child care assistance, and even a 401k were non-existent. The pandemic has forced organizations to quickly improve compensation & benefits. Articulate has been 100% remote since inception in 2002. So, the ability to work from home has always been a key differentiator.

-Coworkers are fantastic.  I have never had more positive relationships with more people than I have here.  Political maneuvering is slight at worst.  Games aren't played.
-Management is present and accessible.  A flat structure means I've had drinks and personal conversations with most of the decision-makers in the company.
-Working from home is fantastic (as long as you're a bit introverted).  My commute takes about 10 seconds now.  I never worry about forgetting something at home.  I have plenty of social energy left over most days for my family and friends.
-Truly flexible time off and vacation.  I have never gotten any feedback from management on my vacation time except to ask about the trip or sharing stories about their own.  There's flexible time off and then there's actually flexible time off.
-Articulate takes care of me.  In return, I take care of them.  This basic tit-for-tat is the single biggest pro on the list.","-Benefits (medical, etc) aren't as good as they would be at a very large corporation.  They aren't nearly as bad as they would be at a very small corporation, or one that doesn't put any value in employee wellness.

-The organization is flat, so there isn't much of a ladder to climb.  Turnover is very low, so any promotions typically come from expansion."
72,Articulate Inc.,"At Articulate you CAN have your cake—and eat it, too",2019-06-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Articulate has offered everything that I've been looking for in a company. It's successful, has a strong work culture, talented people, fair pay and benefits, and flexible work schedule/vacation options.  Articulate is the first company where I don't have to choose between having an ambitious career and a strong work-life balance. I now can't imagine going back to a brick-and-mortar, nine-to-five job—and it motivates me to do my part to contribute to the company's success. 

I'd also give my direct manager 100% approval rating. I love the collaborative leadership style and proactive conversations about career development and growth. They truly care about your professional fulfillment and success.","- Remote work is not for everyone. You will struggle if you're not a self-starter or can't manager your own time effectively. Since Articulate is a results-driven company, you'll also struggle if you're a slacker or fail to perform or produce results.

- Communication can sometimes be challenging—but it's nothing you can't overcome or that Articulate doesn't have tools and strategies to help with.

-Articulate is a relatively flat work structure. There aren't always clear pathways to ""climb the ladder,"" which may be a con if that's your goal. However, there are still other ways to pursue promotions and performance-based raises. I think the compensation is fair and based on what you truly contribute."
73,Articulate Inc.,A Company That Genuinely Cares About Its People and Customers,2015-09-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Articulate is the first company I've worked for that cares deeply and genuinely about people—both its employees and its customers. Autonomy is the name the of the game here and all of us are generously equipped and supported so we can work at our optimal levels. This means working from home full-time with top of the line equipment and software, flexible work hours, unlimited vacation time, and minimal meetings or traditional corporate time sucks.

Articulate's executive team understands and respects that our company's strength lies in the individual, creative contributions of its people and their desire to do work that matters. I love telling people that my job is to help our customers make great e-learning, and knowing that we all feel that way inspires me with a passionate purpose that makes working here both fun and fulfilling.","If you're looking to climb a corporate ladder or land that next big promotion, that's not really what working at Articulate is about. While there are plenty of opportunities to advance your career and your skills, generally people are here because they're very skilled in their craft and happy to continue growing in their role. 

Also, if you're someone who thrives in a face-to-face or traditional corporate office environment, Articulate may not be a good fit for you as the company is 100% remote."
74,Articulate Inc.,"Great culture, rewarding work, awesome teammates",2015-09-03,5.0,Marketing,"Articulate is a really fantastic and unique place to work. It's a fully remote company, with no office, anywhere. That means you'll have tons of independence to set your schedule and prioritize your tasks. But that doesn't mean you're on your own to get stuff done. You'll be in touch with your teammates through Slack, Google Hangouts, and other collaboration tools. You'll feel supported and challenged, and you'll love the way you're trusted to get your work done without constant oversight. 

The mission of the company is inspiring, too. It's super-motivating to know you're helping build tools that make online education better for learners all over the world. 

And the people are fantastic. Articulate is awesome at hiring, and truly looks for people who are good to work with, have a strong work ethic, and demonstrate commitment and focus in everything they do. 

Pay is great, and our annual retreat in a glam location is always something to look forward to as well.","We're a growing company, and occasionally communication across different teams can be a challenge. I think this is something our exec team is focused on improving over time."

Too often, people can't walk the line between taking nothing seriously and taking everything too seriously.  My co-workers help me get things done, quickly, without the stress.

- Work with modern tools.  Github?  Yup.  Teamcity?  Yup.  The list goes on - I don't find myself fighting with anyone's pet tool or unwise purchase.

- Work on a product with heavily engaged customers.  You will work on features that people are clamoring for, and you will meet people who'll give you a high five for implementing it.  How cool is that?

- Work remotely.  For an introvert, you never realize how much energy the office is sapping from you until you don't go to one any more.  I have more energy for my work AND my personal life.","- Cultural fit.  Until I hung out with co-workers socially, outside of work time, I didn't realize exactly how amazing of a cultural fit it was.  Being distributed, the opportunities to do this are not regular!  That said, there is a yearly retreat and several opportunities to attend conferences both to learn and to work the booth."

I've never had a problem getting resources I've needed to do my job. Sometimes it can be a bit anxiety provoking asking to spend a bunch of money on a tool, but here, the response has always been: ""Do you need it? Great. Get it.""","Everyone seems to be very concerned about ""transparency"" these days, but I have a different take on this. It's not really ""transparency"" that's a problem. If anything, I would rather *not* know how the sausage is made. 

Instead, I think ""transparency"" is just a buzzword everyone's landed on, to express the high anxiety many of us have felt about the lack of a clearly expressed direction beyond the next release - and more individually, anxiety around the uncertainty of how those unclear changes will affect your own role and contribution.

I also think some anxiety comes from a top-down mindset people bring with them from other experiences. I know I've caught myself a few times thinking ""they should..."", when I really should be saying to myself, ""why shouldn't I...""

However, there's been a strong effort recently to clear a lot of that fog, and to insure everyone is both excited, and knows WHY they're exited, about the future here..."
77,Articulate Inc.,The Best Gig I've Ever Had,2016-09-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flexibility
I can’t express just how amazing the work environment is here at Articulate. Like many organizations, you’re going to hammer down and work hard. But at Articulate, it’s a whole lot easier to achieve a healthy sense of work-life(family) balance. To be transparent, many of us do work core hours (our families are still pretty ensconced in the normal 9-5). But with Articulate, I have the freedom to step out to attend a school event during the middle of the day or to enjoy a long walk on a sunny autumn afternoon if the mood strikes. And that’s because...

Autonomy
Articulate trusts me to get the job done. I’m given a set of tasks and left to my own devices to make the magic happen. That doesn’t mean that I don’t have set times (such as team meetings) that I must be “present”, or that I don’t actively collaborate with colleagues or my supervisor. But it does mean that I feel empowered to work in my own unique way and, largely, on my own schedule. 

Culture of Care
The best part of working here (for me) is that we sincerely care about the people who use our software. It’s not an act. It’s not something that leadership merely pays lip-service to. We really do care and go the extra mile (or 2 or 3) for the people in our user community. 

Professional Growth
I've learned a crazy amount since I've arrived here. But the key is that you have to be self-directed, secure in who you are, and open to growth. You will receive challenging feedback on your work. You won't always agree with your supervisor, and at times it'll feel like you're being whipsawed as the company quickly pivots in a new direction to take advantage of an opportunity. But the c-levels here are super talented (and genuinely kind) people who you can learn a lot from. You just have to be humble, open your ears and ask a lot of questions.","Frankly, there isn’t much that I don’t love about working here...but here are some caution areas:

Remote work isn’t for everyone.
If you love the traditional work environment with the water cooler, grabbing a drink with your coworkers, and swinging by Bob’s cubicle, you might struggle a bit. Some people have left because they end up missing the traditional day-to-day interactions that the physical office space provides. We do have a lot of interaction via Slack, Skype, Zoom, etc. But if you thrive on more immediate social contact, you’ll need to establish that outside the workplace.

The customer is the rock star. 
Articulate is a relatively small company and the org chart is pretty flat. So if your desire is to quickly work your way into the ranks of upper management, Articulate isn’t going to be your jam. Also, I’ve found that the leadership team here really values sincerity, accountability, and authenticity. There’s no tolerance for one-upmanship and political games. Life here is about working collaboratively as a team to support our customers. 

Can you control yourself?
You’ll need to self-moderate. With autonomy and remote work comes the freedom to work 24/7. It’s super easy to log-on since your home is also your office. While it’s NOT an expectation that you work a crazy number of hours, there’s also nobody kicking you out of the building at night. In all honesty, it’s a challenge that many of us struggle with."

Working here has made me a better team member and human. The culture that has evolved here is also one of a kind. Trust and autonomy are easy words for companies to throw around, but Articulate does its best to live by them. People are empowered to do their best work here. And the work is fun!
