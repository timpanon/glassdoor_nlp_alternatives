1,Awardco,"Great product, culture, and atmosphere!",2022-01-25,5.0,Account Executive,"The product is something I am 100% behind! This makes things more comfortable when selling because I know what we do helps companies. Coworkers are top notch. Working with all around good people makes a huge difference in how I feel coming to work. The place we work. Awardco is continually improving work environment and making this a great place to be, physically. Can't wait to move into our brand new building! It's amazing working somewhere with a great: Product, Culture, and Atmosphere!","Growth. It's great to grow, and it's necessary. However there are pains to growth as well. However when working with likeminded people that accept change and are able to adapt makes things easier!"
2,Awardco,Live and love what you sell.,2022-01-26,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,The product is incredible and there is a very specific focus on not only being but STAYING the #1 vendor in the reward & recognition space. There is a great culture of collaboration and winning amongst the team. Leadership is humble and there is no ego as they are also attached to goals and commissions.,Typical startup growing pains that are all associated with change but the pros far outweigh the cons.
3,Awardco,Awardco is a great place to work.,2022-01-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great team, great environment, good work life balance, good management. The leadership is transparent and open. There is massive growth and opportunity.","This is a hard one because there aren't that many. I do feel if ideas don't fit in with management vision, then it is pushed away passively."
4,Awardco,Don't Believe the Hype,2022-02-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are a lot of smart and hardworking people. I like my coworkers.

Flexibility and good work-life balance.

Office snacks are great.

The product works.","If management makes you a promise, I wouldn't trust it unless you get it in writing. Management makes a lot of promises, but normally breaks them.

There are many examples of this: promised 401k matching, to pay our healthcare premiums, and that we would be getting generous equity. We are still waiting on each of these.

Also, pay is low and benefits aren't great."
5,Awardco,Increadible Opportunities and Culture,2021-12-28,5.0,Brand Specialist,"Fast-paced environment, many new and upcoming opportunities for growth! 
Being that the product focuses on employee recognition and appreciation, Awardco REALLY exemplifies that from within the culture of the company. It is such a happy environment full of people looking to recognize the efforts of others. That recognition inspires innovation and encourages people to continually do their best. 
Great work-life balance. Employees are genuinely encouraged to not only do their best work, but also to maintain a great work-life balance.
Trust. There is a sense of trust that everyone is giving their best.",I haven't found any negatives in working at Awardco.
6,Awardco,1000x better than my last job!,2022-01-18,5.0,Vendor and Reward Networks Relations Manager,"Incredible team members.
Great leadership.
Non-taboo unlimited PTO.
Beautiful vision and mission.
A product I can truly get behind.","My role was brand new, so there were no immediate team members, making it harder to meet a lot of people right off the bat. BUT this is just something I'm thinking of after a while brainstorming trying to come up with cons. I honestly love working here."
7,Awardco,Love this place,2022-02-03,5.0,SMB Account Executive,Awardco is wonderful. The management on the sales team has your best interest at heart.,"Start up vibes. Growing pains. Everyone wants a bigger base salary, right? Pros are much greater than the cons."

11,Awardco,Awardco - Great place to work,2022-01-09,5.0,Software Engineer,Very fun. Everyone is highly motivated. We are going big!,Sometimes they aren't super flexible.
12,Awardco,Best place to work!!,2022-01-12,5.0,Front End Developer,I love the company culture and how motivated everyone is.,401k is not offered yet
13,Awardco,Awardco is the best!,2021-12-20,5.0,Account Executive,Great culture! Great leadership! Great product!,Startup feel. We need to be on our toes at times. This can be seen as a pro or con...
14,Awardco,Great place to work,2022-02-02,4.0,Implementation Team Lead,"Culture is great, executives care about you","Pay isn't the best, ceiling is lower than promised"
15,Awardco,"Amazing company, amazing culture!",2021-11-03,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"People are helpful and supportive, snacks are a plus, and the product as a really cool concept.","Really none. If you work hard, you are recognized often. If you are a mediocre employee, you are still recognized--but not as often. Tons of opportunity for growth."
16,Awardco,Amazing place to work,2021-08-17,5.0,Sales Manager,"Excellent compensation, great leadership, awesome culture, easily drinkable koolaid. I would recommend anyone to join up on any team. I love coming into work everyday.","I think that with a fast growing company there are always growing pains. Awardco has done a really good job at identifying those are working to fix them as quickly as possible. Onboarding training could be more streamlined, but overall, I don't have any complaints. Awesome place to work!"
17,Awardco,Amazing Company!,2021-06-22,5.0,Backend Software Engineer,"- Fun culture where everyone helps each other out and works towards a common goal. Employees recognize each other for the great work they do and make everyone feel valued and important.
- Awesome work/life balance. Unlimited PTO and remote options provide lots of flexibility.
- Lots of opportunities for career growth since the company is growing fast.
- They value their employees and treat them like human beings, not assets.
- Lots of transparency from the senior leadership.
- Free food/snacks.
- Product managers understand software development and follow industry best practices for managing technical debt and cultivating a low-stress development environment.","- Since it's a smaller company, health insurance premiums are a bit pricy and there's no 401k match but salaries are competitive."
18,Awardco,Only gets better every day,2021-07-22,5.0,Implementation Specialist,"Leadership isn’t just a job title here - they are actual LEADERS. They edify and lift up all employees around them - doesn’t matter where you are on the hierarchy. I came from a company where the top leaders were stuck in their office and only knew your name if you benefited them some way. I came from a company that said “we care about your opinion!” but didn’t do anything about it. Awardco’s leaders don’t have offices and sit with everyone else! They take feedback and show you what they are doing to make changes. It really is surreal how amazing this company is. 

Benefits are only getting better! They care about employees and retention and are doing everything they can to give more reasons for employees to stay. I love their mentality that there is always more they can do to be better. 

Work-life balance is great. My leaders know I’m doing my job and trust that when I leave for the day at 4:45, that my work is done. There isn’t a pressure to stay late which I love. My last job you had to stay till at least 5:30 and even then - most stayed around till 7pm. 

People are incredible! Shoutout to the recruiters because they hire the best of the best and do it in a quick/professional manner (I don’t know how they do it!). Literally everyone I have worked with is qualified for their job and bring so much value to the role and team. It makes such a difference in your day-to-day when you’re surrounded by inspiring people. 

Recruiters - while job hunting, I had spoken to a few recruiters. I worked with Jazzy at Awardco and she was 100% transparent upfront which was really nice. Most recruiters like to keep salary a secret (I guess to see if you’re a serious candidate regardless of salary?) but Jazzy was transparent on the first interview. There were no surprises about my offer and no surprises about what I was getting into. 

I’ve had over 10 years of working experience and you really don’t get much better than Awardco. There’s a reason they’re receiving so many awards for being the best place to work along with the best CEO.",- Currently no 401k but in the works!
19,Awardco,Best Job I have ever had,2021-10-16,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),Mangers are amazing and understanding. They want to help you grow.,Growing pains of a startup? But really it’s all good
20,Awardco,Great environment,2021-11-03,4.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),Fun people and there’s always free food.,Just in an SDR position you are the bottom of the totem pole and you can feel it. For a company that is focused on recognition SDRs aren’t recognized at all like other departments.
21,Awardco,Good place,2021-11-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good people, fun vibe and culture",Over promises and under delivers
22,Awardco,Wagon Hitched,2021-05-05,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"- Great culture - I know everyone says that but you work at a company that has a bad culture and you know the difference. 
- Great benefits.
- Smashed between Vivint and Qualtics so we have great examples of how to grow.
- Everyone feels welcomed and included
- The product is employee recognition and they practice what they preach!","No stock options as of this point. They should be coming this year. Other than that, there really aren't any cons. The company s great at taking perk suggestions and working to make them a reality."
23,Awardco,Aweseome,2021-08-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Culture, a great place to work.",Nothing negative to say after a year.
24,Awardco,Amazing!,2021-07-08,5.0,Implementation Specialist,"The culture is incredible, the management/executive team is unbelievable. It feels like a family, but a functional one! 😂 would stay here forever if it could! Great benefits, great team, beautiful office view, just amazing!",Pay could be a little bit better.
25,Awardco,"Fun, flexible, and fast-paced!",2020-11-06,5.0,Operations Manager,"I love working here! It has typical tech start-up vibes with the open-office layout, younger demographic, etc. that make it really fun and a good fit for me. It's also incredibly flexible. Amazing PTO. Leadership does a really great job of encouraging work-life balance and making sure you feel valued. They trust me to get my job done and I don't feel micromanaged at all! I love how quickly Awardco grows and how fast things change. Obviously that isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I like it because there are always new opportunities and work never feels monotonous.","There are a few growing pains with how fast-paced the work is, but I think management is doing a good job of building out the structure more to address that. Training was too unstructured when I started, but that has improved. I wish there were more women here, but it's a tech start-up in Utah so I don't think the demographics are untypical."
26,Awardco,"Great Company, Amazing Future!",2020-03-06,5.0,Sales,"Awardco is a startup company that is taking off. We are the fastest growing company in Utah and 25th in the nation according to Inc5000. I love the energetic vibe and the opportunity to make a difference. I love coming to work and I love the people I work with. If you are a self starter and want to make a difference, this is the company for you. I trust the leaders of the company and their transparency. They are taking the company in the right direction and it's exciting to be a part of it. They truly care about their employees. I love the unlimited PTO and the ability to work from home when I need to. It shows that  they trust their employees. There is a great culture where everyone helps each other.",As a young company the pay isn't up where it should be but it's not bad. I feel they are getting there and will make it better in the near future as we continue to grow. The benefits are also in need of a little work such as a 401K. You may need to put in some long hours which isn't necessarily a con as I feel you do what you have to do and work as long as it takes to get the job done. That may be a con for someone looking for a 9-5 job.
27,Awardco,Awardco,2021-09-14,3.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Great culture, Great product, fun","Lacks training, below average pay"
28,Awardco,Excellent Work Environment,2021-04-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"What's exciting about Awardco is that everyone, regardless of talent or experience, is able to contribute in meaningful ways.",The startup environment may not be for everyone
29,Awardco,Great place to work,2021-04-21,5.0,Account Manager,"Great environment, unlimited PTO, free snacks, discounted gym membership, flexible work schedule and no micromanaging",Pay is on the lower end of the job
30,Awardco,Great company!,2020-10-21,5.0,Cs Department,"Growing company with lots of opportunities - I've seen so much mobility across departments. The product itself is awesome and can be used in any industry so the potential is limitless. Great culture and environment - they take appreciating and recognizing employees seriously. Super transparent, which during a crazy time like Covid-19 has been very reassuring and appreciated. They also adapted super quickly and ended up having the best quarter yet during Covid-19!","Growing company so changes are always happening, gotta be able to roll with it. Training process could definitely improve."
31,Awardco,"Great place to work, but overwhelming",2021-04-23,4.0,Implementation Specialist,Flexible PTO. Great culture. Nice office.,"Heavy work loads, management not into finding deep rooted solutions- puts bandaids on them instead. Not a very organized system for implementation. Very long and grueling process for implementation."
32,Awardco,Fantastic,2021-03-31,5.0,Implementation Specialist,"Great, growing company with an innovative and exciting product",Still young and growing from a benefits perspective.
33,Awardco,Greatest company I have ever worked for!,2020-03-06,5.0,Implementation Specialist,"There are so many pros!
-Unlimited PTO
-Work from home when needed
-Amazing work environment. I personally don't dread coming in to work and haven't experienced the Sunday night blues since working here. People genuinely love coming in to work because we are treated so great. 
-Its an employee recognition company and they really put that into practice here at Awardco. Peers and leaders alike are always recognizing others for things that they have done and it creates a great atmosphere where we all want to do our best and give back to the amazing company that recognizes us
-They mean what they say when they say they want us to have a work/life balance. They understand the importance of taking time for yourself and family.","-It's a start up so things can change quickly as we are growing and figuring out best practice for programming/developments, etc which is to be expected! Leadership is great to keep us in the loop however and transitions happen smoothly."
34,Awardco,Awesome Company with Great Potential,2020-11-10,5.0,Implementation Specialist,"Awardco has a tremendous product and is growing rapidly, changing the way companies around the world treat their employees. As a result, the culture at Awardco itself is very positive.","As a relatively young startup, there are still growing pains and processes still being worked out. Additionally, compensation isn't quite up to par with other tech companies in the area."
35,Awardco,Awesome company!,2021-02-04,5.0,Sales Development Representative,Never had to worry about flexibility. Tons of opportunities for growth since I interviewed with them. Always thinking about the future and helping me be my best self.,They have a startup vibe and naturally some structure goes out the window.
36,Awardco,Best Job I've Ever Had,2020-09-02,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Honestly this is the best job I've ever had. The kindness in the room is unbelievable. The whole focus of the environment is growth and positivity & everyone consistently brings each other up. Have a question? It'll be answered in a positive way that they'll make sure you understand. Need help? You can look around to all of your colleagues and know they'll do their best to see you succeed, just like you'd do for them. An absolutely incredible environment full of growth.","Just the commute for me! Even then, I only live 20 minutes away & theirs the option to work from home so not even really a con."
37,Awardco,Amazing place to work!,2020-11-11,5.0,Senior SDR,"Awardco is a great place to work for many reasons: The work environment, the people who work here, the culture, and the product we have (of course) are just a few.

I do anticipate these to change as well!
38,Awardco,Best job. Best culture. Best platform.,2020-11-11,5.0,Client Success Manager,The culture here is something that will make you never want to leave. Everyone is so welcoming and everyone is on the same page and we all have the same goal in mind; change the game of employee recognition.,"Pay isn't as great as it should be, but early employees are being promised equity."
39,Awardco,A Rewarding Experience,2020-12-09,5.0,Operations,"Lot's of opportunity to grow. The company uses its own product to recognize which is refreshing. The office environment is incredible with outside seating, incredible views of the mountains, a commercial-grade kitchen, eScooters to ride around the office, bathroom stalls with floor to ceiling walls. They truly care about the employees.","still looking for cons, not many to speak of"
40,Awardco,The best place I've worked at,2020-11-25,5.0,Art Director,I really appreciate the transparency from the executive team. I actually have fun going to work and enjoy interacting with my team. Everyone works hard but also have fun doing it.,As a start up company they are still figuring out their benefits. My main thing would be the lack of 401K matching or having to wait 6 months to set up your account.
41,Awardco,Growing Fast,2021-02-04,5.0,Customer Education Manager,Ability to have a huge impact I’d you’re willing to work hard and be proactive.,Growing pains from accelerated business opportunity
42,Awardco,Great Culture,2020-11-13,5.0,Product Development,"If you are looking for a high-energy environment, Awardco is the pace to be. It is packed with solutions-oriented individuals that value the importance of recognition.

58,Awardco,Company Favoritism,2020-03-06,3.0,Account Manager,"The company is flexible with their work environment, they provide snacks and a meal once a week, coworkers/team is great, upper management is goal oriented/driven, and they offer unlimited PTO.","The company is very biased and plays favorites. It relies on the good old boy system and takes good care of friends first. As a recognition company, they are poor at recognizing their employees, unless you are good friends or well-liked by upper management.  It's not just about the big wins, but the little things that make the whole machine operate. The compensation is mediocre for a company that is growing so quickly, and you have no control over your growth. When you express interest in another position in the company, only outside hires get filled (who are usually friends) so you are stuck in your same position. They make lots of promises that do not get kept and if you bring them up again, you receive different answers. There is no consistency and transparency is at a minimum for a company that regards it as one of their core values.  Organization can improve immensely. The unlimited PTO really has a hidden set limit."
59,Awardco,Fast Growing Company,2020-11-11,4.0,Software Engineer,"There are lot of flexibilities in work style, hours, PTO, great location and environment.",I think there are improvements can be made for employee benefits.

64,Awardco,"Growing fast, come be a part of the excitement!",2020-03-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Awardco is growing fast, and the reason for that is because the product solves a lot of problems for its customers. Companies can quickly save money and start measuring ROI with their investment in the software. Because it is a leader in its segment, its client list is growing rapidly. That growth translates to opportunity within the company.","Growth brings on challenging decisions, and the company sometimes has difficulty making a decision and sticking to it. That experience can be frustrating, but I know it is driven by their intent to make the best decision for the company."
65,Awardco,"Fast growing, lean startup",2019-11-06,5.0,Front-End Developer,"Great coworkers and leaders. Decisions are made quickly which allows us to grow quickly and get rid of the red tape.

I can tell the leaders really care about their employees and we are all given the tools we need to perform our jobs with ease.  I'm really excited to see where the company ends up in the next few years.","I'm not a fan of the ""unlimited"" PTO policy. You end up with hundreds of different vacation policies, one for every manager, and none of them openly communicated. I would much rather have a fixed amount of vacation that I can take without worrying I'm missing out on a promotion because someone is taking less vacation than I am."

There is so much room to grow, and I enjoy seeing my own impact as well as the impact of my friends here at work at our growing company.  We are constantly improving, so most of the things I may not like are only temporary!","Awardco is an agile and flexible company. In most cases, this is great, but it does mean that sometimes we make a change and then just as it becomes normal, we change things again. If you're looking for fast-paced, never-boring, constant growth within a company, Awardco is great! If you're looking for something simple where you can do the same thing every day for the next 10 years, you'll want to look elsewhere. Other than that, I think it would be better if we were to let go of people faster who aren't pulling their weight. It definitely has a negative impact on morale among the different teams."
67,Awardco,Great company heading in the right direction,2020-03-06,5.0,Sales,"Awardco is very customer-focused, they care deeply about their customers. They live what they preach and recognize their employees consistently. The product is top of the industry and only getting better. They have global customers and are hyper-focused on improving every day.","It's a start-up world still, which doesn't affect the product but it greatly affects the sales processes and the world. Still, a long way to go to get where they want t o be."
68,Awardco,"Great company, great culture!",2020-03-06,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"Start up company on it's way to the top!

69,Awardco,Great Place to Work!,2020-03-06,5.0,Implementation Specialist,I love working at Awardco! It is a fun laid back start up atmosphere. Management cares about us doing well and our success.  I feel valued as an employee at Awardco and feel like I am part of something bigger. It is fun to be part of a company that is growing and expanding rapidly. I can't wait to see where Awardco goes from here!,Management is spread a bit thin as with any startup because they are wearing many hats and fulfilling multiple positions.

Everyone is constantly innovating and creating work. Don't expect to just show up and have a list of everything you need to do. It's a very proactive work environment. That's not a con in my opinion, but could be to others."
72,Awardco,Great Place to Work!,2020-03-06,5.0,Client Services,Awardco provides employees with great opportunities for growth as well as a fun and relaxed culture.
