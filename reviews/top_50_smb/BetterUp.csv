0,BetterUp,Believe the hype,2022-03-31,5.0,Content Marketing Manager,"I just feel like I made the best possible choice for my life and career by joining BetterUp. I am completely in awe of how open, thoughtful, and values-driven everyone is. The posture, energy, and vulnerability folks have shown to me reminds me of how I try to show up each day, so it feels like a really wonderful fit. This onboarding experience is more than I could have hoped for!","I know when I'm reading these types of reviews, it makes me skeptical when folks say, ""nothing I can think of,"" or ""this place is a dream come true."" I get it — the obvious thought is... well, something's got to be off. Truthfully, I'm more than prepared to speak my truth about professional experiences, even if that means I feel I've made a mistake trusting an organization or perhaps feel like I've been sold an experience that isn't reality. 

Here's the thing... I've only been here a short time, and I simply have no reason to doubt that BetterUp is actually doing what they say they will: delivering change at scale to improving individual resilience, adaptability, and effectiveness. 

What I can say is this: this is the most vulnerable, thoughtful, human-centered hiring and onboarding experience I've had at a company... period. And this is coming from someone who prides herself in seeking mission-driven, values-oriented organizations. Even me, with all of my research, homework, and extra-credit interviews... even I've gotten it wrong at times. But BetterUp has their attention focused on the right things. The things that make a COMMUNITY, not just an organization. The purpose of our product is to help folks flourish in every aspect of their lives so they can show up to work as their best selves. This is the cornerstone and the essence of who we are. There is ownership here. We are asked to be citizens first, before our role. The values shared here are the ones you'd hope we are all bound to and seek to embody in our cities, schools, and neighborhoods. Treating ourselves and our colleagues with respect is fundamental! Any modicum of success we hope to have starts there, and I believe wholeheartedly that folks who join this company fundamentally share the desire to live more meaningful, vibrant lives with greater clarity, purpose, and passion.

So no, no cons yet. I'm just really excited to see what my next chapter here holds."
1,BetterUp,Best sales culture I've seen,2022-03-19,5.0,Sales,The job is very rewarding. You will hear stories from our clients that speak to the impact we have on members and companies. It makes me excited every day to go to work. The business has a focus on internal promotions and building careers at BetterUp. The compensation plan for sales is best in class. The leadership team cares about the success of the individuals on the team.,"The work is hard as we build a category. Regardless of where you come from this work will be different. There is no set playbook when creating a category. If you can deal with ambiguity and work hard, you can be extremely successful."
2,BetterUp,Never Been Happier,2022-03-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,BetterUp really puts in effort to make you feel settled in and welcome. It's one of the few companies I've worked at that practiced what they preached which is amazing to see,There are so many amazing people here - sometimes I wonder what I'm doing
3,BetterUp,AMAZING!,2022-03-29,5.0,Sr. Account Executive,"-Extremely organized 
-Thought-provoking conversations 
-Allowed and encouraged to be vulnerable 
-Very intelligent people 
-Great content discussed","-Lengthy process, I went through 6 interviews"
4,BetterUp,Amazing Culture and Mission!!!,2022-02-04,5.0,Senior Enterprise Account Executive,"The culture and mission at BetterUP are amazing! Everyone is really bought into making the world a better place through Technology, Science, and Coaching. I've worked in HCM space for over a decade and BetterUp is solving the problem that has plagued organizations for ever...and that is clearly connecting talent strategy to the business strategy. It's a really exciting opportunity to help people, organizations, and your own career grow through doing really important work.",There are no cons that I can think of...unless you just really don't like what I described in my pros review section?
5,BetterUp,Be forewarned…,2022-03-13,1.0,Manager,"Excellent benefits, generally feels inclusive (see ‘cons’), amazing mission (again see ‘cons’)..","There is serious misalignment between what the mission is all about and the actually application of it. I have heard horror stories of people getting yelled at, shamed, etc I  front of peers. Many of these reviews are written by new hires in the first week or so."
6,BetterUp,"Not great mid-level managers, but IPO golden handcuffs and company performance keep you going",2022-02-18,2.0,Analyst,"- Pay is about top 33% of industry standards. Potential for the company to pay top 10% overtime.

- CEO and COO are visionaries and listening them speak will motivate you.

- DE&I friendly. We practice what we preach here when it comes to inclusion.","- ""Nepotism"". Many of upper management are in positions they don't belong in because they are siblings with the founders or close friends with the founders leading to many employees not feeling comfortable enough to call out their biases.

- Sometimes the growth opportunities for the company can be scary for those that haven’t seen a company grow as fast as BetterUp has. We've hired many internal employees for management positions based off their potential to grow which is wonderful for their career development but requires their respective teams to be comfortable with incompetent management due to lack of leadership experience or actual job experience.

- Most of the reviews you'll read here are biased because the company asks you to post a review when you onboard (and you're still motivated). I've been here for 1+ years and I've seen many many people get fired or quit (non-covid related) because of the two reasons above."
7,BetterUp,Genuinely so happy I made the jump to BetterUp,2021-11-15,5.0,Strategy & Business Operations Manager,"Amazing people - The level of EQ and self-awareness of the BetterUp team is next level. That alone makes it a great place to work. But this team is not just empathetic and kind but extremely intelligent. If you're looking for a place with no chance of being the smartest person in the room - BetterUp is the place to be!

High Impact Business - We actually change peoples lives. How many companies can earnestly say that? 70% of sessions are ranked by members as life changing or amazing.

High Growth - It's such a rare opportunity to be at a company on a crazy growth trajectory and a privilege to experience.

They care about you - company wide 30 minute ""off screen"" breaks, Inner work days, coaches for you and a friend or family member, $1000 learning stipend - the list goes on, but BetterUp practices what they preach and they don't invest in you just as a worker, but as a human being.",Don't work here if you don't like being stretched to move faster and do the best work of your life
8,BetterUp,"Amazing Culture, Phenomenal Product, Bright Future",2021-10-14,5.0,Senior Enterprise Account Executive,"- The culture is strong and healthy at BetterUp. The organization truly practices what it preaches from the top down. The people here care about each other and the work we do. 
- Diverse employee base. My new hire cohort had people of all ages, races and stages of life. The organization does a great job attracting and retaining diverse candidates. 
- In depth interview process gives candidates the chance to understand if the organization will be a good fit. I had an amazing recruiter who walked me through the interview and hiring process. She was engaged and provided feedback within 24 hours after each step in the interview process. 
- The product is a disrupter and leader in the market. 
- There are a LOT of smart and fascinating people","- The organization has and continues to grow rapidly. This type of environment is not for everyone - if you are not agile and open to constant change, you will not thrive here."
9,BetterUp,Best Decision Ever,2022-02-22,5.0,Associate Recruiter,They truly walk the walk & talk the talk..I could not imagine working for any other company!,"Mostly remote..I would love to meet & see some of these amazing people on a more consistent basis, not just in video chats"
10,BetterUp,"Extraordinary team, actually lives by the values we push from a scientific standpoint",2021-11-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I wanted to wait until I worked here for a good amount of time and had a chance to see any ""dirty laundry"" before I shared my thoughts on what it's really, really like to work here. No workplace is perfect, but out of all the workplaces I've been at...BetterUp is the one that checks all these boxes for me (in no particular order): 

1. Supportive, emotionally-intelligent, high-performing people. There's no babysitting here. We trust each other to do high quality work, and understand that we are people before we're employees. I find myself constantly impressed by how multitalented people at BetterUp are. We have a culture of doing ""inner work"" or pursuing intentional rest, self-work, learning pursuits. And it shows. People here are seriously impressive, beyond the work we do 9-5.

2. Management that leads by example -- whether it's committing to promises, setting boundaries, or encouraging rest (we actually just had an All Hands meeting where our CEO talked to us about carving out intentional periods for rest and replenishment.) 

3. Growth trajectory and long-term viability of the company. 

4. A product that actually works, and a mission that's deeply impactful on a human level. It makes the work exciting, especially when you're given the flexibility to pursue projects based on your skills, growth areas and interests. 

5. A culture of learning. Work to learn is a big principle of ours here. We don't fail here. We learn. 

6. A sense of belonging. Not just from a DEI perspective (though we have had a really great framework around diversity, inclusion, equity, and belonging since even before 2020 when companies started to get savvy to it). Care for each person is a value of ours, and as the team grows and the culture adapts to include more people, we haven't lost that sense of caring for each person. Not in a one-size-fits-all way, but in a way that's actually respectful and not just performative.","This is a high-growth startup environment so there must be cons, right? I get most frustrated by unrealistic deadlines (especially when they're deadlines we've set somewhat arbitrarily ourselves). So we rush to do it, then decide last minute that it can't be done (because we've run out of time) -- so, we extend the timeline and now have to re-do the work to make it better than the rush job we just did. And it makes me wonder why we couldn't have just set a more realistic deadline to begin with to avoid having to do a rushed patch job just to get it through the finish line, then move the finish line, and have to do even more work to correct the rush job? 

Though I do appreciate that sometimes timelines need to shift, and out of everywhere I've worked, BU has been the most ""forgiving"" and understanding when it comes to adjusting for our capabilities and bandwidth, so I think this is a double-edged sword because I don't want to stick to a deadline just for teh sake of it. I'd just like better planning up front to understand if a deadline is reasonable."
11,BetterUp,Praciting what they preach!,2022-02-04,5.0,Account Manager,"BetterUp does a great job with onboarding and ensuring that members are prepped especially with being remote. I'm impressed with how every level of employees are truly doing their best to live the values and acting on sustainable work/life balance despite a fast-changing, fast-paced environment!","Very few but Tons of internal meetings. However, leadership does encourage everyone to own their calendar."
12,BetterUp,Incredible Company,2022-01-21,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"The values are not reviewed annually, they are lived and referenced daily.
The people genuinely care about you personally and professionally.
The manifesto of high impact behaviors create a radically wonderful culture of curiosity, drive, responsibility, and creativity.","The company is still a StartUp in certain ways so it does move fast and change often, but personally I find that to be exciting and a positive."
13,BetterUp,Great Place,2022-01-05,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"you actually get to use the product and it gives you a better sense of how to explain what we do to prospects. The environment is great, working with a good amount of PhDs really lets you learn more about the product and the space.",It is a startup and a lot of the processes are still being developed.
14,BetterUp,I love BetterUp!,2022-01-23,5.0,Customer Support Technical Lead,I've never worked anywhere that compares to the awesomeness of BetterUp! It's amazing to see so many smiling and happy faces when going to work.,"I'll have to think harder on this as none come to mind currently,"
15,BetterUp,Genuinely hard to be cynical in a place like this,2022-01-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Kind, passionate, and supportive colleagues
Mission-driven work
Incredible benefits including learning stipend, unlimited PTO, pet insurance...
Potential for professional growth
Flexible working arrangement",Fast company growth sometimes means cross-functional communication suffers
16,BetterUp,Great company for those driven to work,2022-01-27,4.0,Senior Enterprise Account Executive,"Amazing mission that is oriented around making a real and measurable impact in the world.
People are highly collaborative, smart, thoughtful, and kind.
Opportunities to make money are ample for those with a strong work ethic - and talent.","An undercurrent of burnout exists across the company. If you're not truly dedicated to what we're doing, it can be very difficult."
17,BetterUp,A Unicorn In More Ways Than One,2021-09-14,5.0,Recruiter/Sourcer,"I looked for companies that really spoke to me for a long time before I came to BetterUp. Coming from a stable, mission-driven place, I wasn't in desperate need of a new job/career. When I dug deeper and had countless conversations with the folks at BetterUp, I really understood that this was the best move for me. Within the first few weeks I was delighted to find out that it was a great fit. Maybe I'm in the honeymoon phase, but it's all been so rewarding so far. 

+Really strong, supportive culture that enables success
+Flexible working environment with multiple locations and remote opportunities
+Great pay/benefits/perks
+Tremendous opportunity to grow, learn, and be challenged
+Leadership with a clear vision and a roadmap to achieve success","-There's a lot of work to be done! It's more the volume than it is the pace, though we do move quickly."
18,BetterUp,Great place to work!,2022-01-14,5.0,Senior Consultant,Surrounded by really smart and caring people.,With hypergrowth comes limited internal processes and knowledge management
19,BetterUp,The best sales culture ever,2021-11-12,5.0,Sales,The leaders care about success of each person. Sales team is fun and high performing.  Product is amazing and customers see huge impact.  Comp plan is great.  Really a wonderful place to be.,"You get what you put in.  The work is hard and not for everyone. If you are not willing to roll up your sleeves and do the work, probably won’t be fit."
20,BetterUp,High expectations and BetterUp does not disappoint!,2021-06-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I had really high expectations coming into BetterUp based on everything I heard and researched, and it hasn't disappointed.

Great, super smart, group of people you can learn from and enjoy collaborating with. A genuine culture you can believe in, and values that I'm seeing play out everyday, from the top down.

BetterUp feels really agile, innovative and transparent, helped by the fact we use our own technology internally. Makes you feel very connected to the company, and able to effect change. If I had any skepticism coming in, it's been put aside as I see us 'eat our own dog food'. Having customers feel the same, certainly makes the work very rewarding.

Very excited by our trajectory, and seeing the tech/industry recognition as a result.","In a fast growth business, change is the only constant. You have to be willing and comfortable adapting, and have faith that leadership will manage the growth responsibly. So far that seems to be the case.

I'm sure things will pop up that will be a cause of frustration, but nothing I've experienced that not's insurmountable."
21,BetterUp,Great Company to work for!,2021-12-15,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"Culture is amazing, mental fitness really is an important topic, they actively encourage you to rest and take care of yourself","none really, just wish we could go to the office! People are amazing,"
22,BetterUp,DO NOT JOIN!,2021-11-01,1.0,Sales Representative,"Pay is decent, branding is great, they help people (clients, not employees)","Awful, fake culture, clueless sales organization... they do not care about their people - unless you are in the very inner circle that the top leaders chose. They are not honest with employees either - they lie, play games, test/watch/spy on employees...it's pretty nasty underbelly. Upper management has little sales experience and spwmd more time actively trying to get sellers to leave - versus supporting them and driving growth. More than once, leaders and consultants would meet with accounts - and cut out the sales people. If you're a salesperson with experience - steer clear of this organization as the targets, process, and deal timelines are unrealstic. Sales goals are not realistic and rarely achieved, yer they roll out the same playbook over and over, then fire people or nudge them out before stocks are vested."
23,BetterUp,"Visionary leadership, high performance culture, delighted customers, excellent product-market fit",2021-10-06,5.0,Sales,"I love selling the BetterUp platform. The people, culture and leaders are some of the brightest and best I have ever worked with. The company and product leaders are visionary and are always evolving our product to align to what our clients will need today and tomorrow, and our customers are renewing and expanding their partnership with BetterUp. The sales culture here is high-trust, high-autonomy, and high empathy. I feel like I can be myself with buyers and colleagues and there is no archetype of what makes a successful seller here. I always feel supported and enabled to do my best work. I have sold at many high-growth startups. This is by far the best experience.","We are moving fast and working here requires that I am strongly rooted in my personal purpose and passion for what we do. I believe in our product. I believe in our vision. I believe in our leaders. This allows me to bring my best self and performance to this work, amidst the rapid pace at which we are growing and evolving our product. I also get a dedicated executive coach to ensure I am safeguarding my well-being, authenticity, and performance at work. This is huge privilege and I cannot imagine working somewhere where I do not have access to a professional coach. BetterUp provides this resource, and it's been a game-changer for my personal and professional life."
24,BetterUp,"Hard to move, hard to develop",2021-10-13,2.0,Account Executive,"BetterUp is a market leader providing a service needed by nearly every Fortune 2000 company. After working in the HR tech world for 10+ years, I can confidently say that our product is the most coherent L&D coaching tool available. If nothing else, BetterUp is a disruptor.","Some internal middle managers are simply in over their heads. That does not bode well when go to market teams rely on these teams to close deals quickly and effectively. Newly formed deals desks team causes friction, legal team is poorly managed, and solutions consulting team is too rigid on rules of engagement. We simply cannot grow and scale with the current leadership in this areas, while competition outpaces and moves faster."
25,BetterUp,Flexible and Satisfying,2021-11-18,3.0,Executive Coach,"Great company to work for if you want to work from home, have lots of flexibility and do deeply satisfying work with high performing executives across the U.S.","Very modest hourly pay rate, and very little growth potential."
26,BetterUp,Still pinching myself,2021-06-14,5.0,Senior Account Executive,This organization is a dream come true. Imagine what it feels like not to dread going to work. The company is rooted in mindset and behavioral change in the workplace and they practice what they preach. They treat their employees like gold. They just get it!! Make your employees happy and they produce twice the amount of work. BetterUp has 6 core values that they actually practice in every single facet of the company. The care about your mental health - yes your mental health. They want us to be happy! They want to spoil us! It is a dream come true working here. The culture is infectious and positive.,We are still in start-up mode so there is always change around the corner. It's changing that we all get to weigh in on but change nonetheless. We are building and we are growing.
27,BetterUp,"Poor pay,",2021-11-29,2.0,Coach,BetterUp is a great place to work. The diversity and the company culture is applaudable.,"The biggest con is that the company pro rata the hourly pay for coaches. Coaching is run by intelligence and compassion. Whether the session is 30 minutes or 45 minutes, the effort taken by the coach is the same. I feel the contract stating the pay and providing a pro rata pay is not being transparent."
28,BetterUp,Fun past paced environment where you can make a real impact,2021-01-15,5.0,Behavioral Scientist,"I've really enjoyed my time at BetterUp. There is never a shortage of ways to make a real impact on the business. The services we provide to our members truly makes an impact and this makes it feel like we are all working towards a meaningful goal.

There is a really special culture here at BetterUp. Everyone I work with 
 is extraordinarily motivated and hard working. This makes working in large cross team projects really rewarding.

Ultimately although often the work can be tough, I feel that leadership makes a really conscious effort to help everyone maintain their well-being while working in the realities of a late stage startup. Personally BetterUp is a great fit for me as I get to balance rewarding work with a company that I feel truly cares.","As with any Startup everything at BetterUp moves fast. To succeed you have to be willing to navigate ambiguous situations and truly have an owner mindset. So many of my projects have had incredibly vague scopes and I feel that I am given a huge amount of decision latitude. I personally really enjoy this level of freedom and the ability to shape large initiatives that impact our business, but it can be overwhelming for others. If you are looking for a job where you have a well defined and stable role than you might not enjoy a role at BetterUp."
29,BetterUp,Amazing Culture,2021-11-04,5.0,Deployment Manager,"This company practices what they preach. I am surrounded by supportive, empathetic, smart, hardworking individuals",The typical start-up culture still exists. Lots of challenges to tackle with rapid growth
30,BetterUp,Life Changing Career,2021-11-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Everything so far has been wonderful.,"Not sure I can think of any, truthfully."
31,BetterUp,"Exciting company, lack of balance",2021-08-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Open-minded culture, the most transparent leadership I have seen, issues do get raised and resolved over time. And it's a very fast-paced organization, so I have seen myself and others grow and develop significantly.","Employees are highly encouraged to work evenings, weekends, and work / life balance is hard to maintain. Although we have extra days off, we come back to more work to catch up with... Employees are expected to act like owners to a high degree, and this actually blocks collaboration."
32,BetterUp,This is literally the BEST company in the world!,2021-07-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"BetterUp is true to its mission. They make sure that everyone in the company knows the value of Coaching & Development and how this impacts people not just professionally but most importantly, personally. Their core values are not just writings on the wall. THEY PRACTICE IT. Everyday. This company is what the world needs right now. Also, we work from home but we feel the support of everyone.","This company is really young but it has so much potential. For sure, in the coming weeks, we will see a lot of opportunities but that's how companies grow and with a team like this, I am positive every challenge will only make this company better."

BetterUp wants to do things thoughtfully so there will be a high bar that pushes you to really value crafts(wo)manship.","- It is a growing startup so we're developing and learning along the way. No company is perfect, but BetterUp has all the most sincere intentions of building teams and an environment that is reflective of really amazing values and mindsets.

It was a toxic, uninspired, and painful experience overall.
HR was non-existent. 
They laid off over 60 people in April of 2020 ""due to covid"" but countless people were pregnant women and many others were amazing longstanding good employees. The CEO was an egomaniac and could make anyone's skin crawl."

I came into the organization burnt out and in hyper stress mode. From the help of my BetterUp coach, which all employees get free access to, I learned to manage my stress and be more authentic and compassionate. I worked with a nutritionist to completely cut out coffee and get natural energy from foods (which is also a free benefit from BetterUp) The people I have met here really get me and I learn so much from their leadership and intentionality. Our Co-founders, Eddie and Alexi, are incredible and have chosen a leadership team that is diverse, conscious, and caring. Shout out to Duke, Karen, Ron, Gaurav, Tanisha and so many more who make BetterUp a special place to work!",It is a startup. You have to be ready to work at a start-up. My coach helps me set boundaries and speak my needs when my workload gets to be too much. When you start at BetterUp in the orientation they let you know that work-life balance is important and encourage strong boundary setting. It is also a group of very highly educated and motivated people - that can sometimes be intimidating but the benefits of that network and knowledge is so valuable.

Amazing teammates who are super smart and dedicated to helping others. Lots of opportunities for personal and professional growth. Even with everything going on in the world, I still look forward to working every day because we’re doing something really important to help people, particularly now. There’s been a lot of change at the company this year, including layoffs and some executive departures, which is never fun, but because of these tough changes we’re in a better position than ever before to enter our next phase of growth. I’ve been really impressed with the thoughtfulness and transparency with which all these changes were approached and communicated. I think our leadership team has done a good job of meeting the challenges we’ve faced as a company and making tough decisions that set BetterUp up for long term success.","We work really hard.

- Coach access is life changing","- There is a lot to do and no one will force you to say NO to work. Meaning, if you have the focus/self-motivation to manage your plate effectively and not worry about FOMO, and importantly have honest conversations with your manager, you will thrive. If you struggle with these things, you will run into a never-ending list of work, projects, etc. 
- There is always something to do, so if you don't unplug you will run into burn out. To manage this, you need to advocate for yourself, know that your manager has your back and that the company is not just providing lip service when encouraging employees to take time off, talk to manager about workload, etc."

There is a lot to keep up with, and as soon as you think you've got it, ten more things pop up and you're back to square one. There's a lot of doing things outside your role function because the teams are lean and there's no one else to do it. This is typical of startups, so I don't think BetterUp is unique here."

Some great company meetings have recently taken place.","You are expected to ""work like a CEO"" and it is not a joke. Many people are experiencing continuous burn out cycles and it is ignored. Working through vacations, inner works days and on nights and weekend is commonplace here. There is an unspoken culture that you aren't committed if express your concerns. It appears that BetterUp thinks this is okay behavior because they are a startup running lean and because we have the benefit of having a coach. I honestly believe that top leaders may just be unaware of the damage it's causing on employees' lives and used to working like CEOs themselves.

When asked, ""would you recommend BetterUp to a friend?"" I want to say yes but the reality is if you have a family or needs to met outside of work, this may not be the best place for you. Hopefully it one day will be since people inside care about making this a better place to be."
76,BetterUp,BetterUp is a great place to work - their leadership truly cares about improving the well being of their employees,2020-07-20,5.0,Business Analyst,"BetterUp has incredibly experienced and inspirational leadership that individual contributors can learn a lot from. These leaders truly care about the well being of the people who work for them, whether it is through giving them access to coaching sessions, stipends to use for any activity that involves learning, and several ""inner work"" days each year to be used in reflection. The work is also very motivating as you are helping to bring a high-quality offering to more individuals to help them achieve meaning too. I have a tremendous amount of respect for BetterUp and truly enjoyed working there. I would recommend it to anyone in any role.","Sometimes it can be tough to quantify the impact of the product, making it a little less motivating.

79,BetterUp,"Great people, but leadership is very hypocritical",2020-08-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I have worked with some if the amazing people throughout my whole career at BetterUp.,"So so many cons. My manager at BetterUp was constantly undermining my skills. They had the ""I am better than you, and will always be better than you"" attitude. During every single 1:1 they constantly made it known that I will never move up in my career and always made it known how they moved up the ladder, what Alexi and Eddie think of them, and how amazing they were. They never gave me a straight answer when I asked what I could do to improve. Additionally, the leadership team constantly says if we have ideas just to do it, with this manager EVERYTHING  we did had to go through them. Any small and minute change had to have the green light from the founders. Everything had to run up the leadership cascade, and leaders were constantly breathing over our shoulder. I felt constantly demeaned and was never able to speak my mind. 

They say they care, they will even send out surveys and ask us what they could do better or how we can be heard more. It's all a sham, nothing ever comes from that. Leadership does not care about you, they need you to constantly work and then blame you for not taking care of yourself."
80,BetterUp,Strong and Mission Driven Recruiting / Hiring Process,2020-12-01,5.0,Deployment Manager,I was recently hired and the recruiting/ hiring process was very organized and transparent about every step of the way. The recruiter and the recruiting coordinator were very responsive and worked with my schedule to make the interviews happen in a timely manner. I also felt very prepared every step of the way and knew a background on who I was meeting with. You meet with a panel of people so there are multiple sessions but it really gave me a strong idea of what the company culture was and who I could potentially working with.,You are meeting with multiple people so the hiring process does require a fair amount of time in your calendar.
81,BetterUp,Best Job I've ever had,2021-01-27,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"All star team, meaningful work, great collaboration, product and service that truly changes the world for the better, strong leadership, work to learn culture, great comp plan with aggressive accelerators for over performance, equity in an IPO bound rocket ship!",The market is still maturing to what BetterUp does. Many buyers don't have the budgets or infrastructure to fund at scale. Top of the funnel lead generation should be stronger. The sales cycle can be loooooong which equates to long ramp up time.

83,BetterUp,Amazing - not another corporate job!,2021-01-14,4.0,Program Manager,"This company believes in the quote, ""If you can dream it, you can do it."" It's been such a great opportunity to work in a place that not only empowers you to dream big but pushes you to realize those goals. The employees are ambitious, supportive, and caring. Leaders are open-minded, bold and zealous. Company culture is not about the office perks, it's about helping employees tap into their potential.","We're working in a company that is being built simultaneously.

86,BetterUp,"Personal and Professional Fulfillment, With A Side Of Burnout",2020-11-02,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Phenomenal product that is serving a great need in the individual professional development experience. Tremendous feedback, both from individuals and organizations, on how impactful their experience is utilizing BetterUp. Helps knowing your contributions are supporting the greater good. 

Co-workers are extremely passionate and caring individuals. Both leaders and individuals are there to support your personal and professional needs, which makes it an enriching work experience.","Fast Paced environment has steered the organization into making several poor strategic decisions. Been a revolving door of executive leadership in the past two years. Normally, the CEO will move trusted individuals apart of his inner-circle around to different departments, fulfilling a temporary need rather than focusing on long-term vision. Executives usually lack expertise in that line of business, which is glaring all across the board. Executive Leaders hired externally outside the organization have been a revolving door, and majority don't even make it a year before the CEO decides to put in one of his guys to run the department. 

A lack of career growth opportunities. While you may get a very challenging and rewarding professional experience working in this high growth startup environment, BetterUp is a workplace that lacks in career opportunity. This is especially true in the GTM organization. As the company has grown, they have emphatically decided to hire externally for positions with work experience in top companies. Leaders will never consider internal candidates who've demonstrated success for positions and have aspirations to grow. So the expectation is you remain ""in your seat"" until the organization restructures your team. While the organization will cite leaders receiving growth opportunities and promotions, it is reserved for the C-Level and Upper Management. 

This lack of growth and recognition leads to the adverse effect of Burnout. BetterUp's strenuous work environment moving at a rapid pace, with no clear career development path, has led to a tired and burnout workforce. Even the executive team knows its a problem. They don't provide long-term solutions, instead just encourage their employees to take a vacation and utilize their coach to work through challenges. There have been more individuals that I know have left the organization voluntarily now then in any point in the organization's work history, despite the lack of stability in the hiring market currently. People are tired of constantly running around the hampster wheel, and I don't blame them for it."
87,BetterUp,Be ready to learn,2020-10-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"My previous career experience runs the gamut from seed-stage startups to large companies. BetterUp has been by far the most human, supportive, and growth-oriented experience I’ve had. I’m intensely engaged, I get to challenge myself, I’m inspired by my team, sometimes I cry, I laugh a lot, the people are outstanding, victories are sweet. 

Using the lens of big company experience, there are a few things that stand out: It is a goal-oriented environment, which means constant building and stretch opportunities. When I’ve hit milestones it’s always on to the next which means I’m in a constant state of learning (i.e. that vulnerable discomfort of not knowing what I’m doing...yet). Hence, compared to a large company, no one is a cog here. If something feels wrong or off then we are empowered to fix it; whether that requires a candid conversation, a data-driven decision, or a process improvement. It is not a place to think inside the box of your role or to be a victim (in my experience, large companies can be places that normalize victimhood), rather, it is a place where I have been repeatedly inspired to have an impact professionally and to develop as a person.

From the perspective of working at startups, BetterUp really impresses me for having it’s stuff together. It is built thoughtfully and on a solid foundation with the values and behaviors streamed seamlessly into everyday language. I continue to be impressed by how crystal clear leadership is in terms of goals, and the transparency with regard to how to achieve those goals. In that sense, it’s the most organized and intentional startup I’ve worked at. 

BetterUp also feels extremely family-friendly. Folks like to have fun but it’s not a “work hard play hard” culture by any stretch. There is broad age diversity and people with families of all stages. I’ve never experienced this at a startup, even late-stage startups. For the first time ever as a parent, I take “inner work days” for myself because BU provides the space to do so. It’s been revolutionary for me, personally. In addition to inner work days, the values, atmosphere, and coaching have taught me a ton about positive psychology which has spread into my family life. 

Speaking of family-friendly, the response to the pandemic was impressive. Parents were given an individualized “intake” with their managers and asked questions like how to accommodate schedules, workloads, emotional support, and technology needs for our kids… they even provide an Outschool benefit! 

The commitment to D&I is sincere. Much of the VP level leadership are women and C-level is diverse as well. The COO/co-founder (who happens to be an immigrant from Peru) has taken on an additional role as Head of D&I which in and of itself demonstrates the level of investment they are willing to make. 

In summary, I’m extremely appreciative of my experience here so far and am very optimistic about the future of this company. BU has given me an education in positive psychology and business best practices accompanied by the tools to apply those lessons; as a result, I have career confidence that I've never had before. Also the founders are brilliant (it's kind of intimidating but so cool).",Nowhere is perfect… what would that even look like? I think we’d do well to have more women at the C-level.
88,BetterUp,"A Passionate, Mission-Driven Company",2021-03-16,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"BetterUp has a very efficient recruiting and onboarding process.

89,BetterUp,Company that lives and breathes its values,2019-11-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Highly intentional company. Most startups build fast, sell fast, hire fast... all with a semi-mediocre strategy/plan. BetterUp does a really great job in being thoughtful early on around building the right infrastructure ahead of most startup's curve/track today. The competition for company growth is constant, but BU seems to want to get things right from the start before scaling too quickly and retroactively fixing/building things most other startups miss during the early stages. I've been a part of my fair share of startups and I'm impressed by the work that was put into things that most companies don't care about until later stages in their growth (ie. new hire onboarding, huge investment in manager training, great employee benefits, resources/frameworks for performance reviews). Beyond that, the people are amazing... you're surrounded by highly intelligent individuals with Ph.Ds, experience from successful Big Tech companies and consulting firms... and most importantly, the people here are kind, highly empathetic, and intrinsically motivated by the mission. There are Inner Work days, All-Hands kick off with a 2-min personal meditation, and a push for knowledge sharing beyond the work place (readings on self-development, personal BetterUp coach, learning stipends, etc) I actually feel like I've found company that isn't *only*  interested in what I can produce and execute on, but one that cares about my own personal/professional development.",Remote teams may have difficulty connecting with each other due to pace of company.

* Great and unique benefits
* Had a manager great at validation","There are two main struggles right now at BetterUp:
1. BetterUp leadership has resisted the move towards a mid-stage company
2. BetterUp organization has created a huge misalignment of values, morals and behaviors

What does this mean in practice?
1. Trying to run a company of 200 like a company of 20 with all the leadership gatekeeping and micromanagement that brings…
2. BetterUp was very intentional of the people they have hired along morals, values, behaviors, etc. In 2020, for whatever reason, these practices and behaviors are represented in action no more. If someone represents these values and speaks up… you WILL get pushed out or put down regardless of whether you are a VP or an engineer IC.

What does this reality look like for the people currently working there? Read these quotes from discussions with others:
* “I fear retaliation if I express dissent”
* “My health has been severely (negatively) affected by my job”
* “I feel there is inequity in opportunities and rewards due to my identity”
* “My performance is measured using Github and JIRA as the primary metrics” (everyone knows this is bunk)
* “My manager does not consult my team about my performance, even though they are not on my team.”
“I feel pushed out due to my medical condition""

This feedback has been consistently brought to managers, HR, through company processes, anonymously and directly to C-suite on multiple occasions. These are the resulting actions:
* Multiple people are fired or 'leave'
* These challenges have not been addressed or given voice at team/org/company meetings
* Equity concerns are buried despite a very active and visible DEI/BLM initiative
* Requests for feedback used by leaders to find the detractors
* Confidentiality of employees has been breached by HR on occasion

Does this sound like a Positive Psychology company with integrity, which lives what they preach?

Advice to interviewers:
* Be very skeptical of the story leadership, Founders and HR tell you. It is convincing, but is it true?
* Ask about how they ensure accountability of leaders to reports.
* Ask about how deadlines are used.
* How they have built equity into their performance processes?
* How is data used in product decisions?

You will likely get the 'right' answer, but it is on you to determine if it is 'truth'.

If Fred Kofman saw how BetterUp was operating... I wouldn't be surprised if they ethically couldn't stay an Advisor."

111,BetterUp,Passion and Purpose,2020-02-19,5.0,Senior Recruiter,"Working at BetterUp has been one of the most transformational experiences I have had professionally. The work itself is challenging and fun, the people are intellectual and empathetic, and the community is engaging and warm. I feel so lucky that I have been able to work at BetterUp for a year and a half in now two different positions. The leadership team is thoughtful and caring while also making great decisions for the business.","BetterUp is hard work! We have a big mission and want to bring that mission to people around the world. This definitely is not a ""clock in, clock out"" environment. A great place to work if you genuinely want to build. Not so great if you are looking to just get a paycheck."
112,BetterUp,Layoffs left a bad taste in my mouth,2020-04-23,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have a strong belief in the product offering at BetterUp -- coaching and the self-development platform are amazingly impactful for the employees that receive it, and the companies that pay for it. The company has invested heavily in behavioral science, meaning that there is a real focus on driving positive outcomes (and not just engagement). 

BetterUp also has a very good remote work culture.","I don't fault BetterUp for doing layoffs during this unprecedented time. This is an extremely hard time for businesses in general, and BetterUp has not been meeting its revenue growth targets even prior to COVID-19. I get it, they needed to drastically reduce costs. 

With BetterUp's mission to, ""help professionals everywhere pursue their lives with greater clarity, purpose, and passion"", I expected the company to be an exemplar of approaching layoffs in a humane way. Instead, it felt cold and calculating, with little recognition of the humans that were impacted. BetterUp also had one of the first layoffs among the cohort of Silicon Valley growth-stage firms, and there was little mention of other ways to significantly cut costs before the layoff.  I've also heard from remaining employees that many have lost significant trust for the leadership team due to how this was handled.

After reading the letter from Carta's CEO about their layoff, I can see very clearly the gap between what a candid but humane approach might look like, and the cold distant approach BetterUp actually took. 

My recommendation to candidates: BetterUp is still a pretty good place to work, but remember that it is a business first and don't be fooled into thinking all the positive psychology talk will save you from a sink-or-swim workplace."
113,BetterUp,A sinking ship in a blue ocean.,2020-07-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Outside of the executive team, we have some incredibly smart and amazing people.","-CEO is EGOtistical and believes he’s the smartest person in the company. He has to go. 

-Culture: over the last 2 yrs I’ve personally seen our culture do a 180. The executive team likes to sound as if they’re collaborative but all ideas fall on deaf ears due to the dictatorship.

-The executive team is constantly changing GTM strategies and COVID-19 has really exposed us.  One minute it’s leadership development, the next it’s resilience, D&I. We’re lost.

Every single internal call I’ve had the last 4-5 has been one of fear, doubt and uncertainty because my colleagues and I don’t know where we’re headed and wondering if we’ve hit the “iceberg.”"

We are determined to better the lives of professionals everywhere. With this important mission, it is imperative that the company treat its own employees well and show care for their development. Luckily, this is the case with BetterUp! Everyone seems to be unified in their connection to the mission, there is a respect for work-life balance, and management truly cares about its employees.",No real cons.

117,BetterUp,"Not perfect, but the best company I have worked for",2020-07-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Starting with the mission and product, both are genuine and easy to support even on a day when people or processes may feel more difficult. The maturity and professionalism of the solutions consultants (I/O psychologists running the research behind BetterUp) is very clear, and I feel confident talking to people outside BetterUp about our effectiveness. I consider that a huge pro!

The current size of the organization also allows for jump-level mentoring/feedback, which is readily given (and as at any organization, you receive more when you ask for it). Since the pandemic started, and especially with concern over the layoffs, company calls have increased in cadence and changed in structure to bring added transparency.

Additionally, I have had psychological safety to express concerns and ask for help from my manager. I do know that there are others who don't have this (which would be true at any company), but the safety is more present here than at previous companies I worked for. There are also steps being taken to do an internal audit and ensure that psychological safety, employee experience, and belonging are at a healthy state across the company (i.e. using BetterUp for BetterUp). 

Finally, I saw previous comments about benefits and perks and have no complaints in this area, including with my comp package. The coaching access is definitely worth noting, as we have access to 7 different types of specialists that we can meet with as often as we'd like (i.e. sleep, diversity & inclusion).","I do agree that there were glitches with how the layoffs were handled, and with recent shuffles in the org structure, the C-suite is much more heavily male than when I joined. There are also times when it seems clear that work has stayed siloed, and departments are ships in the night with changes to process, wasting some time and edits that could have been avoided if there was better collaboration upfront. I hesitate to say this last one is a con because it comes with the territory of being a growing 200-employee company, but there is constant change. If anything, just keep that in mind before joining BetterUp in the midst of an exhausting world pandemic!"

119,BetterUp,not an inclusive company - rewards abuse to hide real employee experience and business issues,2020-08-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are some very kind, smart, and dedicated individuals in the organization. Helping people have access to a coach and creating resources to learn more about themselves (especially in pursuit of better wellbeing) is a noble mission. I will always support that mission.","My manager at BetterUp was abusive, abrasive, and created a hostile work environment. He never hesitated to point out that I didn’t belong- constantly bringing up that I not only was the only woman on the project team, but that he also had friendships and relationships with other team members that he would never let me be a part of. Discriminatory and disrespectful remarks became a part of every 1:1. He told me on several occasions he did not want me to publicly contribute because he did not want to have to give me credit in what he believed should only be “his successes”. He did not respect any personal boundaries. When I had skip-level meetings or coffee chats with other co-workers, he would force me to tell him almost verbatim what we talked about, and never believed my descriptions (even when the conversations were casual and often not even about work). It was manipulative. I felt stuck, scared, and afraid to talk to anyone. I poured myself into the work but the daily abuse affected both my physical and mental health. 

Unfortunately, his behavior was not only tolerated by the company, but it was also rewarded by leadership. In addition, there were no changes to ensure this never happens again: no changes to employee training, no changes to promotion-to-manager practices, nor an open discussion with me on how to rebuild safety. It was made clear to me that protecting his ego (and the team’s reputation) was more important than addressing the issues. I was silenced, and I was not the only one to be treated poorly. Apparently, it is easy for leadership to continue to sweep this inappropriate behavior under the rug. 

I am extremely disappointed. I don’t think my experience represents everyone’s experience at BetterUp but I do wish my experience had been filled with the belonging, inclusion, and the compassion that I (and my work) deserved. Abuse of power is not acceptable anywhere - but it certainly is not okay in a supposedly forward-thinking workplace which claims to be dedicated to helping people. At the end of the day, BetterUp is an organization that simply does not uphold the values that they project out to the world. Despite having many opportunities to take corrective action, BetterUp demonstrated protecting employee belonging and safety is not important to them."

The pace and the demands can be stressful. Wow there is a lot of fun and excitement about what we are doing, there’s a lot of stress too. Every moment matters, every project managers every client matters and this can lead to demanding to work situations where the stakes are high.

121,BetterUp,Bad leadership making selfish decisions,2020-06-25,1.0,Operations,"The people at BetterUp are phenomenal. I was so lucky to have worked with some of the greatest folks i've ever met in my career. Good mission, in theory.","BetterUp will preach helping professionals live fulfilling lives but they don't care about your growth or career. At all. You'll be expected to work ALL THE TIME and will probably be underpaid unless you have a PhD, used to be a consultant or are a buddy/ family member of the C-suite. They tout running lean teams which is just their excuse for having everyone working 80+ hour weeks. Sure, they give you holidays and innerwork days but everyone just ends up working through those days too. When you bring up burnout, you're just told that it's your responsibility to make sure you take time off or carve out time for self care and innerwork to make you more efficient. 

The benefits and perks are not competitive with the rest of tech industry. Health benefits are pretty poor and forget about things like a cell phone allowance *unless you're in sales* even if you have to use your personal phone for work all the time. 

The founders act like they're humble but are on a power trip and unless you're one of their family members or within their inner ""buddy buddy"" circle you will never be able to get ahead in this company. They don't think twice to spend large amounts of money on ridiculous toys or costumes but when it comes to investing in their people, they're incredibly miserly. The whole operation is a side-show on wheels. 

P.S.  I left on my own and was not part of the layoffs so this review is not in retaliation."

That said employees work hard here and bring a great mix of talent and empathy to the table every day.  People at every level of the organization are encouraged to learn and understand the company strategy and how their day to day work fits into that overall picture. BetterUp invests heavily in helping facilitate this understanding through paid training sessions.",BetterUp is a growth stage startup which has a certain level of risk associated with it.

161,BetterUp,"Wonderful group of people, wonderful mission",2022-02-04,5.0,Software Engineering Manager,"- the practices and focus on ""inner work"" (self health) is powerful, and real
- I can see myself working here for many years (for the first time at a job)
- Upper management is very, very strong. I haven't seen them do anything without a clear reason. They are also disciplined which is a contrast to what I've seen in other startups
- all promises, and things said in the interview have came to pass","- it's busy! We are encouraged to take time for ourselves, but it seems like there is always more work to do than time to do it - so we must be disciplined to not let inner work slip
- I see some people who have amazing balance in their lives, and some that struggle with this. I think this is a function of being hyper growth. 
- I think they do very well, given their constraints - but it's important to know that these challenges exist if you have some hard constraints on your time"

168,BetterUp,Best Company I have Ever Worked At!,2021-11-14,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"Amazing Culture- Betterup's mission is to ""help people live with clarity, purpose and mission"" as an employee I can say they intend to accomplish this, the work behind the scene to accomplish this very evident and everyone in the company is working hard to make this come true. There is a one team mentality and the focus on ""Work to learn"" is very evident across the company.

Great Leadership- I recently joined and I cant say how many where leadership truly care for their team. They are the best at what they do but don't have any arrogance about it and have a sense of self belief in their ability so don't need to over compensate by trying to bend you to their will. 

Diversity & Inclusion- This is a company I can say that focuses on belonging as a core value, and you can tell that if you look at a room of betterupers it is very diverse and a big change for me coming from companies where I found it hard to fit in

You Matter- At BetterUp everyone has a voice and from my first week at the company, I was pitching new ideas that was listened to by the company and to have this opportunity is very rare for most companies. I appreciate that and feel empowered in my role and in the company.","I can't find any so far, what I can say this is a hypergrowth startup and so there will be loads of changes if you choose to join and you need to have the mindset of extreme ownership in order to excel here. I enjoy this challenge and look forward to it but if you are used to"
