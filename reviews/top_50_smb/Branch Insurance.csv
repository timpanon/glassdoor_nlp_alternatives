1,Branch Insurance,Amazing culture - great vision - lots of fulfilling work to do,2022-03-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"What you see online regarding culture is real. The company is very intentional about it, making sure associate engagement, transparency and well-being are a top priority.

The work is very fulfilling. You feel like you're accomplishing meaning task every day and due to the fast growth of the company, you see immediate results. It definitely keeps it fun and interesting.

Compensation is the most fair and equitable that I've ever seen at a company. The bonus structure is really nice and the work flexibility is amazing.","Because the company, and some departments are relatively new, there has been a lot of working in the business without the team built out to work on the business. That has all changed a lot over the last few months but when you first start, it can be a bit overwhelming. There are a lot of systems and not a lot of standard operating procedures - just yet. The beauty of it all is that we get to have our finger prints on it as we build it and if you're prepared for that and can be flexible, it can be one of the most rewarding parts of what we do."
2,Branch Insurance,Supportive and Rewarding,2022-03-14,5.0,Insurance Sales Agent,"Since Day 1 with the company I have been nothing but in awe of the engagement and transparency they have given. You work hard, you get rewarded graciously. 

I've worked at a couple different insurance companies and not one compares to Branch when it comes to pay and incentive. 

They're with you one step at a time to help you achieve your goals, and when you're having a hard time they're supportive and focus on the work, not the numbers.","I've only been here since November, and had 3 different managers w/in a 3 month time period. Consistency is important to me when it comes to leadership bc everyone has a different style of teaching, I was able to express these concerns and they were listened to. No major cons, everyone's doing the best they can."
3,Branch Insurance,Fantastic Company!,2022-01-11,5.0,Agency Success Manager,"I can't say enough about how great, transparent, and supportive Branch has been in my short time with the company. 

Branch is on a mission to restore insurance back to its original intent by being a source of communal good - and I will say, this would not be possible the right people leading the Branch. 

Each individual I have met with in our remote work environment have been so incredibly wonderful and welcoming with our arms. No question, no idea is ever unwarranted. If you bring idea or question to the table, it is actually heard. 

I could go on and on about the pros of Branch but I will end with saying, I have never been happier. We have an extremely positive work environment that respects you, which is not only reflected in the salary + amazing benefits, but how each individual treats each other across ever channel, including our amazing leadership team.

Trust me when I say, there's a reason why Branch won the best startup culture award for 2021!","We truly are an insurtech start up - things are constantly changing almost by the minute.

It is a privilege to work with this team, and I feel truly valued by my peers and superiors.","I would say that a role at this company would not be a good fit for someone who struggles with remote work, or juggling multiple priorities.
