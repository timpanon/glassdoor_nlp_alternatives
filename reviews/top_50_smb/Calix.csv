We have quarterly recharge days and no meeting Fridays to provide time for everyone to focus on doing their best work and being the best version of themselves. When I joined, I wasn't told exactly what to do, but encouraged to explore, learn about our offerings and focus on what excites me. There is a serious team mentality across the company. If there is a question you have or something you need, everyone pitches in, cross functionally. You really feel like everyone has your back! As for compensation, I felt like I was asking for the moon when I told them my requirements, but it was not a problem and they even offered above what I asked for. As far as technology, I received new high end equipment (huge monitors, new fast laptop, latest new cell phone and more) sent to my house, along with a spending allowance, to build out my home office how I see fit.","I'm not a fan of Apple products, but everyone who gets a company cell phone must use an Apple iPhone as it is a non-negotiable standard."

12,Calix,Calix is as TOXIC as a sales culture as they come! BEWARE,2021-11-10,1.0,Sales,Products teams are good to work with.,"1) They lie and deceive from the moment you are offered a position after a grueling interview process. You. can not trust the data and they are a toxic hot mess especially in large accounts. 

2) The culture is MICRO management from the president Michael Weening and CEO Carl Russo on down. Expect to work 80 hours a week , weekends, and constant berating from management. 

3) They have no clue how to set goals, let alone pay you. Expect that deals you sell will take 9-12 month to ship and they only pay you in arrears after shipment. 

4) To compensate they put you on a recoverable draw to which they pay 80% of plan unless you never meet the 4X inflated quota numbers. Then cut you off until you quit and then expect to recover money from you. 

5) Expect when you leave, and it is always a matter of time, (They only showcase on this website the longer tenure people) you will be part of the revolving door. I have never been apart of such a toxic environment ever! 

6) If you ever look up the dictionary definition of arrogant or pompous- Calix leadership should be the first thing that comes up!"

This is the best team I've ever been a part of. Everyone is smart, strong in their expertise and extremely capable, as well as collaborative, kind and respectful. It's a very special combination that doesn't happen by accident. The senior leadership team has done an incredible job cultivating this fun, dynamic and engaging group. Internal communication is second to none. In my short time, I have seen a clear focus on professional development, continuous improvement, mental and physical health awareness and work-life balance from the leadership team. The benefits are robust and it's easy to find support when you need it.","The team is experiencing some growing pains, but leadership is aware and has engaged strategic teams to improve the onboarding and training programs. There is no shortage of information available, it's just a matter of packaging it into an easy to follow onboarding program. There are a lot of team meetings, which helps to keep the teams engaged and communicative, but it does create a cluttered calendar, and you must be extremely comfortable with spending multiple hours each day on Zoom calls."

30,Calix,A culture that can't be beat,2021-11-01,5.0,Senior Manager,"The people and the culture are second to none. Everyone at Calix genuinely cares for each and every other employee, whether or not they've ever interacted with each other.

Clearly defined guidance for professional progression

Leaders that genuinely want their direct repots to succeed and empower them to do so.

Calix strives to show their employees how much they're valued! The culture is great and all the staff are friendly and welcoming. Work/life balance and compensation are great. 

As a Systems Engineer I'm a continuous learner of technologies and Calix has not only provided me with new learning opportunities, but they're willing to invest in how far you want to take it. You're also not micromanaged and trusted to do your job. New ideas are always welcomed.

The benefits are also amazing such as great health coverage, unlimited PTO, and lifestyle (well-being) benefits. I don't feel there's enough I can say about this company and the great leadership.

38,Calix,Work at calix,2021-11-29,5.0,Software Engineer,A better salary and work benefits,Teamwork and communication are not very good
39,Calix,"Good Now, but Worried About Near Future",2021-11-07,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Rating at 3: I would put 5, but it could drop to 1 very soon.

Calix treats their employees very well. This is from an R&D perspective. Pay and benefits are very good, but the typical annual raises tend to be hit-or-miss. The stock plan is excellent, don't miss out on that. Benefits are very good. The work-life balance is excellent. They allow, at least for now, full remote work and have been smart about that since COVID started. The immediate work environment has is very good... right now (see 'cons').

As a SW engineer, you'll have a lot of autonomy and immediate lower-mid management is very good, no complaints there. Coworkers are very friendly. There are a lot of old-school software styles here, so there is a very rich learning opportunity about Linux embedded environments in C. You will view ""modern"" programming and languages very differently after working here. The software we write is (currently) very clean and maintainable.","Please read the 'pros' section first. With that said, there is currently in-planning a new development work environment that is occurring without care or the affect it will have on engineering. Does developing in a zero-internet Linux virtual machine window with restricted editor choice and no copy/paste sound appealing to you? Of course not, you're not crazy. Does developing in an environment where you cannot even evaluate open-source code, say looking at a security update for an existing library we use, without going through a new undefined bureaucracy process to have someone else ""scan that source"" and then wait a week for it to be evaluated before copied to a secure server for you to use, and have your Jira-ticket in-progress time ever increasing meanwhile? No, because you've stopped reading this review at this point and dismissed the idea of working here. You have 5 new daily messages from other recruiters on LinkedIn to look at, and they're offering companies that don't play games like this.

Calix is an old-school company that likes to act like a ""startup"" and tries their hardest to keep up with the times, they really do, which brings a weird mix of attitudes from upper management. The above decision to ""secure our IP"" (its not about that, we know) is one of the new ideas they have that come from their old-school world. They're not making the connection that we're an internet company, that provides internet services, that works with languages and libraries and technologies that inherently use the internet and that, believe it or not, their engineers need to use the internet to do that. ""Want to develop something new in Rust? Nope, can't do that now, since you can't connect to Cargo's package management"" <- Upper management doesn't know what these two sentences mean, and that's a problem. They're making decisions without understanding what their engineers actually do. This decision when fully implemented will directly impact any new innovation, will cause massive engineering delays, and have the only overall accomplishment of aggravating your existing R&D teams. They're not understanding that they need to strike a balance between the security they want and user usability, and their plan is currently way too heavy on one scale."

That is core to everything the company has done. You feel it from the top down.

To achieve that, we have become a fully virtual culture with work-from-anywhere across the company, very transparent from the CEO down with constant communication on the good and bad and a clear focus on hiring and retaining the best talent. I love that part of our culture.

The company is all about teamwork, no politics and people having each others backs as we make our customers successful.

It is a great team and amazing culture.","We work hard - as a team. If you are looking for a 9-5 job, this is not it. In my entire. career, I have never had a 9-5 job and great teams don't work that way. We are doing hard things, as we change the company - that means commitment. 

As a company, we are disrupting our industry, which means that we take risks and as we find our way to that new market model, there can be ambiguity. Not everyone is suited for that (It is common in a start-up but less so in a half-billion-dollar company - but it is our reality). Through that we expect team members to help us find that path, make the way and lead the company."

I have been fortunate during my time here to work in a few different groups and learn SO much about myself and my career. Calix as a culture is all about pushing ourselves to the next thing. Whether that is pushing into a new role in the company or into a new market. We have been through a giant shift over the past few years from a hardware to software company. That change wasn't for everyone and it was difficult at times. However, the leadership team guided us through this transition and we are now poised for amazing things. If you want to be at a growth company helping our customers transform their business (and don't mind some hard work) then Calix is for you!","Change is hard, and we've been through a lot of it over the past few years. That means making hard decisions about people who might not be a good cultural fit going forward. One of our key tenets is ""we take care of our own"". That means when someone is struggling we as a culture lift them up. However, that also means holding each other accountable and if you want a job that is the same all the time then this isn't the place for you."

Communication. You would think this would be lacking in a company that's so largely focused on working from home, but I feel very much like I'm part of a team here. Calix prefers to over-communicate, so you never wonder what's going on.

Contrary to some previous reviews, I feel that I have a great work-life balance. Most days I don't have to work over 8 hours. I don't feel that I'm expected to be online 24/7.

There were many knee-jerk high-level decisions made to go ""all-in"" in one direction, only for it to cause more issues than it resolved.  Rather than management learning from the mistakes made, they were ""rip the band-aid off quick"" and terminate lower-level employees to cover the costs.  The company felt like it transitioned from the best in the industry to one that wasn't sure where it was headed, and solely led by marketing to sell products and services that just weren't there yet.  The buzzwords being thrown around were lean and agile but honestly, that was just everyone working 80 hour weeks along with Saturdays with no extra compensation.  There were times when we were asked to blow money before quarter-end, only to lay people off the following week.  That was the straw that broke the camels back with me."

This is because you want to do your best to help the company obtain its goals.  It is so easy to get lost in what you are doing... yes it is that interesting.
150,Calix,"Great People, Products & Positioning",2020-11-17,5.0,Cloud Solutions Specialist,Interview process is very thorough which leads to hiring great people!,I started working very recently but I don't see any negatives yet!
151,Calix,Empowering Company,2020-11-17,5.0,Systems Architect,Brilliant CEO and a culture that encourages challenging conventional wisdom and rewards taking calculated risks.,Can't think of any cons. Maybe that telecom and access is considered 'boring' when it can be anything but.
152,Calix,Positive reviews through executive coaxing,2020-07-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,A lot of talented hard working people work there. The pay is decend and so are the benefits. Bonus is also paid out often.,"Do not fall for this high rating, this does NOT reflect what Calix is actually like. The executive team is essentially asking employees to go on glassdoor and ""show how much you love working here"" which is why it has gone from a 3.6 to 4.7 in just a couple months (notice the massive surge in 5.0's). As for working there, prepare for constant restructuring , poor interdepartmental communication, no rasie/bonus structure (you may or may not get a raise that year depending on whether or not your manager feels like it). Mismanaged yearly/quarterly review system that changes all the time. Increasing amounts of cronyism. Poor to no vision from middle management. Product marketing takes precedence over product quality. If you join engineering prepare for your voice to not be heard; 'you get paid to be an engineer, not give opinions'. Saw plenty of talent leave out of frustration with the direction of the company (or lack thereof)."
153,Calix,Excellent company to work in a fast paced environment,2020-11-28,5.0,Principal Software Engineer,"Great work culture, transparent flow of information and great management",You have to give your 100% all the time
154,Calix,I've found a home at Calix,2020-04-22,5.0,Software Applications Developer,"I get to work with good people who are also extremely talented.
I feel empowered to be creative with the solutions I build.
I'm treated with respect and given the space to complete my tasks.
My manager and team as a whole supports one another and steps up to help whenever needed.
Leadership makes you feel appreciated for the work you do.
Executives are transparent in their communications about the company.
Fast-paced environment.","I enjoy the fast-paced environment, but there are times it can result in having to quickly shift gears from what you were working on before you've finished."
155,Calix,Clear mission for the company in this time of the pandemic crisis.,2020-04-06,5.0,Principal Engineer,"As this pandemic ravages our public health and economy the world is relying on broadband networks to continue working and connecting.  At Calix EVERYONE feels the satisfaction of being part of a company that has provided the infrastructure that allows millions of homes/businesses/educational-institutions to receive high speed broadband internet.  The mission at Calix is clear and the long term prospects for the company are improving.

Calix adopted a work-from-home, flexible culture before it was a business necessity brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Engineering teams are lean, but well funded and focused.

Visionary executive management that is transforming the company from a classic 'telecom purple box seller' to a systems/software company.",Poor stock performance over the past ten years since IPO.
156,Calix,An outstanding place to work,2020-04-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Leadership cares about employees.
Leadership cares about the customer and their success. Calix does not just pay lip-service. Pay is competitive and benefits are on par. People are good quality and talented. Leadership has vision and shares it to those who are in the trenches moving forward on the front lines.","Nothing that you would not find at any HW/SW company. Many of the issues are the same everywhere, Always have time/resource pressures. Having said that I don't see any ""cons"" that are unique to Calix. If I was pressed I would say that Sales and marketing has a bit too much sway on influencing committed development plans and schedules. Can be disruptive when ""emergencies"" arise."
157,Calix,"strategy, tactics, internal communications, and employee goals aligned",2020-04-30,5.0,"Senior Director, Analytics Management","Calix has emerged as a very strong player with a unique and defensible business plan after a painful few years of strategic and operational restructuring. Now is a great time to be at Calix.

The leadership team is open and honest about the business plan and communicates how the tactical results are aligned to our financial and strategic operational plans.

Calix has spent the last couple years retooling our infrastructure and processes to support a largely remote workforce and we continue to evolve these processes.

Our leadership sets the strategic direction and lets the team direct and influence the specific projects and tasks to meet this strategy.
Individual performers are recognized and given opportunities to grow both their skill sets and scope within the organization -- if they are motivated to do so.

Leadership is looking for individuals to help the company ""learn"" our way forward -- they don't expect individuals to have the exact relevant experience -- which is not possible in many highly volatile markets or technology situations. 

We have a high percentage of leaders and employees that are smart, willing to listen, and know that they don't know everything.

The Employee stock purchase plans and health plans are very generous and competitive.

I like the fact that the bonus plans are tied to company performance and individual performance.","Not necessarily cons -- but words of advice if you want to succeed at Calix:

If you need the comfort of a ""static"" job with relatively little change -- then Calix is not the place for you. You need to be willing to learn new ways of improving (and therefore changing) your work processes.

If you just want to ""clock in and clock out"" without contributing to the bigger picture and be willing to learn how you can help improve the overall plan at Calix --then this is not the place for you. It requires effort to look beyond the scope of your immediate role and tasks.

If you are unable to adapt to a remote work situation where you need to be self monitoring of your work output -- then Calix is not the place for you.

You will work hard so make sure you are in (or working towards) a role that you enjoy at least 75% of your tasks so that you can spend time in a ""flow"" state instead of in a ""oh my god I have to get this done"" state."
158,Calix,A great team that is leading the transformation of the industry,2020-04-06,5.0,CMO,"Great customers who are very loyal and care deeply about their communities.

252,Calix,A once good company going down in flames,2018-04-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Dog-friendly office
- Occasional work from home
- Great coworkers
- Office perks
- Good health care coverage
- Break room provides endless coffee and drinks, fruit once a week. Now providing donuts and bagels some Fridays.","- No raises in 2 years
- Sporadic, tiny bonuses
- No job security--they're cutting valuable staff left and right with no plan for replacements or workload sensitivity.
- No work/life balance. Meetings could be as early as 7am and as late as 9pm. New venture partnership with India company makes meetings during valuable family time a regular occurrence, and heavily east coast upper management means early meetings for those on the east coast. 
- Weekend work is expected.
- Marketing and sales promise the world, but there is little support for actually getting the promised deliveries to the customer.
- They will work you to death and then ask that you work even harder."
253,Calix,Impact for the Taking,2016-11-18,5.0,,"What attracted me to Calix was the opportunity to have an impact and drive change. Thus far, I've felt empowered to bring forth new ideas and contribute and that's been inspiring. I feel supported in attending relevant conferences and in getting the resources I need to do my work well.

I particularly appreciate that Calix supports Remote Workers. Much of the company is dispersed, yet everything falls into place. It's nice to see that kind of trust from an employer.

Work-life balance has been quite reasonable and time-off has never been an issue.","Since much of the company is dispersed, it's hard to cultivate a true sense of community. I feel in-tune to the team I work with regularly, but don't feel connected beyond that. However, I get that that's the trade-off when working remotely.

Beyond that, my only gripe is that there are no healthy snacks."
254,Calix,Great people,2019-08-21,4.0,Software Engineer,"Lots to learn

Leadership"
255,Calix,Set the record straight,2014-10-22,5.0,Senior Vice President Human Resources,"CEO is brilliant and fun! The HR staff are phenomenal despite the uninformed and frankly outrageous comments from a couple troubled employees. They are a new team that has been able to put in a successful bonus plan in place, merit plans for the first time, increase stock grant levels and distribution, and basically fought for employees rewards every quarter they have been on staff.  The CEO did not hand over running the company to anyone (read the ratings on him! Leaders with such an extraordinary rating do not pass over their leadership.) He does respect their counsel and expertise though....any great leader would do the same.","Great culture, great environment that is centered around constructively confronting challenges or new ideas, and collaborating on the best solutions. Negative would be the tiny number of uninformed unprofessional individuals that don't know the difference between healthy confrontation and misinformed, unwarranted personal attacks. Oh well, bright highly skilled HR professionals can stand proud despite the petty banter."
256,Calix,Great Place to Work,2017-02-26,5.0,Manager,"There are some truly great leaders in upper management in particular Sales and Service, as well as G&A.  I feel like I'm truly contributing to the company's success and don't feel like a cog in the corporate machine.  Calix has a collaborative startup feeling but is also mature and organized.  I really like the strategic direction of where the company is going in terms of profitability and growth.","Departments are running a little too lean; need more support staff.  The CEO can be awkward; at times he can be funny, but other times rude and condescending."
257,Calix,A Sinking Ship,2018-06-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great Benefits,
Work from Home
Great hard working co-workers whom point in more than 50hrs a week","Absolutely no career development. The job you interview for is not what you are going to be doing. 90% of the job description is incorrect. Talent and Culture needs HR employees whom can revamp the Talent Management and create Employee Engagement (because there isn't any). There is also no line of succession. If someone leaves or is laid off. Good Luck! 

Many talented employees whom once helped build the company are now gone and left are Senior Management whom have no idea how to get the job done. Too many Directors and VPs and not enough team to support the initiatives. 

NO Raise in the past few years. ""Bonus"" is a joke! 
NO Job Security - There are lay offs every 2 weeks. 
NO Vision or Direction

Company Morale is at its all time worse. Not surprise why so many are also leaving the company."
258,Calix,90 Days Later...,2017-07-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've really enjoyed my first 90 days at Calix.  The people I work with have been welcoming and helpful, and my manager has been great.  He knows how when to push me and when to pull back.  Really happy to be working here so far.","I really haven't experienced any con's in my first 90 days at Calix.  If I had to nitpick I'd say that we have a lot of good things happening and some times it can be hard to prioritize.  In these situations I've leaned on my manager, and it's been very helpful."
259,Calix,Best place to retire,2008-11-21,3.0,Senior Systems Engineer,"I'm speaking from the engineering perspective. This may or may not apply to other departments.

If you want to retire, and don't want to learn anything new, this is the place. The challenges are not great, the work is very simple.

Occasionally there is overtime work, but most of the time it's just 9 to 5.","Lots of the engineers are very old-schooled, and there's no passion shown towards their work. They don't want to learn anything new, and very comfortable with what they have.
Can you imagine, in these days of age, you guys use only C?

Not only that, the team is currently too big, too much overhead."
