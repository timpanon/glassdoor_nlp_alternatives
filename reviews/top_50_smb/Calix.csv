1,Calix,Calix is a great place to work,2022-04-04,5.0,Associate Partner Manager,Calix has built a great culture and is full of people that are awesome to work with. The company is growing rapidly and there are many opportunities for advancement.,Lots of internal meetings but management has taken steps to mitigate this by implementing productivity and recharge days (with zero internal meetings).
2,Calix,"Came for culture, but got much more",2022-03-09,5.0,Solutions Engineer,"They have worked tirelessly to make sure that employees are happy though many aspects. We have quarterly recharge days and no meeting Fridays to provide time for everyone to focus on doing their best work and being the best version of themselves. When I joined, I wasn't told exactly what to do, but encouraged to explore, learn about our offerings and focus on what excites me. There is a serious team mentality across the company. If there is a question you have or something you need, everyone pitches in, cross functionally. You really feel like everyone has your back! As for compensation, I felt like I was asking for the moon when I told them my requirements, but it was not a problem and they even offered above what I asked for. As far as technology, I received new high end equipment (huge monitors, new fast laptop, latest new cell phone and more) sent to my house, along with a spending allowance, to build out my home office how I see fit.","I'm not a fan of Apple products, but everyone who gets a company cell phone must use an Apple iPhone as it is a non-negotiable standard."
3,Calix,Intense yet rewarding,2022-04-04,5.0,Regional Account Executive,"Big company with small company feeling. ""We are team, not a family"" helps solidify the understanding of why we're here.

I have interfaced with over a hundred employees and have yet to meet someone who is disgruntled, burnt out or feels underpaid/undervalued- whereas that was the norm at my previous employer.","Not much for Cons - as a company that experienced rapid growth, working through some systems and processes that didn't quite scale well with that growth is a challenge, but those are being updated as well."
4,Calix,The best culture I've ever experienced!,2022-03-21,5.0,Customer Success Manager (CSM),"Calix really does care about its employees. Many say this, but Calix puts it into action. The 3 Pillars are put into action: 
1. Know your purpose
2. The three C’s—Collaborate, Create, and Communicate 
3. We take care of our own
#3 is my favorite! Take care of myself, my health, and my loved ones before I take care of Calix.","Onboarding was a little confusing. There is so much information available, and it is in multiple locations. A more simple list would help lessen some confusion."

14,Calix,Calix is as TOXIC as a sales culture as they come! BEWARE,2021-11-10,1.0,Sales,Products teams are good to work with.,"1) They lie and deceive from the moment you are offered a position after a grueling interview process. You. can not trust the data and they are a toxic hot mess especially in large accounts. 

2) The culture is MICRO management from the president Michael Weening and CEO Carl Russo on down. Expect to work 80 hours a week , weekends, and constant berating from management. 

3) They have no clue how to set goals, let alone pay you. Expect that deals you sell will take 9-12 month to ship and they only pay you in arrears after shipment. 

4) To compensate they put you on a recoverable draw to which they pay 80% of plan unless you never meet the 4X inflated quota numbers. Then cut you off until you quit and then expect to recover money from you. 

5) Expect when you leave, and it is always a matter of time, (They only showcase on this website the longer tenure people) you will be part of the revolving door. I have never been apart of such a toxic environment ever! 

6) If you ever look up the dictionary definition of arrogant or pompous- Calix leadership should be the first thing that comes up!"

Many people are being promoted, but there are but so many VPs & Directors you can have in a company, so increasing salary is one of the better ways to keep employees"
29,Calix,This team is truly special,2021-07-12,5.0,Customer Success Manager (CSM),"The hiring process is rigorous and they are very protective of their team culture - rightfully so! This is the best team I've ever been a part of. Everyone is smart, strong in their expertise and extremely capable, as well as collaborative, kind and respectful. It's a very special combination that doesn't happen by accident. The senior leadership team has done an incredible job cultivating this fun, dynamic and engaging group. Internal communication is second to none. In my short time, I have seen a clear focus on professional development, continuous improvement, mental and physical health awareness and work-life balance from the leadership team. The benefits are robust and it's easy to find support when you need it.","The team is experiencing some growing pains, but leadership is aware and has engaged strategic teams to improve the onboarding and training programs. There is no shortage of information available, it's just a matter of packaging it into an easy to follow onboarding program. There are a lot of team meetings, which helps to keep the teams engaged and communicative, but it does create a cluttered calendar, and you must be extremely comfortable with spending multiple hours each day on Zoom calls."

-Great benefits
-Interesting products
-Growing industry
-Business is doing incredibly well","-Unkind coworkers

32,Calix,Incredible culture,2021-12-07,5.0,Senior Consultant,"Fantastic work culture. Every one of my coworkers is smart and hard-working. I have truly been able to pave my own path to success.

Calix strives to show their employees how much they're valued! The culture is great and all the staff are friendly and welcoming. Work/life balance and compensation are great. 

As a Systems Engineer I'm a continuous learner of technologies and Calix has not only provided me with new learning opportunities, but they're willing to invest in how far you want to take it. You're also not micromanaged and trusted to do your job. New ideas are always welcomed.

The benefits are also amazing such as great health coverage, unlimited PTO, and lifestyle (well-being) benefits. I don't feel there's enough I can say about this company and the great leadership. This company strives to be on and deliver the cutting edge to it's customers. I'm honored to be here and contribute to the success!",I honestly can't find any cons.

Balance between family and work","Actually, I did find the downsides yet"
41,Calix,"Good Now, but Worried About Near Future",2021-11-07,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Rating at 3: I would put 5, but it could drop to 1 very soon.

Calix treats their employees very well. This is from an R&D perspective. Pay and benefits are very good, but the typical annual raises tend to be hit-or-miss. The stock plan is excellent, don't miss out on that. Benefits are very good. The work-life balance is excellent. They allow, at least for now, full remote work and have been smart about that since COVID started. The immediate work environment has is very good... right now (see 'cons').

As a SW engineer, you'll have a lot of autonomy and immediate lower-mid management is very good, no complaints there. Coworkers are very friendly. There are a lot of old-school software styles here, so there is a very rich learning opportunity about Linux embedded environments in C. You will view ""modern"" programming and languages very differently after working here. The software we write is (currently) very clean and maintainable.","Please read the 'pros' section first. With that said, there is currently in-planning a new development work environment that is occurring without care or the affect it will have on engineering. Does developing in a zero-internet Linux virtual machine window with restricted editor choice and no copy/paste sound appealing to you? Of course not, you're not crazy. Does developing in an environment where you cannot even evaluate open-source code, say looking at a security update for an existing library we use, without going through a new undefined bureaucracy process to have someone else ""scan that source"" and then wait a week for it to be evaluated before copied to a secure server for you to use, and have your Jira-ticket in-progress time ever increasing meanwhile? No, because you've stopped reading this review at this point and dismissed the idea of working here. You have 5 new daily messages from other recruiters on LinkedIn to look at, and they're offering companies that don't play games like this.

Calix is an old-school company that likes to act like a ""startup"" and tries their hardest to keep up with the times, they really do, which brings a weird mix of attitudes from upper management. The above decision to ""secure our IP"" (its not about that, we know) is one of the new ideas they have that come from their old-school world. They're not making the connection that we're an internet company, that provides internet services, that works with languages and libraries and technologies that inherently use the internet and that, believe it or not, their engineers need to use the internet to do that. ""Want to develop something new in Rust? Nope, can't do that now, since you can't connect to Cargo's package management"" <- Upper management doesn't know what these two sentences mean, and that's a problem. They're making decisions without understanding what their engineers actually do. This decision when fully implemented will directly impact any new innovation, will cause massive engineering delays, and have the only overall accomplishment of aggravating your existing R&D teams. They're not understanding that they need to strike a balance between the security they want and user usability, and their plan is currently way too heavy on one scale."

We have older employees in leadership that have been working at Calix for 10+, many who don't have a clue of how the working environments have changed.

That is core to everything the company has done. You feel it from the top down.

To achieve that, we have become a fully virtual culture with work-from-anywhere across the company, very transparent from the CEO down with constant communication on the good and bad and a clear focus on hiring and retaining the best talent. I love that part of our culture.

The company is all about teamwork, no politics and people having each others backs as we make our customers successful.

It is a great team and amazing culture.","We work hard - as a team. If you are looking for a 9-5 job, this is not it. In my entire. career, I have never had a 9-5 job and great teams don't work that way. We are doing hard things, as we change the company - that means commitment. 

As a company, we are disrupting our industry, which means that we take risks and as we find our way to that new market model, there can be ambiguity. Not everyone is suited for that (It is common in a start-up but less so in a half-billion-dollar company - but it is our reality).

I have been fortunate during my time here to work in a few different groups and learn SO much about myself and my career. Calix as a culture is all about pushing ourselves to the next thing. Whether that is pushing into a new role in the company or into a new market. We have been through a giant shift over the past few years from a hardware to software company. That change wasn't for everyone and it was difficult at times. However, the leadership team guided us through this transition and we are now poised for amazing things. If you want to be at a growth company helping our customers transform their business (and don't mind some hard work) then Calix is for you!","Change is hard, and we've been through a lot of it over the past few years. That means making hard decisions about people who might not be a good cultural fit going forward. One of our key tenets is ""we take care of our own"". That means when someone is struggling we as a culture lift them up. However, that also means holding each other accountable and if you want a job that is the same all the time then this isn't the place for you."

Contrary to some previous reviews, I feel that I have a great work-life balance. Most days I don't have to work over 8 hours. I don't feel that I'm expected to be online 24/7.

There were many knee-jerk high-level decisions made to go ""all-in"" in one direction, only for it to cause more issues than it resolved.  Rather than management learning from the mistakes made, they were ""rip the band-aid off quick"" and terminate lower-level employees to cover the costs.  The company felt like it transitioned from the best in the industry to one that wasn't sure where it was headed, and solely led by marketing to sell products and services that just weren't there yet.  The buzzwords being thrown around were lean and agile but honestly, that was just everyone working 80 hour weeks along with Saturdays with no extra compensation.  There were times when we were asked to blow money before quarter-end, only to lay people off the following week.  That was the straw that broke the camels back with me."

Creativity and collaboration are part of the culture here and so is pushing yourself to your limits. It is hard to be bored here as Calix is so innovative and always looking to improve upon current technology.   If you want to work in an environment with lots of opportunity this is your company.",It is hard to pull yourself away from your job sometimes.

155,Calix,Positive reviews through executive coaxing,2020-07-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,A lot of talented hard working people work there. The pay is decend and so are the benefits. Bonus is also paid out often.,"Do not fall for this high rating, this does NOT reflect what Calix is actually like. The executive team is essentially asking employees to go on glassdoor and ""show how much you love working here"" which is why it has gone from a 3.6 to 4.7 in just a couple months (notice the massive surge in 5.0's). As for working there, prepare for constant restructuring , poor interdepartmental communication, no rasie/bonus structure (you may or may not get a raise that year depending on whether or not your manager feels like it). Mismanaged yearly/quarterly review system that changes all the time. Increasing amounts of cronyism. Poor to no vision from middle management. Product marketing takes precedence over product quality. If you join engineering prepare for your voice to not be heard; 'you get paid to be an engineer, not give opinions'. Saw plenty of talent leave out of frustration with the direction of the company (or lack thereof)."
156,Calix,Excellent company to work in a fast paced environment,2020-11-28,5.0,Principal Software Engineer,"Great work culture, transparent flow of information and great management",You have to give your 100% all the time

I feel empowered to be creative with the solutions I build.
I'm treated with respect and given the space to complete my tasks.
My manager and team as a whole supports one another and steps up to help whenever needed.
Leadership makes you feel appreciated for the work you do.
Executives are transparent in their communications about the company.
Fast-paced environment.","I enjoy the fast-paced environment, but there are times it can result in having to quickly shift gears from what you were working on before you've finished."
158,Calix,Clear mission for the company in this time of the pandemic crisis.,2020-04-06,5.0,Principal Engineer,"As this pandemic ravages our public health and economy the world is relying on broadband networks to continue working and connecting.  At Calix EVERYONE feels the satisfaction of being part of a company that has provided the infrastructure that allows millions of homes/businesses/educational-institutions to receive high speed broadband internet.  The mission at Calix is clear and the long term prospects for the company are improving.

Calix adopted a work-from-home, flexible culture before it was a business necessity brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Engineering teams are lean, but well funded and focused.

Visionary executive management that is transforming the company from a classic 'telecom purple box seller' to a systems/software company.",Poor stock performance over the past ten years since IPO.
159,Calix,An outstanding place to work,2020-04-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Leadership cares about employees.
Leadership cares about the customer and their success. Calix does not just pay lip-service. Pay is competitive and benefits are on par. People are good quality and talented. Leadership has vision and shares it to those who are in the trenches moving forward on the front lines.","Nothing that you would not find at any HW/SW company. Many of the issues are the same everywhere, Always have time/resource pressures. Having said that I don't see any ""cons"" that are unique to Calix. If I was pressed I would say that Sales and marketing has a bit too much sway on influencing committed development plans and schedules. Can be disruptive when ""emergencies"" arise."
160,Calix,"strategy, tactics, internal communications, and employee goals aligned",2020-04-30,5.0,"Senior Director, Analytics Management","Calix has emerged as a very strong player with a unique and defensible business plan after a painful few years of strategic and operational restructuring. Now is a great time to be at Calix.

The leadership team is open and honest about the business plan and communicates how the tactical results are aligned to our financial and strategic operational plans.

Calix has spent the last couple years retooling our infrastructure and processes to support a largely remote workforce and we continue to evolve these processes.

Our leadership sets the strategic direction and lets the team direct and influence the specific projects and tasks to meet this strategy.
Individual performers are recognized and given opportunities to grow both their skill sets and scope within the organization -- if they are motivated to do so.

Leadership is looking for individuals to help the company ""learn"" our way forward -- they don't expect individuals to have the exact relevant experience -- which is not possible in many highly volatile markets or technology situations. 

We have a high percentage of leaders and employees that are smart, willing to listen, and know that they don't know everything.

The Employee stock purchase plans and health plans are very generous and competitive.

I like the fact that the bonus plans are tied to company performance and individual performance.","Not necessarily cons -- but words of advice if you want to succeed at Calix:

If you need the comfort of a ""static"" job with relatively little change -- then Calix is not the place for you. You need to be willing to learn new ways of improving (and therefore changing) your work processes.

If you just want to ""clock in and clock out"" without contributing to the bigger picture and be willing to learn how you can help improve the overall plan at Calix --then this is not the place for you. It requires effort to look beyond the scope of your immediate role and tasks.

If you are unable to adapt to a remote work situation where you need to be self monitoring of your work output -- then Calix is not the place for you.

You will work hard so make sure you are in (or working towards) a role that you enjoy at least 75% of your tasks so that you can spend time in a ""flow"" state instead of in a ""oh my god I have to get this done"" state."

- Sporadic, tiny bonuses
- No job security--they're cutting valuable staff left and right with no plan for replacements or workload sensitivity.
- No work/life balance. Meetings could be as early as 7am and as late as 9pm. New venture partnership with India company makes meetings during valuable family time a regular occurrence, and heavily east coast upper management means early meetings for those on the east coast.

Thus far, I've felt empowered to bring forth new ideas and contribute and that's been inspiring. I feel supported in attending relevant conferences and in getting the resources I need to do my work well.

I particularly appreciate that Calix supports Remote Workers. Much of the company is dispersed, yet everything falls into place. It's nice to see that kind of trust from an employer.

Work-life balance has been quite reasonable and time-off has never been an issue.","Since much of the company is dispersed, it's hard to cultivate a true sense of community. I feel in-tune to the team I work with regularly, but don't feel connected beyond that. However, I get that that's the trade-off when working remotely.

They are a new team that has been able to put in a successful bonus plan in place, merit plans for the first time, increase stock grant levels and distribution, and basically fought for employees rewards every quarter they have been on staff.  The CEO did not hand over running the company to anyone (read the ratings on him! Leaders with such an extraordinary rating do not pass over their leadership.) He does respect their counsel and expertise though....any great leader would do the same.","Great culture, great environment that is centered around constructively confronting challenges or new ideas, and collaborating on the best solutions. Negative would be the tiny number of uninformed unprofessional individuals that don't know the difference between healthy confrontation and misinformed, unwarranted personal attacks.

Occasionally there is overtime work, but most of the time it's just 9 to 5.","Lots of the engineers are very old-schooled, and there's no passion shown towards their work. They don't want to learn anything new, and very comfortable with what they have.

Compensation","Company going through change, changing it's focus (this is also a Pro) and change does scare some folks"
300,Calix,5+ Year Employee,2018-08-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"-- Base salary and benefits package is competitive (but overall comp is not)
-- A lot of great colleagues -- smart and care about the company (too bad they aren't appreciated or recognized by management for the most part)
-- Solid engineering org on the lower levels; lots of smart engineers.  Engineering leadership is all over the place.  Some great VPs, but overall strategic direction is muddled.
-- For those in the north bay, it makes sense to stick around because there are so few other companies up there; for those in south bay, I don't know why they'd ever come here (I suspect it's because they're 3rd tier employees that can't get better jobs at the zillion better places in SJ or they just stay a short while as a stop gap until they get a better job)","Too many to list, but I'll try:
-- Poor, incompetent and unethical management -- there are some good executives, but they are in the minority.  For example, we've took a $100M+ hit in the last 2-3 years that was solely the result of poor management and could have been completely avoided if the CEO didn't surround himself with yes men.  But the CEO is more interested in being the ""smartest guy in the room"" rather than surrounding himself with the best and brightest.  As a result, you get crappy executives or those that will just placate his ego rather than run the company well.  Also the $100M+ hit in the Services org is only one of a few company-ending bombs.  There are others.  That is simply the only one that has been triggered thus far.  I can't imagine this company surviving the next 12-18 months without being acquired (sort of shocked it hasn't happened yet) due to its precarious financial position.
--Lack of accountability in Management and in general.  The CEO will say one thing and then completely reverse his statement 6 months later without acknowledgement of the change at all.  Even when he's called out on it at a company meeting, he acts like he doesn't know what you're talking about.  I don't know if that's just extreme duplicity or senility.  Either way, it's a bad trait in a CEO.  This same sort of Orwellian management style is seen in other orgs.
-- Irresponsible Decision Making.  For whatever reason, management is more run like Game of Thrones than anything else.  Instead of the execs agreeing on a course of action, you'll have different orgs doing clearly contradictory things.  Eventually one org will win out, but then there is a loss of a lot of money and resources for the losing org.  It's the stupidest thing I've seen.  I don't understand why the CEO allows this to happen and why responsible decision making isn't possible.  I suspect it's either because he's disconnected from the reality of what is actually happening at his company and believes the smoke that is blown up his backside or he's just too lazy or cowardly to really lead.  He very much feels like an absentee father that says ""go ask your mother"" because he can't be bothered to be involved.
-- Culture of Fear. If you work under a good exec, you may not feel this.  But if you don't, you feel it acutely.  There is no accountability on the executive level.  Bad execs (and there are several) blame their incompetency on their subordinates.  So when something goes wrong, they place the blame on one of their VPs, Directors or Managers and he/she gets fired.  This is their version of ""solving the problem"", but no changes are made into the process or policy that caused the problem in the first place.  As a result, many employees spend a lot of time worried about others stabbing them in the back and engaging in CYA activities.  It's exhausting and really hurts productivity and makes team work very difficult across orgs in particular.  Some will admit that there is a lack of accountability/responsibility, but in the 5+ years I've been here, I've seen them do absolutely nothing about it.  Execs stay, get their bonuses and stock, and the rest of us just keeping tolling.
-- No life/work balance if you're a high performer.  For those of us that are high performers, we average less than a week off of work per year and many of us go without vacation at all for a year or two at a time.  And now that we've switched to ""unlimited vacation"", we don't even get compensated for the vacation we can't take.  If you're a good performer, expect to be working at least 60 hours per week to make up for all the other poor performers (and 80+ hours on a bad week).  Good managers will totally recognize this as a problem (mine has), but they can't do anything about it because so many of our groups have been hit by layoffs.  As a result those of us in SJ, generally leave pretty quickly (high turnover among high performers in SJ) because if you're going to be working those hours, you might as get the $100K+ in stock from a real company.  Those poor guys in Petaluma are just stuck because who wants to commute 3+ hours each day.
-- No stock for non-execs anymore as a general rule.  A couple of us are the exception, but it's very, very rare.  The stock is only like $6/share so you aren't missing out on much money-wise, but it's definitely demoralizing.  But, base salary is pretty competitive and bonus is so-so.  They are generous with titles so if that's a big thing for you, you will get the Manager, Director or even VP title very easily -- but it's not the same as having one of those titles at a real company, so don't expect it to translate when you move."

And I hate to say it but for a company that has never really been profitable and is currently losing money, the pay and benefits are pretty good.","Where to start...
CEO seems to be on a different planet.  If you listen to him speak it is almost inspirational but actually has nothing to do with the products or culture that actually exist.
Executive management is horrible and for a company with a market cap of less than 400M there are a ton of them. R&D leadership values yes men (a positive attitude?) over talent. Productivity vs r&d dollars spent is terrible. The marketing SVP seems to think that capex decisions at service providers are made based on Tweets as opposed to their lab trials. 
And everybody seems to think that chasing Verizon, who is notorious for squeezing their vendors to death, is worth losing money for 4 consecutive quarters (or more). 
The only upside is the VPs will get to say they brought Calix a tier 1 on their resumes when they move on to the next ""opportunity"".
Honestly, I think if you were to drill down into any of the positive reviews it would be from people in support organizations who don't really know the the products or even the customers and just believe the sound bites."

315,Calix,Totally Disappointed,2015-08-19,1.0,,Free drinks in the break room.,"The culture of Calix historically has been that EVERYONE is treated the same, no matter WHAT position.  This is one of the reasons why no one has an office, including our CEO.  It's a sea of cubicles in our different sites. However when you hire a bunch of people (chiefs no Indians) who have no idea of the culture, they bring their own.   Their own consists of ""if you are not above me in position, then I will treat you with disrespect"".  ""I will make you feel that your job is on thin ice everyday"".  ""As your new manager, I will burden you with so much work but not really understand what you do in the first place but act like I do"".  ""I will not listen to you because your input is of no value"".  ""Oh and I will ensure to throw you under the bus if there are any issues that actually are my fault.  I will ensure you go down for it and not me"". Unfortunately this methodology is crippling.  Good, very good employees that worked for this company for years are leaving at a rapid pace.  You can promote them to keep them but they leave anyway.  You didn't stay at Calix because of the money you were making.  You stayed because of the people that you worked with.  People who worked really hard, all hours of the night away from their families and away from life.  The former chiefs rolled up their sleeves and got in and helped.  This was respected and it showed employees that we are in this together.  New chiefs barely on board for over  a year take off on vacation more than once in a two month span while many have not seen a vacation in years.  They are self entitled and do not feel they need to work as hard as the rest and it shows.  Half of them ""work from home"" and I use that term very loosely.   Can't find most of them.  We thought that when the previous leader of HR left that things would change company wide and unfortunately because of that cancer it's even got worse.  It's bleeding through departments now.  When you loose an entire department within an 18 month time frame you would think to take a look at what, where or who is the source(s) and work to resolve it.  Unfortunately a new chief is hired with little to no experience and then they sit back, collect a check and dump the work on the lower level employees as if they are too good to do it..  Then they question why your work is not getting done when you are to busy doing theirs.  It's crazy and until someone really take stock in what's going on then you will have a revolving door with a bunch of upset employees.  If you don't care about them, how well do you think they will care about you or the work that their doing for you?  You can't feed them all the time to make these deep rooted issues go away.  It's time to show that you care.  Not by food, money, but by deed.  Unfortunately it's come to the realization that this is no longer a career but just a job.  Heartbreaking because I loved it there but the people that I really liked are ALL gone and now I know why."
