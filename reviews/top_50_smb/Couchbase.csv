2,Couchbase,Please don’t fall for this company,2022-03-29,1.0,Sales,There are zero pros to this company,"Why can candidates not respond to a Glassdoor response by the company, when they are blatantly lying? Your leadership does not follow the pillars that you say all employees do. You have managers tell the rest of his team that this employee is quitting when he never mentioned quitting at all. Then you have HR say this person was fired for bad performance but this person wasn’t there long enough and didn’t even have KPIs to reference. Your company treats employees like garbage and mainly your management. Your stock is down 30%+ and Mongo is down half that? Please consider why. They try to go against Mongo but Mongo still wins. 22 net new customers they say they got last quarter that maybe pay or are just using the free version. This company has 150 paying customers total, over what 12 years? Ask yourself why? Why do they bring in leadership from oracle that have no idea what startup even means? Why does a manager live on an island and make excuses not to meet his own team, why? They will tell you a bunch of lies but that’s all it is. Never have I dealt with so many unprofessional people in my life. They don’t deserve anyone. No one is selling anything here. The few that are is all upsell. Run far away from this fire."

All of the folks I interviewed with were very prepared, with great questions and a clear idea of what they were looking for in the role.","I was a bit doubtful about providing a presentation as part of the interview process, but I'm glad I did. It's a bit of work, and I don't generally like providing work product as part of an interview process, but in the long run it helped each of us see where the other was coming from, and made me more confident that I would have the support I needed to succeed."
5,Couchbase,"Recommend, go for it!",2022-01-23,5.0,Technical Support Engineer,"I have been working for Couchbase for some time now and I enjoy every moment of it. 
During an initial interview, everyone was extremely nice and attentive. Somewhere at the back of my mind, I was thinking that it would change once employed, but it did not. The company makes a point of creating a positive and friendly environment, which only benefits overall success",The cons that come to mind are rather related to the specific people than the company itself

Since joining the company I experienced a constructive and collaborative environment where people want to help you succeed. The focus is on teamwork and how we win together. All this starts at the top with a clarity of vision where the company is going and what it expects of its people. If you get a chance to join this company, I would say take it.","There is a massive opportunity for Couchbase to grow in a market that is in full transition. Different people will have different perspectives on how to go about it. You need to feel comfortable speaking up and be part of the solution, rather than expecting everything will be done for you."

It's not. We have work life balance and a collegial workplace where NO ONE is granted the special right to be an blowhard/bully/etc. Friendly means we work together and it's enjoyable; conversations are productive and easy.",Couchbase is much smaller than its competitors. That means we don't have the bandwidth to do everything we might want to. The upside is you get to choose what to work on and you more or less define your own role.

The people running the company have good intentions for the most part. The outlook for the product is great. Autonomy in roles and unlimited PTO are plusses for sure.,"Brand awareness makes sales and growth very difficult. Couchbase is clearly a boys club and isn't very diverse. Efforts to improve DEI are met with resistance. While the outlook for the company is good, there are huge growing pains that need to be resolved to meet the metrics the board and leadership want to see. When a whole team fails, you can't just blame the team."

Don't know how this is not a perennial best place to work company.","Since the company is in a fast growth path, there might be a bit of little company syndrome when competing against others (from some employees).

This is a company that is truly focused on Success. Not only the success of the company but our employees and customers as well. Couchbase has demonstrated the willingness to do great things for employees. In one case one we found a way to help an employee to go help his family for several months during a crisis rather than accept his resignation we helped make it work and now he is back. Our employees are willing to do what it takes for the company to be successful. During a time when it took us longer to get a new position filled another employee from another group jumped in to help. The relationship between the Sales Team and Technical Team is really great at Couchbase. We are able to work together to get deals closed rather than fight over whose job it is.,Unlike many of the large companies I have worked for not every situation has been vetted and documented. This does give us the freedom to look at individual situations and just do what is best for everyone

Check out the most recent Forrester Wave report on market leaders in the Big Data and NoSQL space.  Simply stated, Couchbase is the solution for mission critical applications.  It allows you to do things competitors can't do and they back the product up with world class talent.","We've had normal and painful turnover one sees at a company moving from startup to a more establish growth company.

Impact: After working at a vastly larger company, it was great to come work at Couchbase where I could have an idea for a feature, come up with a proof-of-concept, and get it into the customers' hands  in only a few months' time. As a small company, there is a lot of opportunity to have significant short-term impact.

Culture: a lot of the engineering staff have been around, and worked at a lot of places, giving the feeling that there are adults in charge, yet this also means that a lot of people have families and understand that you have a life outside of engineering. There is definitely an appreciation for getting things done more than just putting hours in, I really do feel that I can ""work smarter not harder.""","Culture does vary quite a bit between teams, different people may have different experiences."
88,Couchbase,"Great People, Great Technology, Winning Business Model",2017-02-02,5.0,Vice President of Technical Support,"What drew me to Couchbase was the technology initially, what's been the most rewarding has been the people and the constant sense that it's a company on the right track and headed for great success.   As a support VP I've rarely had the experience to work at a place where all of the organizations involved seemed to 100% aligned and in tune like I find at Couchbase.  The teams are energetic, committed and amazingly all trying to do the right thing, in the end, for the customer first.   That's true right from the CEO on down.   Definitely one of the best experiences I've had in my career.",The only con for me is that it's not HQ'ed in San Francisco.   Beyond that it would be hard for me to point to something that is a downside for me.
89,Couchbase,Ownership and Community,2018-07-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- We all want to get buy in when moving forward with a particular project or program. When you get buy-in at Couchbase, it's about SUPPORT, not PERMISSION. You're trusted to do the work you were hired in to do, and the teams here WANT to enable and embolden you to do your best.
- Couchbase, as a community, prioritizes family - whether that's the family you're born in to, the family you choose, or the family you identify with - and understands that your priorities often lie with them - AND THAT'S AWESOME! Because of this, we enjoy flexible hours and caring people all around.  The DTO (Discretionary Time Off) policy also supports this.
- Couchbase prioritizes internal candidates - so if you're looking to find opportunities for your career to evolve, this could be a great choice.
- Highly approachable executive leadership","- Moving from Mountain View to Santa Clara in the fall - A fantastic move for most Silicon Valley employees, but maybe not perfect for people coming from San Francisco"
90,Couchbase,Growth and opportunities,2019-03-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Thus far, Couchbase has been a great place to work. What I really enjoy are the benefits/perks, as well as the opportunity, which is the main reason I came to the company. There is so much room for growth, as you are enabled to take on many different projects, and have lots of opportunity to make a difference and lead in your own way.  As the company grows, I feel like I have the opportunity to make an impact and grow with the company which is important. I also feel as though my opinion matters, and my thoughts are heard, and that is something that makes me feel like I play an integral role at the company. 

Additionally, you would think at a start-up that work/life balance is non existent, but at Couchbase I find that I can easily balance my work and life, and I have the flexibility to do so. 

There are also some really great leaders, and great leaders is what keeps great, high performing employees.","- No 401k match

Changing the world is easy to talk about, but our product team is actually delivering a data platform that is doing it.  #4.  The market opportunity.

The culture here is HIGHLY collaborative and there aren't a lot of politics.  The CEO doesn't believe in org charts, so that tells you how horizontal this place is.  The folk here are GOOD PEOPLE that want to win, it's that simple.  Integrity, open communication, and respect seem to be highly valued.  People here are smart, the guy who invented SQL just joined.  Don't miss an opportunity to work at this company.","None that I have observed yet.

There is an inherent culture of effective communication across teams and the expectation is that we are all on the same team without internal divisions. The CEO sets the tone by being very direct, honest, and focused on the right goals to become a successful business.","Not a con really- there's no hype or out-of-control spending on flashy and lavish things (although we do have a very well-stocked kitchen). If you're just around for the short-term flash and perks that some startups seem to advertise as being a selling point, this isn't the place for you.

- Solid CEO who has pretty straight forward plans. 
- Office in SF in addition to Mountain View if you live in the city","- Lack of transparency (right hand does not see what left hand is doing)

There are various perks like Community Lunch Thursdays where lunch is catered --and colleagues actually all sit together and connect. It's a great environment where ""self starters"" can thrive with the correct amount of autonomy and support provided by leadership.","Couchbase plays in a crowded space, although it's not a con about the company itself. If someone is looking to work for a pink, fluffy unicorn on its own rainbow, this wouldn't be the place.

There was a great sales team and sales leadership in place 3 years ago, then CEO showed his true colors and brought in a safe, very wrong choice to lead the team. All good sales people have left or are in the process of leaving. The company literally does not believe in paying commissions or rewarding top performers.

While I was there the management politics were cut-throat, information was hoarded and  the atmosphere was rife with secrecy and paranoia that obstructed productivity and drove talented employees out the door. There was little attempt that I saw by management to curb any of this, or even to acknowledge it was happening. To this day I am still being alerted to congratulate former employees on their new positions at other companies, so perhaps not much has changed."

The past year was a challenging one in terms of the pressure to deliver a really important release but the senior leadership team were always there, willing to listen and give any support I needed.

At the end of the year we knew that important changes needed to be made in how we work, a complete ground up restart of our processes.

I am really impressed by the flexibility, support and encouragement we've had from senior leadership that has helped make the changes successful in a very short period of time.

Top down support and drive is key to any agile rollout and we had no shortage of that.","The days can be long sometimes, but there is opportunity to be flexible."

A company of good apples - I've never worked in a place where everyone is universally nice!

Hugely successful with massive upside - we are growing very well, with many initiatives and products on the cusp of helping us grow even faster. 

A leadership team that leads, cares and fosters a family culture from the top down.

A truly international company, with not just recognition but significant central resource available to support the field.

Everyone at Couchbase can be heard, and has the opportunity to make an impact.","There is some room for better diversity, but pleased to see big improvements in this area in the last 12 months.

A highly competitive market, which is good as the opportunity is huge, but it can get noisy out there.

In some areas of the market, there is a weird negative perception of Couchbase, perhaps based on experiences from long ago. It's weird in that I continuously hear directly from our customers on how much they love our products."

I felt like a part of the team from the first moment I stepped through the virtual door. This is something hard to achieve in a physical office and we are told is extremely hard for a remote team but Couchbase has nailed it.

The onboarding process was incredibly slick, you are guided well through all aspects from IT ensuring your kit is working perfectly to HR ensuring you have access to key support apps and information and are signed up for the benefits correctly.

The kit you are given to do your job is well above anything I've experienced in much much larger organisations too. Couchbase also offer a fund to buy any equipment, furniture etc. to set up your home office as you need it to.

On top of all that the company values are centred around you as a human and the sentiment is genuine from the top down.","Days can be pretty long depending on your role, there is a chance to flex and manage this yourself but it can be disruptive to your work life balance. It's not a 9-5 job."

It's not for everyone (people are intellectually very sharp and driven - so one needs to be both smart and work hard to succeed here).

The best culture I've seen at both the company, and specifically a single office. The Manchester office retains that small startup feel, and has a very good reputation in the company. We punch well above our weight for the size, it's not just a small satellite office. Very flexible working and remote friendly. With any luck, you'll be able to visit HQ in California for a pretty unique (for the UK) Silicon Valley experience.

Exciting continuous growth for Couchbase. Approaching 2 years here and looking forward to what the future brings for the products and the company.","UK and West Coast timezones don't overlap much, so late morning starts and evening meetings are sometimes necessary.
