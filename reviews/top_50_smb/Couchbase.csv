2,Couchbase,Please don’t fall for this company,2022-03-29,1.0,Sales,There are zero pros to this company,"Why can candidates not respond to a Glassdoor response by the company, when they are blatantly lying? Your leadership does not follow the pillars that you say all employees do. You have managers tell the rest of his team that this employee is quitting when he never mentioned quitting at all. Then you have HR say this person was fired for bad performance but this person wasn’t there long enough and didn’t even have KPIs to reference. Your company treats employees like garbage and mainly your management. Your stock is down 30%+ and Mongo is down half that? Please consider why. They try to go against Mongo but Mongo still wins. 22 net new customers they say they got last quarter that maybe pay or are just using the free version. This company has 150 paying customers total, over what 12 years? Ask yourself why? Why do they bring in leadership from oracle that have no idea what startup even means? Why does a manager live on an island and make excuses not to meet his own team, why? They will tell you a bunch of lies but that’s all it is. Never have I dealt with so many unprofessional people in my life. They don’t deserve anyone. No one is selling anything here. The few that are is all upsell. Run far away from this fire."

All of the folks I interviewed with were very prepared, with great questions and a clear idea of what they were looking for in the role.","I was a bit doubtful about providing a presentation as part of the interview process, but I'm glad I did. It's a bit of work, and I don't generally like providing work product as part of an interview process, but in the long run it helped each of us see where the other was coming from, and made me more confident that I would have the support I needed to succeed."
5,Couchbase,"Recommend, go for it!",2022-01-23,5.0,Technical Support Engineer,"I have been working for Couchbase for some time now and I enjoy every moment of it. 
During an initial interview, everyone was extremely nice and attentive. Somewhere at the back of my mind, I was thinking that it would change once employed, but it did not.

If you get a chance to join this company, I would say take it.","There is a massive opportunity for Couchbase to grow in a market that is in full transition. Different people will have different perspectives on how to go about it. You need to feel comfortable speaking up and be part of the solution, rather than expecting everything will be done for you."

That means we don't have the bandwidth to do everything we might want to. The upside is you get to choose what to work on and you more or less define your own role.

The people running the company have good intentions for the most part. The outlook for the product is great. Autonomy in roles and unlimited PTO are plusses for sure.,"Brand awareness makes sales and growth very difficult. Couchbase is clearly a boys club and isn't very diverse. Efforts to improve DEI are met with resistance. While the outlook for the company is good, there are huge growing pains that need to be resolved to meet the metrics the board and leadership want to see.

Don't know how this is not a perennial best place to work company.","Since the company is in a fast growth path, there might be a bit of little company syndrome when competing against others (from some employees).

This is a company that is truly focused on Success. Not only the success of the company but our employees and customers as well. Couchbase has demonstrated the willingness to do great things for employees. In one case one we found a way to help an employee to go help his family for several months during a crisis rather than accept his resignation we helped make it work and now he is back. Our employees are willing to do what it takes for the company to be successful. During a time when it took us longer to get a new position filled another employee from another group jumped in to help. The relationship between the Sales Team and Technical Team is really great at Couchbase. We are able to work together to get deals closed rather than fight over whose job it is.,Unlike many of the large companies I have worked for not every situation has been vetted and documented. This does give us the freedom to look at individual situations and just do what is best for everyone

I can't believe all the incredible use cases for our product and the huge impact we can make in customers' lives.  This is the best kept secret in all of technology...not just the database sector.  Check out the most recent Forrester Wave report on market leaders in the Big Data and NoSQL space.  Simply stated, Couchbase is the solution for mission critical applications.  It allows you to do things competitors can't do and they back the product up with world class talent.","We've had normal and painful turnover one sees at a company moving from startup to a more establish growth company.  This impacted business outcomes earlier in the year but leadership has stabilized the team and business projections since, so things are really looking on the up and up!"
89,Couchbase,"Serious engineering, opportunities for impact, relaxed, mature culture",2018-07-23,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Engineering: as a database company, Couchbase has a serious engineering culture, performance and reliability are critical to our customers. I really like the seriousness and studiousness with which the team approaches engineering problems.

Impact: After working at a vastly larger company, it was great to come work at Couchbase where I could have an idea for a feature, come up with a proof-of-concept, and get it into the customers' hands  in only a few months' time. As a small company, there is a lot of opportunity to have significant short-term impact.

Culture: a lot of the engineering staff have been around, and worked at a lot of places, giving the feeling that there are adults in charge, yet this also means that a lot of people have families and understand that you have a life outside of engineering. There is definitely an appreciation for getting things done more than just putting hours in, I really do feel that I can ""work smarter not harder.""","Culture does vary quite a bit between teams, different people may have different experiences."
90,Couchbase,"Great People, Great Technology, Winning Business Model",2017-02-02,5.0,Vice President of Technical Support,"What drew me to Couchbase was the technology initially, what's been the most rewarding has been the people and the constant sense that it's a company on the right track and headed for great success.   As a support VP I've rarely had the experience to work at a place where all of the organizations involved seemed to 100% aligned and in tune like I find at Couchbase.  The teams are energetic, committed and amazingly all trying to do the right thing, in the end, for the customer first.   That's true right from the CEO on down.   Definitely one of the best experiences I've had in my career.",The only con for me is that it's not HQ'ed in San Francisco.   Beyond that it would be hard for me to point to something that is a downside for me.
91,Couchbase,Ownership and Community,2018-07-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- We all want to get buy in when moving forward with a particular project or program. When you get buy-in at Couchbase, it's about SUPPORT, not PERMISSION. You're trusted to do the work you were hired in to do, and the teams here WANT to enable and embolden you to do your best.
- Couchbase, as a community, prioritizes family - whether that's the family you're born in to, the family you choose, or the family you identify with - and understands that your priorities often lie with them - AND THAT'S AWESOME! Because of this, we enjoy flexible hours and caring people all around.  The DTO (Discretionary Time Off) policy also supports this.
- Couchbase prioritizes internal candidates - so if you're looking to find opportunities for your career to evolve, this could be a great choice.
- Highly approachable executive leadership","- Moving from Mountain View to Santa Clara in the fall - A fantastic move for most Silicon Valley employees, but maybe not perfect for people coming from San Francisco"
92,Couchbase,Growth and opportunities,2019-03-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Thus far, Couchbase has been a great place to work. What I really enjoy are the benefits/perks, as well as the opportunity, which is the main reason I came to the company. There is so much room for growth, as you are enabled to take on many different projects, and have lots of opportunity to make a difference and lead in your own way.  As the company grows, I feel like I have the opportunity to make an impact and grow with the company which is important. I also feel as though my opinion matters, and my thoughts are heard, and that is something that makes me feel like I play an integral role at the company. 

Additionally, you would think at a start-up that work/life balance is non existent, but at Couchbase I find that I can easily balance my work and life, and I have the flexibility to do so. 

There are also some really great leaders, and great leaders is what keeps great, high performing employees.","- No 401k match 
- Pay could be better, but it's not too bad"
93,Couchbase,Start a Revolution!,2018-06-28,5.0,Marketing,"#1 The people.  Simply the best bunch of workmates in my career: smart, creative, fun, committed,  team players.  #2 Our customers.  They LOVE our product: it does what we say it will do,  and more, so they can't wait to tell the world about it!  #3.  The technology.  Changing the world is easy to talk about, but our product team is actually delivering a data platform that is doing it.  #4.  The market opportunity.  It's huge: multiple billions of $$$ are spent in our space and we've only just begun.  #5.  Our financials.  Even better on the inside than it looks from the outside.  Watch out world!","Not really a con, but if you're expecting an easy ride, look elsewhere:  everyone pulls their weight, so expectations are high.  As with all start-ups, agility is the name of the game, so be prepared to jump on new opportunities as they emerge."

95,Couchbase,This company is special,2015-11-04,5.0,Anonymous,"Aside from being pre-IPO, this is a different type of company in terms of culture than most tech companies.  The culture here is HIGHLY collaborative and there aren't a lot of politics.  The CEO doesn't believe in org charts, so that tells you how horizontal this place is.  The folk here are GOOD PEOPLE that want to win, it's that simple.  Integrity, open communication, and respect seem to be highly valued.  People here are smart, the guy who invented SQL just joined.  Don't miss an opportunity to work at this company.","None that I have observed yet.  The company is run in a very fiscally prudent way, so you have to have a solid business case in place to get budget."
96,Couchbase,A rare company with great culture and focus,2016-01-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Everyone tries to do the right thing. Management makes courageous and necessary decisions as opposed to expedient ones. There is an inherent culture of effective communication across teams and the expectation is that we are all on the same team without internal divisions. The CEO sets the tone by being very direct, honest, and focused on the right goals to become a successful business.","Not a con really- there's no hype or out-of-control spending on flashy and lavish things (although we do have a very well-stocked kitchen). If you're just around for the short-term flash and perks that some startups seem to advertise as being a selling point, this isn't the place for you. The culture here is focused on long-term growth and viability."
97,Couchbase,Good potential...,2016-11-23,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Couchbase creates amazing technology that can really change many things (obviously for regulars and even for many techies, Couchbase as name does not ring the bell) 
- There are definitely a lot of opportunities to wear multiple hats and pick up new skills as long you are willing to do so.
- Great engineering team that is always willing to help solving even non-engineering problems!   
- Solid CEO who has pretty straight forward plans. 
- Office in SF in addition to Mountain View if you live in the city","- Lack of transparency (right hand does not see what left hand is doing)
- Too many Directors and VPs
- Lack of life/work balance for certain teams/people. Emails/IMs are being sent pretty much 24/7 with expectations that things will be fixed right away"
98,Couchbase,"So far, so good",2017-08-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The enthusiasm of a relatively new leadership team, including new CEO, is infectious.  There are various perks like Community Lunch Thursdays where lunch is catered --and colleagues actually all sit together and connect. It's a great environment where ""self starters"" can thrive with the correct amount of autonomy and support provided by leadership.","Couchbase plays in a crowded space, although it's not a con about the company itself. If someone is looking to work for a pink, fluffy unicorn on its own rainbow, this wouldn't be the place. But if someone is looking at an opportunity to help make a difference in a highly competitive space, this is it."
99,Couchbase,Do your homework before joining,2017-01-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Technology is pretty good in targeted use cases. Hot space. Great location. Nice HQ building.,"All of the smart people have left. CEO and company does not believe in paying for strong performance. Board should have ousted the CEO a few years ago. There was a great sales team and sales leadership in place 3 years ago, then CEO showed his true colors and brought in a safe, very wrong choice to lead the team. All good sales people have left or are in the process of leaving. The company literally does not believe in paying commissions or rewarding top performers. When top sale people leave without even waiting for their owed commissions...that is a clear message."
100,Couchbase,Solutions Engineer - PreSales,2016-09-07,5.0,Solutions Engineer,Great product and people.  Makes life so much easier when you have a great product that you honestly believe in.  Culture is very techy with freedom.  Very customer focused.  Great roadmap.  **The future looks bright**,"Very fast moving company with a rapid product development cycle.  Great for customers and our feature set.  Sometimes a bit difficult to keep up.  And information has to constantly be kept up to date.  They do a good job of this, but you must future employees must be a person who can keep up with a fast-paced company/product line."
101,Couchbase,Very much enjoying it.,2015-04-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Love the startup culture, where things get done fast, and I'm able to play an influential role in helping the company meet its goals and plan for the future.  Coming from a large, bureaucratic company, where it took a long time for things to get decided on and implemented, it's very refreshing to be in a fast-paced environment where the company can act quickly and strategically.
People are respectful of each other, and value the contributions each of us in ""getting stuff done"".","Only ""con"" would be that it can sometimes be a challenge to figure out ""who's who"", given that the company is growing so rapidly (adding many new faces).  Not really a negative --  its a sign of the success and fast growth."
102,Couchbase,"Fun, exciting NoSQL Startup",2015-06-12,5.0,,"Positive small-company atmosphere. Good, decent people for colleagues and more than our fair share of very capable individuals. People are well-intentioned, care and work hard. Yes there are support tickets and bugs to fix but it's a real product with real customers using it heavily -- so these things are only to be expected. Everything is not perfect all the time but on balance this is a great place to be.","Work can be demanding at times (though in general no ""nights and weekends"" nonsense.) We're still a start-up so there's the existential risk that goes with that territory."
103,Couchbase,A wonderful atmosphere to make impactful changes,2015-12-31,5.0,Software Engineer,"As a developer I moved here from a large company where opportunities to make meaningful changes were as rare as discovering penicillin. Here I find that nearly everything I do can and will immediately be applied to a paying customer usecase! And with Couchbase customer base comprising of most of the biggest brand names in almost every sector, be it retailers or credit unions or travel websites, chances are the stuff I do is immediately going to be used by a very huge number of people!",Free lunch only one day of the week.

106,Couchbase,Need technical direction not policies,2016-02-04,3.0,Software Engineer,"HR is quite active on Glassdoor, playing the saving grace. Please read their 5 star reviews for the ""pros"".","Like someone here clearly mentioned, we need more engineers than managers. There are too many managers, directors, sr. directors who are busy challenging each other, stepping into each other's territory, eventually ending up being counter-productive to the engineering teams. Loyalist culture is gradually taking root."
107,Couchbase,Why have so many people left Couchbase?,2017-03-30,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Very nice people at the individual contributor level, as well as some in management.
- Office very well designed and comfortable to work in","Looking back on my own experience at Couchbase I am struck by the astonishing talent exodus at the company available for anyone to see on LinkedIn. While I was there the management politics were cut-throat, information was hoarded and  the atmosphere was rife with secrecy and paranoia that obstructed productivity and drove talented employees out the door. There was little attempt that I saw by management to curb any of this, or even to acknowledge it was happening. To this day I am still being alerted to congratulate former employees on their new positions at other companies, so perhaps not much has changed."
108,Couchbase,"Rapid growth, more opportunity, exciting times",2017-01-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Although small, the group of people working at Couchbase are among the smartest and most dedicated. Everyone really believes in the product and celebrates wins together.
