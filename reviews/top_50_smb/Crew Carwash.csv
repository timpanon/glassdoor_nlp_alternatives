They also work around your schedule and you can get PTO or even take unpaid time off when needed. There’s more benefits listed on the application as well.",Working outside during the winter or a heat advisory isn’t for everyone. As well as being on your feet all day.

Free washes with each paycheck, health and wellness benefits, tuition reimbursement, and much more! On top of all of that, Crew creates an environment that focuses on having fun! You are supported by motivated and friendly people all day. All around, working for Crew is like having a second family!",Not really a con but it is an outside job.
14,Crew Carwash,Always a Different Day,2022-02-02,5.0,General Manager,"Every day is different. Sometimes I'm performing maintenance, helping customers, or developing the team. I can be myself in this diverse and inclusive organization.",Staffing sometimes creates times where managers work more each week. However most managers are hourly so compensation can be increased if you do whatever it takes!

20,Crew Carwash,Crew's Reputation is the Real Deal,2021-10-12,5.0,Senior Accountant I,"What you hear is what you get at Crew. The reputation of professionalism, friendliness, fairness & high quality that precedes Crew Carwash is truly the fiber of the company. I wasn't sure if all the 'hype' was going to be real when joining Crew (I have seen other companies where it's just words and fluff that hold no substance), but everyday I am happy to be proven wrong. Senior management values and appreciates contributors at every level of the company & shows the same level of respect to it's employees as it does to it's customers. I have never had such autonomy in my role, support from leadership as well as fair and equitable rewards for my contributions before coming to Crew. I can truly say that I am PROUD to work at Crew Carwash.",Crew is growing rapidly and with that come challenges to keep up with the demands of growth. This provides an opportunity for Crew to really solidify every part of it's business so it can capitalize on this growth.

-Lots of incentives for employees",-Winters are very busy and some cars get hard to clean with ice
23,Crew Carwash,"When your here, your family",2021-08-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Crew is great to both their customers and employees. They treat everyone like family and, with it being a family business, your truly feel like you are a part of the team. A lot of companies compromise on their values- that is one thing I respect so much about Crew. They also aren't afraid to try new things. They survey employees and want to hear how to improve.

Working at Crew, you have a network of locations that you know are there for you no matter what city you are in (where there is a Crew). Customers can expect consistency and employees feel respected and valued.

I can not say enough about this company. The opportunities they give their employees to reach their full potential is truly a promise- not just cute writing on a wall. They do what they say and have meaning behind everything they do. I am proud to say I work at Crew and I hope that this will help someone as they are on the job hunt!","Crew, like every company, isn't for everyone. It is a very fast paced environment with high standards. If you do your job well and do it with a smile, you will go far!"
24,Crew Carwash,People Business!,2022-02-11,5.0,General Manager,"-Support team and executives that are willing to listen and make changes for the people

25,Crew Carwash,Great Job,2022-02-03,5.0,Shift Manager,Crew has great benefits for everyone. You make amazing friends and have great opportunities,"Work and Life balance is very difficult. With the short staffing, I felt like we were overworked and under appreciated, but I am sure that happened every where"
26,Crew Carwash,Best people you will meet; strict system,2022-02-10,4.0,Part Time Evening Associate,"I think of some of my coworkers as family. Truly, I have enjoyed working with all of them and look forward to the future. I like the pay rate of $12 and the incentive program they have. I also like how they only hire 1%, it makes sure we work with outgoing people who want to be there. I like that we get free carwashes and that we have flexible scheduling. Now a disclaimer, Crew is the best employer I have worked for but, there are some drawbacks to the job.","Some of the drawbacks would be the temperatures in the winter or summer. In the winter, you have to stand outside if it is above 40. Even if there is no cars and it is a slow day, you are expected to stand outside and stare off into space. I find that this is a waste of time. Another drawback is the penial structure. I was late once 2 minutes early in the morning. I had to talk to my manager about it. I understand if I was 5,10,15 minutes but 2 minutes at 6am? Other than that, I love working here."
27,Crew Carwash,Marketing Supervisor,2022-02-07,5.0,Marketing Supervisor,"-the people we work with everyday are great

Benefits are also always a big plus it’s awesome to have the opportunity to have health benefits, tuition reimbursement, 401k, incentive pay, and so much more!","The weather can be difficult at times but you just have to prepare ahead of time. 
Being a manager has been a great leadership opportunity however longer hours and longer days become longer weeks and it becomes an expectation which is very exhausting. The appreciation definitely goes unseen at times and seems more like obligation which sometimes affects work/life balance."
29,Crew Carwash,Great job,2022-03-17,3.0,Manager,Fast paced outdoor atmosphere good pay,Very hot in summer. Work long hours
30,Crew Carwash,Do NOT Work Here,2022-01-06,2.0,Shift Manager,The people you work with are some of the best people you will ever meet.,"This company constantly overworks their employees. In this time of covid and short staffing, there has been no relief for the workers. They expect each and every location to run the store from 7am-8pm regardless of staffing. This makes it near impossible to give any breaks in this terrible weather. 
Crew expects all employees to be on their feet their full shift and work in the awful weather with varying temperature of below freezing up to heat advisories. But do not worry! You get to take your tie off when the temperature reaches 80°! 
This is only a small portion of everything I have witnessed at the carwash.
Everything said is my personal opinion."
31,Crew Carwash,Manager Review,2022-02-10,4.0,Assistant Manager,Been working at Crew for 6 years now and I say the people are top notch. Its very rare to work at a place where everybody has the same work ethic and shows up to work to have a good time and satisfy our customers.,Probably the thing that I least enjoy is the weather. We wash cars in all types of weather and it sure can take its toll mentally if you are standing in five degree weather taking car of customers.
32,Crew Carwash,Great,2022-02-11,5.0,Manager,Good owners and management along with perks,None all good times and fun

40,Crew Carwash,I did not enjoy working here.,2022-02-18,2.0,Assistant Manager,"- Pay is competitive.
- Training materials for management roles is great.
- Associate staff was fantastic.","- Poor corporate / regional management.
- Did not have a sense of ""purpose"".
- Performance is largely based off of sales.
- False upheaval of culture and values."
41,Crew Carwash,A lot of changes,2021-11-26,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The pay is nice out of college
There is a lot of opportunity to move up at the location, not so much into corporate 
Can get a ton of hours if that interests you
Professional development is awesome here","Seems as if there is a divide at corporate when compared to the locations. The locations work long hours and bad schedules, while corporate gets all the benefits. Also it is very difficult for you to get into corporate, they are always looking for someone with “more experience.” 
Each location is severely understaffed, but all they care about is building more locations instead of staffing there current ones. 
There are lots of people leaving, so it’s hard to build culture of that is something you value, and even if they don’t quit, they shuffle people around like they are pawns.
Seems like I have a lot of negative things, but this is a good place to work, just not for me"
42,Crew Carwash,Crew helps people reach their full potential,2021-10-04,5.0,Trainer,"I've worked at Crew for just over 5 years now. Every year that goes by, I feel that Crew gets better and better with how they treat their employees (which is impressive because it was already one of the best places to work). Crew is really selective with team members they hire. Because of this, I feel that everybody I work with is positive and easy to get along with. Crew also will invest in their employees, helping them improve both professionally and personally.","On the wash side--it's realistic to move up in your career quickly. At the support center, certain positions don't have as much upward mobility as I would like to see."
43,Crew Carwash,Amazing company with continual growth and expansion,2021-12-15,5.0,Assistant Manager,"Work - life balance is great

Crew leadership values and respects employees, and provides frequent opportunities for continued development.",Night and weekend work with retail operating hours. Current growth rate provides occasional challenges to workload.
49,Crew Carwash,Great Company,2021-12-11,5.0,ASM- Assistant Store Manager,Always looking for ways to make associates happier. Definite open door policy with upper management. Large enough company to have great benefits but small enough to still care.,"Shift scheduling.
Lots of sales pushing on customers."
50,Crew Carwash,A Family Owned Business That Cares!,2021-03-16,5.0,Operations Manager,"I have truly enjoyed being employed by Crew Carwash for close to 4 years now! It’s a great environment to work in where “fun” and “teamwork” are highly encouraged! I’ve made some really great friends working here. 
I also love the flexibility of the schedule, it makes it easy for me to attend my daughters appointments for example without having to take a PTO day. 
I love the “family owned” aspect of it. I feel Crew truly cares for their people. The leaders in the company try their best to make the workplace a positive and enjoyable place to be. We’ve even been taken to Top Golf and Kings Island for company outings! 
Lastly- the training that we receive is top notch. Whether it’s Relational Intelligence workshops or a Dale Carnegie course, I feel privileged to work for a company that provides training courses like these.",While the flexibility of the schedule is a plus- the inconsistency of the schedule might be a downfall for some. It is not a regular “9-5” job. We do have a busy season where you may have to come in early/stay late or maybe even pick up an extra shift. Managers are required to work certain shifts as part of their 5 days worked for the week which include at least 1 open shift and 1 closing shift.
51,Crew Carwash,The pay is not worth the job at all.,2021-11-05,2.0,Team Member,You work with some really kind hearted people here. Most of the managers are pretty friendly.,You fold towels all day when not busy or a rain day. Trust me it sucks. The pay does amount to the amount of labor that is worked. They complain about quality even though its only a 10 min express clean. What a joke. If you want hours DO NOT WORK FOR CREW.  They push you back for no reason sometimes. Also they promote whoever they want. I will not recommend  this to anyone. Its backbreaking work and the pay sucks BAD!

Some of the other benefits of working at crew would be your team is like your second family, paid vacation time, 401k, tuition reimbursement, competitive pay, and overall the company is always looking to be better not only for the team members but as a whole company growing as well!","The only con I would say is having to deal with weather with some days being freezing and some days being super hot, but Crew supplies all the needed items for you to be comfortable during those times so it is bearable."

This is honestly the best position I have ever held in the workforce and my quality of life has increased immensely because of it!","I honestly don't have anything negative to say about Crew. The only thing that might turn potential candidates away is having to work in temperature extremes, but this has not bothered me one bit as Crew takes all necessary precautions to make sure their employees are prepared and cared for during those times."

There is a standard always wanting to be met or overachieved with any task leaving no grey area with your work or the associates.","Hiring is hard sometimes leaving you shorthanded for periods of time.

Mechanical knowledge is required, if you are not someone that enjoys fixing equipment and coming in early or staying late to do so, might not be for you. They will teach you how to work on equipment.
Taking time off can be difficult if staffing is rough, and there is a blackout period where you cannot use PTO because it is the busiest part of the year.
Advancement to mid tier management happens quickly, anything afterwards can be very inconsistent and difficult to obtain. 
Job can get very repetitive, but if you’re looking for consistency this is a pro."

I have coworkers who care about my skills and training, and they coach me regularly to highlight what is going well and what could be tweaked. The company offers monthly incentives for all associates and they make sure that anyone who wants a break receives one. The training with Crew is as good as advertised. This truly has been the best training I've received at any job, and I've even conducted training and orientation for a couple previous employers. I'd say it's really hard to not feel fully prepared for this job. The Manager in Training program itself is phenomenal. The training dives into such depth that you really would be surprised that they care such about making sure you truly understand every aspect of running a carwash.","You're on your feet all day, but that's to be expected.

•Managers get every other weekend off if location staffing allows it
•Crew pays out monthly awards for associate level team members. Incentive (commission) bonus pay is given for reaching sales goals. Amazon gift cards are given to everyone after company promotions based on location performance","•Hours can be brutal sometimes. I rarely have to work more than my normal weekly requirement but the shifts vary greatly from day to day and week to week. 
•So much focus on cutting labor through the day that it is difficult to complete other important tasks. We are told that a perfect score isn’t the expectation but still get reprimanded in some form if the scores aren’t close enough to perfect.
•Along with less time during the day to complete tasks managers are also being passed on new items for daily/weekly completion 
•Still some obvious items at older stores that have been and keep being skipped to make time for new store construction 
•Many location are consistently short staffed which is time managers are expected to pick up. I get multiple emails weekly from different locations asking for help, usually needing multiple shifts for the week.
•Just over 2 weeks of PTO management team members with some limits on when/how we are able to use it. No sick time and calling in sick puts a very large strain on the locations for the day due to how tightly shifts are run and how few people each location has."

They work really hard to ensure you have a good work/life balance and aren't spending all of your time at the carwash.",The only downside to the job is working outside in the winter.  They do a good job at keeping you comfortable by providing hand warmers and warm drinks.

255,Crew Carwash,Manager-Times are changing.,2020-01-16,3.0,Operations Manager,"-Competitive hiring process makes for like minded, hard working employees
-Classroom training allows for a more thorough understanding of what you are doing, and allows you to meet people from other stores
-High expectations in some areas leads to great results in team members and allows for a clean and safe work environment. 
-The company really has stepped up their safety game. Austin has done a great job here and I hope he is rewarded fairly for this. 
-The Amazon gift cards are nice 
-Your coworkers and managers really do care about you and your well being. They have been there for me in some of my hardest times. 
-They push you to better yourself, and help you along the way.","This is a great place to work, do not get me wrong. There are a few things that really need re-evaluated though. 

-More accountability for the GM. Seems like other managers are held accountable for their work or lack of, while the GM doesn’t get much heat. ADs will listen if you come forward. But if you don’t, they hardly notice. 

-Labor NEEDS to be re-evaluated. The flex credits have helped, but it’s only a bandaid for the problem. All stores are increasing in volume due to increased unlimited sales. That’s great, but we need to be allowed more labor to do tasks outside of production. It puts more stress on the managers who now get PUNISHED for working more overtime to complete the items asked of us. And we then get punished for not being in production. It doesn’t make sense. 

-We need a strategy for better retention and recruiting. They work hard in the recruiting department, and it shows. But they need more support for more locations. Also, I strongly think we need to relook at our appearance guidelines. Tattoos, piercings, and colored hair are the norm now. We are missing out on a big market of people just because they wanted to get their child’s name tattooed on them. 

-The fasttrack program is great. But it almost has created a mentality of “Let’s move someone up” for the sake of saying you did, rather than them earning it. I’ve seen a few managers get promoted before they’re ready and it left them either getting burnt out, quitting, or getting fired."

262,Crew Carwash,Great Company With A Solid Background And Bright Future,2019-07-24,5.0,Anonymous,"Where to begin about the pros of working at Crew Carwash? Because there are so many! First and foremost, the best part of working at Crew is the people. The people that work at Crew are some of the most hardworking and dedicated people I have ever had the pleasure to work with and meet. Some Managers and Support Team members have been with Crew for 10+ years, and I really think that says something about how the company treats their employees with kindness, respect, and fairness. Next up, the flexibility of scheduling is another great thing about Crew. We make our schedules three weeks in advance, so that gives employees enough time to enter in times that work best for them to work and request days off in case they have appointments that they need to take care of. I truly believe that this gives our employees the advantage of being on their A game when they are scheduled at the times that best works for them! Most of the time, these requests are met and taken into consideration. Furthermore, Crew is a family owned company that truly treats you like a family member. Whether you work at a Crew Carwash in an outer-market or the Indy area, you can connect with other Managers and employees and create an instant connection or friendship with one another. Alongside that, all problems and concerns are taken into account and taken seriously at Crew, just like a family. If there is ever a suggestion or a comment that needs to be addressed about work items, you feel comfortable enough to have that conversation with others. Personal topics can even be discussed. I, personally, have discussed personal things going on in my life with my Manager and have even asked them for advice on how to handle certain life situations! I think it's amazing that Crew can provide an environment that allows you feel comfortable to express both personal and work items.  In addition, pay is very competitive at Crew. A high schooler, for their first job, can make $10 and can have bonuses and incentives on top of that! Full Time employees and Managers make a very competitive salary for the service industry as well. Last but not least, promotions are based on performance at Crew Carwash. Most companies base promotions and raises on how long a certain employee has been with a company, but not Crew! We truly value those employees who work hard and will compensate and promote those who do versus those who do the bare minimum. I think that is amazing and should always be the case.","The downsides of working at Crew Carwash are relevant to the service industry. Shifts can be shortened or lengthened based on the volume of cars being washed. This means that on a busy day you might be asked to stay for an extra hour or two, versus on a slower rainy day you might leave a shift an hour or two early, so it does kind of end up even in the end. Weather also plays a huge role in our business. Due to this, working in the extreme heat and extreme cold are necessary, but is not for everyone. However, Crew does it's best to keep everyone healthy and safe during extreme hot and cold temperatures by providing you with breaks and gear to keep you warm or cool depending on the season."

271,Crew Carwash,One of the BEST!,2019-05-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"You have a  work family across the entire state. It doesn't matter if you are in Merrillville or Bloomington, when you work at Crew, you're apart the family and that is what really makes Crew shine (pun intended). Crew also loves to listen to everyone in the company. If you have an idea on how a process or project could work better, you are always encouraged to bring it up and get a conversation started!

Tuition assistance is some of the best in the retail industry. They even have a loan repayment program that you can sign up for and they will help you pay off school loans faster. They are always looking for programs that will help their employees reach their full potential.

Opportunity is everywhere.  Crew is growing and with growth, they have added many new positions! This is a great place to work if you are looking for a career either out at a location or in our support office.

The leadership of this company is second to none. They are always open to new ideas, they work very hard to make Crew the best it can be and they are some of the nicest people you will ever meet. Working for Crew has been such a blessing and I could not be prouder to tell people where I work when they ask!","I wouldn't say this is a con, but because of the growth and volume of the company, things are ALWAYS moving... and moving quickly! I've always been at my best when I am busy, so it works for me. If you are looking for a place where you leave each day feeling like you have put in a good day of work, Crew is the place for you!"

280,Crew Carwash,Assistant Manager,2017-09-25,5.0,Assistant Manager,"The amount of resources that this company in vests on their employees is unlike any other. When I first got hired here I would be hesitant of letting them know that I worked at a car wash but I know I'll proudly let them know that I work for Crew Carwash. This is the company that paid nearly $20,000 to transfer me from Northwest Indiana to Indianapolis. I, at the time was a lower-level manager and had not been with the company for even a year. Nevertheless all the Crew cares for is one's willingness to be a good, hard worker. 

This is not just a car wash; it is an organization that is willing to not only hire great talent but also develop their own leaders in the community. They will take chances and invest in young kids whom they see potential in. 

Management is intuitive and it's not out of touch with the business. Higher Management constantly ask for feedback from their lower associates all the way to the management team at each store and they actually take steps to make things better or to make them more efficient.

At Crew I'm able to make a living, but the skills and the resources that go towards developing people and make them better leaders is worth another salary in itself.","Hours can be long at Crew, end it is difficult to staff the store since Crew is very picky about who it hires."
281,Crew Carwash,Amazing place to work,2019-07-25,5.0,Assistant Manager,You meet a great deal of amazing people when working for this company. They expect nothing but the best in all aspects of business. Awesome work environment.,Work schedule can be hectic for people with families.

Working full time as a manager while in school enabled me to build my resume while also really enjoying my job. The people that work for Crew are the best, their unique hiring process does a great job of setting up the team for success.  Personally my favorite thing about the company was how easy it was to talk to the higher ups in management. The President, Marketing Director, and other high authority figures were always around the locations and always listening for ways to improve. The lessons I learned from working at Crew set me apart when it came to interviewing for jobs in my career field. I highly recommend young adults looking for some structure in their life to consider working here!",Staffing. As a manager if your store is low-staffed it is on you to either make up for that loss of production or train someone new to come in and help. If you don't do well in high-pace situations it may not be the job for you.
289,Crew Carwash,Assistant Manager/Fast-Tracker,2017-09-26,5.0,Assistant Manager,"I've been with Crew for a little less then a year. I got a job as a Fast-Tracker/Manager in Training after receiving a management and accounting degree from IU. At first I was hesitant to let people know that i worked at a carwash, but now i take pride on telling everyone that i work for Crew Carwash. 

Crew is way more then a carwash. This company is one that develops people and truly cares about its employees. I was hired as a Fast-Tracker due to my experience and education credentials but crew also makes leaders itself. They don't care about seniority; when I started working here I saw young, hard working managers that were great leaders. 

Crew is more then just a company; it's an organization. Management takes great strides to get feedback from associates ans lower level management to create  a better work environment. 

There is an immense amount amount of resources that get allocated towards creating world class leadership. 

Wages are fair and when the company's performance is doing well everyone gets a raise.",Staffing stores can be difficult due to Crew's very selective hiring process. Benefits are also somewhat expensive.
290,Crew Carwash,General Manager at Crew Carwash,2017-10-25,5.0,General Manager,I have been at Crew for 10 years now and really enjoy it.  It is a family owned company which is awesome because you know who the owners are and they make themselves available if you need them.  Everyone that works here cares about each other and we all work as a Team to succeed.  As long as you are staffed properly you get every other weekend off which is rare in the service/retail industry.  The pay is great...starts off at $10/hour for part timers and the managers are well taken care of too.  I have never been afraid of loosing my job due to any type of downsizing so I feel very secure in my position and knowing there will alway be a job for me here.,"We work outside so extreme temperatures do affect you, but we have things in place to make them bearable."

Crew management is always open to team member input and changes, if something else will work better.

Flexible with those who are in school and a great tuition reimbursement program! Also provide a loan repayment incentive for full time team members.","Working at Crew is difficult, but is also very rewarding. Come ready to work! 

At locations, hours are dependent on the weather, so you could work less one week than previous weeks. However, this allows for great flexibility. Shifts can be easily moved around with your team.

Since Crew is a retail business, we are busy around major holidays so we have to be strict with PTO and time off to make sure the teams have enough people to run efficiently."

Crew has met my needs from a professional and a personal standpoint.

297,Crew Carwash,"Excellent Culture, Great People, Even Greater Job.",2018-05-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"All of the people are amazing, hiring is very strict and no one gets into Crew who isn't a quality person/worker. This keeps pay competitive, and the work atmosphere excellent. Benefits are nice, tuition reimbursement, student loan repayment, HSA, and more.

The culture is amazing, and employees and management are empowered to truly make the customer happy by whatever means necessary. Employees are truly appreciated with constant team meetings, contest prizes, corporate recognition, etc.

Training is encouraged and highly effective, with classes being taken in person at the corporate office. All the classes I have taken have been amazing.  All online training is structured and easy to follow.

Working with customers is great, which is what I love, and you get some sales experience with upselling, and customer service experience by dealing with issues that arise, as well as a little management experience for associates if you help train new employees and assist managers with their duties.

Scheduling is a breeze, all of it goes through an app which makes communication easy and automated. No chaos in trading or covering shifts since all employees have the responsibility of managing their shifts through the app. Everything is a few weeks out scheduled, and requesting time off or availability is simple.

Once again, the people are great. The culture is great. All management and corporate employees are truly invested in the company and the ""Crew Values"" and make sure all employees and customers are happy. It's run like places used to be, and if you put in your hard work, you WILL be recognized.","You WILL work outside. Extreme hot, extreme cold. I'm used to it but to some it can be a little much. To me, it's the trade-off for working somewhere so awesome.

Hours can vary if you are full time/management. You will not always have the same schedule, and may work till 10pm or start at 5am, or both. Most schedules are ""guidelines"" and you will often stay over as full-time, if it says 2, you're not leaving until 3:30 and the closers come in. Similarly, you will get sent home other days early.  You get to judge the days more accurately the longer you work though. Part-timers are usually set in stone. I do wish there was more variation in times for managers, if certain people preferred certain times and there was sufficient coverage, that everyone had a set schedule more often, instead of it varying wildly week to week.

Maybe loading will become more automated in the future, it's not for everyone and it's usually everyone's least favorite thing to do, but everyone ensures proper rotation while loading the vehicles so that you don't get burnt out.

You better like walking, most days for me are 5+ miles, which I enjoy, however this may be a con to some. You will be very tired at the end of full-time shifts.

My location seems to be understaffed. Other locations may not have this issue. Most normal to busy days are super hectic and you literally will not have a chance to even sit down and rest your legs for at least 5+ hours, unless you go to the bathroom. Which- is the only place there even is to sit down besides the manager's chair. You will be doing lots of standing and literally no sitting, besides a bathroom break, or your lunch break. I wish there was more staffing so employees could take a few 5 minute breathers throughout the day so it wasn't as taxing, or at least places to sit down in the office for employees besides one or two chairs."
298,Crew Carwash,A Company That *Gets* It,2019-06-13,5.0,Assistant Manager,"I’ve been with Crew for 6.5 months now and have completed their Fast-Track manager program. It is truly intense, but you will not find a company more in tune with the idea that “well-selected and well-cared for employees will serve your interests infinitely better than the opposite”. Crew truly has taken its time to build a world-class training program, which, when coupled with top-notch benefits and competitive pay, truly equal an unparalleled employee experience. The training program isn’t for everyone, but if you want to challenge yourself to learn all new skills and take a deep-dive into improving your business acumen, Crew may be in your wheelhouse!",All the cons are really just warnings: be prepared to bring your “A” game. Be prepared to work with amazing people. Be prepared to work hard and to be rewarded for it. Be prepared.
299,Crew Carwash,Service Industry Leader,2017-10-18,5.0,Fast Track Manager,They are flexible with a school schedule and allow requests for certain days off if staffing allows it. The pay is more than most would expect and the benefits are second to none. They offer endless amounts of training to not only better yourself but also allow for advancement within the company.,Possibility of having sick days in addition to PTO days would be an added benefit. Also there is a lot of pressure to promote individuals into management and leadership positions even when they aren't exactly what we'd look for to fill those type of positions.
300,Crew Carwash,Crew Carwash,2018-09-14,5.0,Shift Manager,"I have never worked at a place that I loved so much. The people that I work with are amazing, and continuously keep me loving my job. Crew goes through quite an in-depth hiring process, but it is worth it in the end. The people that work at all Crew locations are the best people in the state. Also, I am so happy to work for a company that cares about my growth, and wants me to continue learning and utilizing my strengths. I cannot imagine working anywhere else, because I get to be outside all day and work with amazing people.","If you cannot handle standing on your feet for longer than 6 hours, this probably is not the place for you. Or if you cannot handle being outside whether it is 90 degrees or 15 degreees for over an hour, then it is probably not the place for you."
301,Crew Carwash,Safety Coordinator,2018-06-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Crew is a great family owned business that truly cares about their team members.  They want to develop you to be the best you can be inside and outside of work.  They do this by having an outstanding training program that develops the team member to each position they want to reach within the company.  While learning skills for the next position they work in productivity and emotional intelligence workshops to help you outside of work as well.  All team members are super friendly and welcoming.  This creates a want and urge to do the best you can.,It is a fast paced environment.  I came into a position that had been vacant and had to learn from the ground up what they were doing on my own. ( this was for a management position.  The associate route is nothing similar.)
302,Crew Carwash,Cares about employees,2018-02-04,5.0,Associate,"Many benefits including biweekly free washes (works, ultimate), competitions between crew members for cash prizes and more that I can’t think of at the moment. Great training for regular employees and managers. The managers at the location I work at are very proficient and have high accountability for their actions. Crew does not keep management staff who  don’t follow their vision ( a good thing).","Nothing outstanding, the only thing I can think of is you need to stand all the time during your shift, that’s about it."
303,Crew Carwash,Fantastic Company,2017-10-26,4.0,Anonymous Employee,I know going into work every day that I will be working with a great group of people. The training is very thorough and it is very easy to know what the expectations are. There is plenty of room for growth in this fast growing company. Higher ups listen to us at the location level and value our input which is very encouraging. The pay is pretty good and benefits are as well.,"Working in extreme weather conditions, both hot and cold, can make very long and hard shifts. PTO could be greatly improved. PTO does not roll over and there is a several month long blackout period which makes taking it a pain at times. Work/life balance can be pretty thrown off if someone misses a shift or quits as shifts are usually staffed pretty thin. Uniforms are a bit too strict and grooming standards are very old fashioned (i.e. hair length, color, no piercings for men, no tattoos, etc.)"
304,Crew Carwash,Assistant Manager,2017-10-13,5.0,Assistant Manager,Crew has a very fun and friendly environment. You get to work outdoors and have many opportunities to interact with customers.The team at the support center is always very friendly and helpful. Even the higher ups like the CEO and COO genuinely care about what is going on with the people who work for them.,"only about 13 days of PTO after two years of service and it slowly increases from there. no maternity/paternity leave or sick pay, so you have to tap in to what little PTO you have for those kinds of things"
305,Crew Carwash,Great company to work for.,2019-06-20,5.0,Shift Manager,This has been the best company I have worked for.  I was hired in as a manager in training.  The process was very detailed on what was going to be expected of me when starting.  I had to interview with multiple people to make sure I was the right fit.  That interview process only means that your co workers and yourself live up to the standards that they expect.  I couldn't of picked a better company to continue my journey of management.,There are really no cons that I have experienced.  It is a hot/cold job depending on the season but that is to be expected when being outside.
306,Crew Carwash,Great People!  Great Place to Work!,2017-09-25,5.0,Management,"The people, the culture and the positive reinforcement are amazing!  Values that are meaningful and are lived by all.  Everyone works hard, takes ownership and works as a team.  I enjoy the team events and that the company gives back to the community.  Feedback is requested often and acted upon.  Feedback is given often and performance is rewarded.","Sometimes expectations are too high for what can get done, but in most cases a little push back will help make proper adjustments."
307,Crew Carwash,Great company that takes care of their employees,2018-10-09,5.0,Customer Service Advisor,"Great management 
Fun work environment
Base pay is great
Constant opportunities for bonuses and extra money","Working conditions can be harsh but they try to keep you as comfortable as possible
Sometimes fast track managers can disrupt team chemistry, but not always
Some company wide policies get passed even though the response is overwhelmingly negative, such as not letting employees carry pocket knives anymore"
308,Crew Carwash,It's rough but I love it,2015-04-12,4.0,Full Time Associate,"They hire based on personality, so everyone there is relatively likeminded and everyone gets along very well. They try to proved a fun environment. They increased the pay, so it now is awesome. There are a lot of advancement opportunities and management works to get you where you need to be. The tuition reimbursement is nice. It definitely helps take some of the pressure off of being in a 4 year college as well gives incentive to do well.  It is very competitive. They don't take any crap. Though turnover is high, this helps keep a quality team.","Weather conditions suck.  Especially in the winter. Customers can sometime be crabby. With turnover being high, it still stinks to see some great people go. There are a lot of little gimics they add that can be irritating and unnecessary."
309,Crew Carwash,Director,2015-04-21,1.0,,The people you work with can be really cool. Some of the incentives they give out like amazon gift cards are nice.,"almost everything about the job sucks! Long hours in Hot/Cold and if you are a Director most Service Advisors won't help you out with customers ""special"" requests which makes the job super annoying. They say flexible scheduling thats a lie. I asked to be taken off of opening shifts because I was working two jobs at once and sometimes wouldnt get home till after midnight so they said sure we will fix that. Well they gave me every single opening shift possible! Needless to say they lost me after that. All in all I wouldn't work there again and would highly reccomend that you don't either. Unless of course you like being micro managed and getting worked to death with very little pay! Oh and the ""WoW"" program is a joke. Basically working at Crew Carwash is indentured servitude!"
310,Crew Carwash,Fast paced and great benefits,2019-06-20,5.0,Shift Manager,Crew is a great place to work. Great benefits and great starting pay. I’m currently in the fast track program to become a manager. It is challenging to learn the whole business in a short period of time but I have a great team supporting me. Also very flexible with scheduling.,"The only downside I can even think of is being exposed to the elements. As long as you can deal with the heat and cold, this is barely a con."
311,Crew Carwash,PEOPLE -TOP TO BOTTOM,2017-10-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have worked for Crew Carwash for many years. One of the most impressive things about Crew is that the PEOPLE at the top, set an inspiring example by their extraordinary work ethic. The Owner, CEO, President and Executive Vice President all work their butts off and have a strong belief that it's all about the PEOPLE.

In many companies, the executives at the top just sit in an office, sometimes far away and out of touch with operations and then hand down decisions and instructions that  are clueless of reality.

At Crew, the retired Founder,  who is over 90 years old, still has a passion and enthusiasm for the business and the PEOPLE. His son, the current Owner, who has been in the business over 40 years, still has a passion and enthusiasm for the little details that will be important to the PEOPLE of the company and to the customers. The President and Executive VP both have decades in the business. All those at the top are very much hands on, very familiar, in  touch and sincerely concerned with the reality of what is going on with the PEOPLE, from the top Managers all the down to the entry level Associates.  They have an intense focus on doing what is right for the PEOPLE of the company and the customers.

When you see how hard those PEOPLE at the top work, when they are out in the field with the PEOPLE, you can't help but be inspired to raise the bar of your own performance at least a little bit and maybe a lot.

At Crew, the BEST thing about the company is the PEOPLE.  TOP TO BOTTOM.

If you are a PEOPLE person, you should be able to look forward to a very fulfilling career at Crew Carwash.","If you are not a PEOPLE person, you might not fit in very well"
312,Crew Carwash,At Crew Carwash I work with many team members who make everyday enjoyable.,2017-10-19,5.0,,The best thing about Crew Carwash is the environment. Each location team is filled with great employees. The tuition reimbursement at Crew is also a plus!,The challenges of working at Crew are the extreme temperates. There are many hot/cold days throughout the year. Crew does a very good job making these days enjoyable and safe for their employees.
313,Crew Carwash,A great job ruined by corporate ambitions,2016-01-25,2.0,Sales Associate,"Fun, fast-paced environment
Great merit-based sales rewards
Promotions to management are very fair and straightforward
Flexible hours","My location had a 100% turnover rate in the year I worked there
Understaffed constantly
Heavy emphasis on sales performance
As a sales associate, you must follow a very awkward, very narrow script with customers, that involves badgering them to upgrade, no matter what wash they chose. Failure to do so to a secret shopper results in a slap on the wrist. However, a second failed secret shopper in six months results in immediate termination, no exceptions.
Tiring, this is both a manual labor and customer service job
No job safety whatsoever"
314,Crew Carwash,Fun and rewarding,2017-10-04,5.0,General Manager,"Crew has given me loads of opportunities I never expected to have. I started as a part-time high school employee 6 years ago and now act as a General Manager of a location.  I love the people I work around, the job is fun and challenging, and the pay is competitive.","There are lots of different aspects to the job, which is a pro and a con.

It is a company invested in its employees and its customers. It is a great place to gain experience and grow in management as well.,"While I really like that we all have uniforms to keep a professional look, we are allowed to wear hats with visors but not sunglasses.

Micro managed from top down to bottom level,2015-01-08,2.0,Shift Manager,Crew hires based on personality so you work with like minded positive people. Downfall is that management uses this to ask for longer work days and working with hazardous cleaning chemicals nightly knowing team members are afraid to disappoint them.,Not safe!

 interesting place to work
Taught me what hard work is 
Good customer service exposure
Safe environment","-No accountability for associates, Let many workers off the hook with things that were against the rules. This was noticed by all other associated, and encouraged them to also be lazy and break rules, making a team of lazy workers who knew they would get away with things. 
-managers leave the young kids outside to work alone while they sit inside
  -low pay for the work being done (almost every place pays $10 an hour now). 
- Horrible schedules for young worker (worked sometimes 8 days in a row, 8 hour shifts) 
-8 hours is way too long for some kids to stand on their feet in those conditions.
-Poor training on how to handle customer incidents and angry customers
- management and corporate workers gave the same ""automated"" responses to every question and complaint you had
- some management members made you feel bad and stupid for the questions you asked
-some management members made it an uncomfortable work environment by talking about other associates and saying ""sassy"" rude comments to associate team members.
-lots of managers did not do the weekly jobs that they were assigned to do, leaving lots of things around the location broken and unusable for customers and associates. Things that we were asking customers to pay for never worked, and management knew of these issues. This resulted in workers getting yelled at by angry customers daily.
- managers would ask associates to do certain things and punish them if they didn't, and then the managers would get caught not doing them either."

354,Crew Carwash,Manager,2018-02-25,4.0,Management,"Crew teaches a lot about positive work environment, organization, and even more important subjects such as mechanical skills and leadership that really help you for the rest of your life. If you put in atleast a year at Crew. It will look good on your resume to anyplace local. Many local business in the state of Indiana actually try to recruit Crew employees cause they know they are trained well in customer focus and many other aspects. Even some employers I've been told are ""wow'd"" when they see Crew on job history on a resume. It's for sure a great experience that can set you up in the future if you play your cards right. There's also a great opportunity to move up in the company. I cannot count how many associates I've seen move into a management position, and management move into maintenance, office support, etc.","Performance is key but it can bite you in the rear if you don't stay on top.  Regular performance appraisals and reviews are common. Mystery shopper reports with bad grades and lead to termination. The companies does a good job on their company promise but I have seen it fail multiple times. I've seen favoritism and fraternizing happen a lot even though the company claims to be strictly against it. I actually lost a promotion to someone who should have been fired for inappropriate manager associate relationships. But since they were the favorite, they ended up keeping their job and advancing at the same time. Which caused a lot of people to quit or get fired in the process."
355,Crew Carwash,Losing their touch,2018-09-24,3.0,Manager,"Crew is a great place for younger people looking to gain experience in the working world. Crew provides top notch customer service training and is very flexible for the part time role. There are plenty of opportunities for growth and to earn a little extra cash through contests and monthly awards. 
Crew also does a great job weeding out most bad candidates for a job. You tend to work with very like-minded, energetic people who enjoy coming in to work everyday.","Morale around the locations has started to trend downward over the past couple of years. This is due to several things, but mainly staffing, promotions, and unlimited customers.
Crew locations are notoriously short staffed. I see emails multiple times a week of locations reaching out to get shift coverage. The problem is that all locations experience short staffing (some more than others) which means no one has extra help to lend out. This leads to the over working and burning out of managers. We as managers are expected to pick up the slack when a high schooler calls off because they have a headache. 45 hours a week minimum is plenty. There have been a number of times when I have worked 50-55 hours just to help the store make ends meet. But the second you cannot pick up another shift, your WIT's attitude ""Whatever it Takes) is called into question. Stores are also encouraged to run with the least amount of people necessary to complete a job. We must follow strict staffing guidelines and if we don't there are repercussions. There is no work-life balance. Forget about having weekends off or a regular schedule. 
The next downfall is the constant promotions we are forced to bombard on our customers. In the past there were just a couple of shorter promotions throughout the year to show off the books and maybe the unlimited once or twice. Now, we are constantly promoting pretty much year round. The 2018 Father's Day book sale kicked off several weeks earlier than normal this year. When that ended in the middle of June, we immediately (the day after) transitioned into an Unlimited Introductory Pricing sale. Initially we were told this promotion would run based on how successful it was. Shockingly, the promotion was successful and it has been extended not once but twice until November 11. To make things better, we started our 8 week book promotion for Christmas on November 12. I wish the organization would have been more upfront with how long they intended this sale to last. Those of us who work at the location level are exhausted with these promotions. Sure, your revenue has probably increased. But your teams are worn out. It is incredibly frustrating to have every customer cut you off mid sentence in your ""recommendation"" and throw the handout back at your face because they have heard some variation of this speech for the past 5 months. 
This leads me to my third grievance: The Unlimited Club. The Unlimited Club has destroyed Crew Carwash and what made it a nice place to work. Location volumes have doubled and even tripled in some cases over the course of the last couple years. Yet we still have the same expectations to complete weekly and period tasks around the store and are expected to do more with hardly any staffing. We also still must complete grueling tasks such as nightly clean up if a location does not have cleanup team members. All of this is in addition to the frustration of washing the same clean cars everyday, sometimes multiple times a day. I can tell you what time a day a certain customer (who I know by name) will show up to have their car washed for the 12th time this week. This is just grueling and employees at the location level are exhausted."

357,Crew Carwash,Learn and Move On,2017-08-10,2.0,Operations Manager,"Great training program and culture. Worked with some truly great people over 5 years. Learned a lot about management and maintenance that helped transition me to the next step in my career. 

If you excel they will move you up the ladder as fast as you can climb.","You can see job postings EVERYWHERE for Crew. That's because they simply can't retain good talent. There's a reason for that. 

Over my 5 years I worked at 8 DIFFERENT locations (3 locations I had 2 trips back to), yet somehow my raises and job performance was tied to the struggling location I was brought in to help. As soon as they got better, I was shipped back out.

I got tired of being expected to miss or delay family plans because a high school associated decided to hang out with friends on a nice day. 

Salaried managers were taken advantage of. Expected to cover extra shifts consistently over hourly managers. Salaried managers were minimum of 50hr/wk but just like ""pieces of flair"", it's the minimum, and the minimum isn't the true expectation. Realistically average 55 with rain/snow weeks being around 45-50 and nice weeks being around 55-65 depending on staffing.

To take off 9 consecutive days for vacation, you must use 7 vacation days. . . vs 5 typical of Mon-Fri jobs. Get used to monthly 5am meetings where you need to show up for 2-3 hours on your day off or expected to come back in at 2 to close the store.

You are seen as easily replaceable at a lower cost. Next batter up mentality with management development, which is good for advancement opportunities, but bad for career opportunities. They will burn you out and replace you."

360,Crew Carwash,High Standards for Little Compensation,2018-09-01,2.0,SERVICE ADVISOR,"Because of their higher standards, the employees are a lot better than most. You don't get the weird employees you would at say, a supermarket. The workplace atmosphere is also quite nice, usually pretty open and free. Management was lovely as well, usually always friendly and helpful whenever I needed them.","Standards are ungodly high. I can understand if someone were to mess up too many times they'd be let go, that's perfectly reasonable. Their policies however, go above and beyond strict, and I'm not sure if I could list them here due to rules so I won't.  I will however list a few I see repeated on other reviews.
1. VERY specific grooming requirements
2. Interesting schedule planning
3. Morning meetings
4. Uniforms
5. Benefits

Grooming was very uptight. I never got called out on it because I usually did a decent job grooming myself, but others did. One rule in particular caught me as plain stupid, was ""no transitional facial hair."" In other words, it's okay to come into the job with a beard, but you cannot start to grow one so long as you are working there. 

I'm sure I could talk about my hours worked. There have been weeks where I am scheduled 30-40 hours, and end up working maybe half of that if I'm lucky. It actually got to the point where I needed to beg others for shifts simply to have a chance at meeting my own financial demands. I understand I was part time, and that a business needs to make money by shortening staff for the day, but you can schedule less people in a single day, can't you?

I will say I was terminated from my position, and I'm not ashamed to admit that, because I didn't really see this job as favorable. The reasoning I was terminated was because I had missed a morning meeting after a previous code of conduct issue was noted. I gladly admitted it was my own fault, my alarm clock was incorrectly set after all. I feel though a two-strike policy is a little extreme, especially when you put so much time and money into your employees. No one is perfect, after all.

Uniforms are an interesting thought. So instead of the employer just purchasing a uniform for you, you were the one who purchased the uniform, and you paid for it paycheck by paycheck. So instead of getting your full pay, a fixed amount of your pay went towards you uniform account. The worst part of all of this is once your uniform was paid off, the account would simply grow from there for future uniform purchases. A nice idea, but you never got to see that bit of money taken out from every check. 

Finally, benefits. I don't see how this company has good benefits, I never once though ""oh, this is worth it"" from this job. No real part-time benefits besides a couple of free washes every week, and if you got the highest sales for a day, you get some money at the next morning meeting. That's it. Those are the only benefits I've observed for part-time associates. I don't know why this company is so highly ranked as ""A great place to work!"" when they do the things they do to employees."
