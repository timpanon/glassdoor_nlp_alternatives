13,Digital Prospectors,There in Time of Need,2021-07-16,5.0,Sub Contractor,"They've been great to work with already, but it was truly apparent how great this company was when my husband got laid off suddenly a few months ago. Jen Heimberg (my sponsor) was able to help us get onto my insurance and bumped up my yearly raise up a month to help cover the cost. THEN she worked to help my husband find a new role. While my husband was able to find something quickly, Jen still reached back to check in on how we were doing, which was fantastic to hear that she cared so much for us. 

Definitely recommend this team. I've worked with contracting companies before and I've never felt as cared for as I do here. Jen especially has been very on top of anything I need, and I definitely appreciate all her and the company's help.",None that I've found so far.

What I particularly liked:
1) Decent benefits
2) No micromanagement
3) No Drama
4) Super kind

2. Flexibility of pay. Having the ability to forgo benefits (health/etc.) for a higher pay is really nice when you have a spouse/parents that you can enroll in a health plan with.

18,Digital Prospectors,Hired During a Pandemic - Couldn't be happier,2020-10-15,5.0,Account Executive,"The values and mission of this company are unparalleled anywhere else that I've worked. We hold ourselves to an incredibly high standard and are expected to perform and also support each other and the collective. The people here genuinely care about what we're doing and are supportive and genuine. It's one of those offices when someone asks you questions about your weekend and your family when they see you before they ask you about whether you saw that email they sent you last Thursday. This is a hard job in a hard industry, but the people I get to work alongside and learn from on a daily basis make it a job I'm excited about every day. The earning potential here is incredible and the benefits make it the kind of place where people stay...which is rare in this industry.",Onboarding and training remotely stinks...but that's the reality of COVID.

-There are variety of informal opportunities to interact with co-workers and mix up the daily grind (team building events, company parties, free lunches, volunteer events, book clubs, etc.).

My placement at a client's location has been fantastic - my recruiter has remained available and they really care about making sure I'm happy and setup for success here. Almost all servies are through ADP (paychecks, retirement, PTO balances, etc.) - making it very easy to check and manage your pay and benefits.","The 100% company-paid for health insurance is kind of a misnomer - you can leave health insurance and take almost $10,000 more per year in base-compensation, but you have to ask for it. I wish they had been more up-front about this. There is not a lot of growth for contractors unless the client expands the role or scope of the contract with DPC or you choose to apply to another open position through DPC."

107,Digital Prospectors,Transparent Review from a former employee,2019-09-09,5.0,Technical Recruiter,"I worked at Digital Prospectors for roughly 18 months and my tenure ended last March.  Literally, the best company I've ever worked for! I have no incentive behind posting this review, I just believe it's the right thing to do. From the Owners to the C-Level Executives to the Team Leads to the Account Executives and Recruiters.......It's a well oiled machine and they put you in the best position possible to succeed. The culture and atmosphere is by far the best I've ever been a part of and they treat every employee with equal respect and they encourage everyone to voice their opinions and to bring new ideas and insight to the table! 

Regarding my tenure with Digital Prospectors, I enjoyed each and every day there and it's the first company I've ever worked for where walking through the door on day 365 was just as exciting if not more than day 1. 

I was going through some personal hardships on my end and DPC was not only there for me and stuck by me, but they went above and beyond to do everything in their power to be there for me.

Don Catino (Owner/Managing Partner) literally sent me text messages of encouragement, expressing his best wishes and continued support. How many companies do you know where the Owner takes the time to reach out to entry level employees, and not just canned/scripted emails, but heartfelt detailed messages of encouragement? I'm guessing the answer is not many if any at all!

This is a company that individuals who are seeking employment should gravitate towards and should feel grateful and fortunate to be a part of! 

A shout out and thanks to:

Don- Words can't explain my gratitude
Jess and Chris- Thank you for everything!
Kevin and Jen - Best Supervisor and Team Lead I've ever worked under!
Chris H- Thank you! Any new or potential employees reading this, you're in good hands with Chris leading the recruiting team!
Abby- Thank you for all the hard work you put in from your extensive and insightful training to your daily supervising of the sourcing team!
Janet- You're a rockstar! Thank you for all your support!
Steve, Pete and the rest of the recruiting team, it was a pleasure working with all of you!","Chris, Pete and Steve are too good at Foosball! Kidding! Literally, no cons about DPC!"

This is not true only in music but every field of work. We all meet and work with amazing people, a team of people and or organization. I have been lucky to experience such feeling so many times in life. Working with Chip Clarke at Digital Prospectors is one of the unforgettable experience in my recent life. They way Mr. Clarke persuaded my application, spent hours in convincing, negotiating, and making possible so many things that I had never considered important in a job interview or on negotiating table. 
Working with Digital Prospectors in general and Chip Clarke, in particular, was an amazing learning experience that ended up at the best deal I could think of during my career. He is an honest, clear-minded, knowledgeable, up-to-date and respectable person who knows professional demands and desires of clients on both sides of the table.

Training is thorough, and you get to provide your own ideas/feedback.  I feel appreciated working here.  Recruiting is hard, but being around awesome people make it worth it.  I can't think of a better working environment.","Like any other agency, it's not a 9 to 5 job.  You'll have long days, but it's worth it.  You are held accountable to metrics, which makes sense."
113,Digital Prospectors,Subcontractor - software engineer,2018-02-13,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"DPC recently helped me land a software job with a large FFRDC.

I've worked with DPC a number of times in the past to find the kind of software role I now have.  I've interacted with everyone from senior leadership on down, and have worked with several recruiters, and everyone has always been extremely pleasant to interact with.

DPC's recruiters are extremely knowledgeable and persistent.  They know their business and are good at finding the kind of roles that match a candidate's particular skill set.

Also, after receiving and accepting an offer, I had the pleasure of working with DPC's HR team during the on-boarding process.  You could not find a friendlier group of people! On-boarding for this kind of role is very lengthy and there are lots of things that have to get done.  DPC's HR team was extremely friendly, communicative, knowledgeable and patient.  They know how to get the job done.

115,Digital Prospectors,Great company! Great benefits! Rewarding work environment!,2015-08-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been with DPC since March and let me tell you what a company! First of all, upper management is great to work with. They are open to ideas and suggestions, and overall they very supportive. My co-workers are some of the most talented and awesome people I've ever met. Once a month the company celebrates our successes and treats us to lunch. They also throw in little nice things here and there, like an ice cream truck visiting us on a random work day. The work space is open and no one, not even the president has their own office. This open concept environment causes us to work together as a team and see each other as equals; all working toward the same goal. If you're a hard worker and appreciate success, than DPC is the place for you!","Since we're located in a large industrial park, leaving work at night is sometimes a nightmare."

- They really do care about your well being and (if you're a subcontractor) want you to be connected to the best match/opportunity possible for what you're searching for and a position that utilizes and compliments your experience
- Digital Prospectors also cares enough to check in with you to see how your job is going; they want to make sure that you're happy and that you have a healthy work-life balance
- They have rightfully been earning the trust of their clients because of the great job they've been doing, which ultimately enables more opportunities and positions at said clients (for subcontractors)",There have been no cons for my experience with Digital Prospectors
117,Digital Prospectors,Best recruiting experience in my career (accepted position thru agency),2018-07-15,5.0,Senior Security Engineer,"Extremely proactive, professional and engaging recruitment experience. It's clear Digital Prospectors is dedicated to doing tech recruiting the best way possible. I've been doing IT for 20+ years and have dealt with dozens of recruiters, and I can honestly say this agency and tech recruiter Jen Heimberg is the best ive dealt with. From really understanding every detail of the job and why I would be the right fit, to getting all aspects of the interview process lined up, to giving guidance and being on-time with feedback and genuinely helpful follow-ups, Jen handled it all with perfect professionalism every step of the way. It was THE experience you always wish for when working with a recruiting agency.",Literally none. Kudos to Jen Heimberg and Digital Prospectors for making this a flawless experience.
118,Digital Prospectors,Great Place,2016-03-30,4.0,Technical Recruiter,"Have you ever been on a job interview and they walked you around showing off their ping pong table and fancy kitchen, just to find out that everyone at the company is actually miserable and no one really uses all of those cool perks? 

This is NOT that place. 

Digital Prospectors is every bit of what they claim to be. People take advantage of the 1.5 lunch hour to work out, they actually play Foosball together, use their noise-makers to celebrate each other's success, earn absurd amounts of bonuses, get out of work early on Friday, reimburse their gym memberships, utilize their standing desks, play soccer together, eat free snacks.....the list goes on. 

Most people know that companies like this are few and far between, so if you can work here....stay here. Management will do whatever they can to make sure you get the help you need and are successful. But, recruiting is hard. So if you don't like staffing here, it probably just isn't for you.","Change is hard to swallow, especially at a small company. Everyone has an opinion, and when new ideas/teams/people/protocols are implemented, they aren't always well received."

121,Digital Prospectors,Fun place to work,2016-03-30,4.0,Technical Recruiter,"- Digital prospectors is a fun place to work. The benefits and perks are outstanding. For example, Digital Prospectors pays for my gym membership, even has an onsite gym, a ton of food in the office, flex time, company soccer team, etc. 

- There is a 3 month grace period. I didn't have any recruiting experience, so it was nice to not have the pressure of making a deal right out of the gate. Therefore I could really dig into my training. 

- We have ongoing training as well. For example, we have a weekly training session. (This is optional) 

- The bonuses for hitting monthly or annual goal are great. $$","While Digital Prospectors  is a fun place to work and the perks are great, recruiting is really hard. Just like anything else, there are high's and low's. The only difference is in recruiting, the low's are really, really, really low. You may want to bang your head off of a wall at times (at least once a week) but if you can get past that and accept that like most recruiters do, then this is the place to be."

Good opportunity to gain some contacts in the business to use when you move on.  Good entry level position for about 6 months.,"Management counts your phone calls, emails, submittals and every hour that you work.  Long work days.  The real boss / owner runs the show while his manager enforces his rules.  You're only as good as your last months performance.

(Great base + bonus and solid commission structure). Good benefits, company outings, community service.","Metrics:
Most of the metrics that are in place should be used for more inexperienced recruiters to keep them on track and to help them gain valuable experience. Metrics should be used less for senior recruiters that have a track record of being successful and know what it takes."
