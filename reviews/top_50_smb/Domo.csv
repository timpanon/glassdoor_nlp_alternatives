104,Domo,A mixed bag,2015-08-31,3.0,,"The people here are truly great. I loved who I worked with. They are smart, kind, and motivated.","Company structure is a bit disorganized, and it can't be explained away by ""Oh, it's a startup."" People are hired for roles with extremely little training or resources. I've even been in interviews where WE – the interviewers! – were unsure of what the role entailed. 

This disorganization often makes it difficult for simple projects to get done, and people can be reluctant to relinquish control – even when it would make processes more efficient. 

Lack of formalized business processes. They pride themselves on the startup mentality of ""If you have and idea or can make something better, do it!"" but there is no clear way to go about actually doing that (and there are so many layers of management that those ideas are often get muddied or lost anyway).

The path to advancement is not clear. Most of the promotions or salary bumps I saw happen came by way of employees leveraging other offers – not management rewarding performance.

Homogenous and insular. A lot of white ex-Omniture guys from BYU or the University of Utah. Almost no women in middle management. 

Finally, I disapprove of Josh James as CEO. He does not seem to trust people to do their jobs, and instead prefers to micromanage everyone and everything. Inside Domo, he has built a cult of personality where sycophants worship him. Outside of Domo, people seem to view him as a petulant child who desperately wants to play with the tech kingpins of Silicon Valley."
105,Domo,Great Benefits! Excellent Work Environment!,2019-07-10,5.0,CSM,"-Catered lunch every day
-Great, knowledgable co-workers
-Amazing benefits

106,Domo,Odd Company Culture,2015-02-06,2.0,UI Development,"Most things the HR department does are great - the benefits (great PTO, insurance, gym membership, etc.), the perks (every meal is provided, snacks, drinks, frequent parties for families) and more.

It's a casual dress environment.","Sales department is coddled (definition of coddled - to treat in an indulgent or overprotective way). They are praised for any little thing they do and they in turn walk around the office acting like they own it.

Everyone treats the CEO, Josh James, like he is a god (yes, he is smart and he is successful, but have some self respect people). They suck up to him a lot. The CEO also acts like he is still in college, but if you're successful, I guess you can act however you want.

They do not promote from within. They consistently hire outside talent while passing over longtime employees. (Look at other reviews to validate this point.)

Many of the staff and executive team worked together at Omniture. If you did not work at Omniture, you are not part of the ""it crowd.""  Former Omniture employees stick together promoting each other and ignoring those who did not work there. They are continually snatching former Omniture employees from Adobe (Adobe bought Omniture) and promoting them.

Multiple employees are at Domo simply because they are related to the CEO or are family friends. There are more qualified individuals who could outperform these employees, but family and friends get preferential treatment (and get promotions and bonuses)."
107,Domo,Great Company,2019-07-11,5.0,Account Development Manager,Domo has amazing benefits and an awesome culture. The leadership in the company is second to none.,You might get sick if you drink too many of the free RedBulls.

- excellent benefits
- exciting technology space",I can't think of any cons.  It was an exciting run!
110,Domo,Super rad!,2015-05-19,5.0,Technical Consultant,"Domo is fast growing and has a lot of promise. It's great being at a place with such a strong vision and that is pioneering into an  original field. 
I work with a lot of people who came from very large companies to be here. There's a lot of talent to work with an learn from. It's an exciting place and the people are passionate about it.
The benefits are the best around.
Yes, there is breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.
I've read other reviews that comment negatively on the work-life balance at Domo. I have found it very similar to other places that I've worked. The managers I've dealt with have been real people and have understood my needs. I'm sure it varies slightly all around the company though.
Since the business is growing so rapidly, it is also changing rapidly. Processes and structure are constantly changing. I can say that changes are generally for the best, and that management is down in the trenches listening. 
There's room for near unlimited innovation. You can really make a difference and change the way things are done.","Yes, space is limited. They are creative with the workspace, but it's not ridiculous. I've never felt cramped. 
Much of the company is on Macs. That may or may not pose a learning curve. 
It's a young, fast-paced company. A lot is changing. While things have been implemented really well, processes are still not mature."

114,Domo,Appstore Solutions Strategist,2018-12-07,5.0,Appstore Solutions Strategist,"- Culture of innovation, friendliness, open mindedness
- Competitive pay & excellent benefits
- Driven and transparent leadership. Josh would frequently email the company as a whole, open up Q&A at every company meeting, hold special events like a food truck rally or the tailgate party, etc. I never spoke with him directly, but I felt that I knew him pretty well. Goes a long way for employees I think.
- Communicative culture; easy to find and chat with the right person once you know who's who.

In addition to the above info, I personally felt a strong connection with my team, forming friendships and not just work acquaintances. Loved working here, just left because I was moving to live closer to family.","Sometimes leadership can be overly ambitious in time frames. We'd often have to rush to get something done by a specific date, then go back and fix the inevitable errors that came from cutting corners to get the project done in time."

116,Domo,"A super fast paced,fun, growing company that really knows how to take care of you.",2014-09-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I'll start with the perks.
- you get catered food everyday for lunch and dinner.  
- They pay for your Tablet.
- Great health benefits.
- Paid well for just coming out of college.
- A lot of holidays off.  

Now about the business itself
- The company actually matters. The product is super cool and growing.
- You have a lot of room to grow and learn form the best in their fields.
- It's hard and blindingly fast paced but you learn a lot about the SaaS world no matter what position you are in.
- Everyone works their butts off and you get a chill but hardworking atmosphere.","- This space is fairly nuanced and if you aren't used to being required to do a lot and own up to your responsibilities then this isn't the place for you.  People and the pace will test your patience but in the end it's worth it.   So not so much a con as advice.  
- Though it is growing like crazy and already is fairly big it is a start up and works like a start up.  It's only a con if you don't go in with that expectation."
117,Domo,Amazing product and people - coming to Domo was a great decision!,2015-12-19,5.0,Sales/Marketing Manager,"Beyond the long list of work perks (all meals catered, fun employee celebrations, and more), exciting product, and innovative culture, my favorite thing about working at Domo is the quality of the people. The teams at Domo are extremely smart, hard-working, and truly engaged in building Domo to be the leader in business management. Clients absolutely love the product, which makes it very exciting and rewarding to be in Sales. HR is definitely on the cutting edge more than any company I have ever been at, rolling out benefits like a maternity clothing benefit, awesome paternity leave, and newborn bucks that have  received national attention. With opportunities to rub shoulders with the executive leadership team through programs like Women at Domo, and formal mentoring programs, I know Domo wants me to personally succeed. Leaders make sure employees have the tools they need to do their jobs, and recognize when employees do great work. Domo has been amazing place to work so far, and I can't wait to see what the future has in store!",None. We keep expanding and office space is getting better and better.
118,Domo,Not for the good of the company,2018-04-16,1.0,Senior Manager,"Incredible product, smart, dedicated workforce, free meals, massive potential","I recently left Domo after 3.5 years.  It was a difficult decision as I loved the product and the people that I worked with.  What’s holding Domo back was my primary reason for leaving and that is the toxic executive culture which has created a scorched environment for employees.  My experience was specifically in Marketing where they have gone through 4 CMOs in 4 years with the most recent creating a very divisive, contentious, and unproductive atmosphere.  Very talented employees in the Utah office are considered second class and dismissed for out of state leaders who work 2 days a week and are just not present.  The CMO interacts and communicates very little with his teams instead focusing time on an expensive remodel of his executive office while his employees are working on lunch tables and rundown cubicles.  HR is very aware of the issues which have been highlighted in employee surveys and even been discussed at length during many employee exit interviews.  Sadly it seems that HR is handcuffed or covering for executive mistakes.  It’s truly sad to see this happening to what has been and could be an incredible company to work for."
