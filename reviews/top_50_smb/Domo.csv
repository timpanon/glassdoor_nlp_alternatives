105,Domo,A mixed bag,2015-08-31,3.0,,"The people here are truly great. I loved who I worked with. They are smart, kind, and motivated.","Company structure is a bit disorganized, and it can't be explained away by ""Oh, it's a startup."" People are hired for roles with extremely little training or resources. I've even been in interviews where WE – the interviewers! – were unsure of what the role entailed. 

This disorganization often makes it difficult for simple projects to get done, and people can be reluctant to relinquish control – even when it would make processes more efficient. 

Lack of formalized business processes. They pride themselves on the startup mentality of ""If you have and idea or can make something better, do it!"" but there is no clear way to go about actually doing that (and there are so many layers of management that those ideas are often get muddied or lost anyway).

The path to advancement is not clear. Most of the promotions or salary bumps I saw happen came by way of employees leveraging other offers – not management rewarding performance.

Homogenous and insular. A lot of white ex-Omniture guys from BYU or the University of Utah. Almost no women in middle management. 

Finally, I disapprove of Josh James as CEO. He does not seem to trust people to do their jobs, and instead prefers to micromanage everyone and everything. Inside Domo, he has built a cult of personality where sycophants worship him. Outside of Domo, people seem to view him as a petulant child who desperately wants to play with the tech kingpins of Silicon Valley."

It's a casual dress environment.","Sales department is coddled (definition of coddled - to treat in an indulgent or overprotective way). They are praised for any little thing they do and they in turn walk around the office acting like they own it.

Everyone treats the CEO, Josh James, like he is a god (yes, he is smart and he is successful, but have some self respect people). They suck up to him a lot. The CEO also acts like he is still in college, but if you're successful, I guess you can act however you want.

They do not promote from within. They consistently hire outside talent while passing over longtime employees. (Look at other reviews to validate this point.)

Many of the staff and executive team worked together at Omniture. If you did not work at Omniture, you are not part of the ""it crowd.""  Former Omniture employees stick together promoting each other and ignoring those who did not work there. They are continually snatching former Omniture employees from Adobe (Adobe bought Omniture) and promoting them.

Multiple employees are at Domo simply because they are related to the CEO or are family friends. There are more qualified individuals who could outperform these employees, but family and friends get preferential treatment (and get promotions and bonuses)."

The benefits are the best around.
Yes, there is breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.
I've read other reviews that comment negatively on the work-life balance at Domo. I have found it very similar to other places that I've worked. The managers I've dealt with have been real people and have understood my needs. I'm sure it varies slightly all around the company though.
Since the business is growing so rapidly, it is also changing rapidly. Processes and structure are constantly changing. I can say that changes are generally for the best, and that management is down in the trenches listening. 
There's room for near unlimited innovation. You can really make a difference and change the way things are done.","Yes, space is limited. They are creative with the workspace, but it's not ridiculous. I've never felt cramped.

It was a difficult decision as I loved the product and the people that I worked with.  What’s holding Domo back was my primary reason for leaving and that is the toxic executive culture which has created a scorched environment for employees.  My experience was specifically in Marketing where they have gone through 4 CMOs in 4 years with the most recent creating a very divisive, contentious, and unproductive atmosphere.  Very talented employees in the Utah office are considered second class and dismissed for out of state leaders who work 2 days a week and are just not present.  The CMO interacts and communicates very little with his teams instead focusing time on an expensive remodel of his executive office while his employees are working on lunch tables and rundown cubicles.  HR is very aware of the issues which have been highlighted in employee surveys and even been discussed at length during many employee exit interviews.  Sadly it seems that HR is handcuffed or covering for executive mistakes.  It’s truly sad to see this happening to what has been and could be an incredible company to work for."

From an outside perspective, who wouldn't want to work at Domo? The salary and fringe benefits seem to blow everything else out of the water in Utah Valley. They're really the only big ""pro"" to working at Domo.

-  High starting salaries (see con section)
-  $500  to buy an iPad or tablet of choice upon hire.
- Gym membership to Vasa for free or $30 a month for gym membership of choice
- Stock options (see con section)
- Couple health plan options (I did high deductible and company contributed $125 per month to HSA)
- Good Dental
- 401k with 4% match
- 4 weeks vacation to start with, add a day for every year employed up to 5 weeks total (see con section)
- Baby benefit of around $3,000 for having a child
- Maternity and paternity leave
- Cold breakfast food (muffins, cereal, donuts, bagels) and catered lunch and dinner every day, breakroom stocked with all kinds of snacks, drinks, frozen microwaveables. Full time staff on hand to keep kitchen full of stuff.  (See con section)
- Tailgate party every year with food trucks, Christmas formal party, May the 4th party. Domo likes to party. 

Aside from fringe benefits: 

- Teammates. Hands down the best coworkers I've ever had anywhere. 

- The work. Considering nothing else, I loved the Domo platform and the challenges that working inside it brought each day. The variety of customers was incredible and awesome, and I have some huge names under my belt because of the company. The experience was incredibly valuable.

- The product. It's a simple and relatively intuitive product, the time to value for any business user will be less than other platforms (Tableau, Power BI, Microstrat). It's fun to use, honestly. A good analyst can spend hours just playing around with data and viz and it's really engaging. A fun time.","So you may be asking yourself, the above sounds great, so why only two stars? I'm going to address this from my experience working inside client services consulting perspective. 

- Management: First time managers galore. Most of them hadn't managed technical employees, that combined with little to no software/data experience led to a ton of unmet expectations due to management not understanding limitations of the product and limitations of project timeline. This led to more unhappy customers than I can count. For a time the turnover for customers was 70+ percent. 

Most managers are in it for their own careers. They will stomp all over anyone and everyone to get ahead. They will use their teams for their own gain. I rarely saw real ""lead from the front"" mentality. It was seemingly constant setting of unrealistic expectations, no real involvement in projects, and finger pointing back at subordinates when things went badly.  Taking credit for reports hard work without any real contribution was rampant. 

Consulting management had the mentality of ""utilization is everything"" so not only were billable hours tracked, but each hour of the day also had to be entered meticulously, because management thought they could glean useful insights into what was being worked on. Picture $100k+ salaried employees entering time into a timecard every day. Resentment festered, hours were constantly sandbagged by everyone to meet ""utilization"" requirements (for bonuses), which means customers were overbilled constantly. 

Turnover was pretty insane in consulting for the type of job and pay. Nobody in management would admit anything was wrong.

- Salaries: You start out relatively high and you don't get raises, unless you're constantly shouting your name and bowing down and yes sir-ing and no sir-ing your way to management/promotions. 

- Stock options: Minimal stock amount at varying strike prices. So much funding taken that stock is devalued so much you'll probably never see a return. Not a selling point.

- Lots of vacation time, guilt for using it: When you max out your vacation time you stop accruing it, and most on my time rarely used vacation due to overwork and the feeling of guilt when you try to enjoy a day off, perpetuated by management.

- Work-life balance: They feed you meals to keep you in your chair. They want to overwork you. You will be expected to work 60+ hour weeks and get no comp days or even gratitude. You can't work from home really (guilt) and if you leave early management is always watching (guilt) and will even talk to you if they feel you're leaving too close to 5pm. (more guilt)

- Won't listen to employee feedback: any suggestions are taken as ""fighting"" against the system, and constantly being told that Domo is a ""startup"" and things will get worked out eventually gets old after 5+ years. Basically a ""be grateful you work here"" mentality and to keep your mouth shut. 

- Hype, hype and more hype. Josh James is a salesman at his very core. No matter how dry the sales pipeline or any other problem, management talks about the company like its going to rule the BI space and every other platform will bow down to it. Just Ignore the problems with the product and the company completely.

- Fiscally irresponsible: Domo blows a ton of money on parties, events, A and B list entertainment and other frivolous things. It's hard to be at a company that you know isn't profitable, yet is spending hundreds of millions a year. 

- Employee awards: Each quarter/year Domo recognizes a select few ""top performers"" and bestows upon them a big bonus and stock options. The rest of the employees get a small gift. The ""Domosapien"" of the year award ($25k) the years I was there always went to a VP or higher. Someone who was probably already sitting on tens of thousands of stock options and a high six figure salary. Maybe throw everyone a smaller bone instead of lining the pockets of the top company bigwigs? More a personal gripe than anything else, i'll admit. 

TL/DR: Micromanagement, awful politics, guilt."

They let go great managers who produced great results while taking care of their teams, changed compensation so that not one employee can actually see any path to making income and it is in constant change. Currently management leads by fear and the promise of making it big when they go public. They are losing 2 to 3 employees a week currently with most of the sales staff looking for new jobs."
141,Domo,"Fast paced, learning culture",2014-04-07,5.0,Consultant,"Free food, love it. Incredibly smart people to bounce ideas with. Everyone is very nice. Ability to collaborate with other departments. Influential customers. Fast paced. A lot of decisions are left to you to make to get your work done. If you have an idea, the management is willing to hear you out on it. Starting with 20 days of vacation.","Space is hard to come-by. There is a sense of your problems are your own. It takes a lot of ""screaming"" to get your voice heard, there are a lot of requests by all departments to make their jobs for efficient."

The compensation is fair. Having breakfast available, a hot fresh lunch every day, and dinner Monday through Thursday is amazing (most people wouldn't be at work for dinner). Engineers get a MacBook Pro with dual 27-inch monitors. Domo is located right by the freeway. They have a Health Savings Account (HSA) option for insurance and give amazing contributions to it.","Hard to think of any. 

The company is young and the code base is growing/changing rapidly (could be a pro)."
143,Domo,"Domo is the best place to work in Utah, hands down!",2013-10-23,5.0,Account Executive,"Domo is a progressive company, providing the absolute best tools to enable us to excel in our respective job functions.  I am a career salesperson and the resources available to us are the envy of all of my former colleagues.  We work in a ""pro-sales"" culture, meaning our income earning potential is not only untapped, but realized by our results.  Our environment is not the ""micro-management"" culture, but one of celebration of individual and collective successes and celebrated wins across the organization are the norm here.  Think DiscoBalls and Music at a volume of 12 and you will get the idea!","My only wish is an office in SLC, a bit closer to home.  A wish that will soon be realized!"
144,Domo,Strategic Success Manager,2016-02-29,5.0,Strategic Success Manager,It feels like an exciting time to be working at Domo. The product can reach and impact virtually any aspect of a business. Domo is laser focussed on customer support and success post-sales which is great for my role. There is adequate technical cover to clients that frees up my conversations to be around driving business value.,"This is still a growing enterprise software company that is trying to scale all aspects and offerings. With that comes growing pains that can be reactive at times. To truly be an approved enterprise solution in the market will take time and consistency. Domo is relatively new to the space while trying to redefine it. Credibility and trust will be critical, and we aren't there yet."
145,Domo,"Great vision, strange culture",2014-03-08,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The product vision is awesome. I completely believe in it and wish I could have the product at my current job.

I truly enjoyed working with and have deep respect for many of the other people in the trenches with whom I worked.

There is also tons of free food. I lost some weight after I left.","It's the strangest culture I've ever seen. It starts with lots of hero worship and ends with lots of sycophants. It's style over substance. Tweeting gushing affection for the company and execs is what gets recognized.

There are lots of chiefs.

There is high turnover, especially among engineers.

It's not my style, so I moved on and am really happy now with another opportunity."
146,Domo,Best career move I've made,2013-10-14,5.0,Marketing,"I've worked for some really cool enterprise tech companies, but Domo tops them all. They hire really smart, driven people, pay them well, and expect a lot out of them. The energy here is pretty awesome, and the company culture is something only Josh James could concoct. My boss has led massive teams at SAP and Oracle, but somehow remains really grounded and approachable (in addition to being wicked smart).","Like all companies, it experiences growing pains. When you're trying to go this big, this fast, mistakes will get made and toes will get stepped on. Does that ruffle feathers sometimes? Sure. But if you're good enough, and thick skinned enough, you'll thrive."
147,Domo,Ain't no mountain high enough!,2015-06-17,5.0,Technical Account Manager,"This is a very fast-paced, forward-leaning, innovation-heavy environment. The benefit are very competitive for the industry and incredibly generous for Utah.","We are still a start-up. If you want a glass-walled office with a panoramic skyline view, you won't get it here. We work in a snug environment and we love it. Additionally, if you want to loose weight, don't accept the offer, they cater breakfast lunch, and dinner (at no cost to you)..."
148,Domo,Do your research before joining.,2018-07-27,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company benefits are amazing. Not only are the insurance and 401K very good, but they also provide a lot of benefits like free lunches and dinners and completely stocked kitchens. To round out the benefits packages are things like free a free tablet and maternity clothing allowance.
 
They throw the best parties ever. From tailgate parties to offsite meetings to the annual company holiday party, all are the best. Everything Domo does is first-rate. Their annual user conference, Domopalooza, is the best technology conference I have been to, and I’ve been to a lot. Domo puts a lot of time, effort and money into their image and it shows.

Finally, the product is beautiful and really valuable if you use it right. Like most products, people never utilize things to their full benefit, but it can be amazing for those who do.","The amazing benefits are ultimately overshadowed by the things that are not right with the company. While Domo has raised insane amounts of private equity (and now money from an IPO) they are still in a critical financial state due to big issues in the company. 

They have burned through cash so quickly that it’s bound to have an impact on their future growth. Their target customers at Fortune 500 companies will shy away from making huge investments in a company that is in such a precarious financial situation. Their burn rate needs to be seriously addressed as they are finding money harder to come by and revenues are not growing nearly as quickly as they need.

Turnover at key leadership positions seems to be an issue. The sales and marketing teams, in particular, are in a constant state of turnover as the company seeks to get the ‘right mix’ in order to meet very aggressive growth goals. Turnover is impacting their ability to become efficient and develop a refined sales/marketing engine.

There is a big ‘Inner-circle culture’ at Domo, almost like a fraternity/sorority mindset in college. If you are in the inner-circle things are great, but for those on the outside, it’s a struggle. Insiders get benefits that others don’t including promotions and invitations to exclusive parties thrown at the CEO’s home.

Finally, the CEO is very involved in every aspect of the business. His involvement often puts a lid on creativity within the company. People are hired to bring in their expertise but are limited in their ability to do their job because of this control."
149,Domo,"The best place I have ever worked at, bar none.",2015-04-24,5.0,Marketing Automation,"Excellent leadership at the top. The work hard play hard culture is awesome if you're a self-starter and self-motivated. It's the best work environment and company I've had the opportunity to be at, ever.",Start-up growing pains but nothing that that makes me want to look elsewhere. I guess if you like to be told exactly how to do your job and be in a very strict work environment then Domo probably isn't for you.
150,Domo,A Positive Environment that Breads Success,2013-10-15,5.0,Senior Product Analyst,"Domo is one of the few companies that executes an amazing culture where hard work is well rewarded, and every employee is given an opportunity to have a significant impact on the product. Holidays, events and personal successes are all celebrated at Domo (i.e. Christmas, Halloween, May the 4th be With You, Tailgates, Sales, etc.). Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner are all provided at work, all I have to do is show up and concentrate on work.",Because Domo's a startup sometimes the work/life balance can become lopsided. I hope this changes in the future as we become more established and reach our company goals.
151,Domo,"Great people, great culture, long hours",2015-08-25,3.0,Software Engineer,"Domo has some of the smartest people I have ever met working for them. I love going to work each day and I like just about every person I work closely with. It is a very competitive environment with the ""bleeding edge"" consistently hemorrhaging. You never go hungry or thirsty while working.","Long hours to intersect with the ""bleeding edge"". The long hours also do not get any sort of reward either. There is no official compensation review in place yet so getting any sort of change in compensation is nearly impossible. It's the best place I have ever worked but when you have a family, work long hours, and do not get any sort of incentive for doing so, then it's selfish to not look for another place to work."
152,Domo,Thank goodness the product is amazing!,2018-05-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The product is beyond the best in the world! Domo seriously helps every department to be empowered . With the power of Domo, every person at every level can make Smart Decisions for their business.","The new CMO . From his arrival, he dismissed any value from the marketing department. Then, he brought in his previous employees and consultants. Anyone who was at Domo prior to him joining AND didn't LOVE his book, were not only invisible but disrespected by him and his new team.

Upper management is very knowledgeable and experienced - lots to learn from them","Not a lot of upward mobility - The executive team comes from very large companies, and they find whomever they want and pay whatever it takes to bring them in. Employees simply don't move up; they get hired over."
154,Domo,Awesome Company,2016-06-16,5.0,Software Engineer,"Domo is a cool company. They have all the cool perks: free food, great pay, awesome equipment, parties, etc. On top of that, you work with some of the brightest minds in Utah, so you learn a ton every day no matter how long you've worked here.","There is definitely company politics you have to deal with, same as any company. Also, on a lighter note, one con is the weight gain working here. They have #Domo15. (AKA: 15 pounds gained from eating all their free food)"
155,Domo,Going places!,2017-02-09,5.0,Sales,"I've been here for about 4 months now and I have to say, it was the best move I've made career wise AND personally in years.  We'll get to the cons... but the Pros?
-100% can-do attitude and effort from the supporting cast.  If you need help, you may not know where to go right away, but you'll get assistance along the way, and when you arrive at the right person, more often than not they'll drop what they're doing to help.
-Terrific executive team.  ""Traditional"" founders who are smart enough to know their limitations (most of the time), and seek out the Sr. Staff they need to augment.
-Sales driven culture (this may appear in the cons).  I'm in Sales and as I said above, we need a lot of help to get our job done.  Everybody in the company knows that sales is a: a total pain in the neck, and b: without our success, we all go home.
-Not afraid to have fun.  This can be a silly place.  I'm pretty silly myself and find that I need to step up my game.  But fun matters.  I work remotely and LOVE going to HQ at least once every few weeks.  It energizes me and exposes me to all those helpful and fun people!
-The pay is solid.  Above industry in many cases.  Pre-IPO options are fairly standard, but the trajectory here is such that I, at least, feel that the future is going to be even more exciting than the now.
-Benefits are also solid.  Very ""silicon valley"" in a good way.  Thought about expecting mothers are a bit outside the norm... go shopping for maternity closes on us!  PTO is very generous and everybody is encouraged to the time they give to recharge.
-Opportunity - we're in a very crowded space and that's GOOD.  There is a fantastic opportunity to be part of a team that is redefining analytics as a tool for everybody, not just IT, senior execs, or some wicked sharp analyst.","-The pace can be maddening.  I'll argue this is good in general, but you'd better put on your big boy/big girl pants if you come to work at Domo.  
-Our use of Domo is extensive and at every level.  Cool, yes.  But this also means a high degree of exposure to your business, KPIs and SLAs.  There is no hiding at Domo.
-Location.  Salt Lake City is a terrific place, and beautiful.  And the people are incredibly nice.  But its a bit of an island when it comes to the overall high tech ecosystem.
-There's a LARGE group of people who followed our founder(s) from Omniture, their previous, and highly successful, venture.  I get that and would probably do the same thing.  Who doesn't want to hit another homerun and I'd be on Josh too.  But there's a lot of name dropping about ""when I was part of Omniture"", or ""Josh used to tell me..."".  Not that big a deal, but since I'm on the outside of that, you know.
-Sales strategy - Right now we seem to be attacking the market in a bit of a disjointed way.  We are in a transition from mostly inside sales to what will, I believe, be a company who sells larger enterprise deals to larger companies.  There's some animosity between the two right now and the rules of engagement have moved a few times, causing confusion and in some cases, resentment."

Knowing nothing about Domo products coming into the interviews, I left wanting to not only be a customer, but be a part of something this amazing.","The workspaces are tight, but this is to be expected of a fast growing company. They've given me all the necessary equipment (multiple monitors, etc) to get my job done and I suspect (purely speculation) that Domo will eventually expand it's real estate footprint."

Good benefits and a wide assortment of perks including gym/fitness reimbursement, tablet reimbursement, and an insane amount of free food.","The culture is fun and fast paced, but can also feel somewhat insular at times. I'm sure this varies between groups and locations."
171,Domo,"Good people, good benefits and good work life balance",2015-09-20,5.0,Corporate Account Executive,"I absolutely love it here. In my opinion, the company is extremely generous in just about every way. They give you the best of the best in regards to the tools required to perform your job function. I don't feel as if there is really any compromise there. They are extremely generous on comp plans. They have amazing beneftis (health/medical/dental) available to the employee at next to nothing. Aggressive 401k match with full vesting on day one. Tons of PTO time and aggressive observation of holidays. Great training and very supportive management who empowers you to do your job the way you best see fit, and WHEN you see fit. The ability to work remote when needed

Tons of food around here....if you come on board be prepared to gain some weight. Fully stocked break rooms with everything you can imagine. If you can buy it at Costco, it's probably in the break room. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are provided every day as well.

Bottom line, is that we're a sales culture and they take great care of their sales people. Everyone seems happy so I am sure that translates across to all departments, but sales people are well taken care of. You control your travel, but the travel is minimal and always includes plenty of opportunity to have fun on the company dime (take clients to sporting events, etc...).","Honestly, I really don't see any. If I were going to list some, they would be extremely nitpicky things like ""a weekly meeting that starts at 8:00AM"". Petty things like that which aren't even worth mentioning.

One thing worth noting is that we've grown so fast, we're a little scattered. At the Utah office, operations are spread across 3 different buildings. People are grouped together in sensible ways so there's not too much running from one building to another (I actually can't remember the last time I needed to go to a different building) but depending on your job function that may be annoying.

I have this slight fear that as the company grows, and if there is ever an IPO (I have no knowledge that there will be) that we may lose some of the extremely generous employee benefits that are without a doubt extremely costly to the company."

182,Domo,"Amazing product, troubling leadership",2019-05-28,4.0,Software Engineer,"The product is seriously incredible. They dogfood their product with their own company data, so they're constantly working on valuable features that have real applications. Also some of the smartest people I've ever met work there, and they contribute amazing things to the world of software. In terms of the business, Domo is definitely going to be a force to be reckoned with in the BI space.","My main beef has to do with upper management and primarily Josh James. While he's definitely led the business to great success, Josh has also derailed the company many times in many aspects. He runs the company like he's ADHD. He gets an idea in his head and forces his project upon the company whether or not it's a good idea. Halfway through finishing, however, he gets bored and starts chasing another idea. An example of this was Domo's ""Buzz"" chat feature. He wanted to compete with Slack despite the fact that Slack is a totally different industry and not remotely competing with Domo. So the company spent years and who knows how much money pushing Buzz, only to have many customers specifically request to disable the feature. I believe all of this is getting better now that the company has gone public and has to account to their shareholders every quarter. Most projects are going through the proper channels rather than mandated by Josh.

In terms of upper management, some are great, but most play the political game non-stop to get ahead. Josh tends to encourage this behavior or is completely oblivious to it, but considering how obvious it is to the entire company, I highly doubt he is oblivious. There are several in upper management who are not remotely qualified for the position, but got it by playing at politics. They then coast by relying on the work of others which they then get credit for."
183,Domo,Politics and Stock Options,2017-06-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"When I was at Domo they had good  benefits. Domo also had a lot of good random perks. They had a May 4th party for families (which I they had done away with by the time I left) and team building activities (they have also done away with those as well).
There are some great people that make working at Domo not so bad.","Staying at the company for stock options or even accepting a lower salary with the promise of stock option returns is a bad idea, especially at Domo.

The company feels like the business version of Survivor. Most management and senior management are looking out for only their self interests and have no interest in actual leadership. This has resulted in a very toxic culture.

Work-life balance is almost non-existent. You can count on working longer hours for the same pay you'd get elsewhere.

Domo definitely does not have a promote from within mentality."
184,Domo,Great Culture - Innovation Focused,2016-08-01,5.0,Consultant,"-Each employee is encouraged to shape Domo by being innovative.
-Domo is invested in my future by providing access to many educational materials, such as Lynda.com
-We use the product daily to track our own performance
-Great benefits and good work-life balance","On par with being a young company, sometimes things being figured out as we go can create delays, specifically with career pathing. Since I joined a year and a half ago though, things have become much more defined, so they are heading in the right direction."
185,Domo,The smartest people in the biz,2016-01-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great collaborative environment, with smart people who are willing to work hard. The amount of work that gets done with relatively few resources is amazing. Benefits are awesome too.","Free food! This is a perk to some, but has been detrimental to my waistline haha. Growing faster than our office can accommodate."

Free lunch.","Sometimes have to work overtime for a deadline like a trade show.  Rarely, there will be a critical system issue that everyone needs to stay and work on.  No raises. (Maybe an IPO though one of these days)"
187,Domo,"Best place to work in Utah, by far",2012-10-24,5.0,Manager,"Free lunch and dinner catered daily, stocked kitchen, soda fountains and stocked fridge, 401k with 4% match, free tablet PC, great compensation, etc etc. Management very understanding of need for work/life balance. Management tries to be very transparent, and company parties are definitely fun.","I can't think of many. It's the place to be.

- Great compensation & benefits.
- Memorable and exciting, great parties and events gives you lots to talk to your family and friends about.
- Free lunch, dinner and soda.
- Innovation. A ton of incredible innovation happening here.
- The vision. I am behind the company vision 100%.
- Fun crazy projects to work on.
- The direction. The direction of the company is terrific.","- A culture of self promotion makes it easy for talented & quiet individuals to get overlooked. This is a true shame. This also creates an issue where generally abrasive personalities dominate conversations and product direction at the expense of others. There are a couple of very aggressive personalities that everyone just works around because disagreeing means positioning yourself against all the favoritism, as well as becoming the victim of negative criticism that will likely come as a consequence.
- Not an engineering driven culture. Product Managers are puppets for the CEO. The large majority of the features (and corresponding deadlines for those features) comes directly from upper management. This has resulted in a large amount of technical issues.
- The word ""technical debt"" was banned. Not because it was solved, simply because the CEO didn't want to hear it anymore.
- Megalomania central. More self love from past accomplishments in one building then one can handle.
- Somehow a lot of incompetent people are able to manage upwards visibility despite consistent failures. Executives simply hear certain people are valuable and believe they are responsible for everything. The simple truth is, they are just the most vocal."
189,Domo,Domo is the best thing since sliced bread,2013-11-11,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"My friends are beginning to hate me because I'm always talking about how great Domo is. Here is just a short list of some of my favorite things about Domo:

The company is well-funded to execute on its strategy.","Business Intelligence is an insanely crowded space.  Most vendors just copy leading firm's marketing messaging, which makes it very difficult for buyers to differentiate Domo from the pack pre-sale.  Enterprise buyers have been burned in the past by promises of Self-Service BI, which makes them overly skeptical of Domo.  Domo is also battling legacy investments in antiquated technologies in which Enteprise buyers have too much political and financial capital invested to move away from in the near term."

That opportunity provides incredible learning opportunities.  There's a lot of cool areas Domo could go into.  There are a lot of really cool people.,"When we were younger, it was much more entrepreneurial and results-oriented.  The bureaucracy has grown though and some turf claiming and politics has started to creep in in a sad way with some departments (consulting, product) worse while others are managing to stay pretty clear of those issues."
196,Domo,"Work Hard, Play Hard",2013-11-12,5.0,Account Manager,"The Exec team at Domo knows how valuable hard-working employees are.

If you cannot adopt and adjust to change, this is not the place for you."
201,Domo,Account Development Manager,2015-04-23,2.0,Account Development Manager,"They pay is decent. 40k base. Target comp is another 40k in commissions totaling 80k They have a fully stocked break room. Lunch and dinner provided free of charge every day, free ipad.","Toxic work environment. No training. In sales you get no time off. They will fire you without notice or warning. If you miss quota you can get fired without ever getting a chance to improve. Can't leave the office to eat. They provide you food and you are expected to eat at your desk and keep working. Micro managed throughout the day, everyday. Multiple pointless meetings a day. Worst part of Domo is the inexperienced managers.  They lie in the interview process. I was told i could work from home and if i was hitting quota nobody would bother me. However,  I was never allowed to work from home, I exceeded or met quota every month but always had a manager on back. They are liars and will say whatever they need to in order to get you to join them. In the interview all they do is promote how good they are to work for which is always a bad sign when an interviewer tries to convince you to hire on. Very high turnover (they say there is none). Areas are constantly cut (less prospects to call), quotas are changed, and how you get paid is changed monthly. Like any other sales organization they try to pay less and expect more, but Domo is much extreme in this than any other sales position i have ever seen. I would say get hired on, take the free ipad, negotiate a nonrecoverable draw for a few months and leave. Extreme good ol' boys club. You do not move up unless you fit in and they like you, even if you are the best. they say they promote from within but most higher positions are filled from outside recruits. They will work you to death in the ADM position with the constant promise you are being groomed for advancement but then they always hire outside recruits."

This is not unique to Domo; therefore, I would qualify this statement as more of a challenge with start-ups than with Domo specifically."
208,Domo,"Fun, fast-paced environment",2013-11-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Startup with a ton of potential. Domo has perks of a bigger, established company as far as benefits, funding and executive team, but has a startup feel, culture and pace.

There has been 4 different CMOs over a 2 year span. It is hard shifting so often and hard not having strong direction or mentorship within the company.

Sometimes things can stray away from HR standards in company meetings. On-call work, and the load isn't distributed between team members very well.

There is mutual respect and camaraderie between each employee, regardless of what team you are on.",Not much so far.  Seems like the only thing negative is the constantly growing atmosphere.

-Innovation is front and center, stagnation is not allowed
-Numerous opportunities for skill development and career growth","Not necessarily a Con, but more of a general observation/point: Domo is a very dynamic, fast-paced work environment. It can be harder for some to adapt to this type of setting if unaccustomed and sometimes even harder to try and work with individuals who do not adapt to this change well. Happens in all industries and business, just something to be aware of about this type of work environment."

262,Domo,A wild ride. Worked long hours and made a lot of good friends. Exciting possibilities but still a ways to go.,2014-01-30,3.0,Anonymous Employee,They have assembled a very talented team. Everyone is very engaged and works hard. Plenty of opportunities for skilled workers to succeed.,Poor work/life balance. The culture seems fun at first but can distract from what is most important. Things were moving so fast that there was no time for career development.
263,Domo,"Domo is getting dark unless you are ""In the Club""",2016-02-18,1.0,Sales,The Domo product is getting better and customer retention is improving.  Great lunches and dinners are served daily.  Many of the people at Domo are great to work with and dedicated.  Above average pay for some positions.,"The culture is deteriorating and Domo is becoming a company of have ""in the club"" and have nots ""out of the club.""  To be ""in the club"" you need to be a former BYU football or Basketball player, friend/neighbor/relative of the CEO or President or part of the former team from the Omniture days.  

A few months back, most of the company was shocked when an ""in the club"" leader basically ran Enterprise Sales into the ground and was removed from the role to only get a promotion to another  key role.

Then, a month ago, we watched as two great managers that were fully committed to Domo but not ""In the Club""get the Ax, even though they far exceeded their number, were great leaders, loved by their team members and set the standard for hard work and Domo dedication - first in last out.  Ironic, I never heard either of them bad mouth Domo, the executive team or senior leadership.  We all lost more confidence once a young ""in the club"" manager was then promoted, unbelievable.  We have now had two meeting with senior management and HR to explain this boneheaded move - it still makes no sense.  The morale has become dark.  We all sit and listen as to why this happened but it doesn't add up.    100 of us are still in shock and several of us will be headed out the door.  We don't believe in the Domo vision anymore when they take out those that are making a positive difference and bleeding blue for Domo.  We think it is time to go - or if you are considering Domo, now is not the time to come.  Senior leadership needs to get their act together and right the ship.  The Sales leadership team is either incredibly inept or clueless.  I am sure they will try to give the pitch, once again, ""you can make more money at Domo than anywhere else,"" not true.  However, I will say they pay an above average wage...but not worth it for the added headache of continual fear, ""in the club"" (promotions and lack of accountability for sub standard results) compared to ""out of the club"" dedicated Domosapians getting the Ax.  We all feel any of us could be next.  In fact, we had to listen as our new leader told us ""we are all expendable.""  Most of the Sales Leadership is arrogant, out of touch, and masters of deflection."

Excellent Health Benefits
Exciting Company Parties- Most of them are family friendly","Deteriorating, Mismanaged, Erratic. These are the 3 words that I would use to describe Domo’s Sales and Account Development departments. This place is literally falling apart. There has been HUGE turnover among the employees, the entire tech industry in Utah County and Salt Lake County are aware because of the large influx of resumes that have hit the market. This is only the beginning, 90% (if not higher) of the people in Account Development are currently looking for new jobs. By this time next year, I wouldn’t be surprised if the entire team was new. What does this say about Domo? What does this say about their management team? It is obvious that there are some very serious problems going on, or Domo would have changed something by now. 

For those of you looking for that new tech job that is going to pay you big money because you are an all-star? Go look someplace else. Domo had its good days where the compensation package were better than anything else you would find in UT. Those days are over, you will now make less than what market value is, plus you will be driven into the ground. I have never worked for a company that drives their employees harder. I was totally ok with this mentality because it use to equate to more money in my pocket. Not the case anymore, you will be given less, driven harder, expected to do more for far less money than the trouble is worth. 

The account development department is mismanaged. This new management team, has its own agenda, and is respected by very few. I personally have very little confidence in their ability to make the work place/department better than it is today. I do not want to put the fate of my family and well being in their hands. Below the director level or management, there is only 1 veteran manager who has been in his position for longer than a year. Literally every other manager has either left or was let go. All of these changes in management have been made recently, what does this say about the direction Domo is headed? Again back to my point, I have very little confidence in this organization and the plan that they have put in place to take Domo to the next level. It is not getting the job done now (no one is making any money) and I don’t think that it is going to change in the foreseeable future. 

I use to be a very proud Domosapien. I believed in the company, product, and the direction we were headed. That is not the case anymore, which is unfortunate. I understand that every company has to make changes to get better. The changes Domo is making right now are hurting everyone, including Domo. Most employees in sales have questions that need to be answered. What is the long term strategy for sales? Is Domo running out of money? Is upper management going to close down the account development department? If they aren’t, why aren’t they making changes that will keep their top talent in place? These are a few of the questions that need to be answered. Whenever the C-Suite addresses the company it is always ponies and rainbows, which is not the case. Josh James needs to be real with his employees and tell them what is going on. If he doesn’t, he will continue to lose his best people (there are only a few left).

I would not recommend this job to anyone I know. This job has added a huge amount of stress and sleepless nights to my life. I wouldn’t wish that upon anyone. I hope that Domo makes the needed changes soon, because the product does have the potential to do great things for organizations."

- Customers: The customers we have are enterprise level. Large global names in Europe using Domo for complex and valuable use cases 
- Team: We are going through natural growing pains as we scale and although some reps don't make it (see other reviews ;)) the ones that get the proposition and have a 'Make a market' mindset do really well and are always willing to share and support others 
- Challenge: I've spent a large amount of my career at other SaaS businesses and this doesn't fit the mould of: find the problem > find the customer > sell the solution and repeat. It's really challenging me to become an enterprise rep learning how to position a platform, plan an account and retire quota through multiple engagements","- Clarity on go to market. We've gone through several CMOs in recent years and I think we need to shout about who we are, especially to IT. I think we've done a great job of that locally with our focus on key use cases 
- Tough competition. There are some great competitors out there that challenge us daily. We need to embrace that more and look for ways to partner, like we are doing with Snowflake"

Best perks in the industry which includes food budget each week, private health and dental insurance
Domo could be HUGE in years to come. :-)","GTM strategy has gone through a few iterations in the past few years, and we're still looking for that sweet spot as a company for how we position the platform. But when customers get, they really get it.
It's definitely fast paced, and the EMEA management are (quite rightly) looking for people who are really invested in making the company successful. For certain people, this may not be what they are looking, especially if they've come from a big company."

Like any sales environment there is a certain amount of pressure to achieve numbers- but that's the gig I guess. Management will support you with attending sales calls and presentations and strategy - its not all about ""what's your commit?"" 

Some folks moan about limited opportunity for working from home - personally if I'm not with customers I don't mind being in the office and bouncing ideas off colleagues.

Great benefits, pension, health, dental, lunch allowance - new office is awesome and the people are friendly and want to help out when they can.",Domo is building a brand and this takes time but the tech is actually pretty cool - focus on the tech - not the brand and you'll be fine.

426,Domo,Good tech.  Terrible culture & weak management in the UK,2019-09-27,1.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"- Good technology, despite the messaging / focus being slightly confused
- Smart, capable and intelligent co-workers
- Competitive pay","- Weak, disorganised and ineffective sales management.
- Toxic culture of presenteeism where time at desk is valued above all else including quality or quantity of work
- Lack of strategy.  I saw two fundamental shifts in strategy during my tenure relating to sales efforts in the Enterprise / Mid-Market space.  Sales teams were reorganised during this period with no communication regarding the business goals that this was supporting
- Share price halved during my tenure due to poor sales results and lack of strategic focus
- EMEA office has little autonomy and is at the mercy of changes in direction from head office
- Inaccurately claims to support flexible working in the interview process.  There is no flexible working available
- Complete absence of training or onboarding.  No plan to get new recruits up to speed, no management support or contact, no effort made or expertise in sales management to support new hires.  This is purely laziness or incompetence from managers, who will cite lack of resources.  However, this is not an excuse for not providing basic onboarding or product training
- Due to the above factors, there is a toxic culture within the UK office, with little sales activity and poor morale and performance
- Leaders rely on sales tools to do their managing for them.  These resources are thrown at sales people with no explanation or training and are used as a crutch by weak managers in place of the basics of sales management.  There is no attempt to understand individual motivations, build team morale, explain or build a sustainable sales strategy or provide any practical support.  Sitting behind laptops filling out spreadsheets with meaningless statistics to send to head office is not management"

If he did, he wouldn't allow the amount of culling his Senior Management is making.  Great people are being forced out for no other reason than not kissing up to their managers.  The product is stagnant and irrelevant with competitors gaining stride to overshadow what Domo can do.  This company is obsolete and it would be a huge recommendation to leave before things get worse."
