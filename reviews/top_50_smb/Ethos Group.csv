1,Ethos Group,Productive and Fun work Place,2022-01-18,5.0,Information Technology,I've been able to learn and grow as an employee. I'm able to create relations that will last me a life time as well. The company has grown a lot over the years but has kept its close knit feel.

Helpful and caring Senior management 
Innovative technologies",None for me to be honest
4,Ethos Group,You get what you put in!,2021-10-04,5.0,Finance Manager,"Being in car sales before moving to finance, I have a very good understanding of what the job entails. With that being said, I understand that getting this position right out of college is rare in the industry. Pro’s are Good pay for coming out of college, great sales training you can use in other industries, and helps you handle multiple responsibilities at once.","Depending on dealership, your work/life balance could be good or bad. Beyond that it’s not much to complain about as long as you don’t slack and get lazy. Also, it’s the car industry… no saturdays off and maybe sundays as well."
5,Ethos Group,Fantastic Work Environment,2021-11-15,5.0,Finance Manager,Great company to work for! Interview process was smooth and the Dealership I was placed in is a tremendous family owned dealership.

7,Ethos Group,Credibility!,2021-11-22,5.0,F&I Manager,"Ethos Group is named ethos for a reason. Their credibility, attention to detail, and team/partner centric attitude is everything in an industry that is heavily influenced by word of mouth.",I have nothing bad to say about this company.

Amazing opportunity to grow as an person, with great mentors and leaders around you. If this is something you truly want you will excel and have a skill you can use in any state around the country.",Some kids take the job just to get a paycheck without doing enough research. Obviously in car business you have late nights and work weekends.
11,Ethos Group,Amazing Company!,2021-10-05,5.0,Business Manager,"Great training, excellent mentors, and overall best culture that I have worked in within my 15 years of professional experience. Very accommodating to work/life balance, and always there to assist when needed.","Working within the automotive field working Saturdays is always tough, but for the competitive pay I receive I will gladly work every Saturday possible!"

13,Ethos Group,Great Place To Work,2021-07-27,5.0,Software Engineer,"Everybody you interact with will be incredibly friendly and great to get along with. I can't talk good enough about how great the culture here is from finding anything you have a mutual interest in to large team/department events annually.
Typically very low stress with regular hours, and anytime you need help someone is there and willing to reach out. Additionally education is encouraged through things like Pluralsight and going to conferences. 
Work from home was completely embraced and proven very effective as there are 0 in-office requirements at time of posting.",Flat organization means that path for promotion is ultimately vague and raises beyond the annual (while competitive) are more challenging to come by.
14,Ethos Group,Ethos Group had a great internship program!,2021-09-15,4.0,Software Develeoper,"Last summer, I worked as a software engineering intern. Ethos Group had a great training program that was put together and prepared me well for the job. It was a week of learning and a week of applying what you learned, which was incredibly effective. The company also has really helpful, down-to-Earth people who are always willing to answer your questions. My favorite thing about Ethos Group is the culture.","It may be easy to get a bit overwhelmed with all of the software and how everything connects. It's also a bit difficult if you aren't familiar with the car industry, specifically car deals and how the car dealerships are set up. There were also some days where I encountered problems with running the software or my virtual machine freezing."

They spend a more than adequate amount of time assessing your personal and professional characteristics and what you want out of your career before placing you into a position. 
There is nothing left to the imagination during the interview process. You know exactly what is expected of you and there is no sugar coating of the job.
The width and breadth of training and assistance offered to you is beyond comparison. If you have a question at 10:00 on a Saturday night your phone call gets answered and you get the help you need.",The interview process is longer but it is for good reason.
17,Ethos Group,Great Company,2021-10-07,5.0,Finance Manager,Great company for growth and personal development. great way to achieve financial goals due to competitive pay.,"a little longer hours to work specially on Saturday, but if that is not an issue, you can be very well compensated."

21,Ethos Group,The best team I've ever been a part of,2021-03-31,5.0,Rep,"The people within this organization are lead by their ethics, character and moral nature (the name of the company is well suited.) 
There are way too many pros to ever list, but I will say that my life is far better now that I am a part of this organization. We really impact the lives of the people that we work with on a day to day basis, which is extremely rewarding.
Ethos Group encourages us to live by keeping our priorities in line...Faith, Family, Ethos...in that order. We all know that happy and well taken care of employees thrive in the work place and Ethos Group clearly understands that because from what I have seen, everybody absolutely loves working here. We truly are the best in the world at what we do.","Some may see this as a con, other's as a benefit, but you may be asked to relocate."
22,Ethos Group,"Amazing culture, vision, and company",2021-04-12,5.0,Account Representative,"The culture of the company is amazing, and although the company is very successful we are still focusing on areas of growth, and working collectively as a company to be the best in the world at what we do. For the most part, there is full autonomy in my schedule, and as long as all of my work is done there's no one micromanaging my time. We are also encouraged to prioritize our values, with our faith (whatever that is) coming first, our families coming second, and our work coming third. The companies commitment to this has never wavered, and I can personally say that anytime something came for myself or my team members we were instructed to go take care of our families and not to worry about work.","Building something amazing can't be done during 40 hour work weeks, but this applies to every industry. Successful people don't become successful putting in the minimum amount of work."
23,Ethos Group,Amazing Company,2021-09-28,5.0,Sales Reresentative,The culture! Your coworkers actually care how you are doing and each and everyone of them are willing to help.,"The schedule can be tough, but anything worth doing is often difficult."
24,Ethos Group,Toxic Workplace,2020-12-31,2.0,Administrator,"The building is new and the location is nice. You receive a yearly bonus and the amount increased every year, I never had one under $1,000. The technology the company uses has been updated immensely and continues to do so, which helps a lot. Ethos Group's response to COVID was amazing and they adapted to working from home without incident. They provided the materials to do so as well. They give you the opportunity to cross train in other departments which is good for experience.","Good luck making any real money here unless you are a white male or one of their sales reps. No diversity here what so ever. They say raises are based off of how well the company did for the year, and not off of your work performance to get away with over working you and under paying you.(Seriously, it was said so much in the anonymous internal surveys that we were asked to comment on something else.) Multiple employees I worked with advised they were assigned ""projects"" that led to promotions with no raises, even when it's proven to be more work. The owner holds company wide meetings that lightly touch on how the company is doing, then goes off on tangents about how much money he made, politics, religion etc. Most of the higher ups and managers in this company are either married, related or grew up together so to save you some trouble just know it's definitely about who you know and not what you know here. Members of their HR department relay information about complaints, which is unprofessional, the exact opposite of what you would want and seeds distrust."
25,Ethos Group,Great Company,2021-05-04,5.0,Finance Manager,"Hired straight out of college to a competitive job making good money with no experience in the automotive industry. Thorough training made sure that I was prepared to do my job and gave me the ability to hit the ground running. Tons of support, great opportunity for those who are determined to perform well and be paid for it.","Long interview process. At first I found this process unorthodox, but after being in my position for nearly a year, I see why it was necessary. They want to make sure they hire the right candidate and place them in the right position/with the right group."
26,Ethos Group,Top Notch Training and Commitment to Excellence,2021-04-09,5.0,Business Manager,"They will give you everything you need to become successful! Your EG Rep will be an integral part of your placement and continued support. The automotive industry can be a tough one to break into, and an even tougher one to not only survive in but to thrive in. I wouldn't be where I am today without Ethos and my reps. Huge shoutout to Mr. Fiene and Mr. Pigge; it was a grueling interview process and a tough learning curve, but it all paid off.","Compliance can be nightmarish, but it has to be done."

I love the company, but I think my wife loves me working here even more!","I had to relocate to a new state, but we feel like we’ve found a new home with great friends!"
34,Ethos Group,Good Communication,2021-03-27,5.0,Operations,"Communication was still a focus since Covid to keep our culture strong. Online learning was created so we know more than ever about other areas of the company/people.

52,Ethos Group,Don't be fooled by Ethos Group's promise to making you a lot of money,2021-02-05,2.0,Financial Manager,"The only thing I am thankful for is the fact that Ethos Group and my trainer Brandon Strom got me hired at a dealership at McGrath Audi in Glenview, IL as a Finance Manager. Which embarked my long lasting career in the Automotive industry as a successful Finance Manager/Director, but the success was all thanks to my determination and perseverance. I was hired by Ethos Group having never worked in the car business before getting hired. I didn't know what to expect other than Ethos Group kept promising me that I will be making more money than I would know what to do with, but that was all a lie! I worked a minimum of 51 hours per week making $3000 per month while training, and made the dealership I worked for a lot of money. However I didn't know any better that I was being ripped off and kept hearing that from other outside sources, but didn't want to believe them. After working there for approx. 6 months and learning how to be a F&I Mgr and only getting a max payout of $3500 per month. I decided to leave there to go work for a real dealership without Ethos Group's claws being dug into the dealerships they manage for. I finally made the money that Ethos Group kept telling me I would make working in this field. Sad that after receiving my first check from the other job I made more there for 1 month of work than working for an Ethos Group Dealership for more than 3 months. However if it wasn't for Ethos Group I would have never got my foot into the door, and been as successful as I am now. So thank you for that Ethos Group","Not paying anyone what they are worth, and expect you to perform at a level that is at least 3 times what they're paying you. If you ever get the chance to work for an Ethos Group dealership be very carful they are not ripping you off blind."

Just some of the words that come to mind about this company.",2014-09-02,5.0,Finance Manager,"I have worked for this company for almost two years at a dealership in Chicago. I was originally Hired by this company right out of college at Iowa State University. They gave me the tools to become what I am today. It was a smooth transition from being with the USMC for over 6 years. The USMC and being a Finance manager have a lot in common. They both teach you structure, dependability, Initiative, and team work. Values that make you a success in life. Either with them or without I have no doubts that whatever endeavors lie ahead I will be a success. If you are looking for a professional company to work for and to lead others (including yourself) to success in the future than this is the right company for you.","Some few negatives that you may encounter with will be long hours, and working on Saturdays.

Great leadership training to see yourself grow, and of course the pay is excellent.","Make sure you're ready to work and not afraid of people. If you're looking for a 9-5 job that pays for 9-5 work, don't bother. If you're looking for a job where you can show up late in flip-flops and leave early, don't bother. If you're looking for a job that is excitingly different everyday, deals with people vs. paperpushing in a cubicle, and will challenge you to new limits you didn't even know about...look no further."

From the Recruiters, to the Trainers, to the HR Staff, and even the Claim reps, every single time you interact with anyone inside the Ethos Group, you are always dealing with a knowledgeable and friendly individual.

After training, they don't just throw you to the wolves and hope you survive, no, your rep visits the dealership weekly to review and train on any issues you may have.  You are 100% representation of their process and they make sure you are performing at your maximum ability.  After just a short 6 months in this position, I am committed to Ethos as my foundation for my lifelong career in this industry.  Thanks Ethos and Nate Blevins.",I would like a Corner Office overlooking the Ocean..
71,Ethos Group,Above and beyond what I had expected. ..,2014-08-28,5.0,Business/Finance Manager,"Working with the Ethos group has been an excellent opportunity for me personally and professionally.  They have given me the tools for success in the ultra competitive car industry.  I had never worked in the car industry prior, and let's face it  the industry in a whole has a pretty big black eye. While responding to an ad for a F&I position, I was contacted by Ryan the ethos rep. We talked about the Ethos group and set up the initial interview. After a few minutes in the interview I immediately knew I was getting into the right line of work. Ryan has been instrumental in my success,  has always been available to answer any questions I might have had.  The training in Texas was great while giving me the appropriate fundamentals to be in F&I.. The trainers there actually showed a genuine interest in your success as well. Overall I'm glad I've had the success I have had so far. Looking forward to continuing to learn and get better.",There are no cons....if you want to make money then you put the time in to achieve your potential.
72,Ethos Group,Great opportunity to start a great career.,2014-08-07,5.0,Finance Manager,"Ethos has done everything to make sure I am placed in the right role with the right group. There is a process to the interviews done before you even set foot in a dealership, but for good reason. I like how they get to know you and your goals before knowing exactly where you will be placed. I had several interviews with my ethos rep and he set me up with an excellent dealership with tremendous opportunity for growth. I have 5 years in the financial industry, but this is my first experience in the auto industry. With help and advice from my ethos rep the transition has been successful to my new role as finance manager. I know I could not have recieved this opportunity without ethos. In fact, I even applied for the same role a month before and the dealership wanted me to start in another position first. Ethos cares about who they mentor. Bottom line.",None. I was first contacted by Ethos 5 months ago and still haven't experienced anything that makes me feel my career isn't moving forward.

Not much room for verticle growth
Office culture divides contact between departments"
74,Ethos Group,Great Company,2013-02-12,5.0,Business/Finance Manager,The interview process was very thorough and each step of the process had a purpose that in the end makes complete sense.  They want to test you and make sure that you will be a great fit.  In the end our dealership is partners with Ethos Group and our dealer makes a lot of decisions with these guys input.  My rep during the interview process explained to me that he will not allow me to fail because once they brought me to the dealership I would be a direct reflection of them in the store.  It is for this reason that I think they are so invested in my success. My rep is in the store every week pushing me past my comfort level and although the job can be stressful I feel like I'm growing and i'm making excellent money.,We work a lot of hours and lots of late nights but most jobs that pay well are not a 9-5..
75,Ethos Group,Great Position,2014-08-07,5.0,Business/Finance Manager,"My experience has been very good both at the dealership group I work with as well as the partnership with Ethos Group. There was definitely a learning curve that I had to adjust to in the first 90 days but with my weekly meetings with our Ethos Rep I made progress. Our rep had the first 90 days mapped out for me as far as a training schedule and he assigned me both homework and a mentor on all items that he wasn't completing with at my side. I'm now 6 months into the job and hitting my stride and have been making $8,000-$10,000 per month and still working to make adjustments with my Ethos Rep. I'm very grateful for the career path that I have in front of me thanks to Ethos Group.",We do work some hours. It's not a 9-5 job but our rep was involved in helping our managers all get a 3 day weekend off each month.
76,Ethos Group,Former Finance Manager,2015-06-01,4.0,F&I Manager,"I will start off by saying, if you are hired by Ethos, you will not work for them. They help the dealers that sell their products find employees.  I had a good experience with them. I worked for one of the largest dealer groups in SE PA. I started on a guarantee, which will vary depending on your dealer group. After a month or two they send you to Dallas to train at the ethos office, which was a great experience. Once you return you will be a full time F&I manager. The job is by no means easy, but can be very lucrative. At the time of my departure I was well on my way to making at least 90K in 2015. Dave Mguffee was my local rep, and was an absolutely fantastic leader. He has a wealth of knowledge and is always available for help. I assume most reps are this way.  If you are a hard worker and good at face to face sales, you can make a lot of money in this position.","The only downside, and the biggest for me, is the lack of work/life balance. You work for a car dealer and this means dealership hours. We closed at 9 during the week, but usually left at 10 or later. Same thing goes for working saturdays."
77,Ethos Group,You get what you put in!,2014-05-22,5.0,Business Manager,"Ethos Group was heavily involved in the interview process, though they are considered a business partner of the dealership I was applying to work for. Initially I was unsure how the relationship would take form, I quickly realized there role in the dealership's business. They helped to clarify many of the questions that would have otherwise gone unanswered during the interview process. 

I enjoy my position as a Business Manager. Although the commitment required in this industry is substantial, the return on that investment is worth the sacrifice. I would highly recommend Ethos Group to any individual who has the drive, energy, and motivation to work for his success.",The automotive industry can be tough for people that do not thrive in a competitive environment.
78,Ethos Group,The Best Professional Decision I could have ever made,2014-08-08,5.0,Finance Manager,"These people are the best and brightest in the car business. The Name of the company says it all. They have a real interest in seeing you succeed. From my first interview I knew this is what I wanted to do. Teri Lathem's interview made me comfortable and made the decision to accept the job offer an easy one. This company is helping to build a better life for me and my family, by giving me the tools and direction I need to excel. 
Teri has become my mentor and he is never more than a phone call away. His direction and training is concise and thorough.  I feel like Teri will not let me fail!",There are zero cons. I've always had the tools I need to succeed. I can't think of one downside of taking this position.
79,Ethos Group,Ethos Set the Foundation For My Finance Career,2014-08-28,5.0,Business/Finance Manager,"The staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and makes you believe in everything they do. I have also worked with them as a consulting firm with my company for 8 years. Their products are beneficial and they give you no reason to not believe in the quality of their products or their employees. Having traveled to their headquarters for training, I can't say enough great things about them. Even years later. The organization inspires people (both inside and outside of their direct employees) to strive for excellence and to serve their clients properly. The grounds are beautiful and the offered benefits and perks of working for them (or even being trained at their location) are numerous.","There's nothing I can say here that would be fair to call a con, other than I wish the time I had spent on site in Texas had been longer, because I enjoyed it so thoroughly."
80,Ethos Group,Phenomenal Experience,2017-05-01,5.0,Finance Manager,"I cannot possibly overstate the gratitude I feel for my experience with the Ethos Group so far. Over the last 14 months with a high-volume Boston area dealership, I have experienced exponential personal and professional growth. I am blessed to have had the unconditional support of Brandon Strom, a Boston Area Ethos Group representative who is wholly committed to the success of each and every one of his Ethos Management Trainees. Brandon has become a mentor to me, guiding me through the intricacies of the business and offering tools for my betterment and the realization of my potential. If you are a passionate, competitive, and driven individual seeking an unparalleled career opportunity, Ethos is for you.",My experience has been 100% positive.
81,Ethos Group,A Wonderful Opportunity,2014-08-08,5.0,Business/Finance Manager,"The Pros started during the interview. I was nervous going in, but the way the Gentleman (Teri Lathem) handled the interview put me at ease. His reassurance and personality ultimately made my decision to accept the job offer an easy one.
After taking the job Teri has never been more than a phone call away. He has become a mentor and I value the direction he provides. 
Ethos Group has given all the tools needed to be successful.",I have found ZERO cons working for this company. Finding an employer that treats you like a humann being in this business is hard to come by. I should have made this move earlier.
82,Ethos Group,Disgusting,2011-07-07,1.0,Business/Finance Manager,There is money to be made.,"I was lied to repeatedly about what the job was, how much I would make, where I would be, what I would be doing etc.  They interview college graduates and make them think that they will be going directly into a management role in a dealership, when in fact Ethos Group has almost zero control over what happens after you get into the dealership.  You are at complete mercy of the existing management, and the ones I interacted with were complete scum of the earth.  Everyone starts out selling cars, but of course they do not tell you this.  I moved 400 miles from what I called home for this job only to realize I had been duped into a job selling cars.  Don't believe these people's lies!!  They are all ex car salesmen and use every trick in the bag to get you to believe everything they say and guess what.... almost none of it is true.  It is sad that people like this can get away with what they are doing to recent college graduates.  I gave these people 6 months of my life that I will never get back.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  Do not even give these people a chance to sit you down and talk to you!"
83,Ethos Group,Ethos is a great company that pushes you to be the best you can possibly be,2014-06-25,5.0,Business/Finance Manager,"I love working at Ethos Grouo because of your potential. Many people when working in their respective industry handle things like they're just settling. At Ethos, they develop employees to be the best, be hungry and to earn ""it"" every step of the way. My Ethos Rep is Drew Springs and he has truly been a pleasure to work with. He saw something in me that most firms didn't. He follows up with me on a weekly basis to make sure I am succeeding and fulfilling my own personal goals. He is always there to give me a hand. In a way, I feel as if if I fail, we fail together.",I do not see any cons
84,Ethos Group,A Mentor,2017-06-13,5.0,Brand Ambassador,"If Ethos Group were to be embodied by an individual, one would be hard-pressed to find a person more fitting than Brandon Strom.  Not only was he instrumental in my own decision to work as a Brand Ambassador at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, but he has remained committed to my success since getting on board.  Mentorship is truly the passion of Brandon, whose message remains consistent and positive.  My own growth as a result of such a role-model is just one example of his impact on young people starting out in their career.","Only wish I had been introduced to Ethos Group/Brandon sooner, it's never too early to meet your best mentor..."

Always available for follow-up and feedback, with a what-can-we-do-for-you attitude.  Gives one the skills to navigate through hard-sales and different approaches for a diverse client base.

Some will try and find something to find fault in but I cannot.
88,Ethos Group,World-Class Organization,2014-08-28,5.0,Finance Director,"I became associated with Ethos Group almost four years ago. That was the best thing that ever happened to my career. I was working in an Ethos-affiliated dealership and an F&I position came open. Ethos hand-picked me from the sales floor based on my track record in sales. Even though I was already very succesful in the auto industry, Ethos took me to new hights that I couldn't have even imagined before. Their training program is challenging as well as a whole lot of fun. Becasue of Ethos Group, I could move anywhere in the country and get a six-figure job in a matter of hours. If you are going to be in the car business, you want to work with Ethos.",There are no cons.

95,Ethos Group,Don't be fooled,2015-01-10,1.0,,They do a great job of luring you in to believe their cultures is the best in the industry.  There is no Pro unless your a person that wants to push products for the sake of just trying to make a buck and don't care if you find yourself in trouble because your rep tells you to sell his product regardless of what is good for the customer,The rep was a two faced con man that wanted to have me do unethical sales tactics to increase his sales of the products so he could make a extra few bucks.  I have never in my professional career had someone try to brow beat me and belittle me to make himself feel good about his job.  The truth I called him out several times on his horrible ideas and his sarcastic attitude. That person was the most unprofessional person I ever worked with and I think its just sad they had to perform the way they did

It would be great if all were there through ethos. but they do provide training to all. The hours are something they need to work on, its hard to maintain that work life balance."
97,Ethos Group,The Ethos Group has given me the training to develop my skill set into a six-figure income.,2014-09-03,5.0,Business/Finance Manager,"The Ethos Group has the most unique view on the F&I process out of any that I've seen.

He was great to work with, and made sure that I knew exactly what to expect going into my new position.  Ethos works closely with the company that I was applying for.

103,Ethos Group,Awesome Experience,2014-08-11,4.0,Business/Finance Manager,"Probably the main reason i chose to work with Ethos Group was the great experience the position offers.  Coming straight from college I had limited work experience; the F&I position is well rounded.  From this position you have the opportunity to develop solid sales techniques. More importantly for me to develop my leadership skills as well.  In addition, as F&I it is vital that you can handle administrative tasks. The experience to be gained from working in a dealership partnered with Ethos is phenomenal. There is a learning curve but if you have a good work ethic and initiative its not a huge obstacle.

105,Ethos Group,Feels like a bit of a scam,2014-08-03,2.0,Finance Manager,"Got me into the auto sales industry which I wouldn't have considered otherwise, however the only benefit of this was that I was able to make a little bit of money while my days off in the middle of the week were used to interview with other companies . Selling cars can actually be somewhat fun.","Throughout the entire interview process I was led to believe I was applying for the position of finance manager at a car dealership, even during the interview process they would describe that position to me. Never was it stated that I would be selling cars. Not until the final interview at the dealership was I enlightened with the truth. Overall it was disappointing and felt like a scam."
