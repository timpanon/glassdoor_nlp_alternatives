1,Ethos Group,Productive and Fun work Place,2022-01-18,5.0,Information Technology,I've been able to learn and grow as an employee. I'm able to create relations that will last me a life time as well. The company has grown a lot over the years but has kept its close knit feel.

4,Ethos Group,You get what you put in!,2021-10-04,5.0,Finance Manager,"Being in car sales before moving to finance, I have a very good understanding of what the job entails. With that being said, I understand that getting this position right out of college is rare in the industry. Pro’s are Good pay for coming out of college, great sales training you can use in other industries, and helps you handle multiple responsibilities at once.","Depending on dealership, your work/life balance could be good or bad. Beyond that it’s not much to complain about as long as you don’t slack and get lazy. Also, it’s the car industry… no saturdays off and maybe sundays as well."

7,Ethos Group,Credibility!,2021-11-22,5.0,F&I Manager,"Ethos Group is named ethos for a reason. Their credibility, attention to detail, and team/partner centric attitude is everything in an industry that is heavily influenced by word of mouth.",I have nothing bad to say about this company.

Amazing opportunity to grow as an person, with great mentors and leaders around you. If this is something you truly want you will excel and have a skill you can use in any state around the country.",Some kids take the job just to get a paycheck without doing enough research. Obviously in car business you have late nights and work weekends.
11,Ethos Group,Amazing Company!,2021-10-05,5.0,Business Manager,"Great training, excellent mentors, and overall best culture that I have worked in within my 15 years of professional experience. Very accommodating to work/life balance, and always there to assist when needed.","Working within the automotive field working Saturdays is always tough, but for the competitive pay I receive I will gladly work every Saturday possible!"

I can't talk good enough about how great the culture here is from finding anything you have a mutual interest in to large team/department events annually.
Typically very low stress with regular hours, and anytime you need help someone is there and willing to reach out. Additionally education is encouraged through things like Pluralsight and going to conferences. 
Work from home was completely embraced and proven very effective as there are 0 in-office requirements at time of posting.",Flat organization means that path for promotion is ultimately vague and raises beyond the annual (while competitive) are more challenging to come by.
14,Ethos Group,Ethos Group had a great internship program!,2021-09-15,4.0,Software Develeoper,"Last summer, I worked as a software engineering intern. Ethos Group had a great training program that was put together and prepared me well for the job. It was a week of learning and a week of applying what you learned, which was incredibly effective. The company also has really helpful, down-to-Earth people who are always willing to answer your questions. My favorite thing about Ethos Group is the culture.","It may be easy to get a bit overwhelmed with all of the software and how everything connects. It's also a bit difficult if you aren't familiar with the car industry, specifically car deals and how the car dealerships are set up. There were also some days where I encountered problems with running the software or my virtual machine freezing."

They spend a more than adequate amount of time assessing your personal and professional characteristics and what you want out of your career before placing you into a position. 
There is nothing left to the imagination during the interview process. You know exactly what is expected of you and there is no sugar coating of the job.
The width and breadth of training and assistance offered to you is beyond comparison. If you have a question at 10:00 on a Saturday night your phone call gets answered and you get the help you need.",The interview process is longer but it is for good reason.

There are way too many pros to ever list, but I will say that my life is far better now that I am a part of this organization. We really impact the lives of the people that we work with on a day to day basis, which is extremely rewarding.
Ethos Group encourages us to live by keeping our priorities in line...Faith, Family, Ethos...in that order. We all know that happy and well taken care of employees thrive in the work place and Ethos Group clearly understands that because from what I have seen, everybody absolutely loves working here. We truly are the best in the world at what we do.","Some may see this as a con, other's as a benefit, but you may be asked to relocate."
22,Ethos Group,"Amazing culture, vision, and company",2021-04-12,5.0,Account Representative,"The culture of the company is amazing, and although the company is very successful we are still focusing on areas of growth, and working collectively as a company to be the best in the world at what we do. For the most part, there is full autonomy in my schedule, and as long as all of my work is done there's no one micromanaging my time. We are also encouraged to prioritize our values, with our faith (whatever that is) coming first, our families coming second, and our work coming third. The companies commitment to this has never wavered, and I can personally say that anytime something came for myself or my team members we were instructed to go take care of our families and not to worry about work.","Building something amazing can't be done during 40 hour work weeks, but this applies to every industry. Successful people don't become successful putting in the minimum amount of work."
23,Ethos Group,Amazing Company,2021-09-28,5.0,Sales Reresentative,The culture! Your coworkers actually care how you are doing and each and everyone of them are willing to help.,"The schedule can be tough, but anything worth doing is often difficult."
24,Ethos Group,Toxic Workplace,2020-12-31,2.0,Administrator,"The building is new and the location is nice. You receive a yearly bonus and the amount increased every year, I never had one under $1,000. The technology the company uses has been updated immensely and continues to do so, which helps a lot. Ethos Group's response to COVID was amazing and they adapted to working from home without incident. They provided the materials to do so as well. They give you the opportunity to cross train in other departments which is good for experience.","Good luck making any real money here unless you are a white male or one of their sales reps. No diversity here what so ever. They say raises are based off of how well the company did for the year, and not off of your work performance to get away with over working you and under paying you.(Seriously, it was said so much in the anonymous internal surveys that we were asked to comment on something else.) Multiple employees I worked with advised they were assigned ""projects"" that led to promotions with no raises, even when it's proven to be more work. The owner holds company wide meetings that lightly touch on how the company is doing, then goes off on tangents about how much money he made, politics, religion etc. Most of the higher ups and managers in this company are either married, related or grew up together so to save you some trouble just know it's definitely about who you know and not what you know here. Members of their HR department relay information about complaints, which is unprofessional, the exact opposite of what you would want and seeds distrust."
25,Ethos Group,Great Company,2021-05-04,5.0,Finance Manager,"Hired straight out of college to a competitive job making good money with no experience in the automotive industry. Thorough training made sure that I was prepared to do my job and gave me the ability to hit the ground running. Tons of support, great opportunity for those who are determined to perform well and be paid for it.","Long interview process. At first I found this process unorthodox, but after being in my position for nearly a year, I see why it was necessary. They want to make sure they hire the right candidate and place them in the right position/with the right group."
26,Ethos Group,Top Notch Training and Commitment to Excellence,2021-04-09,5.0,Business Manager,"They will give you everything you need to become successful! Your EG Rep will be an integral part of your placement and continued support. The automotive industry can be a tough one to break into, and an even tougher one to not only survive in but to thrive in. I wouldn't be where I am today without Ethos and my reps. Huge shoutout to Mr. Fiene and Mr. Pigge; it was a grueling interview process and a tough learning curve, but it all paid off.","Compliance can be nightmarish, but it has to be done."

I love the company, but I think my wife loves me working here even more!","I had to relocate to a new state, but we feel like we’ve found a new home with great friends!"
34,Ethos Group,Good Communication,2021-03-27,5.0,Operations,"Communication was still a focus since Covid to keep our culture strong. Online learning was created so we know more than ever about other areas of the company/people.

52,Ethos Group,Don't be fooled by Ethos Group's promise to making you a lot of money,2021-02-05,2.0,Financial Manager,"The only thing I am thankful for is the fact that Ethos Group and my trainer Brandon Strom got me hired at a dealership at McGrath Audi in Glenview, IL as a Finance Manager. Which embarked my long lasting career in the Automotive industry as a successful Finance Manager/Director, but the success was all thanks to my determination and perseverance. I was hired by Ethos Group having never worked in the car business before getting hired. I didn't know what to expect other than Ethos Group kept promising me that I will be making more money than I would know what to do with, but that was all a lie! I worked a minimum of 51 hours per week making $3000 per month while training, and made the dealership I worked for a lot of money. However I didn't know any better that I was being ripped off and kept hearing that from other outside sources, but didn't want to believe them. After working there for approx. 6 months and learning how to be a F&I Mgr and only getting a max payout of $3500 per month. I decided to leave there to go work for a real dealership without Ethos Group's claws being dug into the dealerships they manage for. I finally made the money that Ethos Group kept telling me I would make working in this field. Sad that after receiving my first check from the other job I made more there for 1 month of work than working for an Ethos Group Dealership for more than 3 months. However if it wasn't for Ethos Group I would have never got my foot into the door, and been as successful as I am now. So thank you for that Ethos Group","Not paying anyone what they are worth, and expect you to perform at a level that is at least 3 times what they're paying you. If you ever get the chance to work for an Ethos Group dealership be very carful they are not ripping you off blind."

Just some of the words that come to mind about this company.",2014-09-02,5.0,Finance Manager,"I have worked for this company for almost two years at a dealership in Chicago. I was originally Hired by this company right out of college at Iowa State University. They gave me the tools to become what I am today. It was a smooth transition from being with the USMC for over 6 years. The USMC and being a Finance manager have a lot in common. They both teach you structure, dependability, Initiative, and team work. Values that make you a success in life. Either with them or without I have no doubts that whatever endeavors lie ahead I will be a success. If you are looking for a professional company to work for and to lead others (including yourself) to success in the future than this is the right company for you.","Some few negatives that you may encounter with will be long hours, and working on Saturdays.

Great leadership training to see yourself grow, and of course the pay is excellent.","Make sure you're ready to work and not afraid of people. If you're looking for a 9-5 job that pays for 9-5 work, don't bother. If you're looking for a job where you can show up late in flip-flops and leave early, don't bother. If you're looking for a job that is excitingly different everyday, deals with people vs. paperpushing in a cubicle, and will challenge you to new limits you didn't even know about...look no further."
