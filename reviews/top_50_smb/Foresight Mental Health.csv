0,Foresight Mental Health,I love working at Foresight Mental Health.,2022-04-04,5.0,Therapist,"There is an immense amount of support. 
I feel respected and valued.
It's an encouraging atmosphere.
Management do not hold themselves as better than anyone else.",Having just come to Colorado in 12/21 there isn't a client base yet. It's taking a very long time to build up my caseload.
1,Foresight Mental Health,They don't really want your feedback,2022-03-01,1.0,Member Success Team,The majority of people were very nice there. Insurance starts the following month,"I will start out that I am a former employee that was let go because I ""didn't meet the company's core values"". I'm not even sure what those are. The 3 weeks of training was very confusing and completely out of order. Things such a how to use the payroll app and going over company's slack communication program were all done in week 3. When I was ask for feedback on the training it was held against me and was told that I don't care about me job. I believe that my feedback was informative and could've been helpful. 
As far as paychecks went, my 1st one which was supposed to be paid on a Friday, I didn't receive until the following Wednesday. I was told there was an ongoing ""investigation"" into it. I told them they could look at my bank or call my bank to see if the money was deposited and they couldn't or won't do it. They were very laxed about getting in resolved but it finally did. Then my health insurance didn't start on the 1st and my 1st couple of emails went unanswered till I got management involved, I found out that the all the applications were not submitted until the 31st for coverage starting on the 1st. It took my 8 days and several canceled doctor's appointments to get it activate."
2,Foresight Mental Health,Changing the Minds of Mental Healthcare by putting Employees First,2021-12-22,5.0,Member Success Enrollment Specialist,"Foresight is changing the game on employee and employer dynamics. This company truly cares of not only creating accessible mental health services to our communities, but also creating positive mental health work environments for its staff. The environment that has been established here breeds positivity, growth, support, and creativity. After only 3 months of employment I have never worked in a place such as this that actually doesn't stress me out to come to work, or make me feel unappreciated for my time and energy. This environment makes you want to flourish, contribute, and excited to help members every day. You not only make a difference in your own life but also in the lives of others who really need the care. I'm really excited to see how this company grows, and looking forward to growing with it. Changing peoples minds about mental healthcare one day at a time.","Not a con for me personally, however, could potentially be a con for others is that because it's still a growing company if you're not great with adapting quickly to new programs, or not comfortable with technology it may create other obstacles for you. (But everyone is super helpful if you're up for the challenge)"
3,Foresight Mental Health,Best Place to work,2022-02-28,5.0,Member Success Enrollment Specialist,"Lots of opportunities to grow and learn from your mistakes, guiding hands whenever you need help. The job comes with good benefits, and all the experts, leads and bosses are all nice, wonderful caring people who encourage a work life balance especially when working from home.","working from home can be difficult if you are easily distracted, or not feeling engaged/ motivated. You have to have some form of self discipline."
4,Foresight Mental Health,Incredible support and work culture,2022-03-14,5.0,Clinical Operations,"Leadership is incredibly helpful and make their selves approachable
The company is employee focused- meaning they make us as much of a priority as they do their clients
Very rewarding work- helping clients match with providers who fit their specific need on almost every end of that spectrum
They listen to ideas of people from all levels in the company!
Great at giving and receiving honest feedback so you are never out of the loop",I just wish I had known about this company sooner! No cons
5,Foresight Mental Health,Just The Absolute Dream Environment,2022-01-12,5.0,Enrollment Coordinator,"I am treated with respect here and I actually have a voice. Everything is remote but it feels as though you're communicating with everyone within the office using Slack. It's quite amazing how much interaction goes on, and help is literally one click away if you need it. You feel heard, you feel noticed, and you feel like you belong - which are all important qualities to a job/career. It's much more than a paycheck.

I'm not one who boasts about their job if I'm not satisfied. In the past 10 years, I've had different work experiences and I landed what I thought was the ideal job with my education finally done. Except, I was treated as though I didn't have a life outside of work. Family values are important to me and it's not worth the sacrifice of working hard if I can't be home long enough to enjoy it.

Here at Foresight, everyone values your mental health. Everything is balanced.","Honestly, none. Everything requires hard work and this is worth it."
6,Foresight Mental Health,25 years as a recruiter and Foresight is #1!,2021-10-11,5.0,Provider Recruiter,"I get to interview and build rapport with candidates, which is what I love most about being a career recruiter. The candidate experience really is #1 at Foresight! 

I get to provide a high quality experience for each candidate because I don't have to do the full life cycle and a bunch of administrative work, while carrying a high req load. 

The training, support, and team collaboration is in a league of its own at Foresight! 

The core values here are 100% aligned with my own core values as a human being, and as a professional with a career.

The weekly All Staff meetings provide full transparency on all things happening, so everyone is in-the-know abut what's happening within the organization. 

Foresight embraces a healthy work/life balance and wants the employees to do the same. We are encouraged to get up from our desks and take a couple minutes throughout the day, to step away and stretch and we even have weekly 1:1 meetings with our supervisors, called 'walk and talk' where we each go outside in our neighborhoods and walk while on the phone having our touch-base meeting. 

Foresight clearly values its employees and they have created an organization that prides itself on the mind, body, spirit wellness of everyone who comes on board! I LOVE that!

I'm very grateful for my position here, but also honored to be a part of such a progressive team of incredible people who share the same values! More happy, healthy people on the planet is at the forefront of our goals here at Foresight and I am ALL IN with that!",I honestly haven't seen one con!

13,Foresight Mental Health,Not Happy how things ended,2022-01-30,2.0,Member Service Representative,I'm all for Mental Health and getting the help you need. To better yourself and your life to be the best you can be.,"The position I signed up for and applied for was more than I expected. I was not experienced in things I was being (quickly) trained on. The position I originally applied for was changed to another position that as I mentioned. I was not really experienced doing. Not one time did HR say. Let;s put you in the original position you applied for and keep you with the company. Nobody reached out to correct the problem, etc... I wanted to stay with the company just doing something I was experienced doing."
14,Foresight Mental Health,Love my job,2022-02-15,5.0,Member Success Enrollment Specialist,I love the people I work with. My boss is amazing. The leaders are amazing. I have never felt so supported in my career. Lots of room for growth and potential.,"There are often changes in structure, but when the company is almost 4 years old, it is to be expected."
15,Foresight Mental Health,Quite simply the best company I've ever worked at,2021-10-13,5.0,Provider Recruiter,"-Permanently remote, work-from-home full-time positions makes work/life balance substantially easier.

This really is the best company I've ever worked for. I am happy to wake up every day and collaborate with my team."

It's a very supportive, inclusive, environment that celebrates the diversity and accomplishments of all it's employees.","It's a start-up that is expanding quickly, which comes with growing pains. You have to be flexible and okay with changes that happen quickly"
17,Foresight Mental Health,Change Mental Healthcare,2022-01-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I would have to say that I have loved my experience working here overall. By far this is the best company I have worked for. They all rate an 8 with me.,There are really not many downsides of working here. All companies have the things that they need to work on and Foresight has that too. We could definitely use more staffing in some departments.
18,Foresight Mental Health,Great Place to work!,2022-02-28,5.0,Mental Health Therapist,"Inclusive, flexible, supportive, creative, inspiring!",I do not have any negative feedback!
19,Foresight Mental Health,Great place with passionate teams and ambitious goals!,2021-08-30,4.0,Department Lead,"This is the first company I've worked for where colleagues and leaders ask how you are doing and they genuinely care to know. When people here advocate for mental healthcare, that extends to Foresight employees too. It's true that sometimes we--leaders, colleagues, peers--miss the mark, but what sets Foresight apart is the commitment to do the next right thing. 

We own the areas where we fall short and commit to doing better. We are all given grace to be humans who are navigating a complex system (mental healthcare) in a rapidly changing environment (startup) during an incredibly challenging time (COVID-19). Not to mention that we all have lives outside of our jobs, and I feel Foresight is the first place I've worked where that has been acknowledged and respected.

From day one, I have also walked into weekly All Hands meetings, regular initiatives from dedicated DE&I, Wellness and Connections teams, and intentional hiring to get the right leaders in place. Many companies don't care enough to invest the time, money or energy into any of those areas, so I have been very impressed that a company as young as Foresight is already ahead of the curve there.","Some of the struggles that other reviews have cited are real and valid, such as mountains of work to be done with not enough people or resources to do it all. Startups are not new to me and, believe me, they all feel this way while teams, processes and structure are being built out. You will be challenged and stretched here, but you will also learn a lot from working through the growing pains."
20,Foresight Mental Health,Awesome place to work,2022-01-31,5.0,Operations Coordinator,Foresight is full of supportive leaders and colleagues. Everyone is incredibly helpful and goal oriented.

24,Foresight Mental Health,Great company culture,2022-01-13,5.0,Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT),Transparent leadership seeks feedback and acts on it. Company leadership is clearly interested in the well-being of its employees.,I can't think of any after almost 10 months working there.
25,Foresight Mental Health,A Very Welcoming and Supportive Environment,2021-10-15,5.0,Licensed Psychotherapist,"As a new therapist coming from community mental health, I've received a lot of support to help me learn and grow as a therapist. The online therapy resources, weekly consultation groups, peer support, and access to all of the other Foresight therapists and staff has helped me to feel like I am part of a caring, close-knit community and team, even though we are all still remote. I also align with the company's values and mission of making mental health care more accessible and innovative. They pay well and have great benefits.","I would like a little more flexibility with the required minimum caseload. There are a lot of changes, which is to be expected with a startup, but leadership is transparent about them and why they are being made."
26,Foresight Mental Health,Supportive Culture at its best,2022-01-10,5.0,Mental Health Therapist,The culture is so supportive. My team is easily within reach and advocates for me and for the team.

The company actually cares about their employees and there is much room for growth so it’s very exciting!,"It’s a start up so policies, procedures, etc are constantly changing so you have to be adaptable but the change is usually for good and leads to a more efficient work flow."
28,Foresight Mental Health,"Good culture, messy RCM department",2022-03-01,4.0,Anonymous Employee,HR is wonderful and really listen to their employees.,Switching software to process claims over and over created a huge mess.

33,Foresight Mental Health,This is the best place I have ever worked!!!,2021-10-11,5.0,Mental Health Technician,"This place has been so accomidating since I have started almost two years ago. The schedule is very flexible, the leadership always make themselves available, the team times time monthly to check in with us. I love having consult group each week to process cases and it really helps us get the support we need, the team takes time to really hear what providers need. We get extra time for consult and documentation each week and lots of time off! The staff is very encouraging for self care. Over all amazing place to work.","This i a start up so a lot of change and being flexible are a must, but other than that its hard to have any cons."

35,Foresight Mental Health,A Great and Supportive Place to Work,2021-08-19,5.0,Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT),"I have never felt as supported by the company that I work for as I do working for Foresight Mental Health. The company is set up in a way that allows providers to put their sole focus on the company's goal to transform the mental health industry. The company sends out company wide surveys asking about changes employees would like to see and they take suggestions seriously and make changes. In the time that I have been here, they have updated their benefits options twice, providing us with excellent healthcare options for us and our families. The provider regular paid training opportunities to learn new skills and stay up-to-date on best practices. Providing therapy is not an easy job, but Foresight makes it as easy as possible for providers.","I know it may not be helpful, but I haven't experienced any noteworthy cons of the company yet."
36,Foresight Mental Health,"Great Company, Growing Fast.",2021-12-20,5.0,People and Culture,I have been at Foresight a year and really like it. The people are great and they are trying to walk the walk. They promote from within and have fun but productive culture.,"It is a start up, so thing change and move fast. But that is to be expected."
37,Foresight Mental Health,The Little Engine that could (especially during a Pandemic)!,2021-08-02,5.0,Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT),"A mental health organization still young enough to care about their employees! 
Two hours of paid per week for the incidentals (completing notes, making phone calls, communication with staff members, consulting other professionals, etc.).
14 days of vacation and the sick time is equivalent. 
One hour of paid consultation time with area team members. 
Software to monitor your client's weekly moods. 
Upscale computer program for the most efficient session notes which includes treatment plans, goals, interventions, suicide risk assessments, modalities, etc. 
Healthcare Benefits that have slowly been improved over the past several years rated as fair to good. 
A Diversity and Inclusion Team that existed long before organizations were pressured into having one.
In office snacks, coffee and drinks as much as you want. More than you need.",Pay scale could be enhanced to recruit the cream-of-the-crop providers.
38,Foresight Mental Health,Started great but going downhill FAST,2021-07-27,2.0,Member Success Representative,"Pay is good for the work they provide work from home equipment such as a desk, laptop, etc... Friendly customer base.",I originally came here to get away from the call center micro managing environment and the job description described the job as a case worker. After a couple of months they have made drastic changes to make it a call center job which I did not want. They implement too many changes at once as if they are a large company but they are still a young startup and do not have the staff to fulfill the volume they have built up. Leadership seems incompetent to say the least. We tell them we are overwhelmed and stressed but no changes have been made. How can a mental health company have stressed out employees? I am noticing some people sign on to work only to resign before even starting or leaving the company due to the heavy workload. I hope they figure out a solution or I will have to look elsewhere to work due to the job stress.
39,Foresight Mental Health,Best company I have ever worked for,2021-12-20,5.0,Mental Health Therapist I,Terrific support system for employees. Excellent training. Good benefits.

Everyone is engaged and dedicated to the work and to the mission to improve the mental health field and make services more affordable and accessible for everyone. The culture is the best. The people are all very talented and great at what they do. Working remotely from home is awesome. I love the flexibility it affords me. This is the most supportive and healthy work environment I have ever encountered. Also love the unlimited vacation time.,"The benefits are okay - there is a 401k with a small match. Healthcare costs are too high, in my opinion."
41,Foresight Mental Health,Love this company!!!!!,2022-01-04,5.0,Collections Specialist,Co-workers and management are great! Everything is set up for you to succeed at your job!,"No complaints yet. So far, so good"

Fellow team mates: the hiring team hires amazing people. Everyone works well with each other and they are open and willing to help each other.
Every day is interesting and super proud to be part of something that will change peoples lives.
Leadership is very understanding and do as much as they can to help.","Start-up growing pains comes with the territory.
The cost of living is changing and it would be nice to get a little more. Competitive etc. 
Sometimes the days can be long due how busy we are which in most case is good but we need some much needed space between the calls. The calls can be mentally draining.
Glad we have insurance but it's a little expensive."
47,Foresight Mental Health,Caring and Compassionate Company,2021-09-28,5.0,SCA and Benefits Specialist,"This company works continuesly on improving work conditions, Lead members are readily available to help out, and the benefits are above average for the main stream of employers out there.

It's pleasure working here everyday knowing we're contributing by doing and taking action which is what this company does.","As a fast growing startup, there are many lows and cons. We don't have a set of this or that. Miscommunication occurs but often will get dealt with right away. It can get pretty overwhelming at times. Curve balls can sometimes be thrown your way.

The only other con is that some things are still in the process of being figured out or rolled out, due to the company being young, that cause some minor confusion (though it's always explained and supported by the support team)."
60,Foresight Mental Health,LOVE LOVE LOVE my company!,2021-09-07,5.0,Provider Recruiter,"The people are everything! Never have a worked for a company that has really valued its employees like Foresight. No matter what role you're in within the company, you are valued and supported like no other. Couldn't be happier to call this place home.","Base compensation is a bit low, however management is so receptive to feedback and is looking to increase it overall to stay competitive."
61,Foresight Mental Health,Best Company I Have Ever Worked For,2021-08-30,5.0,Member Success Representative,"I have work for several large health care and insurance companies in my 30 year career and Foresight is hands down the best company I have worked for to date. This company cares about it's employees as much as it cares about it's members, and wants their wellbeing to be just as important. 

I am refreshed with the amount of transparency this company shows. In past companies I have worked for, planning and long terms goals of the company were rarely shared beyond upper management levels.",I am hard pressed to find anything negative to say.
62,Foresight Mental Health,"Engaged, thoughtful community of people dedicated to making a difference",2021-10-11,5.0,People Operations,Great group of brilliant colleagues who are passionate about bringing mental health to everyone to lead happier and healthier lives! It's for real!,There is joy in building something from the ground--not everything is worked out yet!
63,Foresight Mental Health,"Hope, help and happiness",2021-10-15,5.0,Operations Coordinator,the staff is so friendly and courteous - leadership makes an effort to make us feel like a family even though we are all remote - we provide help when people most need it,very busy - phone ques
64,Foresight Mental Health,"Great atmosphere, slow change",2021-10-12,3.0,Member Success Manager,Foresight offers great benefits and is truly a great place to work. Everyone is very positive and focused on helping those in need of mental health services.,"Upper management, specifically in the RCM department, has implemented many changes with what appears to be little to no foresight, no pun intended. This has caused many problems that require a huge amount of resources to solve. Also they are extremely slow in updating titles for promotions, and currently do not factor cost of living into hourly rates."
65,Foresight Mental Health,Great company,2022-01-09,4.0,Costumer Service Representative,You’re working with incredible people who love to collaborate.,Crazy fast paced environment. More clients than the company is able to accommodate.
66,Foresight Mental Health,Nice people but disorganized and bad pay,2021-07-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,The people who work at foresight are supportive and kind. The atmosphere at work is very pleasant and there’s no weird toxic culture.,I suspect that everyone leaving positive reviews here for foresight works as a mental health provider. On the operations side everyone is nickel and dimed and struggling financially. Raises are really not entertained and they will prioritize hiring new staff / increasing benefits for already well paid people (such as sick days) before putting some love into Operations. If you are looking for a positive and fun place to work then foresight fits the bill but I do not recommend it for people who are more career driven or people who have dependents or live in more expensive areas.
67,Foresight Mental Health,An intentional company,2021-06-28,5.0,Project Manager,A culture of collaboration and innovation meets a wide ranged of skilled professionals who are all passionate about making mental healthcare a better place. Leadership tries to foster a system where people feel supported and cared for. The development team frequently meets with stakeholders to prioritize projects. We are CONSTANTLY rolling out new features to improve things. We emphasize understanding the member's perspective. There is tons of room for growth. We have fun and random slack channels and happy hours. We have peer counseling and benefits are starting to improve. There is flexibility in our workday and a degree of autonomy.,"If you understand start up life, you understand these cons come with many high-growth companies: Things change quickly and you may not always understand why or see the reasoning. High emphasis on scaling quickly can lead to imperfect operational systems that need constant adjustment."
68,Foresight Mental Health,Growing with Foresight,2021-09-02,5.0,Help Desk Technician,"I joined Foresight when the team size was around 30 employees, fast forward 2 years and it is 500+! Amazingly through this rapid growth the culture has continued to be one of transparency and support. Very happy to continue to contribute to what appears to be a bright future for this company!","As with all startups experiencing rapid growth, it does feel like running from one fire to the next sometimes, looking forward to implementing tools to predict and prevent those fires from happening in the first place."
69,Foresight Mental Health,Truly supportive team,2021-10-11,5.0,Operations Coordinator,"The operations department is a group of hard working individuals who truly care and support one another.

70,Foresight Mental Health,Speed trumps quality- watch out !,2021-09-23,3.0,Clinician,"They credential you, has administrative support for scheduling etc., flexible schedule, offers group consultation. A group of young and energetic people who believe that they are making mental health accessible to more people.","Lofty business goals and a focus on speed/expansion with compromised quality of care and cohesiveness of inter-department collaboration. Confusions and miscommunications are reported by clients and clinicians. Lots of inconsistencies as for policies and roles. What they are striving to achieve does not match the reality yet. It is unclear what are the pathways to get messages crossed and to whom. Very new, very young company."
71,Foresight Mental Health,Best Place to Work,2021-07-19,5.0,Billing Specialist,"Great work support. Fantastic benefits package. Amazing culture. Management is pleasant, professional and organized. A lot of room for growth and experience. I work remote and they have provided me with all the tools needed to succeed in my job role as billing specialist.",One thing I would say is the pay scale seems on the lower end.
72,Foresight Mental Health,Foresight is a very supportive and collaborative start-up,2021-11-09,5.0,Talent Acquisition Coordinator,everyone is extremely helpful and supportive of each other.,I have not experienced any cons

74,Foresight Mental Health,Supportive and Positive Environment,2021-10-11,5.0,Administrative Assistant,Supportive environment and leadership. Ability to work remote. Lots of communication and transparency. Engaging and challenging work.

76,Foresight Mental Health,"Great place to work, but has its cons",2021-07-19,4.0,Licensed Mental Health Therapist,This is a great company and I truly love my job for the endless support consistently given to all of us. It is a newer company and they are constantly trying to make changes to better improve the employees roles and all of the members.,Pay is very low for a licensed therapist. There also seems to be some grey lines with this as newer therapists seem to be getting paid more than therapists that have already been working there (job posting references). I don't agree with other locations making more than others since we have all been virtual and doing the same job. Benefits also recently changed and now I am paying more out of pocket.
77,Foresight Mental Health,Foresight has great benefits for Therapists!,2021-07-19,5.0,Psychotherapist,"Therapists are paid for No-Shows and Late cancellations for intake and follow-up sessions unless therapist waives the fees. I have never seen this done before in any other fee for service clinic I have worked in.

Foresight has a great deal of Support Staff such as The Operations Team which handles scheduling of appointments and reaching out to clients (members) who do not show for sessions or are late to sessions. The Operations Team is outstanding! 

Foresight has a Specialized Care Team that provides referrals for outpatient and higher levels of care for clients (members).

Foresight provides many opportunities for CEU's and Training at no cost to the employee.

Foresight offers weekly Group Clinical Consultations that provide clinical support to therapists.

Foresight pays for 2 hours per week for consultation time and other administrative tasks. Foresight also pays for time spent in mandatory meetings and attending in-house trainings. 

Foresight has a weekly All-Hands Meeting with all Foresight Staff via Video Conferencing to maximize communication among all staff members. 

Foresight provides plenty of clients (members) for therapists to maintain caseloads of 32 (clients) member per week. 

Foresight has an EMR system which is easy to use when writing brief session notes.

Foresight offers Fee for Service Pay per session or per mandatory meeting or training completed. However, Foresight offers Health, Vision, Dental Insurance, 
401-K, EAP Program, HSA's, Vacation and Sick Pay, free access to a Nutritionist on Staff. I have never seen a fee for service program provide all these benefits before. 

Foresight Provides therapists with a Laptop or Chrome book, headphones, mouse etc. for all Foresight related work, video sessions, EMR access. Many fee for service employers do not provide this.

The Foresight Recruiting, Credentialing and Onboarding Department Staff are friendly, helpful and easy to work with.","Foresight is undergoing a great deal of growth and change because of expansion into other states. Growth and expansion can sometimes result in many quick changes in organizations. Communicating quick changes can be a challenge for any large organization. However these changes are communicated via email and/or via All Hands Meetings once per week.

Fee For Service Income can be variable in any Fee For Service Clinic, as clients (members) finish or discontinue therapy. However the OPS Team stands ready to provide new clients (members) once the therapists requests this."

The employees here are some of the kindest people I have ever met, and the opportunity for growth is unmatched by any of my previous work experiences.","It is easy to let the work we are doing affect our own mental health.

I also am impressed with Foresight's ability & responsiveness around facilitating Medical/Psychiatric evaluations. My experience is that clients are seen within 5-7 days of request. The website, though a work-in-progress is navigable. Though it is still all virtual up to this point, there are weekly Case Consultation. Company wide meetings are a bit sporadic.

The schedulers do not understand what the therapists do and often do not follow through so many things fall through the cracks-cleints get assigned to a therapist who does not have the expertise needed, clients are repeatedly charged inaccurately, messages do not reach therapists from clients and there is no follow through. There are unethical actions taken so that the business of running the company is done- client notes, cutting off clients after being allowed to see them if there is a change in insurance, moving clients along and off the therapist's schedule if the client is seen as too needy, difficult etc. It is expected that therapists find an outside referral for a client but there is not enough time in the day to do this. It is great that there is a psychiatry dept to refer clients to but often the psychiatrists are very underskilled and they miss things, do not help clients adjust to new diagnoses and even sabotage a therapist's work with a client because the ongoing therapy notes are not read by the psychiatrist."

What I was not prepared for, was the level of support, attention and respect I received. Start up companies are known to be ""scrappy"" with managers who are overworked and under supported. That is not the case at Foresight. I have levels of support and a team who has helped me onboard, understand, grow, learn and already achieve success within my first month at the company. I see a long term career here at Foresight and don't doubt that I will call this place home for a long time. I am so glad I made the switch and joined such a wonderfully supportive team.","No cons, things can be more organized but its a start up and that is more than expected.
