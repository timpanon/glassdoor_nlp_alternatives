0,GRIN,Amazing place to work!,2022-03-25,5.0,Customer Success Manager (CSM),"The biggest pro is the people. Everyone at the company really embodies the 5 core values from coworkers to the company and department leadership. I'm a huge fan of the open communication from the top down. Leaders answer every question submitted to them anonymously even when they're not easy questions to answer and they're open to/seek out good-faith criticism and discussion that can genuinely improve GRIN in any way. GRIN is constantly making positive changes to improve the company and the experiences of everyone working for it. There's also a lot of room for growth professionally.

I'm also a big fan of the ambition and direction of the company. GRIN is taking over as a dominant player in its industry and has the leadership and team members to ensure continued success. I'm excited to see how the company continues to grow.","2 potential cons (depends on your preference) are the fully remote environment and growing pains. I see the fully remote style as a pro, but it can be more difficult to form connections with coworkers in this environment. That said, since I've worked at GRIN, the company has consistently been improving opportunities for internal connection at both the company level and the department/team levels. 

It's also a quickly growing start-up and there are some growing pains that come with that, such as keeping up with changing features/documentation, and changes in internal processes to facilitate continued growth. I don't think this is specific to GRIN and can be expected from any company in this position. That said, I think GRIN is handling it well.

Lastly, pay and compensation is moderate to good. Since I've started, there has been market right-sizing, merit increases, and additional benefits added consistently which is a good sign that compensation will continue to improve in the future. However, total compensation can be a little low depending on your experience and what market you're in so there's room to make it great."

- Supportive, fun colleagues
- Great compensation, tools, perks, and motivators 
- Fantastic internal mobility and transparent paths for career growth 
- Leadership genuinely cares about their people and their customers","Personally, I have no cons. I have worked with large corporations, start-ups, and in-between. With each move, I found my non-negotiables and GRIN has exceeded my expectations in every front. If you want to join a company that fosters you to grow into yourself, feel confident in your unique abilities, and help you leverage your skills, GRIN is where you want to be. We are a remote-first company, so if you are an extrovert who wants to be in-person, that might be tough. With that said, the company has invested so much time and effort into creating a remote culture that you won't miss it!"

4,GRIN,Bizarre culture,2022-03-17,2.0,Engineer,Great if you're young and you care about social media,"a bizarre culture mix with all the growing pains of a start up and all of the institutional red tape sludge of a mega corporation. They talk about how fast they're expanding (referred to as ""the rocket ship"") but they aren't aware that they're in a dying industry that is dependent on a company in a downward spiral (facebook)."

11,GRIN,"Great company, great people, great experience",2022-01-12,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Autonomy over your schedule, lots of independence in how work is done, the management team is next level amazing, team input is taken very seriously and implemented quickly, everyone is a genuine joy to interact with. Work-life balance is a REAL THING HERE. And it's awesome!!!","Very minimal, but the only things that come to mind are limited PTO balances & lack of diversity (but that is being actively worked on!). Only 16 days your first year, but it does grow over time."
12,GRIN,"GRIN Never Compromises on Culture, Ever!",2022-01-12,5.0,BDR,"""GRIN Never Compromises on Culture, Ever"" is a direct quota from GRIN's President Brian Mechem and it's a very true statement.

I've never worked for such an open, honest business. They're very transparent about their goals, and processes, and they care about their employees opinions and quality of life.","Since it's remote, it's sometimes difficult to communicate between teams, but that's something they're aware of and trying to fix.

Working remote also offers a good work life balance.","There are growing pains as a start-up company. There need to be more processes to follow. Many decisions made seem like they are on a case-by-case basis so it is hard to know what is the right or wrong thing to do. Sometimes, if you think you're doing the right thing, you could get feedback from leadership that you actually should have done something else.

The direction, productivity, and goals are very transparent and the employees are THE NICEST. Everyone is here for one goal and we hustle hard to make sure those goals are achieved. If you want to be in a fast-moving industry and love a busy work environment, apply!

-There is a high level of transparency between the leadership team and the rest of the company. Everyone knows what the company goals are, and there is a clear path as to how we can get there. 

-The software itself is innovative and interesting, and most importantly, it works. Influencer marketing is a great industry to be in!","There aren’t really any significant cons of working at GRIN. The company has been in a rapid growth phase, and because of that, there have been some growing pains, especially in a remote environment when it’s hard to meet and establish working relationships. However, if the company continues to ensure that the right people are in the right seats, then it makes communication and alignment less challenging."

Good company culture

Good work/life balance, rare for a tech start up
Collaboration is easy
Engineers have the flexibility to explore new technologies often and share them or set them up internally
We have an emphasis on education/growth and also attend conferences together (remotely for now but hopefully in person again soon!).
We have game nights often and try to keep social even working remotely
Overall there is a lot of transparency within the company
You get out what you put in...","Documentation can be lacking but they are actively trying to improve this
Some growing pains, but this is typical for a start up that is growing so quickly.
Sometimes too much emphasis on ""numbers"" and ""metrics"" which can be a stressor
Working remotely isn't for everyone. Those who are not active to reach out for help, or are not voicing their concerns can get left behind.
Benefits packages have improved but still could be better
Vacation days are limited to 15 but it is easy to use PTO, and we get separate sick leave. Would really like to have a few more holidays off company-wide."

The company isn't just lip service, they genuinely want to help brands create real and lasting relationships with the influencers on their team, even if that means telling companies they aren't yet ready for the product and helping them figure out solutions to get them to where they are. This kind of transparency and genuineness is so hard to find in a company from top to bottom. It is no surprise they rate 5-stars on Glassdoor!","I am new, but so far, I haven't found any."

In addition to my normal BDR tasks, I have been given the opportunity to help with recruiting and training new BDRs which has been such an amazing experience. I love that I am able to help in other areas of the company. There is also such a clear promotion path and a lot of transparency, which I have never experienced before. I have a lot of confidence in GRIN and I’m exciting to be a part of the success!","Only cons I can think of is a lower hourly rate than I would like and no 401K match but that’s usually just part of working for a startup.

44,GRIN,Culture is key!,2021-03-18,5.0,BDR,"Love the people. There is a clear desire from the top down to bring in people that fit in the company based on their values and cultural opinions vs. simply raw experience. That has lead to a quite diverse workforce despite being such a small company and a huge variety of thinkers. Upward mobility is celebrated and encouraged so if you want to be in a place that actively supports your desire to grow personally and professionally, GRIN is the place for you. The platform is quite interesting and has huge potential within the influencer marketing space (which is why that review below is a bit confusing).",Being paid hourly and having to clock in and out is a bit annoying but very minimal all things considered.

I feel absolutely equipped to perform with best in-class hardware and software set ups. 

The company culture is incredibly vibrant. Everybody is willing to help, and share what is working best for them. We are remote, so things can be tricky, but there has been no shortage of town halls, happy hours, and trivia nights. Incredibly exciting.

The company is also very structured, everything down to how a meeting is run, to everybody owning a number tied to their responsibilities, to the company vision for the future. I've never felt more part of a team in my job. GRIN is on a rocket ship, and I am excited to be part of it!","Remoteness can be tricky. We have a lot of collaboration built into our flow, and also readily available via chat. The trickiness comes, because you have to take the initiative to reach out when you have questions and not operate by yourself on an island, if you will."

Nobody, on their own, makes a great baguette their first try. GRIN has a core of experienced business professionals that bring years of insights to the workplace. This creates a wonderful environment for learning and growth. 

It still takes a lot of work to make a great loaf of bread, but it’s a lot easier to roll out some dough with a rolling pin than a wine bottle.

63,GRIN,Great Company,2020-06-12,5.0,Business Development Representative,"A growing company that is also a fun place to work. Even though we are fully remote now, you can still maintain a great relationship with your co-workers who are cool people.",Great benefits but unfortunately no 401k match
64,GRIN,Amazing place to work!,2020-06-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Team first mentality everyone is willing to help wherever they can. A fast-paced company that is always evolving and ahead of the curve. Leadership is very transparent and always ready to listen. Great product that is changing the game. GRIN truly values the employee's input and is always looking to improve. Not only is the employee's input heard, but so are the customers as GRIN is always listening and adapting to customer requests. Best company I have worked for.","I would say there are minimal cons. IF you are not ready to act fast and adapt this is not the company for you. Benefits have improved a lot, and only negative is that health benefits are expensive side for more than 1 individual."
65,GRIN,Awesome company culture and work environment,2020-06-09,5.0,Business Development Representative,"- Ample opportunities for promotions and upward mobility
- A leadership team that genuinely cares about their employees
- This organization takes the opportunity to listen to their employees and incorporate change as needed
- The work environment is head and shoulders above anything else I've been apart of
- The team is highly motivated and they push you to perform at your best
- They give you the tools/resources to be successful in whatever role you choose
- Great benefits
- Work from home","- It's a smaller startup so change is constant, but it keeps things fresh and interesting"
66,GRIN,The most fun I’ve had selling!,2020-05-28,5.0,Account Executive,"Product: It’s so rare in SaaS sales to offer a solution that is a must have and not a nice to have. GRIN is a solution that solves real business problems and challenges that come with running influencer marketing. I can’t tell you how fun it is to demonstrate GRIN to prospects. During call’s you get feedback like… “this is amazing”….. “I need this right now” …. “WOW!”…… “this would save me 6 hours a day”…. “I’m sold”…. “I’m so impressed”…. “you’ve checked all the boxes”….. etc. When it comes to our competition, we are hands down the leader in the space and this has been validated by our prospects/customers. Going to work every day knowing you’re the top vendor in the space and knowing the positive buyer feedback you will receive, makes GRIN the most fun I’ve ever had selling!

Quotas: Leadership want’s our sales reps to be successful. They have created very attainable quotas that all sales reps are crushing!

Company: Incredible leadership team, amazing culture, wonderful employees, top notch benefits, and game changing product.",Nothing I can think of.
67,GRIN,I have been working at GRIN more than a year (full time),2020-05-12,5.0,Senior Software Developer,"Very solid engineering team. 
Nice startup atmosphere but pretty good software development process the same time. 
Growing super fast.
Inspiring leadership.",Still some things to improve in terms of technical standpoint.
68,GRIN,The best place to work in Sacramento,2020-05-04,5.0,Technical Support Engineer,The culture at GRIN is amazing. It super collaborative space where everyone's ideas are heard in order to grow as an individual as well as a team.,I can honestly say the there is none.

70,GRIN,Love this company!,2020-05-04,5.0,Business Development Representative,"Culture, Transparency from the top-down, collaboration",I would say education about the software when first starting out
71,GRIN,Trust me - this is the best SaaS Startup in Sacramento,2020-04-27,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"Simply put, this is the best software startup I've worked with.   

Growing from several employees to 50+ in less than a year is exciting and not a common experience for a company based in Sacramento.

From a sales team perspective:
- Exciting and ever-evolving space to sell into.  I've never had a more fun demoing and selling B2B software than Grin.   I love talking to innovative marketing leaders, enterprising DTC eCommerce entrepreneurs, and brands that are focused on an exciting space in the marketing world.
- Top of the market product.   It's well built that you continually hear from prospects and customers how great the software is compared to the toughest competition.
- Positive sales team culture.  A great mix of different yet complementary personalities across all roles.  No boiler-room or toxic sales vibes.
- Full transparency.  The team moves fast and is open to making necessary adjustments if needed based on real data.
- Fearless feedback is encouraged. I've never felt more comfortable to ""keep it real"", ask hard questions, and even see the feedback you shared taken into action quickly if it made sense to.
- Everyone seems humble, authentic, and really are smart, good people.

From a personal perspective:
- The company's values match mine.  It's not half-baked values that they hang on the walls.  The executive team lives them, and for the most part, the entire company also does.
- You're working with a team of killers and hustlers.  This is a place you can build relationships and friendships with people who will do great stuff in the future.
- Career platform, not just a job.   Any position or role at this company has the potential to help you jump levels career-wise if you have the right mindset, drive, and grit.
- I trust the executive team.  This is rare compared to past startups I've worked with.  These are people you'd want to grab a beer or drink, actually hang out with.","Keeping it real, it is tough to think of some cons...

- No 401k matching.

- Compared to more established companies, Grin still lacks the infrastructure for legit annual performance reviews, formal internal processes for promotions, bonuses, and raises based on consistent quota attainment.   

- This company is not a fit for you if you do not have an appetite for being accountable to hit numbers while growing fast, personally and professionally, in a high-growth company."
72,GRIN,Receptive Leadership Team & Smart Colleagues,2020-05-05,4.0,Senior Product Manager,"* The leadership team here at GRIN are receptive to feedback and make employees feel heard.

* Clear company and cross functional team goals keep everyone focused on what they should be doing. 

* Fast paced, interesting, and challenging work in a fast growing industry. There are a lot of interesting problems to solve. 

* Smart and collaborative colleagues across the company inspire and help me grow in my position.","The cons that i've experienced are only related to the benefits offered by the company.

* Not enough PTO & Paid Sick Leave (3 days??), which is a detriment when competing with other tech companies for talent as most that i've seen offer unlimited PTO. Additionally, not enough sick leave means people come into the office sick [pre-covid19].

* If you have a spouse that you want to add to your health insurance, its extremely expensive. The company only covers a small % of health insurance. 

* No 401K matching"
73,GRIN,Wake up excited get things done with an exceptional team!,2020-04-22,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"Culture and team are excellent, have never had a team so committed to a common goal. There's a high level of accountability to get things done but the right managers are there to support you and there's lots more collaboration than you'd normally find in a similar environment. We celebrate the wins and learn (quickly) from our losses. Goals are achievable and we have all the resources and tools we need to make things happen. It helps that we're in an exciting space, this is a unique opportunity to speak to marketers from your favourite brands on a daily basis. I highly recommend GRIN to anyone who wants to wake up every morning excited to come into work to make stuff happen. Oh! and did I mention our awesome new office and fully stocked Redbull fridge?!?! Yup.",Not the best 401K benefits
74,GRIN,Best Company I've Ever Worked For,2020-04-20,5.0,BDR,"Great environment to learn and grow. 
Transparency is huge at GRIN and you're held accountable for your performance which is great for motivation and keeping you on track. 
Very much a team environment, even on the sales team which can get competitive at some companies. Here everyone shares ideas and helps each other to make sure we succeed as a team. 
They also don't hesitate to supply employees with tools they need to get the job done.
The leadership team is great and puts their employees before themselves(sounds crazy I know). 
Overall if you're a hard worker and want to advance in life, GRIN is the place to be.",It's honestly hard to think of any cons.
75,GRIN,Grow with GRIN!,2020-04-21,5.0,Market Development Representative,"I've had an absolutely amazing experience at GRIN! You can't beat the work environment. Everyone collaborates to reach goals, pushes one another and makes it a great place to work. I have to give a shout out to the leadership team for being flexible. They are constantly evaluating where we are at, adjusting targets to be realistic, while still giving us a challenge. If something isn't working, they are fast to recognize and make adjustments. Being in a hyper-growth startup, you expect growing pains. They go about fixing these pains the right way. The founders are super inspirational, relatable and humble. The leadership team is easy to approach and very empathetic. Leadership wants you to voice issues so they can be resolved in a timely manner. They all truly care and it shows. Overall, GRIN is doing things the right way and it is really cool to be apart of!","Being in a fast growth startup, there are going to be growing pains. But, as I said, the leadership team is quick to resolve these issues. Our benefits aren't anything special but we are currently working on revamping them. Overall, there aren't too many negatives about working at GRIN."
76,GRIN,Great coworkers and leadership,2020-03-05,5.0,Product Designer,"I’ve been with GRIN for 4 months and truly love working here. There is so much talent on this team and you can tell that everyone is passionate about what they do. Leadership is great - they are very invested in employee growth and growing as a team in general. They are willing to spend time and money on team building, education (if you find & ask for it), and they actually listen to employee feedback/suggestions. Processes are still being formed and things can be messy at times, but this team is well equipped to learn fast from it.

I’ve seen some of my colleagues working odd hours due to the nature of their roles but I personally feel that I have great work-life balance here (I am on the Product team). That doesn’t mean that there isn’t a ton of work to do, there definitely is. The team is growing fast and keeping up with a changing market, but that’s part of why I love this job. You’ll never feel bored here, and everything you do will have great impact on customers. 

Also, we also just moved to a cool new office! There’s tons of open and private spaces to work in, which is nice when you need a little change in your workday. 

I highly recommend this company to anyone who’s looking to work in a fun and fast paced environment while solving interesting problems with a fantastic team.","The overall benefits package isn’t very competitive. Pays well but very standard/minimum holidays, no 401k matching or fancy unlimited PTO."

79,GRIN,"Growing fast, with some bumps along the way.",2020-02-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This company is fantastic.  I can say that the leadership really is trying to do the right thing by the company, the customers, and the employees.  In my career I have worked for many teams and the humility that the Grin team exhibits is a breath of fresh air.

From a company fundamentals perspective Grin is profitable, growing, and securing venture capital.

On the culture front, it is spot on.  People want to do the right thing and work together to make it happen.  There is a bias to action which I really appreciate.

It is my belief that Grin has the ingredients to skyrocket into a global organization headquartered in Sacramento.  What a unique opportunity!","It is a startup, with this there are some cons primarily around growing pains.  Improvement seems to be a high priority of leadership so as new things are fixed new issues may arise.

This seems fairly typical of a team that is growing at the rate Grin is and nothing that is outside of my expectations."

81,GRIN,"Awesome people, company, product, and future",2020-02-17,5.0,Software QA Engineer,"I’ve been with Grin now for just over 3 months. So far, this is been the best company I’ve worked for— ever. I really appreciate that Grin is selective when it comes to management and company directors, which means we have a handful of leaders in the company who do a great job planning for the future of the company, and pay attention to helping foster employee growth along the way. They offer so much when it comes to personal and professional development for their employees, if you seek it. Everyone is really open to new ideas from anyone, and there’s a lot of freedom to do your job while also growing in other areas outside your direct expertise. I also love that everyone across departments really encourages and supports each other when we’re together.","As the company grows rapidly, it’s hard to keep track of all the new employees across departments. This is a good and bad problem to have, as I know it’s proof of success in the company as so many people join, but it also reduces the family feel in the company."
82,GRIN,"Great People, Great Company",2020-02-21,4.0,Customer Success Engineer,"Amazing team at every level. Great impression of leadership in the interview process is what sold me on the job, and 4 months in I am still impressed.","Still a very small company and growing exponentially, which can be painful but leadership is doing a good job of adjusting with the quick growth."

85,GRIN,Amazing work environment!,2019-09-13,5.0,Customer Marketing Manager,"- Positive work environment.
- Exciting growth opportunities.
- Never boring.
Those are just the bullet points. I can't say enough about how much I enjoy coming to work. Every person is supportive regardless of the position. Management and the team as a whole exemplify integrity and a take-action attitude that infectious. Because the company is young, there is still a lot of work to be done, but I see that as a positive. There is never a boring day!","It can be a grind. But that being said, the person who is successful at GRIN has a personality that has a strong work ethic and wants to be part of something great, that will not be seen as a con."
86,GRIN,One of a kind opportunity in Sacramento,2019-09-12,5.0,Anonymous,"The people and the big picture.  I've had many different opportunities with different perks, cultures and promises, but happiness and fulfillment always bubble down to who you work with and a mission you can get behind/feel part of.  Everything else is supplementary.

The leadership team is passionate and inspiring.  This is the culmination of their lifes work to this point and it's obvious they're all in to make something special.  Sit down with the 2 founders and you'll want to be part of what they're creating.  They're young and vibrant, open to new ideas and thoughts, but strike a healthy balance of high execution and performance from the team.  In my experience it's rare to find Executive Leadership so relatable and empathetic.

The culture is actually what every tech company advertises it has.  Collaboration, empathy, fun passionate people, and most importantly a group of people that believe in the higher mission above their own immediate gain.   That being said, there are plenty of opportunities for career growth and we've grown from 15 to 35 people in the last 9 months and much more growth is on the horizon.

It's also very fun and rewarding to work in the influencer marketing industry.  Our customers are young forward-thinking marketing professionals at companies pushing the envelope.  For the sales team, it's pretty fun to see reps prospecting into  brands they've actually bought from and love on a personal level.  It makes it easier to buy into what GRIN is selling.","Struggling to think of something.  Like others have said, the bar here is set very high and there's nowhere to hide.  This provides an opportunity to shine and get noticed, but you also have to talk about your struggles when they happen.  Leadership and management expect certain levels of performance and accountability is high.  But them, along with the team around you genuinely want to help each other get better and improve every day."
87,GRIN,Fulfilling work and Smart Engineers,2019-09-13,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,It is a young company with a young product so there is minimal legacy code. Your days are largely working on new things which is always more fun.,"It is a startup, so you often have to grind to get things done."
88,GRIN,Best Choice For A Job,2019-08-15,5.0,Senior Business Development Representative,"There are a lot of pros to this Job.

 First, you get to work closely with management. In most cases, working closely with your boss means a stressful environment and culture. That's not the case at GRIN. The management here works closely with you to help you improve, to craft you, and make you better. It also means that your success depends on your accountability. When all the possible resources are at your fingertips, you have no excuses.

The intermingling of Influencer marketing and SaaS is unique. To be honest, it's awesome.  We get to meet with so many awesome people, speak to executives from our favorite brands and get an inside glimpse to the coolest space in the world. 

The biggest pro is the community. I can walk into my CEO's office and BS with him about his time at Redbull, or meet up with my CRO for a drink after work. We have get-togethers and parties to celebrate out wins, small or big. I have a person to my right or left who will offer advice, a Sales Manager who will sit down and write emails with me, and an encouraging team that provides motivation and support when a month does not go my way. I don't think there is a better place to work if you put in the effort, like to go big, and are accountable to your actions.","Like others have said, ""Its a start-up."" We're growing fast and the goals are high. It can be stressful, long days, but the community is here to build you up. It levels out pretty well."
89,GRIN,Great company to work for in Sacramento,2019-08-13,5.0,Vice President,Fast moving startup in an amazing space and will emerge as one of the winners.,Sacramento is not a highly happening city but good for people with family and looking for buying houses
