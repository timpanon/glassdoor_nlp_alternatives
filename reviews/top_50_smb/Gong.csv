0,Gong,Incredible Start-up!,2022-03-29,5.0,Strategic Account Executive,"Balance: They want us to find a balance between life & work
Product: Continual innovation to support increased sales
People: I really do appreciate and like the teams I work with
Customers: Get a ton of value out of the partnerships with Gong",Very busy but productivity is high and we plenty support systems in place to assist when we need.
1,Gong,"Over hiring is an understatement, run from this one like a üè°   on üî•",2022-03-31,2.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"Talented coworkers and disruptive challenger brand
Strong roster of existing install customers in the technology vertical","Gong has massively overhired in Enterprise and Strategic accounts in an effort to grow top-line revenue and meet ever-expanding board pressure to grow into an astronomical valuation. 

The only reps who are ""succeeding"" have been working on the same accounts and deals for YEARS and instead of recognizing this, Gong continues to change processes frequently, cut territories smaller, raise quotas, and hire more reps. 

Many hires over the last 12 months have yet to close a single new business deal and in the Enterprise business, you have to pass your customers off after landing an initial footprint, leaving the growth and success to a customer account team. 

Outside of multiyear cycles coming in, nobody is hitting plan. Morale is incredibly low and many peers have left or are planning to leave for greener pastures.

We are constantly subjected to new training and processes and measured to complete learning paths in Lessonly as if we are first-time reps versus seasoned sellers.

To round everything out, there has been increased competition in the category from former partners and customers alike and many are giving away extended trials or free offering of their product alongside renewals.

Icing on the cake: We have unlimited time off but nobody takes any time because the goals are so insane and all activity is monitored closely. We also do not have a company match on 401k."
2,Gong,LOVE this company so much,2022-01-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've worked at a few tech companies and Gong's culture is by far the best. Feels like a startup but operates like a large, established company in a lot of regards (there's still a lot of room for improvement but it feels like they know where they're going and how to get there). 

They've put INCREDIBLE leaders in place. People who really care about you, the company, and ""enjoying the ride"". The leader for my team in particular is the best I've ever worked for. I've never felt so respected, supported, and appreciated in my entire career. He's the type of person that actually makes me want to be better every day and goes out of his way to make sure his whole team is heard. Honestly, he just has class - like so many of the people I work with at Gong. 

The workload is reasonable but I'm still early on in my time at Gong, however, I don't feel incredibly stressed out or that anyone has asked too much of me. 

I feel lucky every. single. day. that I work for this amazing company and with such intelligent and kind humans. Can't believe how much working here has changed my life for the better and I'm 100% remote!","Not many that I've seen so far. Like I stated above, there's always room for improvement. Things aren't as ""polished"" as most established companies but it also kind of adds to the culture, so I don't think it's a bad thing at all."
3,Gong,Blown away by this place and the people,2022-01-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I can't say enough good things about working at Gong, but I will try to name a few specific ones.

1. Leadership is incredibly transparent, down-to-earth, and encouraging. There's absolutely no micromanaging here ‚Äî just trust and support to do our jobs. 
2. Cross-collaborating has never been easier than it is here. Everyone is so willing to help, whether it's joining a brainstorming session or taking on a part of a larger initiative. I truly feel like there's no project I can't accomplish because I have the help of every single person at this organization. 
3. I feel so set up for success in my career. I have an incredibly clear picture of my 1, 3, and 5-year career path at Gong.
4. The people! Incredible. So smart, creative, and quick. I feel like I can bring my true, full self to work here and I am embraced for what makes me me.","Things move fast here and you will find yourself busy every single day! I personally feel energized by this, but if you're looking for a job where you can coast, that job is probably not at Gong. Not necessarily a con, just something to be aware of."
4,Gong,Great Company and Lots of Opportunity!,2022-03-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Trajectory of the Company, grounded and experienced leadership, ability to have a real impact on the Company's success, really good people, great product","Given stage of the Company and high growth, longer hours and some time zone challenges depending on the team"
5,Gong,Best job I ever had!,2022-02-16,5.0,Director of Strategic Partnerships,"I lived an interesting life and I felt like have seen some things (for context, have spent 14 years at Google prior to coming to Gong). And yet, Gong exceeded my every expectation on every level: from colleagues to leadership to product to culture to opportunity. Kindest people ever, who are incredibly amazing at their jobs building an incredible product that customers adore inside of an unbelievably accepting and supportive culture. And I really think it comes down to leadership - I have absolute unshakable confidence in our executive team. They are incredible humans, always willing to help. This is the best job I have ever had in my entire life. So lucky and grateful to have a meaningful job and work with absolute rockstars! Come, join us!",None. Zero. Zilch. Nil. Nada.

This company will take your CSM game to a level you may not have thought possible. Hands down Gong is the best company I've ever worked for. And likely will be the best place I'll ever work in my career.","Nothing, not one little con, nada."

The product is way more valuable than just call recording. The people are friendly, smart, hard working & down to earth. I have been impressed with the leadership decisions from a strategic business sense to being more inclusive and promoting diversification. Come join us .You will love it here!","We are moving fast which is a good thing, but you have to like working in that type of environment. Things will change month to month or even week to week. It will change for the better, but change can still be hard. Also, with moving this fast means things are not fully built out and we are building as we go."

17,Gong,"Great People, Fantastic Product, So Happy to be Here!",2021-12-06,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"Gong's leadership team is comprised of seasoned SaaS leaders that understand the market Gong is creating, however more importantly, they have a deep compassion for people. Every Director, VP, & Exec that I've met in my short time here has expressed a genuine passion for understanding employees needs and making sure they are feel well supported in Gong's company culture.","I cant think of too many downsides of Gong. If I were to mention one, it would be that AE's can't currently hold their initial ""land"" deals and continue working the expansion. After the deal closes, it gets transitioned to the Account Management team."

- Company is going through explosive growth - it's a fun time to be a part of a winning organization. 
- Company Operating principles are a true snapshot of what the culture is like here. 
- Really great people to learn from and grow with. 
- Company places a strong emphasis on coaching, internal growth, and professional development opportunities.
- Does a great job keeping everyone connected in a remote environment - lots of transparency!
- The list goes on - see for yourself! ;)","- not all positions/teams are able to be fully remote as of yet, but many are. I suggest opening this up for all roles!"
20,Gong,Amazing Job,2021-12-12,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"- Working at Gong is the perfect place to jump start your career. In my opinion its like working at google or Facebook in the early days. If you work here, you will beable to land any company after you leave. (just done quit before a year lol)
- They pay good, Its not going to break the bank, but very good. They also give you Options, which is a huge plus.","You can't negotiate on any sort of pay, you have to take what they give you when it comes to being an SDR."
21,Gong,Great Product doesn‚Äôt make up for lack of accountability for toxic leadership,2021-11-12,3.0,Sales Development,"The product is really helpful for getting up to speed, sharing out helpful tactics to peers and for getting feedback on call performance.

Majority of people on front lines and front line management are open to helping out and supporting people.","No work life balance. 
Constatant changes with little to no support on how to manage through it.
A lot of finger pointing and shaming and not a lot of coaching.

When feedback is given or even asked for, nothing happens. 

Leadership only reacts when people threaten to leave or walk out the door. 

Overall an unhealthy org."

Leadership at the top is amazing , and they truly make you believe in their vision.","Not the best place for development. A ton of development has to come on your own time (listening to aging calls) however because of the constant pressure and difficulties to hit quota. Very hard to self develop and lots of reps go stagnant and get burnt out. More metrics was always the answer to low attainment , never improve conversion."
24,Gong,Loving it,2022-01-26,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),Gong is seriously an awesome company. Talent is top notch. Product is top notch. Process and leadership is top notch.,None at the moment. Have to work hard

26,Gong,Go work at Gong :),2021-10-21,4.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),Great place to learn sales! Committed team and wonderful culture. Truly amazing product that is cutting edge and the future of sales. I am beyond proud to have worked at Gong and would certainly work there again. I was let go for missing my sales quota FYI. No hard feelings. Gong is a great place to work yet it is certainly a startup still.,"A young culture. Very youthful and rather white. As a white person I did fit in... but despite the efforts to build out diversity and inclusion and the hiring of many managers who were people of color, the staff on the whole was still pretty similar looking (white). Also, the super youthful culture was tolerated by me yet it was also not very supportive of older reps who didn't want to have to say ""Let's Go"" and ""lit"" all the time. You didn't get pushed out if you didn't participate in this... but you didn't really bond as well."
27,Gong,Great culture & best onboarding experience I've ever had,2021-12-06,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"- Really embedded the operating principles (core values) into daily work life/culture.

30,Gong,Great Recruiting Experience,2021-11-01,5.0,Senior Sales Enablement Manager,"I have been recently hired at Gong and I'd like to share how pleased I am with the entire recruiting process and have asked him to share with me your information so that I could personally reach out to you all. 

The recruiting team  are a wonderful embodiment of Gong's Operating Principle of Win as a Team. Throughout the process I felt I had an ally and partner in my interview journey. Two things come to mind about how my recruiter (Austin) and his team showed up to enhance my experience and deserve to be praised. 

1. Professional - They professional in every sense of the word. Whether sharing with me the necessary resources to support my interviews, responding to my texts/emails in a timely manner, or sending me an encouraging message prior to a scheduled meeting, they did it all with a great attitude and professionalism.

I particularly remember my recruiter would routinely share with me what I could expect to see happen in the next phase of the interview process. Prior to my meetings I would be given the specifics of who I would be speaking with, sent reminder texts and emails to confirm I had all the Zoom meeting details and would immediately be followed up with me upon the completion of the interview with advice on what was likely to happen next. Additionally, he/they would sprinkle text check-ins in the gaps between interviews to just see how I was doing and if I had any questions that needed answering.

2. Supportive - As I mentioned above, my recruiting team was very supportive of me and my experience throughout the entirety of my interview loop. Support comes in many forms, and it was provided  in attentiveness to my needs, flexibility with my scheduling difficulties, encouragement of my learning process and understanding of Gong as well as responsiveness to challenging situations.

During my panel interview, we had a technical challenge with accessing the Zoom site, my recruiter spent the preceding minutes working to reschedule our call with the appropriate team members and as a result we were able to start our call on time. His (and the teams) support was extremely appreciated.

I believe in letting people know when they are doing things right. Well, this team and my recruiter did a lot right.",Not one thing to change.
31,Gong,I love it here.,2022-01-18,4.0,Sales Development Representative,"The culture is awesome, the benefits are great (needs very few tweaks, but they‚Äôre constantly adding more and more), and leadership is amazing.",The ONLY con (and the reason I gave the company 4 stars) is that they need more BIPOC individuals in leadership roles (directors and higher).
32,Gong,Strong Product Market Fit + Great Place to Grow Career,2021-10-19,5.0,Strategy and Business Operations Manager,"Gong‚Äôs product is capturing market share like crazy with incredible leadership building runway to support continued hyper growth Y/Y.

Culture is great too!  A high mix of top performers with no ego involved.  Very refreshing from companies I‚Äôve worked for in the past.

If you‚Äôre lucky enough to get an offer from Gong I‚Äôd highly recommend taking it.  Big things to come!",Creative problem solvers excel here.  If you‚Äôre looking for a basic job with no ambiguity then Gong is likely not the best fit.
33,Gong,Love being part of Gong,2021-12-31,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Everyone is encouraging and smart!
Fast-growth with the best talent
Excited to be part of this rocket ship",Nothing that I can think of
34,Gong,Can‚Äôt recommend Gong enough,2021-06-14,5.0,Account Executive,"I‚Äôve been absolutely blown away since joining Gong just a few months ago.

- People are A+++. The type of person I‚Äôve met at gong is that person who is hungry for the opportunity and is constantly learning. Managers are awesome - I‚Äôve never gotten so much great feedback, coaching, and support. My peers are incredibly accomplished, helpful, and cool too. 

- Product/vision. I‚Äôll never sell anywhere that doesn‚Äôt have Gong. It‚Äôs an absolute game changer in sales and has already made me a much stronger seller since joining only a few months ago. Product is a blast to sell. There a lot of unique qualities of selling to sales leaders that makes the job fun.","Managers are busy so you have to be resourceful. Thankfully everything is meticulously documented in our LMS, your peers are helpful, and you have gong‚Ä¶

Pay low IMO compared to other Bay Area salaries. But I‚Äôm optimistic that the scale will top in the opposite direction through commission and equity (I‚Äôm seeing my peers crush their numbers and the valuations just keep going up‚Ä¶)"

40,Gong,The place to be!,2021-07-15,5.0,Consultant,"Don‚Äôt know where to begin, but a disclaimer that I am still fairly new to the company. I love helping customers achieve success with a product that I actually use every single day. The cross-functional collaboration (even in a remote environment) is phenomenal. I truly feel like everyone wants to work together as a unit, and it shows with our customers. This is also the most diverse company I‚Äôve worked at, and it‚Äôs nice to be somewhere that actually implements a legit plan to be more diverse in work force versus just saying it. Leadership from the C-Suite to frontline is so supportive and sharp. My career aspirations are celebrated and respected.","As they say, we are building the plane while the plane is also taking off very quickly.

- The training and coaching you get is world-class. It'll stretch you to grow and become a better at sales.
- The pay is pretty good, lots of nice perks and benefits of a well-funded company
- They actually pull off the remote work situation really well
- Likely to IPO soon","- It's in hyper-scale phase right now, so they're hiring tons of sales people, increasing quotas, and dividing the territories smaller. You have to work harder... AND smarter, if you want to keep up.
- Most software companies(the best fit) either bought Gong, or have been heavily prospected by reps in the past. You'll have to penetrate new industries, a lot of which are resistant about call recording and slow to adopt new tech.
- Outreach is the slowest and most inefficient Sales Engagement platform of all time."

45,Gong,The Bridgerton of Gong,2021-10-26,1.0,Engineer,"The people
The product
And, well that is it!","Where shall I start.....

The C-Level executive team at Gong is involved in the littlest things to which they should not be involved in. They do not give senior management the free reign to do their jobs or make their own decisions.

The interview processs at Gong is longer than infinity! Candidates endure 7 interviews and meet with one c-level exec and a bar raiser interviewer or two c-level executives.....very uneccessary. Be expected to jump through fire for a mediocre company. From the outside Gong is desireable but once you're in you realize it's a mess. AE's and SDR's have aggressive targets and they won't think twice to put people on PIP's for missing just one quarter.

Compensation is very low and so are annual merit increases. They claim to pride themselves on pay parity, but this is not the case. HR needs to do a better job of leveling employees salaries correctly so that everyone is being paid fairly. Currently there is no path or upper mobility program at Gong for employees which is alarming for a company of this size. HR - step it up because you are lagging behind other startups with terrible benefits, terrible compensation, and terrible equity.

When it comes to Diversity and Inclusion Gong is not doing their part to retain under represented employees. There has been a flux of diverse employees leaving the business. Just because you have ERG's doesn't mean you are doing your part, it's more than that. FYI...everyone has ERG's, so what are you doing so different? NOTHING!"
46,Gong,Sales,2021-11-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Most incredible culture I have ever worked for,N/A - I love this company so much

- Amazing benefits (2 days off at the beginning of each quarter, and unlimited vaca which is sometimes hard to find in CS), super fun team + ERG events
- The product speaks for itself- customers love you 
- Gong is growing FAST - tons of room for growth and opportunity
- Everyone (managers included) embraces feedback, vulnerability, and becoming better and always growing. (Huge growth mindset culture)
- We're encouraged to always step outside of our comfort zone and think about if the processes we have are best serving our customers","-Don't feel as connected as I could to team members because I onboarded remotely, but that's not really Gong's fault"

49,Gong,Rocketship that cares about employees,2020-09-23,5.0,Anonymous,"I feel very fortunate that I was able to land a job at Gong. While it's a startup, it feels a bit more mature in the sense that the leadership team is seasoned, there is direction at the company, and the recruiting & onboarding process were top-notch. That being said, it is a startup so there is always a laundry list of things to do. I've been very impressed so far with the caliber of people they've hired which is extremely important to me in a company. I also highly believe in the product we're selling and think the possibilities are endless for the future of the company.

With COVID they've set up virtual events to keep people engaged (workouts, bingo night, cooking classes, etc), and they have also blocked off at least 2 days at the start of every quarter for people to take off to encourage employees to recharge.

Overall I'm very happy to be here and can't wait for what's in store for this company!","- High turnover on the sales team
- Hard to stay connected to the company with the remote work environment, but that would be the case anywhere right now
- While they give employees a couple days off at the start of every quarter to ""recharge"", other than that is doesn't feel like people are taking PTO. Could just be due to COVID (where are people going to travel to right now?), but it still sets a specific tone whether its intentional or not"
50,Gong,"Building it mid flight,  a few bolts are making noise",2021-06-16,4.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Great product! It is NOT just call transcription, it is so much more. There is a real need in the market and there is real interest in the product. We have great tools to use for our job, collaborative peers in the SDR org, excellent marketing support, and people who work really hard. I really do love working here, my team is great and the pros outweigh the cons. But the cons are important to note!","Because Gong is growing, the growing pains are real. High turnover in the SDR org these days. Most SDRs think or feel, It is because of the path to promotion, and the high bars that have been set, for some segments, these are a tall order when we have run out of SaaS companies to sell to and are looking at new industries that are new to this type of tech. I need to work 9-10 hours and make as many phone calls as humanly possible to hit quota and then the only way to promote out is to do it 15 months in a row at 100% nothing less or you are in the seat for an extra month. I would say if you can't commit to making 60-70 phone calls a day every day for 15 months, this is not the job for you.
Lots of chatter around folks being required to move to a new city if they want to be an AE who have been working here in the beginning and middle of COIVD. Which I don't think is fair given we market our product as a ""THE #1 PLATFORM FOR REMOTE SALES TEAMS"""

Rocketship
Great onboarding, very thorough

They really follow the operating principles that they post on the website","They are growing really fast, which means a lot of learnings can be missed and sometimes lofty goals come off as being set for no reason. Raising quota in Q1 (a historically slow quarter) and then cutting books in half in order to accomodate new hires drastically impacted quota attainment especially for the Commercial and Mid-Market segments

They also don't track how long reps work, so when they raise quota or change account books, its short sighted and doesn't take into consideration how many hours reps work just to hit 100%"
58,Gong,Stressful Rocketship,2021-07-16,5.0,Mid Market Account Executive,"The company is really well structured, every department has best in class people doing amazing things.",Very stressful. Even the reps that were hitting/exceeding quota were stressed.

64,Gong,"Rocketship ""growing pains"" at the expense of SDRs",2021-04-06,2.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Great best-in-class product

Diversity is actually valued (almost all SDR leadership are women and/or POC)

Seasoned leadership that has been around the block and know how to run a company efficiently 

Genuinely great people to work with

There are many career paths available at this point in the company, with some caveats

Minus the current growing pains (detailed below), the company is poised to become a big player","There are a lot of conflicting attitudes within the SDR org. Leadership say one thing but their actions say another. 

Gong prides themselves in having the best-in-class SDRs. The extensive interview process for an entry level role proves this. Because of this, Gong expectations are high for SDRs; everyone is expected to at minimum hit 100% or higher. 

However with quotas raised in order to hit company rocketship $$$ goals, SDRs have not been set up for success. When the books/leads are of poor quality & poor volume and a significant chunk of the org is no longer hitting quota, SDR morale takes a hit. 

Activity is up, outreach is still famously creative, and reps are doing everything they can to the best of their abilities. Morale is low because we've moved from everyone crushing to reps scraping by to hit their numbers or not hit at all. When not hitting quota affects your career path/length, it makes it that much worse. 

Again, SDRs are hired at Gong because we are best in class. At some point leadership needs to reflect on if people aren't succeeding because either Gong no longer is hiring the best reps, or if because expectations are misaligned. Hopefully the answer is clear."
65,Gong,"Seasoned and effective leadership + sharp, motivated people",2020-08-28,5.0,Marketing,"Gong has continually exceeded my expectations in every aspect - leadership, commitment to diversity, balancing agility/GST and setting the business and employees up for long-term success.

I'll break down a few highlights that really stand out:

Leadership: I can't say enough how good it feels to have seasoned, thoughtful leadership across the board. Amit and the whole executive team know what they are doing and it's visible in every decision that they make. But they're also endlessly humble, responsible, authentic, and the absolute best cheerleaders. You'll regularly see the C-Suite calling out employees in Slack for the great work that they do.

People programs: Since going remote, Gabby and the team have gone above and beyond to deliver a wide variety of awesome and engagement programs. Zoom workout classes with trainers? We got that. Coloring class for your kids? Got that too. Meditation? Cooking classes? Game nights? All of the above.

Commitment to diversity: Gong's BLM response was real and action-driven. As a new employee, I didn't know what to expect. But I was surprised when the company held a company-wide open mic essentially where anyone and everyone could share ideas for how Gong can bring more diversity to our own business and give back to our community. Then, they acted on it. Nearly all of the initiatives we set out to do are in progress - changing hiring practices and building a diverse candidate pipeline, building out ERGs, offering services and products to organizations we believe in. It comes from the top, but it also comes from everywhere. Employees individually stepped up to do the work which tells you a lot about culture.

People: My team members at Gong are some of the most creative and hard-working individuals I've ever had the pleasure of working with. If you see Gong everywhere on LinkedIn, it's because...the SDRs are literally getting public shout-outs from their prospects for creative/compelling messaging. THAT IS NOT NORMAL. You see folks from every team writing blogs, speaking on podcasts. Gongsters are truly the best in their field and it is inspiring to work alongside them.","Work/life balance, which is to be expected at a startup. Tough in an all-remote environment. But they're doing everything they can to combat Zoom fatigue and keep people energized.

Expectations are really high. Some might see that as a con, I see it as a pro though. People around you are always delivering."

First and foremost, their leadership team is the strongest I've seen in my 12 year career. The C level leaders are seasoned professionals who have been part of some very successful companies and they are very intentional about the culture and lead with a people first approach. I've seen them through challenging times (COVID19) and they should write the book on how to lead through a pandemic. They were quick to act, ensure people's health is priority # 1, gave a work from home stipend to buy a monitor or desk to WFH more comfortably, hosted community events like yoga, meditation, happy hour, bingo, cooking classes etc. Oh, and the business is still rocking because it helps sales teams operate remotely and sales leaders have visibility into their sales pipeline.

Also, I really loved my direct Manager, and everyone on my team was extremely hard-working & fun!","Gong stopped caring about the people at the bottom of the totem pole. It used to be a fun place to work, you felt supported, etc. Now, morale is in the gutter, people aren't happy, and everyone feels underappreciated. In addition to the restructuring of a few orgs, the vast majority of reps aren't able to hit quota, which affects not only income, but also their career paths. It's such a long and unforgiving path to move from SDR up to AE; it would be easier to quit the company & reapply as an AE than it would be to work toward an internal promotion. I also found it strange that leadership acknowledged that the majority of the company feels there is not a good work/life balance, but then increased our quotas."

Gong is truly a special place. 

The leadership is incredible, the product is disruptive and impactful, and the colleagues you work with are world-class. 

Leadership is constantly reaffirming how much they care about us and our development through things like: 

Engagement surveys
Walk and talks 
Leadership 'ask us anything' Lunch and Learn
Dinner invitations with the CEO
Renting out the SF Zoo for our Xmas party
President's Club for the entire company (not just sales roles)
GTM Kick-off in Carmel for 3 days
Educational stipend
Camp Gong (all the new hires go on a day trip together to bond)
An incredible onboarding program
Company shut down the 1st week of January to be with our family/reset
 Employee Resource Groups

The product is amazing, most of the sales team used the tool at a previous company. They have built an awesome team with a great culture of celebrating. The company does invest a lot in its employees with training which is awesome.","A little too much rule by fear in sales management. They tell most new reps that they are ""worried about them"" to get people to work harder. There was a lot of guilt-tripping people about taking vacations at the end of the year, even though our CRO took a vacation at the end of a quarter. I have seen more SDR's move to other departments than getting promoted to AE which seems odd as well. Also, too many shout outs for people staying at the office until seven working, just seems unhealthy."
90,Gong,Never feels like a day of work!,2019-12-16,5.0,Recruiter,"I joined Gong in September and it has been the most incredible 3 1/2 months so far. I have never felt so motivated, supported, and truly excited to come to work every day. 

Our leadership is next level. I mean, what CEO goes on 45-minute walk & talks with everyone in the company and takes 6-7 people to dinner each week just to get to know each other better?! On top of that, the entire exec team makes it a point to be accessible/approachable in the office every day. 

My interview process here was such an amazing experience. Eric Lindroos was my recruiter and the first question he asked me was, ""what would never feel like a day of work to you?"" I knew right then that this was a company that really cared about ME and my passions.

Safe to say, it hasn't felt like a day of work yet.","The start-up lifestyle isn't for everyone. It's definitely a grind and can be crazy at times, but you definitely won't be bored! :)"

- Great product that evolves incredibly fast; constant feedback taken from ourselves and our customers. I myself even throw out ideas and our CTO himself + product teams will always respond and chat with me about where on the roadmap this will be, why I suggested something, etc. Super cool to have a voice/see everyone else's and not just be shouting into a void.  
- Our leadership, specifically CEO/Amit is constantly trying to get to know employees on a personal level. Offering 45 min walk-n-talks, taking  5-7 people from different teams to dinner, etc. 
- People are recognized for their contributions and impact the impact they make in & outside of their job functions. Win-as-a-team mindset is so huge and you'll have Marketing leverage ideas from all teams for campaigns, conferences, etc. You can always contribute to other projects outside of your main function. 
- Management & Leadership welcome all/any form of feedback, create a safe place to be raw/up-front. Everyone owns up to their own opportunities/areas for growth. 
- Personal mindset/wellness is valued and are always encouraged to take the measures necessary to get our minds right. 
- Since day one I have felt this is a place I am excited & look forward to being at for the long haul!","- surprise surprise.... GROWING PAINS! As with a lot of fast growing startups, things change a lot to meet our targets. Being in the Sales Dev Org (one of the fastest growing teams/supporting pipeline), often seems like we feel it the most. When changes to quota, verticals, process, etc are made would like more understanding into the thought process, insights, etc. that support. 
- Haven't been able to find/hire managers as fast as we are hiring reps. Great that everyone is super helpful with lending a hand to new hires/sharing best practices - but leaders are spread thin & can't always give the attention/support necessary. 
- Don't have a gym membership/benefit anymore. When it comes to free lunch every day & all the perks, this is one of the benefits I was most excited about & now it's gone. 
-  Movement/promotion from the SDR org into other departments (outside of sales) is still very unclear and waiting on more teams to have headcount for more entry-level roles."

120,Gong,Elite Caliber at Every Level!,2018-10-24,5.0,,"Every team is brimming with ELITE talent unlike any other company I‚Äôve ever worked for.  This is our competitive advantage and the reason why we‚Äôre obliterating our competition, despite coming to market after them.  Our execution across ALL TEAMS at ALL LEVELS is truly special, creating to a top notch product, sales and customer experience. The company is operationally mature for its age - we had a COO before employee 25 - and it‚Äôs paying dividends as we scale.  To top it off our CEO is a masterful operator who has focused on the right things from day one, and our CTO is nothing short of a genius.

Everyone loves our product and it‚Äôs the most fun thing I‚Äôve ever sold.  Compensation and benefits are great, although comp plans and quotas are ever evolving as business metrics accelerate.","We need to be sure we celebrate wins and achievements in a meaningful way.  While we‚Äôre consistently overachieving, the emphasis on ‚Äúsuper stretch‚Äù goals can be a little off-putting for some individual contributors.  Personally I‚Äòm okay with it, but I‚Äôm also cognizant that‚Äôs not the case across all teams or personality types.

That said I do believe we‚Äôre improving here and recognize we‚Äôve recently hired for roles that will help this, but we can still do better and need to make this a priority."
121,Gong,So glad that I joined this company!,2019-03-12,5.0,Account Executive,"I have only been working at Gong for a little over a month, so you're getting a fresh perspective! There is a lot that is great about this company: 

-The product itself is incredible. It's fun to sell something that people actually want!
-The culture. It's a great mix of ""start up"" fun with a strong business background. I've worked at a start up before where the leadership wasn't strong, and the culture was fun but toxic. Gong knows how to have fun, but do it in a responsible way. As an example, my first couple days at the company included wine tasting in Sonoma and racing cars mixed in with celebrating the strong performance of 2018 and setting goals for the year ahead.
-The people! I've quickly realized they hire the best of the best. I'm already learning so much from my colleagues and know they'll push me to be better as an individual contributer and employee
-The leadership. The leadership team have all been leaders at large, established companies and have extremely strong business acumen. They're also extremely accessible and open to suggestions and feedback. 
-They aren't afraid to invest in and celebrate their employees. Case in point: there are billboards all around San Francisco right now of our top performers :)
-Dogs in the office (big perk in my eyes!) 
-Lunch every day 
-Joining a rocket ship. The growth that this company has had is INCREDIBLE. It's a really fun ride to be a part of",I've only been here about a month and have yet to find one!
122,Gong,Gong Creates Raving Fans of Its Employees,2019-03-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The number one operating principle of the business is to create raving fans. It's typical to see start ups want to be customer obsessed (and believe me, Gong is really customer obsessed), but the idea of ""create raving fans"" also extends out to employees.

Team members are highlighted here, thanked and rewarded in all the best ways. From having our ""employee of the year"" winners put up on billboards around SF to taking the team to a beautiful team kickoff in Sonoma for crushing the sales target and more.

The culture here is top notch. Couple that with incredible market traction (#1 in the category and continuing to grow), tons of happy customers (NPS usually hovers in the mid-70s and Gong has the most reviews on G2 Crowd by a long shot) and smart funding that will help fuel the rocket ship. You've got something amazing happening here.

Don't worry, we have all the usual awesome perks too:
-Competitive Salary
-Unlimited PTO
-Free lunch every day
-Gym membership
-401K program
-Games (ping pong, shuffle board, Super Smash) for you to enjoy when you need a breather
-Opportunities to learn (go take a class, attend a conference, etc.)","There aren't many things that I would classify as a true ""con"" at Gong. There are the usual start up challenges here: work can demand you stepping outside of the comfort zone of your existing skill set, hours can be long at times, the team has had to move around a few times before landing in our new SF office due to the growth."
123,Gong,Doing my best work with my best friends,2019-03-11,5.0,SDR,"An awesome team that is willing to help you be successful in any way they can; sharing workflows, advice, templates, time, etc.

We all win as a team and celebrate both individual & group success -- which is also recognized by the whole company during Lunch and Learns (not the case for other SDR teams/companies I've been at).  

Great events/programs that employees get to run/own; happy hours, charity, social events (sports leagues, etc) 

Management/Execs that care about both personal and professional development. All leaders are willing to lend an ear and listen/mentor.

Get to come into work with people who have truly become some of my closest friends and we just so happen to be building an amazing product that people love & rave about.","With such aggressive goals, there is pressure to work more hours/outside of work every so often.

Promotion paths outside of sales are not as clear.

124,Gong,"Skyrocket your SaaS career, and with meaningful work is a plus.",2017-10-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The People: Everyone at Gong is the type of person you'd want to sit next to on a long flight. They all have incredibly high standards (without being snobby). That will transform you.
- The Leadership: By working at Gong, you work for the smartest sales, marketing, and product minds in the SaaS world. And they are extremely generous with their mentorship and guidance. Work with them for a few years, and you'll wake up to a completely different life.
- The Product: There are so many ""me too"" and ""incremental"" startups out there. Gong is changing the way an entire profession is being done (sales). It makes you feel like you're a linchpin in changing a massive industry. It feels so much more like a mission than a job where you simply tell your boss where to send the check and do you work.
- The Vision: the CEO knows exactly where he wants Gong to be over the long-term, and is not distracted with the latest shiny object.","- When your business is growing so fast that it catches fire, every now and then your hair will catch on fire (in other words, hypergrowth can be overwhelming at times)"

-Amazing being able to sell the #1 product in the space that customers absolutely LOVE. 
-Very well run operationally for a small company
-Growing like crazy. Lots of success!","-Even though the work-life balance is great for a startup, it's still a startup work-life balance. This means that you'll be working outside the typical 8-5, especially in sales. All this work is typically on good things, though, like deals (not administrative nonsense)"

Once in a lifetime opportunity",2019-05-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've worked in some great companies, but the quality of the team here is just incredible.

The office is great and the perks (lunch, snacks) were recently upgraded and are top notch. There's a good amount of team events that are lots of fun, creating opportunities to socialize with the growing team.","The company is growing very quickly, so there's a lot going on.

- The leadership team is great and always open to new ideas
- The product is pretty cool. It's never an ""easy sell"", but customers seem truly excited about what we're building
- Since Gong is still growing and a young(ish) company, you get to wear multiple hats and collaborate across teams

Salary is not the most competitive part of this job. When I interviewed I had other offers with a higher salary. However, I chose Gong because I had a good feeling and despite the lower salary, I think I made the right choice.

- Global workforce with huge focus in EMEA 
- Most fun, high performing team I have ever worked with -- never seen an entire organization encourage and celebrate their teammates successes before Gong","- Work life balance was an issue thru Covid (via employee feedback survey) -- Gong responded quickly by re-evaluating aspects of roles that could be managed by different teams (or created new roles) to reduce workload, instating mandatory time off after quarter ends, and encouraging reps to be diligent around taking much needed PTO
- Very fast-paced start up environment, eg. changes in processes, product development is unprecedented (as we should be practicing what we preach using Gong) -- all requires a nimbleness to change and adapt to steep learning curve

We're a fast growing company and it's definitely been a mix of blood, sweat, & tears along the way. It makes it a lot more bearable knowing that leaders are willing to get in the trenches with you, hear you out when you're unbelievably stressed, & tell you take a day off when you need it. 

If you're looking for a company that truly has your back & best interests at heart - Gong is your best bet.","Gong is growing fast and there will always be growing pains, but we're figuring it out.

There is something very genuine about Gong, when this company sets up to do something, it does fully committed. It's not about making an impression it's about doing what you say you are going to do.

There are obviously so much more to be said as pros as I see it - but as well as cons - this is highly individual.","Too many operating principals ;)
As the pro's goes - it depends on the person - If you're not up for a fast-paced-no-sugar-people-want-to-hear-what-you-have-to-say culture - than perhaps we are not a best fit - but i'd suggest you reconsider."

Fair compensation (depends on how you look at it) and nice atmosphere (also, depends..). Also liked the transparency of the CEO who is one of the nicest I've met, and his overall positive, encouraging attitude.","The CTO is the one who will give tasks, describe them (in his at-the-moment preferred words) and watch (criticize) them, regardless of the team you're at. This way you suffer from both micro- and no management at the same time. 
The off-boarding (dismissal process) is within the grey area of misconduct, which is something they've already became infamous for."

There are a lot of very interesting data challenges. Customers love us.,Not enough HR events but there is a new office manager which will soon change that. Population is not homogeneous (which is actually might be also an advantage): Some people are parents of teenagers while others are on their 20's. Not enough after-hours hangouts (but maybe it is just me). Recently some projects were outsourced and I  believe less in that.
