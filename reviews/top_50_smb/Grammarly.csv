From the hired leaders to every team member I've worked with, I've never met a more driven and compassionate group of people.

My manager and team members are supportive and proactive about setting projects that better align with the skills I want to cultivate.","Not necessarily a con, but a note for those looking for a more established and structured company: Grammarly and Grammarly Business are growing quickly. This means that there are some growing pains when it comes to changing and establishing processes, finding better tools to fit the needs of our growing teams, increasing team size, and more. This makes for an exciting environment where I've been able to grow and learn so much in a short amount of time, but might not be the best for someone looking for a more structured and defined role."

When I joined, I thought our EAGER values were just marketing material, but having been here over a year - I truly see the values reflected in my teammates and peers. 

Additionally, management has been great about being transparent and responsive to employee needs through the uncertainty of the past year.

Grammarly is growing, and along with that come great growth opportunities. I am fortunate to have found a company and manager that provide me with opportunities to drive my career growth.","Since our company is split across Ukraine and the US, cross-team collaboration sometimes requires work outside ideal hours. This is mitigated as far as possible by colocating teams that work together a lot, but I do have early meetings in the US, which has taken some getting used to."
20,Grammarly,Always doing the right thing for their employees,2021-08-17,5.0,Engineering Manager,"They apply their values every day across all decisions from user privacy (they don't store any raw user text data!), to doing best by their employees (listening to the feedback about remote work and applying that to develop their remote-work hybrid policy).",The company is scaling fast and they are still finding the right level of process to put in place.

* Transparency and internal communications: you always know what’s happening and why. It’s easy to direct your question to anybody, including the CEO, and get a timely and detailed response.

46,Grammarly,"Impactful work, creative freedom, and wonderful culture",2019-10-14,5.0,Data Scientist,"1) I love how cross-functional the data science role is at Grammarly. We interface with various teams across the org and help stakeholders make important decisions about the products and the company. It truly feels like we are strategic partners. As a result, we get to work on a variety of projects and develop different skills. Super fun work --always entertaining and challenging. 

2) The data team is relatively small, but it is strong. We have have a a great team of data engineers who truly are our backbone. Their work helps me do what I do best, and they are true partners when it comes to taking data science products/ideas into production. I love my team's committment to democratizing data in our company.

3) The culture at Grammarly is awesome. We actually like each other and truly appreciate our differences. People are passionate about what they do and are always fun to be around. I have learned that a good culture means that my sweet days are a little sweeter, and my bad days are rare and tolerable.","We have a very high bar for our candidates so hiring is not a quick process (i.e., candidates need to be technically strong   + have a great business sense + truly exemplify our values). I am hoping that hiring only gets easier as our team grows. We need more people to tackle even more high-impact projects."
47,Grammarly,Positive impact and a  key career opportunity,2019-08-20,5.0,Marketing Communications Manager,"I've been at Grammarly for almost five years now, and I’ve been blown away by the company’s growth and quality of the team. The company went from 1 million to 20 million daily active users in less than four years, grew to over 200 team members, and is becoming a truly comprehensive AI writing assistant. The company is profitable and had an incredible round of funding recently. It’s a testament to the product, team, and values — a needle in the haystack of startups.

I've had the opportunity to try different roles to see what aligns best with my talents and interests while continuing to earn more responsibility. With a manager that cares about my growth, I'm excited about my work. What's unique is that I get to define my career at a company that helps people understand and be understood by others through improving their written communication. If you’re looking for a place to accelerate your career with an authentic, fun, collaborative team, this is the place.","There is a lot to accomplish over the next years, especially as we develop our product and grow as a team.

I genuinely look forward to coming into work every day because of the amazing people I get to work with! 
- Work: High impact work on a product that's helping 20+ million people worldwide. Since we're relatively small, there are a lot of opportunities to learn, grow, and have full ownership over your projects—which in turn gets recognition within the company.
- Culture: Values-driven culture where we apply an EAGER mindset (Ethical, Adaptable, Gritty, Empathetic, and Remarkable) to everything we do and every decision we make.  Office environment is fun and welcoming, with monthly birthday and work anniversary celebrations, team high-fives, company-wide outings, and an annual offsite to Europe.
- Business: Profitable business with a stable, long-term vision that's gained high-trust amongst employees. We just closed our second round of funding, so things are looking bright for the future of Grammarly as a product and business!","- No 401k match (yet—this is hopefully going to change soon)
- PTO is fair but 5 more days would make us competitive with other tech companies
- Hiring process is thorough but needs to be faster to match lofty business goals"
49,Grammarly,"Impactful work, exceptional coworkers, and bright future!",2019-10-09,5.0,Current Employee,"Grammarly is a very collaborative work environment with an amazing and passionate team. It's impressive how thoughtful and engaged management is while maintaining ambitious goals, and the company truly lives and breathes our core values. It's an exciting time to be here at this growth stage with such an impactful product. I hear stories every day about how Grammarly has transformed written communication for people all over the world. I've learned and grown here more than anywhere else I've worked, and it's truly a place where everyone's ideas are valued, and each individual makes an impact. The culture is engaging and fun, and there is an emphasis on team events and creating a community everyone feels included in and wants to be apart of. Additional perks include snacks, daily catered lunch, a great office location, a gym allowance, and a company-wide offsite in Europe!","We still have some catching up to do in terms of some employee benefits (401k matching, PTO) to reach the standard of other tech companies in the Bay Area, but we are constantly improving and management is always open to feedback. The only other thing I can think of is that we can't hire fast enough!"
50,Grammarly,Growth Mindset Company With No Ego,2019-10-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Live by our values. Our values are in everything we do, and we try to do the right thing every single time.

- Smart people with a growth mindset. The only kind of people you want to be working with. People are always trying to do and be better, which leaves no room for egos.

51,Grammarly,"Great People, Great Mission, Needs Diversity",2019-10-15,3.0,Content Marketing Manager,"- Grammarly has a strong mission and values, and they stick to them. Performance reviews and business decisions are based in values, which is rare in tech.
- The business and product are doing well, and they're interested in building for the long term. A nice change of pace from many other early and late-stage startups.
- The culture is very supportive and collaborative, with very little ego.
- Team members across the org are given the autonomy to grow and deepen their knowledge of their function. There's also a budding culture of promoting from within, so fast career growth opportunities exist for top performers.","- In a word, diversity. The company is still primarily focused on binary gender identity as a measure of diversity success or failure, with very little focus on underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities or diversity of thought. Although leadership means well, the lack of prolonged focus on D&I initiatives from the top can cause employees to lose hope that Grammarly will continue to hold themselves to a higher ethical standard than the rest of tech."
52,Grammarly,Once in a lifetime...,2019-09-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been working in and out of tech for the last ten years, and Grammarly is unlike anywhere I've ever worked. 

The people...they're ethical, brilliant, humble, emotionally intelligent, passionate, hilarious, and collaborative. I instantly felt comfortable and got the sense that everyone is here for the same mission. There is no crazy internal competition or ego.

Everything ties back to our EAGER values and our users, whether we're choosing on the next product feature, hiring the next team member, or simply deciding on marketing copy. The values are the basis for any decision made within every part of the organization.

The culture at Grammarly has created a very successful company with a lot of growth on the horizon.","There is a significant amount of autonomy, so if you're not a self-starter, I could see how this might not be your type of environment.

PTO isn't on par with a lot of tech companies in the Bay Area, and there is a pretty strong point of view on WFH flexibility. However, overall, there is flexibility to take care of your life stuff and good work-life balance even in our hypergrowth mode."
53,Grammarly,"Highly competent team, ambitious goals, warm and trusting environment–a hidden gem!",2019-09-03,5.0,Software Engineer,"Engineering:

Company:

- Clear goals, balancing long term and short term well

- Would like a bit more time off–something that would be even more of an issue for me if I didn't enjoy coming in to work as much
- More diversité on the engineering team-é (the female's, the lgbtqi's, the brown's–where ya'll at?!)

They're building a product that reaches millions of people every day, and they take seriously the responsibility of doing that ethically. There's a high premium placed on user respect and a genuine sense that the company cares about employees' lives and well-being.","Grammarly is a small team, which is an opportunity to be able to have autonomy and make true and recognizable impact through one's daily work. It also means that people often need to be their own project managers and seek out the resources and skills they might need to achieve an objective. For someone who doesn't like to work in this way—to find answers for themselves and take ownership over projects—working here would perhaps not be a great fit."
58,Grammarly,A Wonderful Place to Grow,2020-02-26,5.0,Sales,"Grammarly is an incredible company: great product, strong leadership, focused, driven, yet humble and inclusive. The technology is extremely user-friendly, with AI that actually works.

60,Grammarly,Grammarly has been a transformative career experience!,2019-08-15,5.0,Growth & Marketing,"I've grown at and with Grammarly for the last 7+ years. This is more than 3x my next longest tenure, which is a huge testament to Grammarly's culture and focus on growing folks from within. It's been an intellectually stimulating, inspiring, and character-forming experience. I've started as an individual contributor and have been given the trust and support to build out a function that today is 20 (phenomenal) people strong and is rapidly growing. The learning velocity, smart yet humble team, as well as the exciting business growth and future prospects, are what keeps me here.",We can be hiring faster so that our awesome team can tackle the multitude of opportunities in front of us :)
61,Grammarly,Brilliant values-driven company with endless opportunities for growth,2019-10-11,5.0,N/A,"1. People and values: I feel lucky to be at a company that is as holistically thoughtful about its values and company culture as Grammarly is. It’s tough to find a group of more empathetic, low-ego, and passionate individuals that both personally and professionally embody our company’s values. I’m constantly impressed by everything from our humble and involved leadership (one of our founders came up to me when I started to introduce himself, a fact that surprises my friends at other tech companies) to our amazing management who go out of their way to mentor you as a professional. It doesn’t hurt that we have fun events such as off-sites to Europe, monthly team events, and even lunch events where we can express our appreciation for other individuals at Grammarly!

2. Purposeful work: Due to the challenging, rewarding, and ever-evolving nature of the work, I have learned and grown an immense amount during my time here. In my role, I’ve been able to expand my skills set in a variety of areas while always feeling empowered and comfortable reaching out to others for guidance. Because of the nature and relatively small size of Grammarly (200+ employees), you can see the impact of your actions and are able to voice ideas that get implemented.

3. Clear vision: Grammarly has a clear and ambitious vision of where we are headed and the right leadership and values guiding us to achieve it. The multitude of goals we have to improve our product for our (20 million!) users around the world are inspiring. There’s always more that can be done to improve our users’ lives by helping them connect with other people!","1. Sometimes we’ll have early morning meetings (8am) due to the time difference between SF and our office in Kyiv, Ukraine.

2. More PTO days and WFH opportunities would be nice!"

Some of my best friends in the world are my Grammarly coworkers. :),"You have to be a self-starter. Everyone is acting atomously since we have a lot to do and limited bandwidth. The bright side is, you can choose what you work on/how you work. Plus, you have an outsided impact.

81,Grammarly,All the pros of a start-up with none of the cons,2015-05-10,5.0,Online Marketing Manager,"I've been at Grammarly for over two years now and fully expect to be here for many more. To me, it's the perfect blend of a fast-paced, autonomous, start-up environment with none of the usual drawbacks of investor dependence (we're bootstrapped), instability, and lack of resources.

Contributing to something that creates genuine value was something I longed for at every other company I've worked at. When you tell people you work at Grammarly, more often than not you'll get a burst of excited ""I use that every day!"" and ""It's saved me from so many embarrassing situations.""

Perhaps the most important reason I hope to be here for very long are the people. I feel privileged to work with and learn from a team of smart, engaged, warm, and helpful coworkers.","Due to the time difference between our two offices (Kyiv and San Francisco), I've had to master the personal challenge of becoming a morning person. That and having a lot of calls with the team in Kyiv every morning is something that takes some getting used to. The upside is that I've learned to work with people with very different cultural backgrounds."
82,Grammarly,Big Impact and Big Commitment,2017-01-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"We're helping people all over the world communicate better. That's something that we can all be really proud of. The product is awesome, and our potential for continued innovation has no limit. It's not just a grammar checker. It helps people write correctly and effectively. Also, the addressable market is huge - 2 billion people. Our leadership team is accessible, driven, and focused. They care deeply about the success of our team because that translates directly to the success of our company. I was amazed to find out that they not only developed the content for our training programs but they lead them as well. That's the kind of leadership investment in people that you rarely see in other companies. We have a team of committed, passionate, and super smart people. Even though we're many time zones apart between San Francisco and Kyiv, magic happens every day. Well, I guess it's not magic because we're all working our tails off. But it feels like magic!","We put in a lot of hours and a lot of ourselves. It's a big time/life commitment, but to me, it's worth it because we have a huge opportunity to make a huge impact on the world. It's also a challenge to find high-caliber people, so it takes a long time to fill our open roles."

- User feedback: The impact Grammarly has made on people's lives is humbling — the love our users share with us is enough to keep anyone inspired.
- See room for improvement? Make it happen! Everyone's open to feedback and willing to learn.","Not really a con, but we have big goals that require a bigger team — and we need to grow to achieve them! In the meantime, there's a lot to do and not enough hours in the day to get it all done, so there are days when work-life balance is non-existent. But that dedication is recognized."
84,Grammarly,An opportunity to grow with a great team,2016-04-07,5.0,Marketing Analyst,"Grammarly has been a great working experience that has pushed me to grow personally and professionally. I get to work with experts in their fields, our top management have successful startup & tech track record, and I am challenged to grow everyday.

- Motivating company mission
- High investment in individual development and accountability
- Lots of freedom to experiment and design your role
- Strong focus on metric-driven goals
- Healthy, bootstrapped company growth
- Team is best in class, hardworking, and easy to work with
- Colleagues are people I meet up with outside of work
- Great team events","- Work 50-60 hours/week without WFH
- Limited perks due to being bootstrapped
- Lack of internal expertise in your particular field
- Two offices in different time zones means you need an earlier routine to maximize overlap"
85,Grammarly,The company to stay challenged and make the world a better place!,2015-12-07,5.0,Head of Sales,"The team. High emphasis on the team communication and development. Grammarly provides in-house and external training sessions.

Autonomy. I believe it is important to leverage your own brainpower when working on the project. Our values provide this kind of environment. BTW, everyone at Grammarly is always happy to help with the challenges along the way.  

Company off-sites.

Every year we are off to explore a new place on the map. We collaborate, have fun, fire the water guns and get to know each other even better. No doubt you will enjoy the getaways and make new friends among the teammates. 


Compensation.

Grammarly provides above the average salary rates, health insurance benefits, and interoffice travels.","From time to time, there may not be enough collaboration time between San Francisco and Kyiv offices due to zones difference."

It is a small, but exceptional, team with a passion for life and language, impeccable technical skills, and tremendous drive. Our San Francisco headquarters is centrally located in a shared office space replete with startups, and our vacation plan and benefits are very competitive.","Growing companies typically experience ""growing pains,"" but Grammarly seems to defy this precedent. The management team is cohesive and open to feedback, but with a very clear vision for the company's future. As a result, all team members work long hours (with pleasure!) to realize these impressive goals. We truly feel like we are a part of something special."
87,Grammarly,A Nurturing Environment with a High Bar,2015-05-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"My experience thus far at Grammarly has been overwhelmingly positive. There is a great deal of care given to hiring the right people and making sure they are a culture fit and once you're a part of the team it really feels like a family. It's a privilege to work directly with so many different teams and functions and to have each project provide direct impact to our users. Professional development, autonomy, and encouragement are all prioritized in what is still a very intimate group.","+ Not a huge suite of benefits, though they are commensurate with current size and profitability

+ Product has endless opportunity for success. 
+ Good fringe benefits (lunch every day, fun company events, beautiful offices.)",- Growing company with lofty goals.  Employees must be dedicated to the mission and interested in being in an environment where they will make a serious impact.  That may not be for everyone.
89,Grammarly,Mixed Bag,2016-05-09,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Grammarly has a lot of things going for it. I spent a lot of time in both offices and had some good experiences and got perspective. 

Team: A lot of dedicated individuals who want to build a good product and are friendly and willing to help, welcoming atmosphere, positive attitudes even when people are frustrated

Product: Interesting product to use and build with big user base, clear sense that users actually benefit from the service
 
Company: Bootstrapped, financially healthy, and growing

Career: Opportunity to grow and learn a lot if you are aggressive and in the right position, opportunity to make a good position for yourself if you are skilled and motivated

Perks: Reasonable number of perks that includes free food, training, paid conference attendance","Management: The tech world is a minefield of bad management, and Grammarly is no exception. Top management is obtuse and sometimes insensitive, particularly regarding women. Feedback to management is encouraged in words but not in action. My feeling is that they do not listen/respond to people except close, trusted advisers or highly-valued employees (developers). Feedback from management is often not meaningful (we like what you do, but you could maybe not take so many days off). Although it is not discussed very openly, there is a clear sense that top management plays favorites.

Offices: The norm of 10 or 12 hours in SF is beginning to relax, but many people still believe that staying long hours in the office is the only way to be appreciated. This is bad for morale and the company. People who work effectively in limited hours should be rewarded, and people who stay in the office forever should not be held up as an example. The CEO spends all of his time at work, which makes people uncomfortable. Employees/team leads are not empowered to make decisions about managing their own time. Both offices are overcrowded, but WFH is strongly discouraged. The search for a new office in Ukraine has been going on for at least one year. This is bad for productivity. Finally, we have a big time difference between offices that makes it difficult to coordinate. It used to be common for people to visit between offices, but this does not happen anymore. 

Career: Many salaries, especially in the SF office, are well below market. The company has become reliant on importing developers from Ukraine via H1B to make up for lack of hiring in SF. We hired two engineers in SF for the past four years. We behave like we are special enough to attract people at lower pay, but that is obviously not the case. I guess we will not be able to scale efficiently if we do not fix this problem. Some people develop a lot and some do not. I guess that if top management likes you (and especially if you are a developer) the opportunities are much better. There is not a clear way to become better, so you just have to find your own way. It can be good for some people, but I don’t think it can work if the company really grows."
