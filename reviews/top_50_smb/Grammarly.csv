From the hired leaders to every team member I've worked with, I've never met a more driven and compassionate group of people.

My manager and team members are supportive and proactive about setting projects that better align with the skills I want to cultivate.","Not necessarily a con, but a note for those looking for a more established and structured company: Grammarly and Grammarly Business are growing quickly. This means that there are some growing pains when it comes to changing and establishing processes, finding better tools to fit the needs of our growing teams, increasing team size, and more. This makes for an exciting environment where I've been able to grow and learn so much in a short amount of time, but might not be the best for someone looking for a more structured and defined role."

When I joined, I thought our EAGER values were just marketing material, but having been here over a year - I truly see the values reflected in my teammates and peers. 

Additionally, management has been great about being transparent and responsive to employee needs through the uncertainty of the past year.

Grammarly is growing, and along with that come great growth opportunities. I am fortunate to have found a company and manager that provide me with opportunities to drive my career growth.","Since our company is split across Ukraine and the US, cross-team collaboration sometimes requires work outside ideal hours. This is mitigated as far as possible by colocating teams that work together a lot, but I do have early meetings in the US, which has taken some getting used to."
20,Grammarly,Always doing the right thing for their employees,2021-08-17,5.0,Engineering Manager,"They apply their values every day across all decisions from user privacy (they don't store any raw user text data!), to doing best by their employees (listening to the feedback about remote work and applying that to develop their remote-work hybrid policy).",The company is scaling fast and they are still finding the right level of process to put in place.

* Transparency and internal communications: you always know what’s happening and why. It’s easy to direct your question to anybody, including the CEO, and get a timely and detailed response.

46,Grammarly,"Impactful work, creative freedom, and wonderful culture",2019-10-14,5.0,Data Scientist,"1) I love how cross-functional the data science role is at Grammarly. We interface with various teams across the org and help stakeholders make important decisions about the products and the company. It truly feels like we are strategic partners. As a result, we get to work on a variety of projects and develop different skills. Super fun work --always entertaining and challenging. 

2) The data team is relatively small, but it is strong. We have have a a great team of data engineers who truly are our backbone. Their work helps me do what I do best, and they are true partners when it comes to taking data science products/ideas into production. I love my team's committment to democratizing data in our company.

3) The culture at Grammarly is awesome. We actually like each other and truly appreciate our differences. People are passionate about what they do and are always fun to be around. I have learned that a good culture means that my sweet days are a little sweeter, and my bad days are rare and tolerable.","We have a very high bar for our candidates so hiring is not a quick process (i.e., candidates need to be technically strong   + have a great business sense + truly exemplify our values). I am hoping that hiring only gets easier as our team grows. We need more people to tackle even more high-impact projects."
47,Grammarly,Positive impact and a  key career opportunity,2019-08-20,5.0,Marketing Communications Manager,"I've been at Grammarly for almost five years now, and I’ve been blown away by the company’s growth and quality of the team. The company went from 1 million to 20 million daily active users in less than four years, grew to over 200 team members, and is becoming a truly comprehensive AI writing assistant. The company is profitable and had an incredible round of funding recently. It’s a testament to the product, team, and values — a needle in the haystack of startups.

I've had the opportunity to try different roles to see what aligns best with my talents and interests while continuing to earn more responsibility. With a manager that cares about my growth, I'm excited about my work. What's unique is that I get to define my career at a company that helps people understand and be understood by others through improving their written communication. If you’re looking for a place to accelerate your career with an authentic, fun, collaborative team, this is the place.","There is a lot to accomplish over the next years, especially as we develop our product and grow as a team.

I genuinely look forward to coming into work every day because of the amazing people I get to work with! 
- Work: High impact work on a product that's helping 20+ million people worldwide. Since we're relatively small, there are a lot of opportunities to learn, grow, and have full ownership over your projects—which in turn gets recognition within the company.
- Culture: Values-driven culture where we apply an EAGER mindset (Ethical, Adaptable, Gritty, Empathetic, and Remarkable) to everything we do and every decision we make.  Office environment is fun and welcoming, with monthly birthday and work anniversary celebrations, team high-fives, company-wide outings, and an annual offsite to Europe.
- Business: Profitable business with a stable, long-term vision that's gained high-trust amongst employees. We just closed our second round of funding, so things are looking bright for the future of Grammarly as a product and business!","- No 401k match (yet—this is hopefully going to change soon)
- PTO is fair but 5 more days would make us competitive with other tech companies
- Hiring process is thorough but needs to be faster to match lofty business goals"
49,Grammarly,"Impactful work, exceptional coworkers, and bright future!",2019-10-09,5.0,Current Employee,"Grammarly is a very collaborative work environment with an amazing and passionate team. It's impressive how thoughtful and engaged management is while maintaining ambitious goals, and the company truly lives and breathes our core values. It's an exciting time to be here at this growth stage with such an impactful product. I hear stories every day about how Grammarly has transformed written communication for people all over the world. I've learned and grown here more than anywhere else I've worked, and it's truly a place where everyone's ideas are valued, and each individual makes an impact. The culture is engaging and fun, and there is an emphasis on team events and creating a community everyone feels included in and wants to be apart of. Additional perks include snacks, daily catered lunch, a great office location, a gym allowance, and a company-wide offsite in Europe!","We still have some catching up to do in terms of some employee benefits (401k matching, PTO) to reach the standard of other tech companies in the Bay Area, but we are constantly improving and management is always open to feedback. The only other thing I can think of is that we can't hire fast enough!"
50,Grammarly,Growth Mindset Company With No Ego,2019-10-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Live by our values. Our values are in everything we do, and we try to do the right thing every single time.

- Smart people with a growth mindset. The only kind of people you want to be working with. People are always trying to do and be better, which leaves no room for egos.

51,Grammarly,"Great People, Great Mission, Needs Diversity",2019-10-15,3.0,Content Marketing Manager,"- Grammarly has a strong mission and values, and they stick to them. Performance reviews and business decisions are based in values, which is rare in tech.
- The business and product are doing well, and they're interested in building for the long term. A nice change of pace from many other early and late-stage startups.
- The culture is very supportive and collaborative, with very little ego.
- Team members across the org are given the autonomy to grow and deepen their knowledge of their function. There's also a budding culture of promoting from within, so fast career growth opportunities exist for top performers.","- In a word, diversity. The company is still primarily focused on binary gender identity as a measure of diversity success or failure, with very little focus on underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities or diversity of thought. Although leadership means well, the lack of prolonged focus on D&I initiatives from the top can cause employees to lose hope that Grammarly will continue to hold themselves to a higher ethical standard than the rest of tech."
52,Grammarly,Once in a lifetime...,2019-09-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been working in and out of tech for the last ten years, and Grammarly is unlike anywhere I've ever worked. 

The people...they're ethical, brilliant, humble, emotionally intelligent, passionate, hilarious, and collaborative. I instantly felt comfortable and got the sense that everyone is here for the same mission. There is no crazy internal competition or ego.

Everything ties back to our EAGER values and our users, whether we're choosing on the next product feature, hiring the next team member, or simply deciding on marketing copy. The values are the basis for any decision made within every part of the organization.

The culture at Grammarly has created a very successful company with a lot of growth on the horizon.","There is a significant amount of autonomy, so if you're not a self-starter, I could see how this might not be your type of environment.

PTO isn't on par with a lot of tech companies in the Bay Area, and there is a pretty strong point of view on WFH flexibility. However, overall, there is flexibility to take care of your life stuff and good work-life balance even in our hypergrowth mode."
53,Grammarly,"Highly competent team, ambitious goals, warm and trusting environment–a hidden gem!",2019-09-03,5.0,Software Engineer,"Engineering:

Company:

- Clear goals, balancing long term and short term well

- Would like a bit more time off–something that would be even more of an issue for me if I didn't enjoy coming in to work as much
- More diversité on the engineering team-é (the female's, the lgbtqi's, the brown's–where ya'll at?!)

They're building a product that reaches millions of people every day, and they take seriously the responsibility of doing that ethically. There's a high premium placed on user respect and a genuine sense that the company cares about employees' lives and well-being.","Grammarly is a small team, which is an opportunity to be able to have autonomy and make true and recognizable impact through one's daily work. It also means that people often need to be their own project managers and seek out the resources and skills they might need to achieve an objective. For someone who doesn't like to work in this way—to find answers for themselves and take ownership over projects—working here would perhaps not be a great fit."
58,Grammarly,A Wonderful Place to Grow,2020-02-26,5.0,Sales,"Grammarly is an incredible company: great product, strong leadership, focused, driven, yet humble and inclusive. The technology is extremely user-friendly, with AI that actually works.

60,Grammarly,Grammarly has been a transformative career experience!,2019-08-15,5.0,Growth & Marketing,"I've grown at and with Grammarly for the last 7+ years. This is more than 3x my next longest tenure, which is a huge testament to Grammarly's culture and focus on growing folks from within. It's been an intellectually stimulating, inspiring, and character-forming experience. I've started as an individual contributor and have been given the trust and support to build out a function that today is 20 (phenomenal) people strong and is rapidly growing. The learning velocity, smart yet humble team, as well as the exciting business growth and future prospects, are what keeps me here.",We can be hiring faster so that our awesome team can tackle the multitude of opportunities in front of us :)
61,Grammarly,Brilliant values-driven company with endless opportunities for growth,2019-10-11,5.0,N/A,"1. People and values: I feel lucky to be at a company that is as holistically thoughtful about its values and company culture as Grammarly is. It’s tough to find a group of more empathetic, low-ego, and passionate individuals that both personally and professionally embody our company’s values. I’m constantly impressed by everything from our humble and involved leadership (one of our founders came up to me when I started to introduce himself, a fact that surprises my friends at other tech companies) to our amazing management who go out of their way to mentor you as a professional. It doesn’t hurt that we have fun events such as off-sites to Europe, monthly team events, and even lunch events where we can express our appreciation for other individuals at Grammarly!

2. Purposeful work: Due to the challenging, rewarding, and ever-evolving nature of the work, I have learned and grown an immense amount during my time here. In my role, I’ve been able to expand my skills set in a variety of areas while always feeling empowered and comfortable reaching out to others for guidance. Because of the nature and relatively small size of Grammarly (200+ employees), you can see the impact of your actions and are able to voice ideas that get implemented.

3. Clear vision: Grammarly has a clear and ambitious vision of where we are headed and the right leadership and values guiding us to achieve it. The multitude of goals we have to improve our product for our (20 million!) users around the world are inspiring. There’s always more that can be done to improve our users’ lives by helping them connect with other people!","1. Sometimes we’ll have early morning meetings (8am) due to the time difference between SF and our office in Kyiv, Ukraine.

2. More PTO days and WFH opportunities would be nice!"

A few things that make Grammarly unique
- A very cool mission and vision to help everyone in the world be a better communicator.

Some of my best friends in the world are my Grammarly coworkers. :),"You have to be a self-starter. Everyone is acting atomously since we have a lot to do and limited bandwidth. The bright side is, you can choose what you work on/how you work. Plus, you have an outsided impact.

81,Grammarly,All the pros of a start-up with none of the cons,2015-05-10,5.0,Online Marketing Manager,"I've been at Grammarly for over two years now and fully expect to be here for many more. To me, it's the perfect blend of a fast-paced, autonomous, start-up environment with none of the usual drawbacks of investor dependence (we're bootstrapped), instability, and lack of resources.

Contributing to something that creates genuine value was something I longed for at every other company I've worked at. When you tell people you work at Grammarly, more often than not you'll get a burst of excited ""I use that every day!"" and ""It's saved me from so many embarrassing situations.""

Perhaps the most important reason I hope to be here for very long are the people. I feel privileged to work with and learn from a team of smart, engaged, warm, and helpful coworkers.","Due to the time difference between our two offices (Kyiv and San Francisco), I've had to master the personal challenge of becoming a morning person. That and having a lot of calls with the team in Kyiv every morning is something that takes some getting used to. The upside is that I've learned to work with people with very different cultural backgrounds."
82,Grammarly,Big Impact and Big Commitment,2017-01-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"We're helping people all over the world communicate better. That's something that we can all be really proud of. The product is awesome, and our potential for continued innovation has no limit. It's not just a grammar checker. It helps people write correctly and effectively. Also, the addressable market is huge - 2 billion people. Our leadership team is accessible, driven, and focused. They care deeply about the success of our team because that translates directly to the success of our company. I was amazed to find out that they not only developed the content for our training programs but they lead them as well. That's the kind of leadership investment in people that you rarely see in other companies. We have a team of committed, passionate, and super smart people. Even though we're many time zones apart between San Francisco and Kyiv, magic happens every day. Well, I guess it's not magic because we're all working our tails off. But it feels like magic!","We put in a lot of hours and a lot of ourselves. It's a big time/life commitment, but to me, it's worth it because we have a huge opportunity to make a huge impact on the world. It's also a challenge to find high-caliber people, so it takes a long time to fill our open roles."
83,Grammarly,"Noble mission, ambitious vision, brilliant team, low-ego leadership",2018-05-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- A noble mission, an ambitious vision, and an incredibly smart and dedicated team behind it all.
- The perfect place to work if you want to make an impact, set a strategy, try out new ideas (and iterate on them),  learn, and move at a fast pace — all the while being yourself while doing it.
- NO EGOS at the top! Humble co-founders, humble CEO, humble exec team that just wants to make an awesome product people love. Incredibly refreshing.
- User feedback: The impact Grammarly has made on people's lives is humbling — the love our users share with us is enough to keep anyone inspired.
- See room for improvement? Make it happen! Everyone's open to feedback and willing to learn.","Not really a con, but we have big goals that require a bigger team — and we need to grow to achieve them! In the meantime, there's a lot to do and not enough hours in the day to get it all done, so there are days when work-life balance is non-existent. But that dedication is recognized."
84,Grammarly,An opportunity to grow with a great team,2016-04-07,5.0,Marketing Analyst,"Grammarly has been a great working experience that has pushed me to grow personally and professionally. I get to work with experts in their fields, our top management have successful startup & tech track record, and I am challenged to grow everyday.

- Motivating company mission
- High investment in individual development and accountability
- Lots of freedom to experiment and design your role
- Strong focus on metric-driven goals
- Healthy, bootstrapped company growth
- Team is best in class, hardworking, and easy to work with
- Colleagues are people I meet up with outside of work
- Great team events","- Work 50-60 hours/week without WFH
- Limited perks due to being bootstrapped
- Lack of internal expertise in your particular field
- Two offices in different time zones means you need an earlier routine to maximize overlap"
85,Grammarly,The company to stay challenged and make the world a better place!,2015-12-07,5.0,Head of Sales,"The team. High emphasis on the team communication and development. Grammarly provides in-house and external training sessions.

Autonomy. I believe it is important to leverage your own brainpower when working on the project. Our values provide this kind of environment. BTW, everyone at Grammarly is always happy to help with the challenges along the way.  

Company off-sites.

Every year we are off to explore a new place on the map. We collaborate, have fun, fire the water guns and get to know each other even better. No doubt you will enjoy the getaways and make new friends among the teammates. 


Compensation.

Grammarly provides above the average salary rates, health insurance benefits, and interoffice travels.","From time to time, there may not be enough collaboration time between San Francisco and Kyiv offices due to zones difference."
86,Grammarly,Successful Silicon Valley Startup Dedicated to Perfecting Written English,2012-11-20,5.0,Director of Communications,"Grammarly has ambitious plans to perfect all written English for the world’s 1+ billion English speakers. It is a small, but exceptional, team with a passion for life and language, impeccable technical skills, and tremendous drive. Our San Francisco headquarters is centrally located in a shared office space replete with startups, and our vacation plan and benefits are very competitive.","Growing companies typically experience ""growing pains,"" but Grammarly seems to defy this precedent. The management team is cohesive and open to feedback, but with a very clear vision for the company's future. As a result, all team members work long hours (with pleasure!) to realize these impressive goals. We truly feel like we are a part of something special."
87,Grammarly,A Nurturing Environment with a High Bar,2015-05-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"My experience thus far at Grammarly has been overwhelmingly positive. There is a great deal of care given to hiring the right people and making sure they are a culture fit and once you're a part of the team it really feels like a family. It's a privilege to work directly with so many different teams and functions and to have each project provide direct impact to our users. Professional development, autonomy, and encouragement are all prioritized in what is still a very intimate group.","+ Not a huge suite of benefits, though they are commensurate with current size and profitability
+ Work-hour commitment at the office (WFH is discouraged) has a higher bar than previous jobs I've had"
88,Grammarly,Large impact on an amazing product!,2017-10-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"+ Team invests heavily in employees, gives them any/all resources needed to be successful. 
+ Extremely high potential for growth.  Thoughtful interview process which ensures that the team is bringing people into roles which will help them grow and challenge them.
+ Smart team that is dedicated to the mission and product.
+ No egos.  Executives are extremely down to earth, easy to talk to, and open to ideas from all levels of the organization.
+ Product has endless opportunity for success. 
+ Good fringe benefits (lunch every day, fun company events, beautiful offices.)",- Growing company with lofty goals.  Employees must be dedicated to the mission and interested in being in an environment where they will make a serious impact.  That may not be for everyone.
89,Grammarly,Mixed Bag,2016-05-09,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Grammarly has a lot of things going for it. I spent a lot of time in both offices and had some good experiences and got perspective. 

Team: A lot of dedicated individuals who want to build a good product and are friendly and willing to help, welcoming atmosphere, positive attitudes even when people are frustrated

Product: Interesting product to use and build with big user base, clear sense that users actually benefit from the service
 
Company: Bootstrapped, financially healthy, and growing

Career: Opportunity to grow and learn a lot if you are aggressive and in the right position, opportunity to make a good position for yourself if you are skilled and motivated

Perks: Reasonable number of perks that includes free food, training, paid conference attendance","Management: The tech world is a minefield of bad management, and Grammarly is no exception. Top management is obtuse and sometimes insensitive, particularly regarding women. Feedback to management is encouraged in words but not in action. My feeling is that they do not listen/respond to people except close, trusted advisers or highly-valued employees (developers). Feedback from management is often not meaningful (we like what you do, but you could maybe not take so many days off). Although it is not discussed very openly, there is a clear sense that top management plays favorites.

Offices: The norm of 10 or 12 hours in SF is beginning to relax, but many people still believe that staying long hours in the office is the only way to be appreciated. This is bad for morale and the company. People who work effectively in limited hours should be rewarded, and people who stay in the office forever should not be held up as an example. The CEO spends all of his time at work, which makes people uncomfortable. Employees/team leads are not empowered to make decisions about managing their own time. Both offices are overcrowded, but WFH is strongly discouraged. The search for a new office in Ukraine has been going on for at least one year. This is bad for productivity. Finally, we have a big time difference between offices that makes it difficult to coordinate. It used to be common for people to visit between offices, but this does not happen anymore. 

Career: Many salaries, especially in the SF office, are well below market. The company has become reliant on importing developers from Ukraine via H1B to make up for lack of hiring in SF. We hired two engineers in SF for the past four years. We behave like we are special enough to attract people at lower pay, but that is obviously not the case. I guess we will not be able to scale efficiently if we do not fix this problem. Some people develop a lot and some do not. I guess that if top management likes you (and especially if you are a developer) the opportunities are much better. There is not a clear way to become better, so you just have to find your own way. It can be good for some people, but I don’t think it can work if the company really grows."
90,Grammarly,Wonderful colleagues + constant learning + being yourself = Grammarly,2019-06-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The biggest pro of working at Grammarly at this stage is the impact you can have on the things you genuinely care about — and these may differ from person to person. For me (nearly 2 years in), here are the top three:
1) Contributing to the office/company culture by being myself and encouraging others to bring their whole selves to work. I'm so proud to work in a place that isn't just tolerant of my quirks — it's accepting and encouraging of them (and of others'). I genuinely love coming into work knowing that I'm appreciated for who I am and that my perspective and feelings are valid. My teammates are incredible, and together we get to build the inclusive environment that makes coming to work a true joy. [NB I'm a woman in tech.]
2) Being around people I can learn from every day — Grammarlians are so smart, so giving of their time, so helpful, so empathetic, and so interesting! I truly learn something new every day from folks in all of our different functions. 
3) Our mission and the people we serve: It never ceases to inspire me to know that our product is making such a difference in people's lives. Knowing that we're helping millions of people around the world (we hear from our users a lot!) is such a great feeling. While some may view Grammarly as a mere productivity tool, our users tell a different story — when they talk about Grammarly, it becomes so clear that it's so much more than that. It helps them feel confident, it helps them have the courage to express their ideas, it helps them land that job, it helps level the playing field in a world where English writing skills are a prerequisite for success (e.g. for folks with dyslexia, immigrants who are non-native speakers, etc.). There's a true sense of purpose in our mission, and there's still so much room for growth.
--
There are so many more to list (our vision for growth, the complex technical challenges that need to be solved, our business model, super-dope powerhouse women colleagues, humble CEO who's willing to learn and welcoming of feedback, etc.).","As we grow in San Francisco, I look forward to seeing more representation from URMs within our organization. I'm encouraged by the steps we've taken in the past year and look forward to more — we have work to do here."
91,Grammarly,Bad Management Harms Company and Employees,2015-11-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The employees are enthusiastic about the work, the company has good perks, and the product is interesting and useful for customers.","One office is noisy and chaotic. We are promised a new office space but so far nothing. The business model is questionable. Focus has changed from conversions to user acquisition, which creates a dilemma for marketing and product. Successful products have been shelved because of delayed development and release of the main browser extension, so focus moves from things that are working to things that are not. Communication between teams and offices is labored. Management across teams is inconsistent. General management is usually counter-productive. The CEO is a micro-manager who has a poor grasp of detail. Nearly all of the people who work directly with the CEO end up switching managers or leaving the company, but the CEO still has broad managerial and hiring responsibilities. This creates a lot of friction and mistrust, making it difficult to improve the processes of the company."
92,Grammarly,In my Top-3 of best places I used to work,2015-04-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Not too much hierarchy (a very few number of levels between engineer and CEO), no barriers for the feedback between team and executives

Which tell you a bit about it's current focus. Apart from that there is ambitious project goal. Having a noble and ambitious project goal does help motivation alot. Especially if you have a nice collection of young specialists around, which Grammarly does have.","There are some downsides as well. If you are looking for a developer position there is not much space for promotion. Positions like VP of engineering and team leads are usually filled via recruiting rather then promotion.

105,Grammarly,Amazing place for a dynamic long-term tenure,2021-07-20,5.0,Engineering Manager,"So far I have been with Grammarly for the last 7 years. It feels like I have worked at several different companies during this time. The circumstances evolve rapidly and we find ourselves in a new reality every year, and every version of reality has its unique challenges and opportunities. This is true for everyone at Grammarly but for engineering managers especially. Figuring out how to operate on the next level of scale is the most rewarding work. It feels like we have already scaled a couple of orders of magnitude but there is still so much opportunity around. Every team I work and have worked with could double in size and still have enough impactful work on their plate.

Most amazingly, there is a guaranteed human touch to everything. A while ago, I had a conversation with my manager about my focus areas. He started it with a ""what makes you happy?"" question and helped me align my choices with my aspirations first, all other circumstances second. I've come to depend on this approach both in my work and in my expectations from my bosses. There is a lot of respect, support and genuine care between everyone in the company.

Did I mention that Grammarly is a rocketship? It is. Don't take my word for it, look at the public announcements about our launches and milestones for the past few years. So, yeah, hop on.","You certainly have to be willing to work a lot and be open to a lot of changes and adjustments. Is it a con? I don't know :) Makes for an interesting life, for sure."

- Company values are actually real and people truly use them as their north star to make decisions",- We're scaling quickly and will need to be mindful of the way we work to make sure it can keep up
109,Grammarly,Tens of Millions of Happy Customers and Counting,2021-09-10,5.0,Sales,"When you work for Grammarly and people ask you what you do, they either say 'I love Grammarly' or ask 'What is Grammarly' - I've never had anyone who knows what this company does have anything negative to say. We have a very value-based hiring process, so when you join the team, you are surrounded by highly capable like-minded individuals eager to collaborate towards the mission.","Anyone who has joined a company growing as fast as ours will be familiar with the growing pains. There are only so many resources available, and it sometimes requires patience while your projects are prioritized."
110,Grammarly,No better place to work,2021-09-23,5.0,Communications,"-Collaborative and supportive environment
-Our values are not simply something fed to prospective candidates; they're what we live and breathe every day
-Incredibly smart team members who are all dedicated to our mission of improving lives by improving communication
-A remote-first environment with competitive compensation","-We have not rushed our growth (a benefit in my eyes), however, that might frustrate employees looking for a startup that is moving at lightning-speed toward an IPO"
111,Grammarly,Great company!,2022-01-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"+ Invested in career growth
+ Growing company with lots of opportunities for growth and creativity","- Working out kinks of building internal community/culture as a remote-first company, but overall it's great!"
112,Grammarly,Team is energized about ambitious goals,2021-07-27,5.0,Software Engineer,"The company vision is quite ambitious but the company does a great job of breaking it down into achievable next steps. Awesome set of people to work with who are energetic, smart and driven. 
Lots of freedom and focus on personal growth.","Everybody is doing at least 3 things (no pressure or bad WLB. Just a bunch of excited folks working on too many projects). This means you might not always get a meaningful review of your proposal or code or design. 
Team has expanded a lot in last year. More than doubled. Still need to scale up processes"
113,Grammarly,Great place to grow,2021-08-18,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Clear and open culture, I feel both heard and respected
- Good compensation, clear expectations about how to get the raise
- Good, reachable senior management
- No overworks; company helps with keeping the work-life balance
- A lot of opportunities to take the responsibility and grow as a specialist","More nuance rather than a con, but engineers are responsible for the full feature life cycle, including requirements clarification, communication between teams, and testing. It might not fit engineers who like to have clear inputs and outputs for each task and be responsible for the engineering part only."
114,Grammarly,A company driven by values,2020-11-13,5.0,Product Manager,"* Some already mentioned this, but I want to reiterate it once again - the company is really driven by the values (as cliche as it may sound). You often hear people mention values in both formal and informal work discussions, e.g. ""That project was really hard and took a lot of it, that person showed a lot of Grit to make it work"". More importantly, all of these are noticed and appreciated by other people on the team;

* Especially during the COVID-19 times, Adaptability value was at strongest with quickly adapting to a remote lifestyle, providing help for working parents, or even creating new opportunities to connect with other Grammarlians across offices;

* Another great aspect near and dear to my heart is the product itself - these days a lot of consumer companies rely on ads or traffic schemes for a business model. Grammarly has a strong Premium value that drives its core business. The value is also appealing to a wide audience. So whatever features we create, it feels like it will be used by many people

* I also appreciate all the mentorship and career guidance I received so far. Grammarly was the first company where I saw a career path with levels for a PM role. This creates a shared set of expectations and growth opportunities I can follow in my career.","* Having teams in both North America and Ukraine makes it often hard to collaborate on large projects. There is really no downtime cause once the day is over in Kyiv, it only starts in North America. So you have to be really mindful about creating your own work-life balance."

118,Grammarly,It's a great place if you want to grow and learn,2020-09-02,5.0,Recruiting Coordinator,"Culture is probably the best thing ever at Grammarly. And it's not only about events or office; it's mostly about how people treat each other and how you feel working with them. Being a junior specialist here feels great as you have all the opportunities in the world to learn and grow. 
There is no hierarchy and no personal offices for the management team. And it's like that in communication. Everyone is open and happy to help or ask you for help when needed. That makes you feel comfortable.

The office place is amazing to work at and Grammarly takes care of its employees by making many personal gestures and taking care of all the things you can think of. You feel like a family here. And because you have so many amazing people around, they quickly become your friends as well.","It's startup culture, so it's not for everyone. And you also have multiple time zones that you need to manage. But being creative and having the flexibility to set up your working hours is a solution here. And it's a small price to pay after having this amazing experience working here :)"
119,Grammarly,The company that cares about the employees,2020-11-05,5.0,Customer Support Manager,"Grammarly is the first company in my life that has values everyone follows. Many other companies ""invent"" values that do not work and employees do not care about them. However, it's not the case for Grammarly. The whole team shares the same values as employees are carefully selected and hired (even though the hiring process may seem tiring for somebody). Once you've received a job offer, you feel valued and cared about. You are getting a lot of benefits like sports compensation and medical insurance but you also receive opportunities to grow and develop. The company is really interested in making you the best specialist in your sphere and invests a lot of money and time in your development. You always have aggressive but achievable goals and the whole atmosphere at the company prompts you to perform better and better.",I cannot even think of at least one.
120,Grammarly,It's all about the people,2021-07-07,5.0,Commercial Account Executive,"The people are hired for values and talent, and it makes a big difference.",The hiring process might be lengthy sometimes.

122,Grammarly,A company with an amazing environment,2020-12-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"1) Grammarly is a rare company in Ukraine where culture and values exist. Not only as a formality but in fact. Everyone who joins the company shares EAGER values and understands its importance. You may expect trust, respect, and support from your colleagues, whatever happens.
2) You'll work with professionals who never stop learning and who are committed to the result. You'll be challenged. You'll gain much of the experience, for sure.
3) People at Grammarly are used not only to work together but also to have fun together. There are frequent teambuildings, master-classes, talent shows, etc.","Not cons, but peculiarities:
1) Grammarly's a company with quite a flat structure. It's very likely that you will grow horizontally rather than vertically. There are different tracks for growth: as an individual contributor or a manager. 
2) There's a tight correlation between impact and growth (professional level & salary), and you'll have to constantly exceed expectations to grow."
123,Grammarly,The best place to work and grow,2020-12-07,5.0,Workplace Experience Manager,"Grammarly is a human-centric company where you can develop your potential to the highest and realize the most challenging ideas. 
Here we have unique and engaging events that stay in the memories and hearts of the Grammarlians, people whose values meet the values of the Company they work for.","It is hard to say for me because I've found what, where and for whom I truly enjoy doing what I'm doing now. 
Sometimes it is difficult to align Kyiv and North America offices because of the difference in timezones."

127,Grammarly,"Amazing company, amazing people",2020-11-07,5.0,Applied Research Scientist,"Grammarly is an amazing company to work at. There're a lot of opportunities, challenging tasks, and wonderful people. Talking from an Applied Research Scientist perspective, I believe this is one of the best places to work in the natural language processing field. Another big thing is the possibility to make a difference to tens of millions of people every day.","You better be pretty experienced and self-confident to work here, as there is a lot of work to do usually on your own, but, as a result, you get rewarded with valuable experience."

130,Grammarly,A Supportive and Rapid Growing place,2020-10-11,5.0,Software Developer,"I like how Grammarly operates with the right balance of freedom and easy-going with everyday tasks or processes within teams. Another strong side it's how Grammarly is growing in terms of customers and team members, it creates a lot of opportunities.","You're more focused on growth opportunities in Grammarly, but it sometimes cuts long term goals, so you rather think in short terms wins. Also, of course, it affects your life-work balance which is harder to keep."

Constant growth is always supported and welcomed by management. There are unlimited opportunities for professional development that depend only on your desire to grow.
- Grammarly cares about people: both customers and employees. Working at Grammarly, I feel care and human attitude to myself and others.","- Working from different offices across the ocean, we need to adjust our schedules to the big time difference. It may take some time to adjust, but probably it mostly relates to the Kyiv office. It may impact work/life balance.
 - All team members are very impactful and committed to work (which is good), but it impacts sometimes work/life balance."

Folks are honest when expressing opinions, and are passionate about the product and work results in general. This combination creates a very challenging environment, so it's not an easy walk around here. But in my two years here I have grown my manager's muscle significantly. It is a great learning environment, definitely.

Grammarly's product is unique in a way how it is research-heavy on the backend and how it is so lightweight for the users. Lots of great design work backed up by a very able engineering team.

I have to be honest - I have a huge positive bias for Grammarly. I love working here.","We are still figuring out our organizational nuts and bolts. We have gone through a fair amount of changes recently, and that was stressful for some people. So you do have to take changes well to work here."

Running a scale web infrastructure in the cloud. Applying advanced algorithms and computer science daily. The engineering team is very strong (programming competitions participants etc.)

One can learn a lot about what it takes to run an Internet company - business and technology. Working in a ""startup"" atmosphere. Everyone's contribution matters. Releases reach millions of users instantly. 

The customers love the product. 

The company cares about employees - professional growth and happiness. The managers have good judgement and listen to employees’ feedback.

A fun and comfortable place to work: the office location, perks, friendly atmosphere, events and offsites.

Disclaimer: I work in the Kyiv office although I've met many teammates from SF.","In engineering, we are responsible for our services running without disruptions. For many people, this means participating in on-call duty and having some deal of unpredictable work, although it is a norm for most Internet companies. Having offices in two time zones helps."

The culture and values play a substantial role at Grammarly. I consider it important as it defines what people are around you. People at Grammarly are not only super smart and resourceful, but also active and sociable. There's always something happening: traveling, ice-skating, board games, composing music, dancing, etc. This creates a unique atmosphere here at Grammarly. I enjoy every day with my team. Each and every one of my team mates is remarkable.","The motivation for the decisions of the management is not always clear.
The hiring process can turn out to be tedious and never-ending: some vacancies stay open for a really long time, and the reasons for not hiring certain candidates are not always clear.
The communication between two offices needs improvement."

Grammarly is about trust, passion for the work, sincerity and love :)

A culture that focuses on strengths and talents rather than on weaknesses and mistakes. There are opportunities to try many things and take on new responsibilities, and an occasional failure is met with understanding and support because everyone gets that ambitious goals sometimes get too ambitious.  But that's considered better than not trying. The product has a long roadmap and significant value & market upside.","The team is too small for what the company is doing, so everyone has to figure out how to maximize impact. It's NOT crazy hours or overly intense work but it's more like having to always optimize, prioritize and juggle multiple things, which sometimes can be defocusing. But it's definitely not boring."

It manifests in many things: the way people write code, the way they talk to each other, the way management works etc. It is the first place for me where I feel - my personal development does matter for my employee. 
Another biggest strength is people. A bunch of bright, open and enthusiastic people makes me want to go to the office every morning.
And, of course, the product. Reading that we're helping people to write great stuff, helping children with dyslexia and other feedback from happy users - it does motivate a lot.","It is so fascinating - to build a great product,.. sometimes I work a lot and forget about rest and recreation."

Most of the team are nice people who care about their jobs and work hard. Business is secure.,"So many sad things with people management and hiring. Managers are inexperienced and do not understand people. Takes months to hire for just one position, and they often don't last more than a few months after that. Management tries (too) hard to make environment ""fun"" but professional and gets neither. Constant implications or accusations of not working hard enough. Performance reviews painful and ineffective."
