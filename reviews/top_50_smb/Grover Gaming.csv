15,Grover Gaming,A Company That Cares,2022-01-18,5.0,QA Tester Analyst,"I have worked several jobs in my lifetime and to me, Grover Gaming is the first place that feels like they value and care about their employees. Since my first day, I have felt that I was welcomed into a family rather than having another 9-5 job. This company is always finding new ways to better improve the employees, whether that is through professional or personal growth. There is a department (C.A.R.E. Team) who is responsible for taking care of employees and making sure their physical, mental, spiritual, and financial health needs are being met. Healthcare options are fantastic if you are single.","My only complaint is the pricing of the health insurance. While the options appear to be fine if you are single, I feel that it is too expensive if you have a family. Health insurance in general is trash and overpriced, so this isn't necessarily on Grover. However, I did have to choose between losing half of my paycheck to insurance or not having insurance at all. Might not be an issue depending on the salary though."

I'm not saying this is the perfect job, but its pretty close."
35,Grover Gaming,A Truly Caring Company,2021-09-21,5.0,Service Technician,The best reason I can give is the culture. When they say they are a family they mean it. Everyone from the top down is approachable and down to earth. Another reason is that you are not stuck in a certain role if you have the ability to do something else within the company there is a good chance there is a tract that will lead you to it. You will become apart of a company that is growing by leaps and bounds and has no intentions of slowing down.,"I honestly can't think of anything right now that would be a con, only being here for my short tenure so far.

41,Grover Gaming,Welcome Week Orientation,2021-07-15,5.0,Marketing Manager,"First week and I have nothing but great things to say.

Every employee you talk to from the top down seems to be on the same page and fully committed to the success of the company. Great passion, great benefits and a family feel are just a few of the things that jump out at me in my first week here. One of the best decisions of my life to come and work here!","I don't really have any right now, but I'm sure as fast as the company is growing there are sure to be some pains and difficulties that go along with that.

As it's grown, Grover Gaming has been able to maintain a small company feel through the dedication of its employees to the Core Values created by our owner. Senior Management is relationship oriented and makes an effort to care for every employee that joins it's family. While there are perks like weekly catered lunches, monthly rev-share bonuses, and benefits packages, to me personally the appeal comes from the creative process that is owned by developers and artists themselves. The collaborative environment is just fun, with small scope projects and a holistic approach to game design where game teams are small and multidisciplinary. It also doesn't hurt to be in such a stable industry for an artist where ‘crunch’ is virtually non-existent.","Being with the company from its roots to what it is today, spread across multiple states, I've seen some of the struggles that come from company growth. However, as Grover Gaming continues to mature there has been a stronger focus on accountability, processes, and documentation over the past year that’s allowed more flexibility to how employees work.

From the moment I walked through the doors of Grover Gaming I was welcomed. They took hours out of their busy day not only to interview me, but to get to know me.

The working environment is out of this world. I have never felt so comfortable to be myself at work. I actually feel of pride about Grover and all of the products we provide.

On top of that, the management here wants to see you grow within the company, I have had one on one meetings at certain milestones and they all focus on growth.

The benefit package is great and is also growing.  The latest change allows employees the opportunity to enroll in 401K after only 6 months.  And the company also added 2 additional 401K enrollment periods per year to expedite the enrollment process for new team members.",Definitely a growth company and more set up for employees that want to be part of a team.

117,Grover Gaming,Quality Assurance Director,2017-01-09,5.0,Quality Assurance Director,"I have been working at Grover Gaming for almost 7 years now. I have had the pleasure of working in almost every department in the company. I worked in the warehouse for 1.5 -  2 years, then technical support for 1.5 - 2 years, then sales for a little over a year, then started as the solitary member of Quality Assurance about 1.5 years ago. We now have 7 employees in the QA department. 

Saying all that to say this. I had no experience or formal training on any of the areas that I have worked over the years for Grover Gaming. This company truly rewards hard work. I am proof of that. This is the main reason that I have been here so long, and plan on being here indefinitely. 

Some additional pros include:

- Company Sponsored outings
- Company Sponsored Lunches (EVERY Thursday!)
- Christmas Bonuses
- 401k plan
- PTO based off time with company!!! (7years!)
- Pool Table, Basketball Goal, Lounge, and Gym
- Transparency with Senior Management (They all have an open door policy)","The only con that I can think of is the hours.

I have children, so for me, I would rather work from say 7am-4pm or 8am-5pm, just so I could be home earlier in the day to spend MORE time with family."

The owner and management team truly care about each of their employees. With weekly catered lunches, work gatherings, strong benefits, and an amazing work facility consisting of 3 kitchens, a gym, lounge area with a billiards table and television,  and the best coffee machine known to man it is hard to forget how good we have it here. Garrett (owner) is constantly looking to tap into new markets, constantly looking to build the company and he is quite good at it. Overall, this has been the best job I have taken and I have no plans of  moving on from the company.","Sounds crazy but I really have no cons, if we were to grow from an employee standpoint it could help out with labor, and maybe allow us to tap into even more markets. Other than growth (which seems to already be happening) I have nothing negative to say."
121,Grover Gaming,An accurate review of Grover Gaming Inc.,2016-01-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"You will feel welcomed at first, as well as the feeling of camaraderie, at least for a while. 

Free lunch every Thursday.

In-office gym.

Healthcare, 401k benefits, etc.

Company's actual products are pretty competitive in the marketplace. 

Greenville has ""small-town"" charm.","The location; Greenville is a college town with the population of around ~90,000. If you want to do anything besides the average college party or play video games at home, you will need to drive to larger cities close-by. Raleigh is about an hour and a half drive away, and Charlotte is about four hours. Although claimed as having a lower cost of living, Greenville has the same if not higher cost of living compared to the larger mentioned cities (PayScale.com). 

Non-competitive pay; Pay will be meager unless you are familiar with upper management, or hired on as a specialist of some sort. Most employee recruiting is aimed towards new college graduates that will be happy to have a job to begin with, so the odds of  a competitive salary are slim to none. To secure a raise, you will have to practically work as an indentured slave, kiss up to higher management , or threaten to leave because of a higher salary offer somewhere else. 

The hours; From the start, you will be encouraged to go ""above and beyond"". To clarify this, you will be expected to work 45-50 hours a week regardless of productivity during your normal 40 hours of ""salaried time"". I stress ""salaried time"" as they will still track your hours via time clock as well as video monitoring (not kidding) whether you are salaried or not. Any time that you spend working over the expected hours, you gain brownie points with management, but not much else, as pay raises are based on poorly executed employee evaluations. 

High turnover rate(disposable labor); The company hires batches of employees at a time and cut the fat early on. If you dont make an impression right out of the gate, start looking for another job shortly after. If you move here before you start your job, you may face a difficult situation having to job hunt in Greenville if you find yourself on the chopping block. 

Power tripping management and other unprofessional points; The company mascot and name was an inside joke by the owner pointing out the quirks of computer nerds by calling them Grovers, essentially making fun of your employees. Unless you are fired, leaving the company can become a very sensitive subject. You may face legal threats even if you have not breached an NDA/ non-compete/etc, as it has happened to past employees. I suggest having your own legal counsel look over any paperwork you may be made to sign before you take any position."

GB is probably one of the most down to earth high class boss I've ever had, and I doubt he's aware of the issues the rest of management is causing...","Most of the 4+ star reviews on here are management. HINT: DID YOU NOTICE ALL THE REVIEWS ARE IN THE SAME MONTH!? If you're working here as management, you scored a nice job. Otherwise...run.
Underpays developers (programmers, artists, audio) and warehouse unless they're close to management
They keep saying ""we're constantly growing"" but they fire people left and right without warning to them
Horrible communication between higher ups and everyone else
Like going home after an 8 hour shift? Good luck! 
Yoyo development. Sometimes they'll have 2 games in development, and 10 a week later.
Raise? HA! Small rare bonuses, yes. Raise, not likely.
Like I said, they're good people outside of the work. AT work, respect is rare unless you're an ""original"".
Reason they pick entry level people is because they're easier to screw over.
Just about everyone who got fired since I worked there had NO warning. No chance to talk, or anything. One person didn't even get 90 days to prove himself.
A lot of the people working there are looking for jobs elsewhere to escape.

123,Grover Gaming,A company that cares.,2014-05-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"At least once a week I've heard conversations regarding ways to give back to employees. Whether it be bonuses, increased healthcare contributions or additional company-provided meals. The owner of the company genuinely cares about each employee and product. This attitude is reflected by the executive staff all the way down to the average employee. Everyone is invested in the products that we create... all the way through the product lifecycle.","There are many projects waiting to be started on, but manpower is the issue.

They invest in their employees as people, to in turn become better employees. I feel it should happen that way at every company in order to be successful, but it does not always work that way. The onboarding process is phenomenal. There is a full 3-day orientation that goes over every aspect and department of the company. Everyone newly hired attends from all office locations-Ohio, Wisconsin, Georgia; office admins, service techs, sales people-everyone. There is no transparency-you learn everything you need to feel like you have the company’s full support behind you in your position.","During some of the department presentations, people would use a lot of terms/terminology that would go over my head as a new employee!"
