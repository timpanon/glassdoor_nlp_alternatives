-Leadership is intentional, and forward thinking
-Innovative and Collaborative environment
-Great Employee Engagement
-Open Forum with Leadership
-They are consistently looking for new and improved ways to improve the employee experience.",None. They do a great job of balancing out work with engaging activities and are a people first consulting firm.
1,Inspire11,"Not perfect, but pretty close to it",2022-03-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people and culture at Inspire11 are second to none. I look forward to interacting with everyone daily and can’t wait to get back in person with everyone. 

Autonomy and enough structure where you can take control of your career. It is not for everyone and we’ve definitely brought on the wrong indictable as we grow quickly and they’re just not ready for our pace. 

Rewarding work and it is what you make of it. Everyone gets the opportunity to work with world class organizations. It’s not ideal for people who need hand holding daily.",Growth is super rapid and at times things aren’t perfect. Most folks step in and contribute to make it better. Small minority chooses to complain due to their lack of self starter attitude and ability to contribute to the org. It’s easier to complain on surveys and Glassdoor than to roll up your sleeves.
2,Inspire11,Incredibly Happy Here!,2021-11-15,5.0,Recruiter,"It's hard to decide where to start on the pros, but I would say the overarching theme is that the culture is amazing. Inspire11 has done a really great job picking people that are genuinely down-to-earth and nice, but also wicked smart. I constantly feel like I'm surrounded by the best of the best. 

For me, one of the draws was unlimited PTO. I just went on my first vacation since joining Inspire11 and my team was so incredibly respectful of my time off. It was the first vacation I've had in years that I was not constantly answering calls and emails. 

Leadership is fantastic. They are thoughtful and strategic, and I'm always met with open ears and open minds. I've been able to talk really openly with my manager and directors. I appreciate the way they receive and give feedback, it makes for an environment where we all feel like we are constantly improving together.

Lastly, my workload is completely fair. I never feel stretched too thin or as if I'm taking on roles that are not part of my job. Inspire continues to hire support rather than putting too many responsibilities on one person, which I really appreciate. 

The benefits are amazing and the pay is very fair. I feel really lucky to have made my way into Inspire11.",I have none so far!
3,Inspire11,A different kind of consulting company,2022-03-02,5.0,Consultant,"People are wonderful

5,Inspire11,Good company,2022-03-10,5.0,Software Engineer,"Good culture and environment
Cares about employees",Nothing really. Some minor issues are due to the company being very young and growing fast. No major cons.
6,Inspire11,Amazing culture even before day 1!,2022-01-18,5.0,Recruiter,"Inspire11 is a family and you feel it even before day one. It's refreshing to work for a company that truly puts their employees first! 

The passion and excitement for providing awesome solutions to clients is truly second to none! It's a contagious atmosphere and you just want to keep coming back for more.",I can't think of any at this time!
7,Inspire11,I actually enjoy working here,2022-01-12,5.0,Consultant,"- Reputable colleagues 
- Hourly expectations are great
- Encouraged to grow
- Leadership is involved and available
- The work itself tends to be more interesting than projects I have worked on at other companies","Not many cons so far. Sometimes there are cool internal initiatives that don't get our full attention. While it would be great to spend more time on those things, I tend to be busy with deliverables."
8,Inspire11,It's a consulting company,2022-03-07,2.0,Data Scientist,A lot of coworkers are great. You'll learn a lot,"Not much incentive to work hard, but still expected to work hard enough to get client deliverables."
9,Inspire11,Inclusive and Accepting,2022-01-12,5.0,Sales,Inspire11 is a place where employees can be their true selves. Inclusion and acceptance are part of what make it such a fun culture. There hasn't been a time where I've seen my colleagues uncomfortable or judgmental of differences in our office.,Not applicable at this time.
10,Inspire11,"Fast Growing, Evolving and Culture Focused Organization",2021-10-08,5.0,Managing Director,"Inspire11 is fast paced and growing business and IT consultancy that among others values culture, collaboration, diversity of thought, curiosity and getting things done. It employs individuals who are smart and ambitious and who care about building genuine relationships with clients and each other. It is exciting to have a voice in defining the future of Inspire11 and ultimately executing the plan to bring that vision to life.","With growth comes growing pains...and that's OK. Inspire11 has grown and evolved substantially since I have been there and through each growth spurt we've needed to address process, procedure, system and other areas necessary to enable the company to scale, maintain/evolve the culture and remain efficient. That will likely continue for some time to come as we plan to continue to grow the Chicago Market."
11,Inspire11,How can you not be Inspired,2021-10-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Inspire11 is full of talented, passionate, curious professionals that genuinely look out for the best interest of each other. I've never been at a firm where so many people were willing to help out, even if it didn't impact them in a positive way. They truly believe and live out their vision of creating a Better Tomorrow for All. I can't wait to see what the future brings for Inspire11. They have the opportunity to change the world.",No real cons to speak of. There are multiple opportunities in front of them as they continue to grow. I know that they will continue to push the envelope and create new solutions that will revolutionize the consulting space.
12,Inspire11,Love working here,2022-01-19,5.0,Consultant,"great work life balance, and good people",You'll grow a lot because everyone is smart!
13,Inspire11,Building Something Amazing!,2021-09-30,5.0,Managing Director,The autonomy and support to take on and do more is unlike any other organization I've been at previously. We've grown and continue to grow beyond my wildest expectations. The community of 11's is one of curiosity and a desire to win. It's great to see the impact and value we deliver to our clients every day. It's also fulfilling to help people achieve goals even they didn't believe they could achieve. It's so refreshing to challenge the status quo with regards to the traditional consulting model and have the liberties to do things different and things that are truly right for the client.,The fact that more people don't know about us and that we aren't (yet) in more markets.
14,Inspire11,Great place to build a career!,2021-09-28,5.0,Senior Consultant,"As someone looking to get more embedded leading technology, Inspire11 checks all the boxes:
- Interesting and varied work and clients
- Passionate, energetic, intelligent and humble peers and leaders
- Genuine commitment to employees, development and DEI
- Transparent and honest communication about developments (particularly important during the early stages of the global pandemic)
- Entrepreneurial and experimental approaches with how to provide value for clients and create new revenue streams","The company is growing quickly and some things are still in development. This is generally the opposite side of the coin of being entrepreneurial. The company has recognized these area as is working to improve internal knowledge repositories, defined career paths, distinct product offerings, etc."
15,Inspire11,A company that TRULY lets you pick your own path,2021-09-27,5.0,Principal Consultant,"- Enables it's people to branch out and try things outside their comfort zone
- True focus on the employee (work / life balance, maintaining reasonable hours, investment in people through training and social events).
- Partnership with clients - Inspire11 actively works with clients to find solutions and partner together to realize those solutions together. This leads to better results for the client and provides Inspire11 team members with a shared sense of purpose and drive.","- As Inspire11 continues to grow, a renewed and continued focus on maintaining core values is critical. Inspire11 does a great job of this today and I hope Inspire11 continues to drive focus here as we expand our local markets and open new ones in the future."
16,Inspire11,Small(ish) but Mighty,2021-09-09,5.0,Consultant,"-Open, communicative, collaborative culture with truly friendly coworkers
-Freedom to come as your unique self without judgement or pressure to conform to some boys club consultant archetype
-Truly passionate, ambitious people who want to learn and grow and mentor others
-Encouragement and support to forge your own career without pressure to posture and compete with others in order to secure your job
-Commitment to increasing and nurturing diversity and inclusion
-Work-life balance and accommodations for those with family obligations
-Currently: WFH flexibility with option to come to the office and company events if you're vaccinated","-Need to scale upper management level positions, organization , and communication to accommodate explosive growth (already making strides in this area but feels a bit like catch-up)
-Could have a more competitive (and progressive) parental leave policy, especially for those looking to adopt"
17,Inspire11,Be challenged and be yourself,2021-10-17,5.0,Principal,"One of the first things I noticed about Inspire11 from my very first interview is that the people who work here are authentic. They take their work very seriously, but are humble, unique and a pleasure to work with.

There's no shortage of opportunities here - if you're ready for it, and can prove you can do it, you will be given opportunities to grow and lead. I came from a large consultancy where I'd have to ""wait my turn"" for some of the opportunities I'm getting here.

This company is growing fast. This growth means there will continue to be opportunities for leadership, new ventures, etc. I feel like the company will grow with me, and my next challenge here will come as a result of that. While this company is not new, it feels like the best is yet to come. 

The way we sell here is also very thoughtful, client centric and refreshing. We're not trying to sell anything and everything - we focus on opportunities that are truly strategic, where its clear that we can add value, and its something our people want to do. A client told me the other day that Inspire11 is the best partner he has worked with because we ""truly try to solve problems, not jam work down [our clients] throats.""

Like most consultancies, we still have work to do in terms of women and people of color in leadership positions and throughout the company. However, I'm putting this topic in the Pros section because half of our practices are led by women, and our leaders are committed to diversity hiring, so am hoping to see even more progress here soon.","Until now, our leaders have been able to care for our people without formal processes. But with our numbers growing, it's important to add more structure to our performance process and career paths, which we're actively working on. With this structure lacking at the moment, there's some uncertainty about how folks can progress, how their performance is being evaluated, etc."
18,Inspire11,Review Headline,2021-10-04,5.0,Consultant,I honestly believe I'm surrounded by some of the best and the brightest. Being able to reach out across the company to find deep expertise on very specific and niche questions helps out immensely in actually delivering unique and strategic solutions to clients.,"Not specific to Inspire11, but consulting work can sometimes be less than glamorous. Helping clients quickly mature can be very rewarding, but foundational work is just that."
19,Inspire11,Radically changing the consulting landscape,2021-09-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Significant growth without sacrificing people-first mentality. Clients experience a comprehensive partner that brings the expertise of an agency, think tank, digital and product development shop and strategic consulting firm. On the flipside, consultants work (and play) across these areas based on their passions and skills. A community of team members supporting one another--a true in it together mindset. A ton of peer-to-peer learning opportunities. Corporate functions are strengthening and scaling to prepare for next level of growth. There's an intangible energy about this place that is felt amongst employees and clients.","Typical constraints when you have strong autonomy in an organization--a lot of great ideas, projects and excited people--just need to prioritize!"
20,Inspire11,We're building a world-class consulting organization,2021-09-28,5.0,Consultant,"People - Inspire11 attracts entrepreneurial personalities who are passionate, personable, and genuinely good people

Work - our clients really look for us to partner with them to help them navigate changes to their industries and leverage the latest technology and operating model trends to help them grow efficiently 

Start-up culture - we're currently in the process of building a company from the ground up. It's incredibly exciting to be working in consulting AND work at a start-up at the same time","Like many start-ups who are growing tremendously, there are growing pains associated with bringing on new folks and getting everyone engrained in the culture"
21,Inspire11,Collaborative culture & exciting growth opportunities,2021-11-05,4.0,Solution Owner,"Inspire11 has experienced dramatic growth throughout the last several years and through COVID, and I was particularly interested in being a part of that growth previously coming from a large, established consultancy. I've found the culture to be open, friendly, and very helpful as Inspire11 continues its growth. Everyone is focused on high quality client service work and fostering a fun, enjoyable workplace. I'm impressed by the amount of forums and communication lines that the leadership have established with all levels of the company since joining.","Similar to other consultancies, I think it can be challenging to clearly define concrete career paths, internal roles, and development opportunities. I think the leadership team is doing a good job trying to define that despite such rapid growth."
22,Inspire11,Great company to learn and grow as a Data Engineer,2021-10-07,5.0,Data Engineer,"The people are all incredibly hardworking, results oriented, and fun to work with! 
As a DE I am on projects working with new and cutting edge tools in the cloud which keeps things fresh and allows me to constantly build new skills",Leadership and principals seem to be mainly based around sales/business development and as someone who wants to stay technical it is difficult to see how that can align with promotion to those levels.
23,Inspire11,Unlike any other company I have experienced!,2021-09-29,5.0,Technical Consultant,"Very supportive, tolerant, and diverse culture. This is a company who understands their people are their value, and treat them as they would want to be treated. 

For the company to succeed the employees must also succeed in their aspirations. Inspire11 understands this.","The company is growing rapidly. They are trying to achieve something different. Sometimes, it doesn't work out, but this gets recognized, and they try something else if it isn't working."
24,Inspire11,"Innovative, Strategic & Growing!",2021-10-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"What a great place to be. From the people, client work, delivery, and celebrating successes this company is doing a great job at incorporating it all. The passion from the employees and founders is what makes this company a great place to be!","As always there are growing pains and mistakes are made, but this company is using its mistakes to make better decisions for the future."
25,Inspire11,Great up-and-coming company that cares about its employees,2021-08-13,5.0,Data Analytics Consultant,"- Currently flexible WFH / Office option with no pressure to go into the office 
- Management makes an active effort to gather employee feedback 
- Super talented and intelligent people at all levels 
- Great insurance, pay, and benefits 
- Consistently heard you “build your own career” throughout the interview process and it holds true within the company 
- A lot of independence and trust is placed in employees, which truly enables individual growth 
- Great place for ambitious people and “go-getters” 
- True focus on company values","- Recruitment is focused on experienced hires, so there isn’t an established new employee training program 
- “Flat” hierarchy means there isn’t an established employee/manager structure, which can be confusing"
26,Inspire11,Inspire11,2021-11-18,5.0,Talent Sourcer,"A fun, transparent and collaborative culture and excellent benefits! You have a voice here at Inspire11 no matter what role you are in.",None - I can't think of any negatives for this company.
27,Inspire11,Constantly Trying to Get All of My Friends to Work Here,2021-09-14,5.0,Data Analytics Consultant,"- Everyone here trusts each other to hire experts in the field and their specialties so there is no ""proving yourself"" period to painful push through like I've had in other jobs
- Specifically related to the Minneapolis office, we are in such a cool spot that is a mix of being more stable than a fresh start up, but being less cemented in an existing culture than a larger & older office might be. I have gotten to be (and continue to be) a very active contributor towards shaping our local identity and growing our team, but without taking on the risk of a completely brand new company.
- There are SO many smart, passionate, & wonderful people that I get to work with everyday
- We have various committees with focuses that I'm passionate about: DEI, women in tech & consulting, community outreach & volunteering
- I have a chain of leaders (from my practice lead to my market lead to our founders) that not only give space for me to share my perspective, but actually follow through with recommendations provided by myself & my coworkers
- I have a boss that is passionate about my personal goes for professional growth and my work/life balance, not just my ability to generate revenue with clients
- We are constantly celebrating each other's successes and milestones
- We've taken the pandemic seriously; allowing people to remain remote & flex schedules
- The health insurance plan I have through them is the more affordable, yet has more coverage, than any other health insurance plan I've had since I graduated college
- We have time off specifically for social advocacy & involvement
- Leadership continues to consistently solicits input from the entire organization as we grow","- As we grow offices outside of the main corporate office, it can be tough to balance individuality with consistency between them
- Reflective of the current demographics of our industries (consulting, technology), and even though we are actively aware and working on ways to improve, most of my coworkers are white & male-identifying"
28,Inspire11,Bring your whole self to work,2021-09-29,5.0,Principal Consultant,"-Team members are driven and talented
-Leadership is compassionate and personable
-Interesting and varied projects
-Your efforts are valued and rewarded
-No pressure to conceal or play down my identity","-Kinks are still being worked out in scaling of processes
-There can be a tendency to reinvent the wheel
-Would like a more inclusive parental leave policy"
29,Inspire11,Fast Growing Organization!,2021-09-14,5.0,Consultant,"- The People - I get to work with smart, creative and all around good-hearted people everyday.
 - The Work - We work with some all-star clients and help them bring their ideas to reality. If you're into creating the new, you'll love it here. 
 - The Benefits - Pay and benefits are on-par with industry...no complaints.","The organization is growing FAST! Going through some inevitable growing pains, but to be expected."
30,Inspire11,Great Place to Work with Amazing People,2021-09-20,5.0,Consultant,- The people and the culture! Everyone who works here is amazing and you learn so much while also having a ton of fun,"- Starting remote has it's challenges and can feel lonely. Everyone is available if you reach out to have a 30 minute chat or have any questions, but if you don't initiate you can feel lost."
31,Inspire11,Great growth minded firm - the skies the limit!,2021-09-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Fast growing company that allows you to really contribute to the growth in meaningful ways. Great company culture that is high performing, but fun. Provides the ability to work on really challenging and cutting edge projects. Strong leadership team.",If there are any cons it would be that operational processes are still being developed and catching up to growth

37,Inspire11,Best company I’ve ever worked for,2021-07-10,5.0,Senior Consultant,"Coming at this from the perspective of a technologist/engineer. Competitive pay, kind and intelligent coworkers, great benefits, tons of professional growth opportunity.",May or may not be a con but the company structure is very flat. that’s great if you like an interdependent atmosphere like i do but might be tough if you need clearer structure. Also seems to be a lack of gender and overall racial diversity in leadership roles
38,Inspire11,IT consulting firm growing faster than their ability to manage it,2021-09-30,3.0,Senior Consultant,"Fast growth means lots of different project opportunities.
Lots of knowledgeable people to learn from.
Accommodating PTO and WFH policies.","Very sales focused, with no advancement for anyone that doesn't sell.
Projects are staffed with who is available rather than for success.
Lots of informal processes straining from growth."
39,Inspire11,Fantastic boutique consultancy,2021-09-29,4.0,Solution Owner,"A fast growing consultancy that is still small enough. Ability to network with all levels of the organization, including the co-founders. Approachable leadership and friendly co-workers.",Lack of clarity on how to be promoted/ grow within the organization.
40,Inspire11,Great place to work,2021-05-12,5.0,User Experience Team,"A very fun place to work. Overall, great and talented people","The people directly on my team bullied me by excluding me from meetings, ignoring me, throwing out my work, and treating me poorly. Such a shame because I really liked the other folks at the company"
41,Inspire11,Amazing culture; some growing pains,2019-12-06,5.0,Consultant,"The people. Amazing group of very talented, fun, and passionate people. We have a lot of mutual trust and respect for each other and a common goal to deliver valuable, exciting work. Lots of office events and opportunities to engage with coworkers and leadership. 

Work/life balance is better here than I could have imagined at a consulting firm. We work hard when necessary, but there is no expectation of maintaining perception by being in the office for long hours. 

Company structure is largely flat and everyone's suggestions are considered on their own merit. Many current employees are highly self-motivated people who were frustrated with bureaucracy and ineffective leadership at their old jobs. Inspire11 empowers employees to take on new responsibilities and make decisions themselves.","Most of the cons here would be the same cons for the consulting industry in general.. from project to project the effort required, difficulty of client interactions, and opportunity to innovate varies greatly. We currently don't do a great job of giving consultants a voice in their own staffing, but I hear there are some changes to the staffing model coming next year. 

I would also like to see our sales process become a bit more strategic to pursue the types of work we really want to be doing, rather than just whatever we can sell. 

We've done a decent job of increasing diversity over the past year or so, but it's still a heavily male-dominated workplace and leadership team."

47,Inspire11,"Great people, but culture can be unhealthy and real feedback isn't acted on",2019-09-05,3.0,Consultant,"Inspire is good at selling work and self-critique. They're good at getting companies to view them as assets (growing accounts) and they definitely move the needle at their clients - their consultants are genuinely great.

The people are friendly (as friendly as can be expected for people who work under a consulting model, and have limited time and are frequently on client sites) and happy to help you along and teach you.

Inspire11 has genuinely brilliant people working there.","The kind of core thesis of Inspire is to attract top professionals by selling them on the idea that Inspire is different and disruptive. ""If you're already a career consultant, it'll be better than where you've worked."" ""If you've been in-house/worked for Fortune 500s/'product' companies, you will love the consulting model. You'll be listened to, valued, and ultimately, happier."" The problem is, this isn't true. Culture is, as in much of the industry, ""every man for themselves"" because investments are made only in ""symbolic"" culture (happy hours are a sure bet, but it would be very risky to point out that parental leave is widely considered very inadequate by most employees.)

Inspire has a very pyramidal leadership structure; top management has layers of insulation around them. Power is highly concentrated, especially for a company this small. It's difficult for anyone to make change without buy-in from key players - buy-in that only comes if change is cheap, non-threatening, and small-scale. Management has an open-door policy, but real, incisive critique is only likely to be taken well if it isn't also going to actually rock any boats. What's the point of feedback being a gift if feedback, if it's taken, is only taken in half-measures?

Ultimately, Inspire is just like most enterprise consulting firms, prioritizing growth over all else at the cost of its people. Consulting firms are, ultimately, valued on their profitability, not their work quality, and that means squeezing work out of people and selling ever faster. That can work for you for a while - I don't begrudge any individual who wants to go maximize their income for a while - but if there's a place in enterprise consulting that is actually healthy for the consultants, isn't doing work for comedically evil corporations, and has leadership genuinely accountable to the workforce's interests, Inspire isn't going to be the place that happens."

49,Inspire11,Consultants who are real people,2018-10-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The organization is comprised of extremely talented, business-minded technology professionals who have proven themselves successful in other environments. 

The rapidly growing team has been able to maintain close knit relationships where people are not afraid to share different view points and opinions. The culture of learning and problem-solving is apparent in day-to-day conversations, while also maintaining a fun nature. People are referred to as people, not ""resources"".

The open door policy is genuinely enforced. All employees are encouraged to interact with leadership, who are responsive to feedback.

There is no unwanted travel. A solid local client base keeps most people home, but there are also options to travel if desired. Project expectations are also incredibly reasonable and work/life balance is encouraged.","Growing pains of any firm - need to solidify a brand identity and some operational processes, though this is also part of what makes it such an exciting place to work.

The flat organization structure leaves an unclear path for promotions/raises/etc; the ambiguity can be difficult for someone used to a very structured promotion model."
50,Inspire11,Not too good to be true,2019-01-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people here are very genuine and just good people to be around.  While you need to go after your own growth, leadership is very willing to support you and is focused on providing recognition for hard work.  It's exciting to be part of a growing company where everyone is passionate about the work we're doing.   My boss is invested in my growth.  For the first time I can honestly say I love my job!","We have our growing pains and there is a lot of internal progress that needs to be made.  I am confident we'll get there as in my 6 months I've already seen a lot of positive improvements.  We also need more women in leadership, which is top of mind and I hope to see that improve in 2019."
51,Inspire11,Culture & Balance,2018-03-08,5.0,Solution Owner,"Breath of fresh air.... consulting is consulting. Everyone knows the work is challenging, rewarding and at times demanding.
