0,Klaviyo,"Finally, a company that practices what it preaches",2021-11-19,5.0,Senior Program Manager,"Klaviyo is a company that literally puts their money where their mouth is. From a comprehensive onboarding program to benefits that think outside the box (learning stipends, wellness initiatives, business coaching - the list is endless), it is clear that Klaviyo truly believes that employees are their most valuable asset. 

Additionally, the culture here is tremendous. I have felt nothing but welcomed and accepted since the moment I started interviewing, and that has not gone away since I officially joined the company.

Accepting the offer here feels like one of the smartest decisions I have made in a very long time.",None that I can think of.
1,Klaviyo,Good place for sales,2022-02-28,5.0,Outbound Business Development Representative,"Has a very good sales org, very aggressive targets but as a BDR fairly easy to hit quota",Not a huge fan of the management
2,Klaviyo,"Epitome of the ""Carrot on a stick""",2022-03-16,2.0,Account Executive,Great engineering team that is making constant iterations to product to better serve customers and actually follows up on roadmap promises,"Inexperienced sales middle management with little to no experience in actual selling themselves. The fast tract for promotions in 2018-2020 lead to a group of sales leaders who were directionless and actually promoted poor sales practices that I felt lead to a step back in my sales acumen and career tract. 

While interviewing, I was so excited about the potential for an IPO, I was convinced to accept a 10k cut in base and 17k cut in OTE. Their feedback was ""Our highest level of sales management are taking cuts, so you shouldn't feel bad doing so"". Never take a step back like this in your career! It was one of my worst mistakes and the promise of an IPO is never assured. 

Majority of sales team I haven spoken with recently are considering leaving

The market is highly competitive, moving to all-in-one tools and Klaviyo doesn't seem to be keeping pace with companies like Attentive 

Hyper transactional, as an entrepreneur AE you'll like be expected to close 35-40ish deals a month. Worked from 6am to 10pm some nights as I was handling territories from every section of the globe. 

Sales comes second to everything else within the company. Originally the founder didn't even believe in having a sales team, wanted this to be a ""self-serve"" model and that attitude against salespeople seems to still prevail within the culture

Cliquey, high-school type of culture"
3,Klaviyo,Outward Image Doesn't Match what's going on,2022-03-09,3.0,Onboarding Specialist,"-Company Match 
-Fun and competitive product 
-Education stipend and generous book reimbursement 
-Super fun people to work with","Honestly, their outward image makes it seem so much better than it actually is. When I first got hired, I couldn't believe that this company hadn't gone public yet. Now, I get that they do not have their stuff in order. Lack of leadership decision making that is not based around sales. 

I should have known to run when I saw that one of their values is ""customer comes first."" Seriously, that is a value. It's basically saying that they put money over their employees since the customer is the business. 

As other reviews have mentioned, time and time again, capacity is an issue. What do they keep doing? Scaling sales and not having it match customer success to support these sales. Teams are stretches thin, then people quit, and then stretched even thinner. 

Do they train their sales to set proper expectations? No. Do they keep sales accountable for this? You guessed, it. Nope. Who suffers? Customer support. 

What is honestly super disappointing is that the pay scale is in comparison to our competitors. It's about a 20k difference. And you know what? That's enough alone to make someone leave. 

There is not rhyme or reason for promotions. During a town hall, leadership mentioned that the expectations was about every 2 years to get promoted. They didn't mention about experience, projects, etc. Yet then, other teams people get hired in about a year. 

More importantly, they were supposed to roll out compensation bands and sure enough they withdrew that project.

So far, this is a smoke and mirrors and I'll be looking for a job elsewhere."
4,Klaviyo,Honestly? It's just okay,2022-02-08,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Decent compensation package, benefits
Strong sense of ownership over work
Lots of opportunity to make an impact
Meaningful investments in R&D financially and otherwise","Severe lack of transparency from upper management when it's touted all the time as one of our core values
Career growth pathways are not always the most clear
Product is often over-ambitious with what can actually be delivered by engineering
Burnout has been brought up time and again as an issue and management doesn't really seem to care
Outward image seems to be more important than making sure people are happy and taken care of"
5,Klaviyo,One of a kind,2022-02-02,5.0,Director,"- Successful product with lots of opportunity 
- DEI is not just lip service: the company has doubled but improved representation and leadership is bought in to keeping the momentum 
- Unique opportunities to try new things and grow your career 
- Our CEO is the first one I've ever worked for who is truly a good human being who cares about the people
- The energy here is really human and authentic but still smart and quick",- A lot of the cons are not unique to us given how quickly we are scaling but prioritizing is hard for folks who are ambition and care because there is so much that can be worked on
6,Klaviyo,By far the best company I have worked for,2021-08-12,5.0,Software Engineer,"Competitive pay.
So much to learn.
The company strongly values career growth.
Promotions and hires are based on real results rather than nepotism or politics. I Feel that those in hire positions have earned them.
As a general principle The company is focused on scalable solutions rather than meeting immediate needs that will run into issues later.
Everyone I have met has been pretty humble.
The company does try to learn from its mistakes rather than repeat them.
Does care about its customers and employees.
In general it feels very real. In many places those who talk a lot and speak up get better results where here they try to cater to everyone including the more soft spoken individuals who still contribute just as much.
Well funded.","Fast paced isn't for everyone. Some of those may have a harder time here if they just want to coast. It's typical for fast paced companies to change frequently. So if you do not like change it may not be for you.

Since it is growing so fast there are still legacy systems that need to be replaced.

The company is very liberal. If you are a conservative you will want to keep that to yourself. I am conservative (only in some ways) and have not had an issue but feel if I expressed anything I would get some really weird looks.

Not a con but it is no longer a real startup. There are a lot of people at the company."
7,Klaviyo,"Lots of promise, not much follow through",2022-03-15,2.0,Sales,"Good product that is well liked within the space

My biggest concern was what it would be like to be a remote employee since there's a three hour time difference. Fortunately, my team has been very accommodating, moving stand-up meetings and things of that nature to times that are comfortable on my end.

The product has room for improvement, but it has a strong foundation. Having gotten more familiar with it, I'm surprised that Klaviyo isn't a more well-known name. The company is growing very quickly, so it's a really exciting time to join.","I don't really have anything to write here, honestly."

Place: Klaviyo has all the startup perks you want (free snacks, lunch on wednesday, cold brew on tap, beer in the fridge, unlimited vacation etc) without the drama that is sometimes associated with that startup culture.

-Your ideas get listened to and if you work hard and take initiative you can have a huge impact on the company
- Everyone who works here is smart and hard working -- I've never worked with such a fantastic group of people
- Great product that's only getting better
- Nice office space near Post Office square convenient for commuting, kitchen stocked with snacks, free lunch on Wednesday and beer in the fridge on Fridays.
- Leadership does a really good job of celebrating success of employees and also helping to solve problems when they arise","Not much, typical start up stuff. We could have better and more formalized training, but we're working on that. Salaries are good, but one could argue that you could probably make more somewhere else in the city working for a larger company-- but this is nit picking because if you're looking for a start up culture, with all of our benefits, then you probably wouldn't be interested in working someplace like that anyways. 

Lastly I'd say that you have to be the kind of person who likes to come in and work hard and give it all you've got, it's not a slow paced environment where you come in at 9 and leave at 5 every day. Not that there's a work/life balance problem here but if you're not interested in working hard, occasionally late if needed, then this isn't the place for you."

But I can't emphasize it enough — when it comes to the company, the people, the mission, the strategy, Klaviyo has it all. They genuinely care about their employees, they have good benefits, they pay well, and they are really transparent with their employees. I was most impressed by the CEO, Andrew, who takes the time to get to know everyone and is genuinely appreciative of what everyone does. Klaviyo took care of me, which is why I'm writing this review. It's a great company to work and they hire the best of the best. If you want to solve hard problems, go to Klaviyo.","- You need to really like ecommerce. If you don't, it's tough to get behind the mission."
104,Klaviyo,Rare Opportunity,2018-02-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"-The company is growing crazy fast and doing it in a sustainable way, with extremely ambitious goals.

-Working with incredibly intelligent, genuinely kind and collaborative people.

-Level up your skill set. Expectations of Klaviyos are high; you will be pushed out of your comfort zone. You will work hard. You will be expected to own your work and you will feel amazing when you realize you are capable of much, much more than you thought.

-Expand your skill set. With fast, lean growth, there is inherent opportunity to do things you wouldn't have the chance to do at a vast majority of companies. 

-Klaviyo is fast becoming known for the incredibly talented people who work here. Working at Klaviyo will open many doors for you well into the future.","With the blistering pace of growth, there will be some growing pains - that comes with the territory. There are a lot of areas Klavyo is still figuring out what works and what doesn't, more or less on the fly.  This can lead to quick pivots based on new information which can cause frustrations. Again, it comes with the territory of a company this size growing this rapidly; it's important to understand that before coming in."
105,Klaviyo,This company saved me,2017-07-25,5.0,Sales,"Everything. 

I came from a big corporate company, and there's just no comparison. The people at Klaviyo are genuinely kind, smart, and enthusiastic about their work. The environment and culture are welcoming, fun, and engaging. Management is awesome -- they work with you, listen to you, and help you grow. Everyone on the team offers to help you and wants to help you succeed.

There's free lunch every week, events throughout the year, an incentive to work hard, and plenty of reasons to stay. This is not a company where you go for a short period of time, try it out, and leave for something bigger and better. This IS what's bigger and better. A young start-up company making their way up to pass their competitors, growing rapidly and expanding, and also keeping their people happy. 

For the first time in a long time, I enjoy my work. I'm passionate about a company, I believe in a product, and I'm well-taken care of. Props to Klaviyo for winning in every way -- from our new hammocks in the office to the green bean bag chairs, to the people who stay past 7 pm on a Friday to hang out in the office and socialize.",Can't think of a single thing.
106,Klaviyo,Phenomenal growth trajectory with a lot of upside,2019-06-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"As a company Klaviyo has been on a red-hot growth curve for a few years and shows no signs of slowing, so it's a really exciting place to work. Add to this that they're doing it profitably and it makes it that much more impressive. I think they'll quickly unseat HubSpot as ""the"" tech company in Boston. They also pay above market rate in many departments, which is very nice.","Most negatives are results of their fast growth - can't hire fast enough, other departments can't keep up with the sales growth, things like that. Also some things are a little thoughtless, nothing crazy but an example would be all-company meetings every Friday at 4. These were fine when there were 30 people here, but now that we're pushing 300 it's pretty pointless. Also growing too quick for our office space, but moving soon so that's all set."
107,Klaviyo,Great company with unmatched sustainable growth,2019-04-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Klaviyo has a very concrete vision and an amazing product market fit. Long term, the company has massive growth potential. The culture is also great and this all starts at the top.

Not only is the product rock solid and continuing to grow in new and innovative ways, but it's easy to use and the customer base is amazingly passionate about being a part of the Klaviyo family. I've never seen anything like it.

The growth is amazing and I've seen us grow 100% YoY for the past 2 years and it's growing in a sustainable (profitable or break even) fashion, which is surprisingly unique in the software world.","With exponential growth comes growing pains. These are fun problems to solve and everyone at the company is aligned on pushing through these challenges, weather it be scaling the infrastructure, the customers we support or the continued revenue revenue growth targets."
108,Klaviyo,I talked to 35 companies before finding Klaviyo.,2017-01-12,5.0,Product,"Klaviyo is a unique culture. Every start up claims to want to move fast, be transparent, give people opportunity to influence the business and be fun. Fine. 

What's different here is that our CEO is incredibly intelligent and an exceptional software engineer. The team leads are passionate, selfless people who advocate for their teams and the business over themselves. If problems arise (let's face it, when you're growing 3-4x a year and scaling our backend systems to support 3x volume every year, that will happen) people don't point fingers - they swarm as a team to find the problem and defeat it. I've never felt so lucky to work so hard and see my sisters and brothers in the trenches right next to me, regardless of rank, past experience or responsibility.","Klaviyo is not for the faint of heart - you must be smart, you must be ambitious, you must care and you must want to build a pillar company in Boston. Otherwise, this won't be fun for you. If that first sentence motivates you, then let's go."
109,Klaviyo,Great place to learn and grow,2017-05-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been at Klaviyo for about a year. The team has grown a lot, and the leadership has expanded a lot at the same time. Andrew (CEO) and others are good at identifying problems and working to solve them. My coworkers generally all get along very well and help each other. They're good people to work with. Compensation is pretty good compared to other companies I've worked at / my friends work at now. Not the highest but pretty good. I like my manager a lot, they listen well, take feedback, and help solve my problems.","We have a lot of long hours and stress, but it's getting better. Benefits are getting better, a year ago they weren't great but they've been making good improvements to them."
110,Klaviyo,Thriving Company,2019-01-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The CEO is not only invested in the success of his people but is actively engaged with making sure we have the best product on the market 

- Employees are treated with respect and have the autonomy to try new process and fail. 

- Upper Management treats employees with respect 

-Groundbreaking product with extremely high customer reviews. 

-Challenging culture that allows you to constantly remain on your toes.

-Weekly company town halls ensure every employee is up to date on what's happening across the organization.","- A quickly growing company means that there are currently few processes in place. If you are process driven, Klaviyo isn't the right place for you. If you like having a say with implementing new efficient processes, Klaviyo is perfect."
111,Klaviyo,Arguably the best place to work in Boston,2018-01-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I could tell from the moment I set foot in the door at Klaviyo that this is not a “normal” company.  This is a company of sharp, driven, hungry individuals that want to see the company succeed in delivering the best product in its category.

It is VERY difficult to get hired at Klaviyo, and for a good reason.  Leadership selects only the most talented and collaborative individuals around Boston to be part of a fantastic team.

Many have mentioned in their reviews how they work with smart, talented people.  While I agree with this sentiment wholeheartedly, what continues to impress me is how kind all of the people you work with are.  People go out of their way to help their fellow ‘Klaviyos’ succeed and this is why the company is so successful.  Management also works tirelessly to celebrate these successes and employs many creative ways to thank employees.

People work long days but also take time to have fun with their colleagues.  Beer Fridays, games of ping pong, card and board games are a natural occurrence at Klaviyo without any forcefulness or pressure.  Participation comes completely organically because you love the culture the moment you set foot in the door and you want to celebrate the successes of your peers.","Some people just don’t want this type of work culture, and this is understandable because no two people are the same.  

I’d say that if you are looking for an organization with a startup culture that you can have a significant impact on, there is no better choice than Klaviyo in Boston.  If you are not looking for a startup, or you are looking for a 9 to 5 job and nothing more...this is not Klaviyo."

Everyone has freedom to spin up servers they need and spend time researching and learning new technologies. The product team was excellent to work with as an Engineer, and they allowed Engineering to have a lot of input into the roadmap.

Come here to learn a lot about distributed systems, all Amazon web services, and the email sending pipeline integrating into ecommerce. You will learn a great, helpful amount to enable you for your next role.","There needs to be prioritization into the following R&D principles to make the team world class:
* Aligned dev environments: right now there are 5 different independently designed systems and bug recreation & new local feature implementation  is challenging
* Product team leaders need more experience: more experienced leaders could help design better UIs and hold more rigid stances on goals & roadmaps
* Chocked-full of 1st-time startup employees: this is dangerous because without careful attention burnout can be produced & inefficient systems of operation
* Not an attractive start-up for financial gains: stock prices were always expensive and the plethora of shares handed out to Engs mostly cannot be afforded by them, and hopefully AMT will not bite them later (many of them do not understand AMT so this is scary)
* You'll have to work days, sometimes late at nights, and be on call. It's very difficult for the company to understand work-life balance, and that's clear when you hear about the CEO even working during his wedding."

I have made many friends here and everyone is so kind.","Sadly I am noticing more and more that there becomes favourites for Managers to choose for project time and again. We are always encouraged to get involved and be part of things, but this is often overlooked for the usual people or Manager friends.

Expectation when having a lot of accounts is not always realistic and no matter how often you raise this, it's never really taken seriously.

Micro Management is often a frustration. We do the work and work long days, yet still do not feel trusted!

Opportunity to be promoted is a tick box, rather than how good you might be at your job sadly."
