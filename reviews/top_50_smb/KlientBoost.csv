0,KlientBoost,"Fun, Fast Paced Career with Incredible People and Benefits",2022-03-31,5.0,Inbound Growth Specialist,"Working with and for people who genuinely care about your well being, goals, future. Our sales team has big expectations, don't get me wrong. BUT - they are always willing to learn with you, check in on how things are going, and make sure you are happy! I love my sales team, I love our managers. I love that I am surrounded by happy, hardworking people.","This company moves fast, which I love! They are constantly looking for ways to improve, you have to be willing to be okay with change and not be afraid to voice your feedback."
1,KlientBoost,"A fun workplace culture that values curiosity, learning + development, honesty and contribution",2022-03-30,5.0,Account Coordinator,"* KB really invests in each employee- in both their personal and professional lives. They are invested in building each employee's professional skills through ongoing in-house digital trainings- diamond standard systems, blogs, and Lessonly assignments-. They offer reimbursements for educational workshops, conferences etc if it is applicable to your position. They are also invested in your personal wellbeing- KB offers a free library of inspirational + motivational books on managing finances + investing, building leadership skills, how to be the best version of yourself, etc.
* You are in charge on your own success. No micromanaging by leadership. By no means is working at KB easy (the business is constantly evolving and you must easily adapt to changes), but if you work hard and thrive in your role, you are rewarded. Note- this might not be considered a *pro* for everyone. In fact, if you need handholding, KB is probably not the right company for you.
*Flexible work environment and hours. Ability to WFH or go into office
* Awesome perks- Friday lunches, happy hours, game room, wellness reimbursement, paid holidays, company outings/celebrations, unlimited PTO to name a few
* Regular Check ins and on-going feedback. A lot of companies promote a 360 feedback culture, but don't actually walk the walk. KB walks the walk
* Company connection- with offices across the US and many employees working from home, its sometimes difficult to connect to your peers in a meaningful way. KB hosts bi-weekly ""donut dates"" to connect you with someone in the company for a 15+ minute fun chat or outing.
*Community Give Back Opportunities- KB recognizes how important it is to give back to the community. KB provides opportunities for staff to participate in local food, hygiene, clothes and toy drives for organizations like Toys for Tots and local shelters.",* Workload can sometimes be overwhelming. Time management and knowing when to ask for help is key
2,KlientBoost,"When everyone works hard, everyone benefits.",2022-02-09,5.0,Director of Paid Strategy,"‚úÖ Have you ever wondered what it's like to jump on the rocket and soar to the moon? Working at KlientBoost, no matter what role you're in, will always feel like the success of the company is your success too. The honest and transparent communication on the growths and struggles will always be shared so you can feel like whether you're employee number 1 or number 100 you are a part of the team.
‚úÖ You've probably heard... we go big. There is no such thing as impossible at KlientBoost and it really does show in the craziest ways. Random full company trips to Vegas, casino-themed Christmas parties, training and traveling for Spartan races, the whole works. If you've ever dreamed of working at a company that does yacht parties and trips to Hawaii more often than not, KB is your place.
‚úÖ Very human, very supportive leadership. Unlike any other I've ever seen. People who value their employee over the client.
‚úÖ Ever-changing environment so you definitely will not get bored.
‚úÖ Learn as you go, as long as you're always continually improving, KB understands you're human.
‚úÖ New comp plans (coming soon) will better reflect performance. Paid not necessarily just for your time. As an Account Manager and Paid Strategist, it's easy to increase your base salary and get bonuses as you go.
‚úÖ Work as a team, you always have someone you can brainstorm with or ask questions.
‚úÖ Work-life balance is for real here. You may work late sometimes, you may log off early sometimes, you may take two weeks off without any access to the internet sometimes, you may answer emails while you're on PTO sometimes. It's all about balance and KB provides the flexibility to do that. Your dog, your family, your well-being are important and the flexible schedule makes it easy to put those things first.
‚úÖ Not just a 9-5, you're a contributor to something that is ever-changing and growing. With the feedback loop, it's more than just an open-door policy. You have a say in what the future of KB looks like because you can speak up and make change.","‚ùå Did I mention the ever-changing environment? üòÖ Positives and negatives can come from this. Things can change so fast, too fast even, sometimes that it feels like 1 step forward 20 steps back. Having the patience to see things through and the optimism when trying new things is SO important.
‚ùå There's a high level of empathy and respect that is needed to work here. There's so much that is going on at one time, it can be much more stressful if you feel like you're going against the flow. You MUST be able to respect each other and work together.
‚ùå The culture is everything. If you're looking to work 9-5 and not be a part of the culture, in your own unique and quirky way, then you will probably just find the culture annoying. The way to get the best out of working at KlientBoost is to be a hard-working and highly-engaging person!
‚ùå Have you ever felt like you're drowning? Some weeks may feel like that working at KlientBoost. It's not easy work and can sometimes be a tad bit overwhelming. Expectations are high. Time management is necessary. You'll grow super fast working here both personally and professionally, however, you have to be able to handle the potential intermittent stresses that come with the job if you plan to be here long term. And we really hope you do choose to do that with us!
‚ùå Lastly, the biggest thing that probably attributes to the above stressors is that KB is a growing company. We're learning as we go. We do prioritize our employees, however, we also have extremely high expectations. We're pushing and resetting the bar every single day. There will be a lot asked of you, and you'll get even further if you can do all of that and then some. Those who say yes to new challenges, want to continue to push your limits and show big resiliency when things go wrong will do well here."
3,KlientBoost,Very lucky to be with KlientBoost,2022-01-25,5.0,Director of CRO,"Joining KlientBoost is the best decision I have ever made for my career. A perfect amount of challenge to stay interested, along with great growth opportunities. But the #1 best thing about KB is the culture. Work Hard, Play Hard mentality. We have such a diverse mix of brilliant minds collaborating on every team that will make you want to get better at what you do. I feel like it would be impossible not to grow here. You would really need to try...

It's very rare to find an employer that REALLY cares about every teammate. A place that listens and is receptive to feedback and growth. Leadership that enjoys critique and seeks it. Management that is proactive about employee happiness. I always say people shouldn't work here as a first job, because you really need to have some experience to understand how lucky and valued we are here. I consider being a leader at KlientBoost to be an honor and a privilege.",Not sure this is even a con... but this is not the place for people who need an excessive amount of handholding. We have amazing leaders who are here to help you grow. We have great training and courses (and we're always making them better). There are a ton of resources at your disposal for any struggles that may arise. If you need to be micromanaged and require someone looking over your shoulder all the time this might not be the best environment for you. Hard and smart workers will thrive here.

Literally everything from fun, healthy living challenges to financial advisory opportunities! Not to mention the synonym for culture is quite fun :) (P.A.R.T.Y.)

- Grow your knowledge base to the maximum with leaders who selflessly guides and challenges the team in efforts from everyone to become subject matter experts.

- Feedback is of most importance. Honest, constructive feedback is ALWAYS welcomed and ALWAYS looped back with supportive response and action.","It's not a personal con, but working across time-zones can be challenging for some new people or, those unfamiliar with the industry."

10,KlientBoost,KlientBoost is exactly what I was looking for in a company!,2021-09-29,5.0,Senior Campaign Manager,"KlientBoost has been exactly what I was looking for in a company. Leadership cares about employees and their opinions, and consistently asks for feedback on themselves, and the systems/processes within the company. On top of this, they make work/life balance a priority for employees and are extremely flexible when it comes to the random life situations that naturally pop up from time to time. 

The company is constantly focusing on growth and improving both internally for employees, and externally to give clients the best possible experience. I always feel like the KB team has my back, and I've even seen that when clients aren't treating fellow employees as they should be. Management steps in and makes sure it's known that KB employees should be treated well and professionally. 

Lastly, I have learned a ton since joining the team. The KB Academy has a plethora of lessons and strategies you can learn to apply to the different digital marketing platforms that we work with. I'm consistently learning and growing and it's fun to know I might learn something new each day here at KB!

I can't recommend KlientBoost enough as one of the places that actually back up the notion that they are a great place to work!",I don't think there have been any cons or red flags for me during my time at KlientBoost. I will say that there are a lot of moving parts and you have to be willing to put in the time to learn and grow in the areas you know you need to improve in order to be as successful as possible!
11,KlientBoost,Great place to work,2021-09-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Incredible team where everyone feels like family
- Strong desire to always be better. If things can be improved, they are open to exploring how solutions could benefit the whole company.
- Strong leadership that is always available & willing to help whenever possible","- Remote work has made getting to know everyone on the team difficult, although those you do get to know are like family, as mentioned above."
12,KlientBoost,Supportive Team and Approachable Leadership,2021-09-15,5.0,CRO Designer,"The design team at KB is one of the most supportive and hardworking teams I've ever been on. It makes for a really great experience! The overall company culture is fun, and there is a big value placed on creating a community within the workspace. It's great to feel known! KB leadership is always striving to grow and improve, and make their people feel heard in the process.","The company is growing FAST, and things can get really fast-paced. That being said, the leadership is always open to feedback and in my 5 months here I've seen them take my feedback and make changes accordingly. While things can get busy and stressful, you also have a team to back you up if you are willing to ask for help and strategies to manage your workload."
13,KlientBoost,Truly exciting place to work,2021-08-19,5.0,CRO Strategist,"Benefits are the best of any company I've worked for. 

Feel valued as an employee and there are built-in systems for feedback and praise.

Hard work is noticed & mistakes are allowed to be learning opportunities.

Complete autonomy over my work.

No shortage of support and camaraderie.

CEO is incredibly generous with both resources and time.

Exciting vision and growth.","Although work/life balance is said to be important, it's not often doable because of the workload.

Party environment can be a little much at times.

Some expected growing pains."
14,KlientBoost,An agency that cares about YOU,2021-08-12,5.0,Account Manager,"Klientboost has given me autonomy and opportunities since day 1. Unlike other agencies I've worked at, KB listens to your feedback and implement change. 

Worklife balance is part of the culture and going to the office is a party every time. It's also insanely awesome to work with a company that actually has best practices in place. Everyone is working in the same way and knows their stuff, making it easier to level up your skills. 

Another big pro is that getting real results for clients is the norm. KB does a great job of vetting the right clients that are a fit of digital, making the work you do very rewarding and a healthy challenge.","The account manager role is built on several systems so be prepared to spend most of your day in Asana and on calls. If you are not extremely organized, this job can quickly get overwhelming. 

Also, like most jobs, you will continually be pushed to take on a full load of clients so you might need to do a late-night every once in a while to get everything done."

Awesome perks, Awesome CEO, Awesome colleagues.

Promotions are based on the individual and their accomplishments and their fit for the job - not on politics. You're also recognized for your achievements and each person celebrates your success. 

The people working at KB are immensely talented, hard-working, and driven. Each and every person takes such pride in their work and contributing to the stellar reputation that KB has. They recruit top talent and help further develop each individual in their personal and professional life. The company promotes health & fitness and well as learning new industry tools & techniques.

All in all, there are amazing perks and the culture is second to none! The youtube videos are true... we do have that much fun - but we do work hard as well.","Because the company is still relatively new, they don't have all of the systems and processes in place as an ""old company"". Each quarter they actively work to improve and add additional processes to streamline and make things better. Upper management is always open to hearing new ideas from employees, even from employees in their first month at the company, and take reccomendations to make the company better.

In the past, I had troubles with getting support and upper management was open to listen and quick to make changes for the better."

- everyone I worked with was smart; wizards everywhere I could ask questions to 
- great culture: everyone‚Äôs fun (but professional), and it‚Äôs really like a big family 
- always room for promotion! I was given progressively better titles either 3 or 4 times in 1 year

- I learned a TON

31,KlientBoost,LOVE it here,2021-02-15,5.0,Marketing Coordinator,"I absolutely love KlientBoost. The people here are amazing - smart, kind, and funny! Many go above and beyond to help out and even teach you how some things are done. They offer great benefits - full medical, dental, and vision paid for and a 5% match to your 401k. The CEO, JD always finds ways to not only make everyone feel valuable but he also genuinely cares about everyone's life outside of work which I think is amazing and something not commonly heard of. So there is a work/life balance found here for sure. We also have monthly ""How can I be better for you"" HCIBBFY with your director in which your management hears from you on what or how they can better help you. Another amazing thing about this company other than the amazing employees and opportunities for growth is how diverse and inclusive they are. As of recently, I think the company has almost a 50/50 (for sure more than 40%) male to female ratio that is also reflected in management positions as well! I can't wait until we all go back to the office! Oh, they also are dog friendly too! And have food delivered Fridays, have a stocked up fridge and snacks as well. Can you tell how excited I am when we get the green light to go back to the office?!","This isn't their fault, it's more circumstantial that we're not able to enjoy the full office vibe of being together in person due to COVID.

It definitely feels like a place where you have control of your growth and leadership is there to make way for it.

In summary: work is fun and rewarding. Opportunities are abundant. There's a heavy focus on diversity and philanthropy.","There will be tough days but that's more due to the nature of the industry.

The entire leadership team are super welcoming and always willing to jump on a call to help you out. The training is a lot to take in but gives you a little taste of every aspect of the company, to the point where I feel like I have learned more in these past couple months than I did working years at my last job.","So far the only Con is working from home due to Covid. This company is full of a lot of fun and exciting people, so when you hear stories of how fun being in the office is it definitely makes you wish you could experience it.

- With the growth comes opportunity to scale your own career. I was a major beneficiary of this kind of growth where i got to rise to multiple roles and really find what I loved.
- Leadership that cares about where you want to go and what you want to do. I think this is one of the more rare things to find, so really appreciated always being heard and encouraged with whatever i was doing.
- 401K matching, everyday lunch, fun parties, just to name of few of the additional perks
- Very easy to be #1 in the office in ping pong.

45,KlientBoost,Amazing place to work!,2020-10-06,5.0,Account Manager,"Awesome CEO, wonderful team, fun and collaborative environment, competitive pay, and great benefits. Tons of opportunity to grow as well!",There are no cons that I can think of!
46,KlientBoost,Amazing company!!! Plenty of growth opportunities ahead!,2020-09-29,5.0,Growth Strategist,"Ok... I have almost 10yrs of business experience and have worked at a few different companies in my time (I know I sound old), but seriously, KlientBoost is the place to be! 

The Founder & CEO has built an army of driven employees by continuously investing back into the business and not just in the form of office lunches, snacks, games, etc....

...instead, by investing in creative, like-minded, driven, and talented individuals who push each other on a regular basis. The young company culture of the aforementioned character traits is really what's intrinsically inspiring. That, and being treated as an adult having autonomy rather than a child helps too. 

Of course the office renovations and prizes are fun, but that's just icing on the cake. Besides, I'd rather work for a company that invests back into their employees than not. 

Not only is KlientBoost constantly raising the bar in the PPC world, but have also added more services to help better serve their clients which has also increased many employees' earning potential. 

As the saying goes, ""If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room"" and KB keeps leveling up so you'll be hard-pressed to be in the wrong room.","Not really a con, but you have to have a sense of humor to work here. If not, you're in the wrong place (and likely won't get hired anyway). 

The only real ""con"" would be there's currently no 401k matching, but the benefits are 100% paid for. (days after this was written, there is a very generous 401k match)"

48,KlientBoost,"Great Company, Great Culture, Even Greater People",2020-09-04,5.0,Account Manager,"I had always heard great things about Klientboost and their reputation as a company, their culture and the people. Working at KB, I have absolutely confirmed everything I had ever heard or been told. 

- THE COMPANY: KB is a highly respected PPC agency because they get clients tangible, repeatable and proven results that make their clients more money. If you are looking to enhance and hone your PPC knowledge, KB is the best place to do that at. KB truly cares about, invests in and takes care of their employees. They give you all the tools you need to succeed and if you are willing to work hard and be open to learning and new ideas you can be very successful. 

-THE CULTURE: The culture that the owner and senior management has established at KB is awesome. It is a culture that breeds success from hard work but also a ton of fun. They truly have a work hard, play hard mentality. Everyone at KB is trusted to ensure their work is handled and there is very little to no micromanagement which is a breath of fresh air in comparison to agencies I have worked at in the past. They encourage a great work/life balance. Management understands that if employees are happy with life outside of the office, they will be better employees inside the office. 

Senior Management genuinely wants to see everyone succeed and they show that by providing employees with weekly training for growth, companywide shoutouts for awesome work done by the team and quarterly employee reviews so employees always know how they are doing.

-THE PEOPLE: The people are one of the best aspects of KB. Super fun and tight knit group of people that make work fun and enjoyable every day. Everyone checks their ego at the door each day and wants to work hard, learn as much as possible, provide incredible results for their clients and have a ton of fun together at the same time. 

Overall, I would recommend Klientboost as a company for anyone looking to further their marketing career, work hard, learn a ton and have a blast at the same time. KB is a fast growing company that I am proud to be a part of.",None that I can think of. Except for COVID not letting me fully enjoy the office experience at KB at the moment.

CEO That Takes Risks For His Employees","Kind of a pro also, but CEO is brutally honest and transparent, if you can't handle that, you might be a bit surprised talking to him. Personally I appreciate it but I can think of personality types that wouldn't.
When there are new systems and ideas for the company, they are sometimes implemented incredibly quickly."
50,KlientBoost,Place for Growth,2020-08-27,5.0,Director,"If you want it and are willing to work for it, you will be able to actually grow your career rather than just dream about it.",Not being in the office right now is a major bummer.
51,KlientBoost,This company is ran like a fraternity,2020-08-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The money can be good, but you'll have to work 60+ hours per week. If you have other obligations such as family, school, hobbies, health, don't bother applying. You'll make a measly salary while you work your butt off for 40 hours.

- The independence you have to do your job is nice. No one is really breathing down your neck other than your clients.","Where do I even begin?

- Management lies constantly. To the employees, to clients, and themselves. Horrible or too high of expectations are often set with clients prior to them onboarding, which typically starts the relationships off very rocky.

- The CEO is an incompetent, manipulative, lying salesman type. His knowledge of business is virtually null. He's a total Gary V wannabe, except he'll never actually become that like he thinks. He's a fraud.

- Firing people during COVID, while giving them false promises of when they'd get rehired, and buying nonsense items for the office like scooters totaled for $8,000, along with arcade machines. Keep in mind, DURING COVID. That money could have been a cushion to keep several employees around until everything geared back up.

- The office culture is basically a fraternity. The team is made up of mainly men, and men who are more about playing ping-pong and drinking a cold beer with the other boys on the outside patio more than they are concerned with getting their job done.

- The senior management is an absolute joke. Talk about incompetent. The select few fellas who were promoted to senior or director positions are VERY close with the CEO. Essentially, if you drink the kool-aid enough, he'll reward you and make your job very easy. Directors do almost nothing in a day's time. They don't handle any accounts, yet somehow are never available to help the account managers that they're supposed to be managing. Every director is younger than 30 years old. One as young as 24. They have no real world experience when it comes to supervision. The CEO expects them to pick it up as they go, but with past management experience myself, it's not a walk in the park. They were lucky to have been hired when KlientBoost was in it's very early stages, so they were inevitably given the position due to having the time to become buddies with the CEO (Johnathan Dane.)

- The directors are rewarded far greater than any other employee. He has bought them brand new iPhones, tickets, gift cards, etc.

- The CEO illegally incentivizes clients with cash or gift cards in exchange for a lengthy positive review on Google and other platforms. If you read the reviews, you'll notice how every single one is extremely long and so praiseworthy. Any negative review has been smothered by the hundreds of falsely given positive reviews he has paid for.

- The retention rate for clients is not healthy. So why aren't there more negative reviews? That is an FTC violation through and through. In the State of California, it is illegal to incentivize others to leave positive reviews for your company.

- There's always a camera on inside of the office. They have a dedicated videographer to record every second of Johnathan's life there at the office. I guess because he thinks it's eventually going to turn into a reality TV show or something. The videos get about 30 views each on YouTube, so I'm not really sure what the point of it all is. Probably to pad the CEO's ego a bit more. The CEO has openly said his goals in life are to be rich, and to be famous. Red flag there.

- The CEO can never be wrong. Many times in conversation, even when proving that he is in fact wrong on something certain, he tends to not apologize or admit his faults. This is a big problem of his, which unfortunately trickles down to management, because that's who they look up to and strive to be like. They think that his behavior is what is correct, so they attempt to mimic it."

In addition to that they are very work hard, play hard oriented. If you need a lot of hand-holding and rigid structure it may not be the best place for you due to the fast-changing nature of the industry and the get it done mentality that is prevalent at KlientBoost.

At other places I've worked at, I remember spending long hours at work trying to be the hero only to get wrecked by burn out and no satisfaction. 

Not here. Leadership recognizes people who put in the work and it shows. My goal has always been to never work for a company that prioritizes the bottom line over employee happiness and satisfaction. To never work at a place that feels ""corporate"".  Unfortunately, most companies created by an older generation are like that. 

Not this place. I definitely landed in the right spot when I came to KlientBoost. Dog-friendly, catered lunches on Fridays, chill work hours (if you actually get your work done) and everyone brings something interesting to the table. Anyone you talk to here can teach you something new that you probably didn't know before.

- Major family vibes (my co-workers have literally become my best friends)
- Flexible time off & freedom to work from home when needed
- Snacks & alcohol in the office
- Conference & business travel opportunities 
- Ping pong, foosball, video games, etc.
- Gym membership/personal training sessions paid for 
- Monthly catered breakfast & spontaneous company lunches out 
- Cool office space with comfortable chairs/couches 

All perks aside, Johnathan and the rest of the leadership team truly care about the company and employees. They love to see us all grow and give us the tools needed to succeed. 

The work is challenging (in a good way) but also rewarding when you work hard and get your sh*t done. :)","It‚Äôs still a young company, so kinks are getting worked out with scaling, which could cause some of us employees to feel overworked and stressed at times. With that being said, extra hours and hard work usually doesn‚Äôt go unnoticed. 

401k & Dental/Vision isn‚Äôt offered yet so hopefully those benefits are offered in the future."
86,KlientBoost,Ehh,2017-11-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"They pay you money for the ""work"" you do.","Video games are a problem in the environment. People would rather play games then get work done. I understand giving employees freedom but that only works if they act like adults. It is like working at a wannabe google. Not meant to be a compliment but they act as if we are extremely profitable. When in reality that is not the case. Workers need to realize that after work hours at 5pm would be an appropriate time to play. 

People do not care about the clients as much as they care about being liked by fellow employees."
87,KlientBoost,Amazing place. Amazing people.,2017-10-30,4.0,Account Manager,"KlientBoost has been the best decision I have made in my entire career to date. The team is filled with kickass people who not only like to have a great time but are also really great at their jobs. 

We get fancy macs, standing desks, snacks for days, coffee and kombucha on tap, and there is no discrimination if you would like to crack open a cold one with the boys. 

There is no such thing as micro-managing at KlientBoost and you can tell that management actually trusts everyone on their own since they allot us multiple work from home days a month and generous PTO. 

At the end of the day, KlientBoost is a family full of amazing people who all truly care about one another and anyone should consider themselves lucky to be a part of the fam.",The only pitfalls are no 401K or equity/stock options and insurance is not very good (no dental or vision & there are no fully covered plans anymore).
88,KlientBoost,I love my job!,2017-09-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"KlientBoost is easily the greatest company that I've ever worked for. Amazing workplace culture, flexible work environment, challenging, and stimulating work. It feels so nice to be a part of this growing company, and actually taking pride in your work. It is also very inspiring to work with such talented people. Your co-workers quickly become family here. It is truly an honor to be a part of the KlientBoost team.

Also ummm a million snacks/drinks and cold brew coffee on tap? Hell yeah!",I haven't experienced any cons.
