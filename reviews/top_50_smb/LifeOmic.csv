0,LifeOmic,Making a Difference,2022-01-14,5.0,Director of Strategic Business Development,I have worked at other great companies but all of them were based on building a business. LifeOmic is based on the idea of changing peoples lives for the better and the goal is to change all peoples lives thru better health and wellness. Everything is based on science and proof that it works through real data. I am living proof. LifeOmic products changed my life and the best part of that experience is as an employee myself and my associates get the satisfaction of helping people and changing their lives for the better through our work at LifeOmic.,"Only downside, is that health and wellness is so poor in the world today. Sometimes the problem seems overwhelming."
1,LifeOmic,Decent but not 5 stars,2022-03-21,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Preamble: 
Not a bad place to work, but like some other Glassdoor ratings, it's a bit hilarious that it's ""five stars"". This is why most people don't take the star rating on this website seriously and most of all the top talent in the industry use the blind app instead. 

Pros:
The CEO is a great guy. Very specific parts of the culture were a positive. The work life balance is pretty good.","There were some really strange software architecture and management decisions made during my tenure at the company which was indicative of jaw-dropping naivet√©.

The entire experience at the company is somewhat geared towards an outdoorsy, ""granula"" like personality, and if you don't necessarily love that kind of thing, you will be extremely uncomfortable at the forced twice-a-year work outings. 

Speaking of which, most of the culture was not amazing. There are some really positive things and people here, but it seemed way too complicated to get things done. It also didn't feel like I was working with top-of-the-line people in some very specific circumstances. If you have any experience with FAANG-like companies/culture than you will feel like you are on the junior varsity team when you work here."
2,LifeOmic,"Above average, but worse over time",2021-12-21,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Pre-pandemic - lots of fun activities, team building retreats, etc. Lots of opportunity if you're willing to sacrifice work-life balance. Hopefully this returns at some point.","- Mental illness is treated as a weakness. Don't work here if you suffer from mental illnesses.
- Demo driven development is most rewarded - leads to inefficient practices and stress/lack of appreciation for those not working on easily demoable work.
- Biggest perks aren't possible during pandemic
- Too many focus areas and products leads to small teams being stretched thin. In some cases, individual engineers having to split time over many areas.
- Equity is non-standard (profit units) which are difficult to reason about due to the many LLCs present and complex passthrough structure. In general, the equity structure is very opaque and I fear it may be possible for funds to be shifted around to benefit majority stakeholders instead of employees for certain scenarios.
- Below average benefits. Raises are tooth and nail to obtain. Performance and compensation don't always correlate.
- Hiring bar has dropped over time - lower output and expectations over time."
3,LifeOmic,"Great People, Good Company, but Mediocre Outlook",2022-01-07,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"You will have the opportunity to work with some great people and will learn a ton.

The company is engineering-driven.

Good benefits.

When the office was open...

Everyone had their own private office. Providing lots of privacy and time for focused work. 

Free lunches are provided once a week.

The company is invited on semi-annual retreats, which are fun, but also stressful.","Don, the CEO routinely asks everyone to submit a Glassdoor review. It's plausible this has resulted in an overly optimistic opinion on Glassdoor.

The leadership team is largely inexperienced in the healthcare industry. There have been some strategic hires, but since the majority of the company is non-healthcare it is difficult for them to implement the changes they need to make. 

An ever-increasing amount to do since the company pivots frequently.

Since Don fully funds the company, you are inclined to do whatever he wants you to do. This is reasonable in its own right but results in a strange dynamic.

The company offers incentive units instead of stock options. The claim is that they are less risky than stock options. But they are unproven and structured in a way to ensure that investors will make all of their investment back before you make yours."
4,LifeOmic,Amazing place to work,2021-10-22,5.0,Product Director,"After 3.5+ years LifeOmic continues to be an amazing place to work. We continue to hire experienced, talented individuals that work hard and are fun to work with. We definitely have a team mentality here and the understanding that when certain teams or product areas do well it benefits the entire company, which means people are always willing and able to chip in across multiple areas of the company. It's very much a ""can-do"" and get stuff done culture, but in a well thought-out manner and always focused on the broader direction and strategy of the company. Leadership is fantastic and models the type of culture we have and wish to maintain, where everyone has a voice and the best ideas are shared and implemented. Flexible working culture is very nice, especially for people with families and commitments, but everyone works extremely hard and makes sure they aren't letting the team down.","Fast pace (typical at a startup like this) can make it hard to stay informed of everything that's going on, but the team does a good job recognizing when this is happening and taking steps to remedy it."
5,LifeOmic,Really love working here!,2021-09-27,5.0,Video Marketing Manager,"LifeOmic is such a wonderful company to be a part of. The culture here is very healthy, positive and happy. They provide excellent benefits, a safe and respectful work place ethic and everyone is nice and friendly to each other. Everyone working here is truly passionate about their job so there's a natural enthusiasm that comes through. Help is always around the corner, people check in on you to make sure you're doing OK and don't need a helping hand with anything. There are no hard and fast rules and harsh demands from management but rather you are entrusted with your role, your tasks and your time-management. You're the keeper of your own responsibilities and discipline with getting your work done at the highest level and in a timely fashion. If you like being respected, friendly, a team-player and show up for your work passions in a disciplined way then you'll love working here!",I absolutely struggle to find cons to working here. The only feedback I would give is that diversity at the company could be improved. It would be really enriching to have people from more diverse backgrounds around to learn from and work with!
6,LifeOmic,"A good place to work, not perfect",2021-10-22,4.0,Software Engineer,"- Autonomy & ownership
- Lots of great people
- Interesting problems & industry
- Great tech stack
- Yearly retreat!
- Always trying to do better","- Spread very thin, some projects feel very understaffed
- CEO fanaticism, Don is great, but I think there's a borderline cult mentality
- Poor work / life balance for some, not all. There isn't anything making sure employee work life balance and mental health are okay. There's a great wellness program that supports physical health.
- Wrong things are rewarded, engineering excellence seems to be less rewarded in recent years
- COO is handles yearly reviews and he's very stingy and not involved in almost all engineering. Isn't very clear with how the reserved units work and doesn't have anywhere you can see your total vested options. Also, I have gotten poor responses when emailing the company after I left to see what options I have for documentation purposes."
7,LifeOmic,Great Company with an Engineering-First Mindset,2021-09-21,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"LifeOmic is a great place to work if you are a driven individual who is not afraid to jump in and start innovating without a ton of direction or oversight. It has a highly collaborative environment but you are expected to take charge of the tasks you are assigned and help shape and define what the final result will look like for the betterment of the project and company as a whole.

LifeOmic is poised to start making waves in the Health/Tech industry within the next few years. It has a ton of different product offerings and is all built around a well architected API made up of various microservices.

The culture is the perfect blend of nerds, scientists, and product managers that help foster an incredible environment rooted in healthy living and practices and inclusive of all who work there.

The work/life balance is excellent and upper management encourages employees to maintain this healthy balance.

Benefits are pretty good and the Salaries seem to be on par with the industry standards.",Everyone is expected to pull their own weight and help drive the company towards success. If you are looking for a place where you can just coast then this is not the right company for you.
8,LifeOmic,Great place to Grow and Learn about Really Important Things that Matter.,2021-10-21,5.0,"Director, Strategic Business Development","The team at LifeOmic is of the highest quality. If you like to work with really smart people that have a track record of success, then LifeOmic is the place for you. The mission at LifeOmic is to make a real difference in peoples health and lives and that is what you get to do every day. The things I have learned since working there have literally changed and saved my life. I can't say that about any other place I have worked.","Sometimes it is hard to stay on point because there are so many opportunities to work on really important and interesting projects. But in a way this is also a good thing, because many of the projects can benefit your own health and life."
9,LifeOmic,Great work and awesome company,2021-10-20,5.0,Senior Mobile Developer,"Lifeomic really looks after you as an employee. I have crashed at my CEOs house many times and he goes above and beyond taking care of the people who work for him.

The company retreats are unparalleled, caviar at 10,000 feet is no exaggeration (literally we did that this last year). If you're an outdoors person or want to be, the retreats are amazing.

The work is great and very meaningful. People are passionate and we all honestly think we're making the world a better place by improving healthcare on all fronts.","The tech stack can be hard to work with. If you're not big on Javascript (or Typescript) then it's probably not a good fit, we use AWS lambda extensively for better or for worse, react native on our mobile clients. We live on the bleeding edge which can be awesome but also incredibly frustrating."
10,LifeOmic,Great place to work!,2021-09-20,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Great company to work for. They are working on improving health outcomes for everyone from cancer patients and doctors, to general wellness for companies and anyone with a mobile app. They seem to only hire people who are both good at their job, but also easy to work with. I have learned a lot both professionally as well as improving my overall health as well. One of the best decisions I've made to join LifeOmic.","The only thing I can really think of to criticize would be that I wish we had more options for health insurance. They currently only offer an HDHP/HSA option, but I understand it can be tricky to offer more expensive options as a smaller company, and they do offer wellness incentives on top of the insurance, where they pay you extra if you do fairly simple things to improve your health (completely optional, and anonymous on the specifics of what you did)."
11,LifeOmic,You want to work here,2021-10-21,5.0,Product Designer,"- Wide array of products to work on
- Remote-friendly (work in the office as much or as little as you want)
- Great stand-up desks in office
- Great hardware
- Modern office design
- Great pay and benefits
- Free lunches once a week
- Great Indy office location right on canal
- Unbelievable all expenses paid annual camping retreat in Utah
- CEO is approachable and available
- Everyone is talented, smart and willing to help","Projects and priorities can change very quickly so if you're not mentally prepared to drop what you're doing and work on something else, this might not be the place for you."
12,LifeOmic,One of the best places I've worked,2021-10-21,5.0,Software Engineer,"For a self-motivated developer, this place is great. It's a small company and can feel pretty sink-or-swim a lot of the time, and an inexperienced developer would probably struggle, but most people with a couple years' experience should do fine. Management encourages devs to grow and challenge themselves, will pay for training, organize books clubs and things like that. The company culture is great, and very health-focused as you'd expect. The CEO is passionate, intelligent and seems very kind.","All engineers are required to do ""support rotations"" every ~6-8 weeks where you're on-call 24/7 for a week. It would be good to find a better system for this."
13,LifeOmic,Thumbs up!,2021-09-21,5.0,Principal Designer,"This company is unlike any other I've ever been at - it feels great to work on a product that is helping our users live better lives, to be surrounded by super smart & passionate people, & the leadership / team mindset has truly & consistently been to evolve our product to make it be even better for our users. I'm very thankful to be here.","Not a ""con"" - just something important to know if you are looking to join. This is a small company where most folks work mostly autonomously & are really good at what they do & get things done amazingly well. We work very collaboratively but also there is support & encouragement for areas that people want to grow into."
14,LifeOmic,Proud to be a part of this company,2021-09-27,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"LifeOmic is one of those companies that just does things right! They are leading the way in many innovative areas around health, wellness and improving patient care. The company employs a group of hard working, highly intelligent people and supports their innovation and diversity. The work is challenging, rewarding and always exciting. So very glad to be part of this organization!","Lots of things going on all the time - not the place if you are someone that needs a lot of guidance and structure.
No 401K match. 
Both of these are earmarks of most start-ups so not unexpected cons."
15,LifeOmic,Enough of the right motivation to keep me going,2021-09-27,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Still in early stage and yet to take outside funding, ownership is shared with employees in a unique LLC structure.
- More than just making money, the company is dedicated to helping humanity, if in some small way via health innovation.
- Independent, autonomous and self driven engineering culture.
- Amazing team-building retreats twice a year","Not really a con, but something to note depending on your preferred work style. There is almost no pair-programming or writing code together. This is understandable in a startup that needs to produce features as quick as possible and most pair-programming benefits are medium to long-term.
However, it can be hard to grow personally without opportunity to mentor or be mentored on a day-to-day basis."
16,LifeOmic,Company that cares,2021-09-20,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Engineering oriented culture using latest tech.
- Engineers are trusted here which means they get to take their decisions, and choose what to work on. 
- Summer retreats are fun and they help build connections which is especially helpful and important during covid times. 1 extra week of vacation each year to go to the retreats is very appreciated too. 
- Remote friendly.
- Individual offices. 
- Good pay.
- Wellness program that allows to get about a 3000$ bonus and stay healthy.",I wish all companies in the US provided 30 days of vacation or so. LifeOmic has 16 which seems to be the average for tech companies. Having more vacation would greatly improve my quality of life though.
17,LifeOmic,Engineering-driven culture,2021-10-20,5.0,Mobile Engineering,"The founder has intentionally built a culture where engineers can be happy and successful. The high trust, high autonomy, self-directed engineering environment is extremely motivating. The end result is that we attract talented engineers and build great products. Just about everyone I work with is smart, humble and hardworking.","A high-trust, high autonomy culture also comes with accountability. This is not a a good fit for engineers who want just pull Jira tickets. If you don't contribute at a high level, you won't be successful here."
18,LifeOmic,Incredible team + great culture + awesome mission,2021-10-20,5.0,Software Architect,"- The concentration of software engineering skill and experience is incredible
- Awesome culture, flexibility, engagement, empowerment, access
- It's hard to think of a more meaningful space to be in than precision health
- Great mix of learning about the *omics, yet being able to lean on our scientists to help drive features","We're still a small company at heart - this is not the place to mail it in :) Personally, I prefer it this way"
19,LifeOmic,Empowered Developers and Long-term Focus,2021-06-08,5.0,Technical Director,"LifeOmic is by far the best company I have ever worked for. The amount of trust and independence that is given to developers is unlike anywhere I've ever seen. You are expected to solve hard problems as a team, making whatever technical choices make sense. You are expected to maintain your own solutions and it leads to fantastic code quality.

The CEO has an unrelenting long term focus, never chasing short term distractions. Don is equally focused on developing the people in his organization, giving the time to build out the right technology platform, and pursuing long term customer relationships.

Because of the expectations and independence of the employees, the bar for hiring is high. It has led to a very strong group of people to work with. I can't imagine what it would take to get me to leave.","On a day to day perspective, no cons come to mind.

If you care strongly about a low deductible health plan, this might not be right for you. 

If you are looking for a place to coast in your career, this is not the right place for you."
20,LifeOmic,A Company that Gets It,2021-09-20,5.0,Security Engineer,"People want to be well, take care of themselves and their family, and feel like they're doing something of value. Well, that's possible at LifeOmic. The benefits are great, there's a ton of opportunities to contribute and grow. You literally earn a bonus by taking care of your health and using their app.","The vision is clear, but it's not clear how that's being translated into happy customers. Could use more communication around how the product is making an actual, not just theoretical, difference."
21,LifeOmic,Fun tech-focused health company,2021-07-11,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,The majority of LifeOmic's team is developers so there is a heavy focus on technology with freedom to experiment with new tools or just work in areas you aren't as familiar with. Everyone I have worked with here has been helpful in facilitating cross team code sharing as well as ensuring that there is a great developer experience that also enables us to ship with high quality. Outside of work the focus on health and wellness is refreshing and the retreats are a ton of fun. Also there is 401k matching now!,"The company is continuing to grow and it's common for short term goals to change each quarter.
As the company has grown it has been harder to follow along with what other teams are building"
22,LifeOmic,Truly Outstanding Company,2021-10-22,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"This is a company that genuinely cares about employee health and well being, and it's reflected in the generous and unique perks. When you work here you're surrounded by talented and productive coworkers, and you're given everything you need to get things done.","Unless you're uncomfortable working with accomplished teammates, I don't see any significant cons."
23,LifeOmic,Fantastic company culture and vision,2021-10-21,5.0,Anonymous,Strongest group of technical folks I've ever worked with. No egos or politics. Everyone just works hard trying to accomplish company goals.,"Like all startups, you have to be willing to do whatever it takes and be willing to wear multiple hats. This is actually a pro for me."
24,LifeOmic,Great place to work!,2021-10-20,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Great culture
- Working on things with very positive impact
- Modern tech stack
- Very tech focused
- Very talented developer pool, so lots to learn from and room to grow
- Everyone is helpful and easy to work with
- Diverse set of projects and areas to work on",- Not as many options for health insurance
25,LifeOmic,A true culture of caring,2021-10-20,5.0,Sales Executive,"Company is very supportive of employees, and does all it can to ensure that they are provided with necessary resources for a fulfilling life at home and at work.",I have only been here a few weeks but I have not encountered one downside yet.
26,LifeOmic,Passionate Team with Clear Vision & Empowering Culture,2021-09-20,5.0,Growth Marketing Manager,"Leadership is amazing - visionary, passionate, focused, and transparent. 

LifeOmic also provides great benefits and pay, opportunities for continued education, strong diversity, top-of-the-line technology, a great work-life balance, and truly meaningful work!","If you are looking for lots of guidance and structure, LifeOmic could be a challenging place to work. Be prepared to shift direction and learn as you go. You will need to ask if you're needing direction. Driven self-starters will thrive at LifeOmic!"
27,LifeOmic,Exiting Company,2021-10-20,5.0,Senior Mobile Software Engineer,"Open. Driven. High goals. Exiting vision.

We want to change the world while taking everyone for the ride. With all the that is expected and needed, they still understand the need of a work life balance.",Due to being a startup there is a bit of extra stress but its very exciting
28,LifeOmic,Innovative tech start-up with big ambition.,2021-11-03,5.0,Hospitality Manager,CEO and owner has a deep working knowledge of every position within the company.,There are so many things to accomplish and not enough time in the day.
29,LifeOmic,I absolutely love my job,2021-09-21,5.0,Growth Marketing Manager,"Experienced leadership, clear and meaningful company vision, above-market salary, worker autonomy, intelligent and collaborative co-workers, remote work flexibility, culture that incentivizes good health, very little time spent on administrative overhead and performance review processes, quick movement from idea into action",Inherent risks of working at a start-up (although these are minimized by the experienced leadership team)
30,LifeOmic,Enthusiastic Work Environment,2021-06-14,5.0,Software Architect,"LifeOmic provides an excellent work environment and an opportunity to work with a wide range of talented individuals. Everyone is aligned with their focus on building a great company that is bringing new ideas and solutions to the Precision Health, Wellness, and mobile markets.

Employees are encouraged to take on new challenges and work on original ideas. As an individual contributor you get a sense of ownership of your work, a lot of latitude to create solutions for LifeOmic's target markets, and a great team to lean on and collaborate with.

Excellent daily work flexibility and minimal management structure.",Typical startup mentality for productivity expectations that come with a smaller company doing big things (not necessarily a con). You need to want to thrive in such an environment. The LifeOmic differentiator is that everyone is very supportive and there is not that expectation of long grueling hours.
31,LifeOmic,Fantastic Company,2021-09-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been lucky enough to be at several great companies over my career, but nothing compares to LifeOmic. From having management that lets you adopt the latest software to going on a company-wide retreat in the Utah backcountry, it stands alone.","If you need everything spelled out for you in minute detail or you are resistant to change, this may not be a good fit."
32,LifeOmic,Outstanding Workplace,2021-10-22,5.0,Associate Software Engineer,My work is up with the times and feels like in makes a difference. My manager and coworkers have excellent communication and the company atmosphere is extremely positive.,Honestly I haven't had anything to complain about.
33,LifeOmic,Great Place to work,2021-10-21,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"* Flexible work hours
* Great co-workers and atmosphere
* Upper management cares about the company and the people who work here
* Fantastic benefits",Cons are small and not worth mentioning
34,LifeOmic,Awesome company,2021-10-21,5.0,Software Developer,Great company doing exciting work with incredible people. What could be better?,Fast-paced with high expectations. Not really a negative unless that's not what you're looking for.
35,LifeOmic,Love working at LifeOmic,2021-09-26,5.0,Communications Manager,"Great culture - lots of positive attitudes and an environment that fosters collaboration and communication. Over the last year, I've been able to work on a variety of exciting projects. I feel passionate about the work I do.",It can be fast-paced (but I like that).
36,LifeOmic,Amazing place to work,2021-09-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Transparent philosophy. Encourages everyone to contribute. New ideas are welcome. Creative and welcoming environment, with a goal of building inventive and useful software to better the lives of others.",Too many people working remotely. But company is encouraging people to return to office.
37,LifeOmic,Amazing place to work and help people reverse and prevent disease,2021-10-20,5.0,Director of Channel Sales,"Great leadership with a positive, supportive and enthusiastic team.",None that I have seen yet
38,LifeOmic,Great place to work,2021-04-21,5.0,Senior Product Manager,"- The company is truly product-led rather than sales-driven, which is refreshing in the current climate of VC overload
- You get the best of both worlds; a small start-up feel with little to no red tape and small, scrappy teams, but larger company benefits like 401k matching, a wellness program, competitive maternity/paternity leave policy, nice offices, etc.
- The culture encourages autonomy and taking ownership but also collaboration - good ideas come from anywhere and anyone can jump into anything.
- An annual all-company week long retreat to the Uinta Mountains! Totally optional, but well worth it.
- Working from home and flexibility is easy and a very accepted part of our team environment.","If you love the start-up environment, there would be no cons for you. Be prepared to change direction and move quickly! There's never a dull moment."
39,LifeOmic,Great Company,2021-10-20,5.0,Director,Great company to work for/with. An amazing group of individuals that work amazingly well as a team.,None. Come see for yourself!
40,LifeOmic,Best place I have ever worked!,2021-09-20,5.0,Software Test Engineer,The people here are amazingly talented. They are also fun to hang out with. Our company does retreats where we all get together. They allow employees to work remotely.,Nothing negative to share at this time.
41,LifeOmic,Best Place to Work,2021-08-26,5.0,Marketing Manager,I have never worked for a company or leadership team that cares for their employees as much as LifeOmic! The company culture is amazing and you get work with so many intellectually curious and hardworking people.,Lots going on! Many different products so if you want to laser focus on one thing it might not be the place.
42,LifeOmic,Great place to work,2021-10-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Amazing team and culture.
- Developer oriented company
- Great mission and products",Nothing I can think of.
43,LifeOmic,Loving everyday,2021-05-14,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I've never worked with a group of such hard working, intelligent, and inspiring individuals. Everyday brings new challenges and the expectation is set to grow and rise to the challenge with the help and support of a great team. In a short time I have grown exponentially and can't wait to see what the future holds.","This isn't really a con, just something to be aware of. We move quickly and face large challenges everyday. I wouldn't say its ""sink or swim"" because the company is supportive of the team, but there is a lot of emphasis on the individual to self-manage, learn on the job, and contribute. We set a high bar and I don't see that changing anytime soon."
44,LifeOmic,Best Place to Work!,2021-05-12,5.0,Senior Product Designer,"Amazing leadership, great benefits, great pay, lots of opportunities, best technology, impressive diversity, great products, meaningful work.","I had to really, really think about this one because it's all so great, but since I need to put something in this section, here it is: Health Insurance is a high deductible one. I've worked in companies where they provide you with an HSA with preloaded funds (based on individual or family) and I would say that was a better deal than what we have here. BUT, I will also say that we switched my family to this insurance because my husband's has less coverage and is about $350/mo more expensive than this one. So, not the worst! I'm very happy here!"
45,LifeOmic,Great company and culture,2021-09-22,5.0,Software Engineer,Mission driven company with clear leadership,Fast growing growing startup so it has some growing pains
46,LifeOmic,Great place to work and learn,2021-04-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I'd echo the no-ego culture of other reviews, as well as the talent and drive of employees. Folks here are smart, driven, and genuinely helpful to new people. You can tell that the company's goal is to hire great people and let them work, which is very motivating. The CEO has a clear vision for the company which he shares openly during all-hands meetings. Even though we are all on Zoom there is a strong sense that teams are aligned. I've been really impressed with everyone. There is a ton happening here with a team of only around 100!","If you need a lot of structure and direction, this could be a challenging place to work. You will need to speak up if you need help or direction. Self-starters will thrive here."
47,LifeOmic,Big Vision Company with Many Paths to Success,2021-03-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"LifeOmic is the best company I've worked for in my 20 years in industry, in culture, quality, and business potential. It has the vision for making big impact in both cutting-edge genomic medicine and personal health and wellness for millions. The company is strong in both science and tech. The culture is phenomenally positive, yet grounded in know-how and common sense. We are remarkably advanced in product maturity after only four years in business. The CEO has several prior successes under his belt, and it shows.","People who like the longer-term planning of a big company might not be comfortable here. LifeOmic maintains a great deal of business flexibility, which is awesome from my perspective, but not to everyone's taste. New products launched every year stemming from opportunity and creative employees, which means there's always a bit of a resourcing struggle."
48,LifeOmic,The company I always wanted to be a part of,2021-03-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The talent level is incredible yet the culture is ego-free, collaborative, empowered, friendly and committed to building innovative, high-quality software. 

The offices are all very nice and the environment is friendly for working remote / from home. The culture is very conducive to work-life balance. Employees are treated like responsible adults. 

The team is made of people that are a joy to work with every day. 

The retreats are epic.

We have already impacted the health of millions of people around the world - and we are only four years old.",Things move quickly. It is not a great fit for anyone that wants to hide in a slow moving company or political culture.
49,LifeOmic,Incredibly Talented Team,2021-03-22,5.0,Mobile Architect,"The talent here is just astounding. What we are able to produce quality and scale wise would not be possible without having such talented people. We use the latest technologies and practices and are never afraid to move things forward. Our process is very agile with a minimum of red tape. We are able to develop and deliver features very quickly. We rely heavily on automation to enable continuous delivery of updates. The culture is very inclusive, and there is a company-wide love of the outdoors, and leading a healthy active lifestyle. Also have to mention the company-wide epic outdoor adventures!","No major concerns.

Great Culture.,2021-03-22,5.0,Data Scientist,"This is a phenomenal place to work with an energetic team interested in building tools for people to live healthier lives through precision medicine, personal wellness, intermittent fasting, and scientific understanding! It has a great company culture where your work actually matters, and teams are not simply silos. Plus, you can know that you've got an excellent leadership that knows what they're doing and welcomes transparency across the entire company. The individuals throughout the company are a great group of both scientific and technical backgrounds but still prioritize teamwork--and not egos.",Those looking for a simple clock-in/clock-out and a paycheck likely won't be happy. These guys are builders and want to change the world--not be a cog in a huge machine.
51,LifeOmic,Where have you been all my life?,2021-04-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I mean... where do I even begin? 

My role is a bit unique at the company, as I am my own entity in a newly created position. I've had several jobs as a developer/engineer prior to my current position, as well as various other industries prior to LifeOmic and I can safely say that this is the best company I've been a part of. I felt spoiled by one manager I'd had previously, and my current manager is giving her a substantial run for her money.

The biggest award-winning quality is that the company truly does walk it's talk. Most roles I've had, I haven't been reminded daily of why we do what we do... which leads to the tendency to not be as engaged or passionate about the work and the mission. Not the case here. On a daily basis, I feel inspired and grateful to be a part of a company who truly is looking to help people be the best version of themselves. 

Complete flexible work from home options, which sometimes can be a challenge. But LifeOmic is clearly well-practiced and prepared and encouraging to everyone on the team. The company sets you up for success.

Our CEO and leadership team are highly transparent about the company as a whole, as well as day-to-day operations. No question is inappopriate or goes unanswered. Every bit of feedback is encouraged, considered and appreciated.

The amount of trust displayed by the company to simply get work done is incredible. Not sure why so many other companies micro-manage to the extent that they do, because that feels like a lack of trust. I can't trust and feel inspired and motivated to work to my max unless I feel that trust. This is the best example of it that I have ever experienced. 

The company truly walks their talk as far as corporate wellness, and even incentivizes monetarily those who elect to take part in the wellness initiatives. As an avid outdoorsman, I am thrilled that my passion is such a huge part of the company and the team.

On a personal level... how often do people in our culture not dread Mondays or are excited to get up and work every day? From my own experience, that is super rare. I can't wait to jump in every day and can't see myself working for anyone else.",".....not applicable (n/a feels like enough, but need to fulfill the requirements of at least 5 words)"

If you want to make help improve people's health or make doctors lives easier you are empowered to execute the best way you can. The development organization is a mix of experienced developers capable of leading while still staying incredibly technical and some more junior developers that exude a desire to learn and improve. If you are an enthusiastic developer, it will be hard to find a more welcoming and satisfying place to work.

Don, the CEO, is a very candid leader with a undeniable excitement for improving people's health and the possibility for LifeOmic to make a difference. He is relentlessly focused on delivering value to doctors and individuals and isn't afraid to make long term investments to see it happen. He is generous with his time and experience to help build up everybody around him.","Being a new company, the exact direction of the company is not always clear.

Even though we move quickly, we don't make a lot of the same mistakes as most startups. We are very focused on quality and security instead of simply getting something out there fast. Leadership is very insightful and they have done a good job of empowering developers.

Everyone is very careful about hiring strategically which has allowed us to avoid a toxic culture. Everyone seems to just want to get stuff done and there's not a battle of egos. Most (if not all) of my colleagues seem to love what they are doing and have a passion for helping LifeOmic succeed. There's a high level of teamwork and the collaboration has been refreshing when compared to larger companies.

I also have to mention that the founder has organized multiple team off-sites in Park City. We've done skiing, camping, rock climbing, hiking, and fly fishing. Of course, we also talk business. It's an awesome experience and I look forward to continuing this tradition.",The main downside to working at LifeOmic is that we have had to frequently pivot or change directions slightly as we gather market feedback. Luckily we have hired more industry and business experts so I think this will improve. I'm optimistic that we'll succeed but employees do need to recognize that the healthcare industry can be challenging (i.e. slow to change).
