- Great product and ambitious company.
- Transparent talent team. 
- Very well compensated.
- Flat structure with an open door policy.

1,LogicMonitor,Great Company,2022-03-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good work/life balance
Solid managers & AEs",401k matching is somewhat low
2,LogicMonitor,"Great Culture, Less Than Desirable Pay",2022-03-15,3.0,Software Engineer,"LogicMonitor has a great work life balance and the culture is also great. While the pandemic put a hold on lots of the in-office activities, people near the offices still have that benefit available to them. Lots of learning opportunities if you're willing to put in the extra time.","The pay is less than desirable. Many of my friends that have been around for years are leaving for jobs with 50% - 100% more pay. C level management seems to be brushing off the topic with no clear plan on how they will keep their employees. Valuable knowledge is lost in the process as new employees come in but senior members leave.

Stock incentive program is not clear at all with no clear picture as to what the actual worth of the stocks are. Newer employees are also getting less of it which is a shame. Eventually they will realize it's not worth as them made it seem.

Insurance plans keep getting more expensive year by year if you're covering family members.

Employees hired before 2021 are really feeling the pain of inflation, as they make less now than they did back when they were hired. With rising costs in living, transportation, food, this is not offset for existing employees. Existing employees are finding out how new hires are making more than they are as seniors.

Remote workers feel left out from the day to day activities that the different offices benefit from. If you were hired as a remote employee, you might be out of luck here."
3,LogicMonitor,Amazing Experience,2022-03-04,5.0,"Program Manager, Customer Experience","I recently began my journey here at LogicMonitor, and my entire experience, from the interview process, to the onboarding, has been nothing short of amazing!  I've never experienced something so positive and encouraging!  The communication has been on point!  Everyone has been so helpful, kind and welcoming!  And the organization of the entire process has been more than I could hope for!  It's truly a breath of fresh air to feel a part of such an amazing ""family""!!  I'm excited beyond belief to be a LMer!!  :) ",None to my knowledge!  It's an amazing place to work!
4,LogicMonitor,Shell of what used to be one of the best in Austin,2022-02-03,3.0,Senior Analyst,"The lower level management really cares about their teams
LM is growing at an insane pace which does create some opportunities","Every 5 star review in the last year is either a New Hire being told to give 5 star review in orientation process or Managers trying to push the score up. Do not believe them. LM is not a horrible place to work but it is nothing compared to what it used to be

LM has lost most of its C level staff including the CEO and the ones here were not the ones with vision for the company. 
Very unorganized due to uncontrolled systems in the process of extreme growth. No plans on the company plan in 2022 to address any of these issues. Literally caused the entire data quality team to quit

Overall, LM is likely in the process of going public in the next year which is causing them to set extremely aggressive goals while not ever improving existing processes."

8,LogicMonitor,"RUN, don't walk",2022-01-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people who have been around for more than a year are generally great people and a lot of fun to work with. Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of them left.","Over her year as President, the new CEO made no effort to learn how the business was run, being caught listening to podcasts during important meetings, throwing out platitudes and clichés left and right, and ruining what used to be a great, high-growth company.

The culture has become nothing but politics, and they haven't had a full executive team since last summer. Turnover is incredibly high across all levels, and it's due to lack of leadership + her chief of staff being inexperienced and arrogant, a dangerous combo.

If you're thinking about working here, go to Datadog or Dynatrace instead. And don't let the vague, positive reviews fool you - they encourage everyone to do one during onboarding, to drown out the noise of their bigger issues..."
9,LogicMonitor,Great place to work.,2022-03-28,4.0,Deal Desk Analyst,Open minded culture. Lots of room to grow. Great people.,Fast paced and sometimes hectic. Changes happen faster than management can respond. Normal problems of a hyper growth company.

14,LogicMonitor,Best Company Ever!,2021-09-14,5.0,Sales Operations Analyst,"I targeted LogicMonitor for a couple years knowing how amazing they were and am so happy to now be part of the company. During the interview process, they worked to find a position for me that they thought I would be the happiest and most successful in. They actually hired me for a higher level position than the one I applied for. This really spoke to how much the company sees potential in people and wants its employees to be happy. The company has amazing perks and benefits, they just ask that you work hard, which is not hard to do when you believe in the company and are treated so well. I love the downtown location. The view is amazing and it's close to so many shops and restaurants! The company is experiencing astronomical growth and is scaling very well.",None so far!

Lots of diversity initiatives and opportunities to grow and develop your career with workshops and stipend.","Lots of change and growth, processes are always a bit in flux, and responsibilities can be a bit ambiguous. This really can be seen as a pro for those who want to step up, go outside their comfort zone and contribute, as those who do are typically rewarded. But if you value having a very strict set of expectations, rigid responsibilities, and just want to show up, collect your check, and not worry about anything but that, you might see it as a con."

Benefits are great: You get unlimited holiday, a $150 stipend per month as part of the ""Harmony Bonus"" program to be spent on personal health and/or growth, and so much more!
Great company for someone who is new to an area and looking to meet people and be more social as they have a lot of social groups and events outside work. 

Bonus: They have a BYD program- That's Bring Your Dog to work. I haven't tried it yet, but will definitely consider when offices open back up.",The 401(k) match is much less than a lot of similar companies in the SaaS industry.

41,LogicMonitor,Pretty damn good,2020-10-28,4.0,Senior Individual Contributor,"- The company offers lots of great perks. For example, they gave the entire company Fridays off for a month and they gave everyone bonuses to offset the office being closed because of COVID. Salaries are competitive.

- Great work environment. Everyone is friendly. Everyone is welcome to put forth ideas, from the newest, most junior person, to the most senior. Having an opinion is encouraged. People are passionate about trying to make LM a better product. 

- The company is invested in making the product better. They are not just maintaining old software and promising customers improvements that will never come (like so many companies do today). New features and refreshed designs are being implemented all of the time.

- Not overtly obsessed with ""process."" No one is calling you up and complaining that your time sheet isn't properly filled out. What matters most is getting the work done. (There is process where it matters, like anything security related.) 

- Leadership is generally pretty open and honest during the company all hands meetings.","- Benefits could be better. For example, their offerings for family/spouse benefits are a little weak and they don't offer some of the options available at other companies, like a legal protection plan or pet insurance.

- Can be political and promotions (and some hiring) often comes through patronage. I know at least one person who left the company specifically because the got the short end of a political fight.

- Can be a little 'sink or swim.' 

- Long term future of the company is a little uncertain. It is a small company going through a lot of growth, it is hard to predict where it will be in 2-3 years."

45,LogicMonitor,False Promises and False,2021-01-06,1.0,Sales Development,"unlimited PTO after 6 months
smart and friendly people eager to help you (coworkers)
collaborative work environment","'unlimited PTO' is a lie - management makes it hard to take time off and are suspicious of sick leave
stressful work - expect much more work to be given to you without extra compensation. hiring team preys on young graduates who are gullible and green in the workforce.
very political hiring and all-hands meetings are pointless cheerleading tactics to make execs feel important.
company culture has done a 180 since Vista has leaned out and chased off the talent that the company was once proud of.
Marketing is no help to sales team whatsoever due to patronage in hiring rather than merit-based.
increased micromanagement and pointless trainings scattered throughout the week makes work unbearable and turnover sky-high in the SDR team.
growth opportunities are obsolete and management responds with empty promises.
unattainable quota and often BDRs are not paid correctly for their quota obtained
BDRs are not even given battle cards for competitors and forced to eke out information on their own.
sales territories are changed constantly and makes attaining quotas even more impossible.
higher-ups have no idea what BDRs do, yet call the shots as if they do know."

50,LogicMonitor,Best place I've worked so far.,2020-09-08,5.0,Developer,"I came from big corporate and found working at a much smaller company to be truly refreshing. You can put forward ideas and expect to be heard. You are given the creative freedom to think about how to solve problems and empowered by the organization to solve them.

If you have talent, drive, and are a self-learner you will thrive here. But you will be put in many situations where you are the only one solving a given task and you may not have many people to lean on in finding a solution. So it can be a sink or swim situation if you are not confident in your abilities to do that.

But if you are able to do well in such situations you will be recognized and rewarded for it. 

For me, it's been a dream come true.","Sink or swim. Can expect to be put in stressful situations where you need to complete a task by a certain time with no exceptions due to various constraints in the organization. And you have to figure it out for yourself from the ground up most of the time.

If you are not able to this will be noticed immediately."
51,LogicMonitor,Enjoyable company to work for,2021-04-11,4.0,Associate Software Engineer,Nice people within the organization. Product is interesting and very technical. Managers treat you with respect and do not micromanage. Relaxed deadlines and understanding upper management.,"The company heavily focuses on sales and greatly neglects their engineering team. During company events sales people are heavily praised and no one mentions engineering and other technical milestones.

Most of upper management and the product team have never written a line of code in their life. This can be very frustrating.

Most people within the organization have no idea how the product works. Non technical team members used to required to learn about the product, but this was removed."

I'm told pretty regularly that the standards for hiring are high and that I deserve to be here, a message that seems to be universally spread to staff, which is great. It makes me feel valued and takes some of the stress out of starting a new role in a new city. Everyone seems to be on top of their game, and willing to communicate openly about what they are working on, what they need, and what they think needs to be better. Every action is distilled down from core values, so the company is always living by it's mission. I love that.","Very white and very male (but very very aware of it and working to change).

The company also cares about world issues and bringing equality to everyone, a must have in today's society.","With every company that grows quickly, there will be some growing pains.

73,LogicMonitor,Outstanding Beginnings,2020-07-21,5.0,Solutions Architect,"I've been absolutely stunned by the hospitality and intelligence of everyone I've interacted with . Culture is often a noncommittal term that is often written down and spewed internally at a lot of organizations, but here the culture is readily apparent from the first interaction you have and more so each and every time after.

It is really motivating to be around and makes me want to do my best. I also appreciate that the leadership team is very transparent and does frequent Q&As.","The only con I have experienced is that since many of the employees here are on the younger side, there can be a bit of immaturity. Coming from a more professional environment at my last job, it can take a bit to get used to the bluntness and sarcasm. But it hasn't negatively impacted my experience too much."

Thank you for your interest in LogicMonitor. The next step in our process includes a brief pre-employment assessment. This scientific tool is used to ensure we have a fair and consistent measure against hiring criteria. The assessment is one of many factors taken into consideration when making hiring decisions. In fact, everyone at LogicMonitor, from our CEO to our Interns, has completed the assessment.  

Check out these tips to ensure you're ready to go.

Here is what to Expect:

The assessment is split up into 2 parts, cognitive and personality, and will take 30 minutes total to complete.
For the Cognitive Assessment:
US and UK Candidates: You have 15 minutes to answer 50 multiple choice questions across 3 categories: math and logic, verbal ability, and spatial reasoning.  
If English is not your first language, we can provide a language agnostic version. Let us know and we will send you an updated link with a new assessment. Do not take this assessment.
Australia, Singapore, and India Candidates: You have 20 minutes to answer 40 multiple choice questions across 2 categories: math and logic, and spatial reasoning.  
Don't spend too much time on any one question. While the goal is to get as many answers correct as possible, best practice is to finish all the questions - even if this means you quickly guess on the last several questions if you are running out of time.
There is no penalty for a wrong answer, so if you aren't sure of the answer after 45 seconds, make your best guess.
You may use a pen and paper. You are NOT permitted to use calculators or any other problem-solving device such as Google.
We do verify test results with a follow up assessment if you move further in the process.
For the Personality Assessment:
You are responding to statements about yourself; answer in a way that most accurately describes you. Please don't feel pressured to answer how you ""think"" the system wants you to answer.
There are no right or wrong answers.
This section is not timed, but will take about 10 – 15 minutes to complete. Read each question completely before you answer, as some questions may appear similar. 
After the assessment, our hiring team will review the results and follow up with you on the next steps.
Make sure you have 30 minutes set aside with no distractions. The best thing you can do is prepare yourself as much as possible."
85,LogicMonitor,"Great People, Great Company",2020-03-26,5.0,Talent Acquisition,Smart people creating a great environment. I'm excited that I get to work with such amazing talent on a day to day basis. The process is long but thorough which I can appreciate. The emphasis they put on personal and professional harmony is unlike any I've ever seen and it makes me excited to come back everyday.,"The interview process can be rigid, too many assessments in my opinion, and 401k matching is not at market standard."
86,LogicMonitor,"Run away, don't walk!",2020-07-09,1.0,Product Manager,Good people in non-management positions-they really care about others. Great product although it's overly complicated. Compensation is on par with market.,"They tell you one thing in the interview, but then the job is completely different! Look at all the other negative reviews and you'll see a similar pattern. Also, when submitting a positive GlassDoor company review is on your Day 1 new hire checklist, you'll see how they are trying to drown out the authentic negative reviews (Good strategy-should have seen this red flag)!! The CSM and PM orgs have revolving doors-don't expect to spend more than 6 months there before some imaginative excuse is used to get rid of you. 401(k) match is 3%-mediocre at best. The product is overly complicated and lacks basic features like IPv6 support, a real working NetFlow product and restrictive API rate limits without any queuing for requests and it shows-customers are moving to DataDog, SolarWinds and others. Also, a SaaS infrastructure monitoring product that offers three 9s is umm sub-optimal. Last, but certainly not least, LM is a product-driven organization and what that means is, they will ignore the voice of customer and do what the 3 stooges (not my words, but funnily accurate) want. PS and Engineering groups are constantly at war! Remember companies that were at the top of their field, ignored the voice of the customer and did what they want aka made ""technical sense""?-like Siebel, Blackberry, Palm, MySpace, Netscape, Kodak, etc, etc. You've been warned.."
87,LogicMonitor,Rocketship Growth + Intoxicating Culture,2020-03-10,5.0,Director,This company is on fire.  Best in class growth and customer retention as a result of an industry-leading product.

The challenge and learning is phenomenal for those folks, but not for everyone."
88,LogicMonitor,"Pleasantly surprised how a rapidly growing SaaS company is this mature, organized and driven vs.  what I was expecting.",2019-11-08,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"The level of professionalism and intelligence needed to work here is a reflection of joining the Vista Equity portfolio a year ago. They’ve implemented a thorough onboarding program, provide any tool you need to achieve success and the culture is fun but focused.","Breakneck speed of knowledge transfer and ramp up to your role. If you want a laidback company that will hold your hand in the first months, then this place is not for you."
89,LogicMonitor,Off To a Great Start,2020-04-07,5.0,Business Development Representative,LM did a great job of making sure I had all the tools I needed to WFH for my first day.

--GREAT benefits - what other companies pay you $1,000 to take a vacation?
--Still a small company so there's equity. No, they can't offer the inflated salaries that Google can, but you don't join a small company expecting that either. They make up for it with the major growth opportunity. 
--I feel like I have a voice here. They will listen to you and your ideas.","--parking is limited, but every company in Austin is facing this problem

101,LogicMonitor,Best job I've ever had,2020-01-08,5.0,CSM,"-high growth
-encourage to speak openly and have a voice in decisions that effect you
- routinely asked for feedback internally on how to improve","Growing pains, figuring out a lot of processes as the business scales"
102,LogicMonitor,Account Manager = Customer Failure Manager,2020-02-19,1.0,Sales,"-above average base salary for sales role and opportunity to achieve a high OTC (but no one achieves quota)
-product is good (but expensive)
-unlimited PTO (after 6 months of employment)
-potential for the company to be acquired, go public (lol), etc.","-micromanage culture in sales organization 
-frequent texts from management after business hours, including weekends
-insecure management additionally leverages performance plans as a CYA tactic, and plays it off as a method to develop you into a better employee
-crap compensation structure with unachievable quotas
-crap existing book of business (Account manager’s get penalized for not retaining business as part of their compensation package)
-crap training and training team (training team has no experience in sales and relies on internal employees to lead training discussions)
-company is consistently late on commission payments and often incorrect

The culture to expect in the LogicMonitor sales organization equals a low commission rate, plus small sales deals, plus high micromanagement.  The above average base salary is nice, but little transactional deals won’t get a sales rep to their (high and unattainable) quota.  

I was misled in the interviewing process about the company’s culture and compensation.  When I came onboard and recieved my book of business, I was further told that there's a lot of low hanging fruit to go after.  It was actually a lot of low hanging pile of crap.  Crap that I only got paid out 1.6% on the dollar for.  The insane level of micromanagement towards my pile of crap made myself hate working there altogether.  I NEVER felt like a valued employee.  I felt like the company’s punching bag.  This was the absolute worst sales experience I was ever apart of.  

I guess someone needed to be that punching bag to handle your legacy priced customers."

Best things: lots of really smart, nice folks without big egos (data always wins over opinions); very flexible work schedules (for roles that don't depend on a set schedule) and vacation policy; great work office environment (I often choose it over working from home because it's so much fun).  There's a kegerator, lots of great snacks (healthy and not-so-much), and lots of opportunities for outdoor activities (beach parties, etc).  The office location is great, as it's right around the corner from State St and all sorts of lunchtime delights.

139,LogicMonitor,I love my job,2015-07-08,5.0,Account Executive,"LogicMonitor is a incredible place to work. Downtown location in Santa Barbara, CA keeps you motivated and entertained. If you need to take a walk and take a break, go for it! 

Amenities aren't bad either. Fully stoked kitchen, beer on tap, bike racks if you want to ride in, and ping-pong table. Company pays for a yoga instructor once a week and are always looking for ways to keep us active. 

I always feel challenged working at a company that is constantly evolving. My team I couldn't be more happy with and supported by. We really are a cohesive unit that help one another out all the time.","A company that is constantly evolving is quite fun, sure, but it can also be really hard to keep up. LogicMonitor isn't necessarily a start-up anymore so some of those transitions are hard to make. Working in an open office environment is also fun but sometimes is can get quite loud."
140,LogicMonitor,"Great People, Great Product....a few growing pains",2017-07-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"We have done a great job of creating a phenomenal product .  There is a level of autonomy where you get to take personal responsibility for the outcome of  the product and how the company progresses and grows. The culture at LogicMonitor is absolutely special, not because of the perks or the location (which is not bad) but because of the emphasis on family and being this tight knit community. It also doesn't suck when people come to work because of their passion for the company/product and not just to collect a paycheck.","We run into growing pains (which any small-mid size company goes through). Priorities are constantly changing and its important to not lose sight of our goals through transitions. We also have to make sure we continue the culture that makes LM great...culture is home grown, not defined by management."
141,LogicMonitor,Greatest Place to Work in Santa Barbara,2016-11-18,5.0,Salesforce Administrator,"So there are some great perks, like gym reimbursement, covered costs of continued learning, yearly $1000 bonus for completely unplugging from work for 1 week, stocked fridge, beer, but those are just added bonuses.  The biggest pro of working at LogicMonitor, is being part of the LogicMonitor team, and to use an analogy, at previous companies everyone was looking for their piece of the pie, but here, everyone is helping bake the pie.  You will never have a chance to work with this caliber of people, and I'm not just talking about people with high levels of education.  Everyone that works here works hard, and have a high level of social grace and affability.","None, there are literally no cons to working at LogicMonitor.  If I were to think of something, I live out of town, so I have to commute."
142,LogicMonitor,"Fantastic, transparent hiring, no waiting",2018-10-29,5.0,Technical Support Engineer,"While I've only been with the company for a short time, I have been very impressed with the responsiveness of LogicMonitor's talent acquisition and people operations staff. 

From submitting my application, to receiving my offer letter the process took about 5 days total, during which time I was kept up to date with all phases of the hiring process.

Rather than being subjected to days or weeks of waiting and follow-ups, the company was very forward about their interest in me and was able to get all phone interviewing completed on my schedule in one day, and then a single in-person interview session with multiple levels of my department leadership.

Everybody is friendly and the welcomes have been warm, I can't wait to see what more the future brings.","So far I have not come across any downside to this fantastic company, but I'll say the parking situation is a bit of a mess."
143,LogicMonitor,Great place to work with a few growing pains.,2017-07-25,4.0,Technical Operations Engineer,"Categorically, this is an incredible place, with people who not only support each other in their professional lives, but also in their personal ones. The work is constantly fast paced, challenging and rewarding. 

One of the massive differentiators for this company from any other startup that I have worked for in the past is that we are one of our own biggest customers. Having that level of expertise and 24/7 involvement with out own product (from the point of view of the customer) brings every department closer to the user and gives a great sense of purpose beyond just building a company.","Going hand in hand with such a fast pace comes some growing pains. Having seen this transition point in other start-ups, fast becoming medium businesses, these are not uncommon issues, but issues none-the-less. With growth comes reorganization, and with reorganization comes some amount of confusion. While the primary goals, and underlying culture stay strong, there can be challenges on a day-to-day or project specific level which come with shifting priorities,"

The other thing that's great about LogicMonitor is that we have an active lifestyle here. The kitchen is fully stocked with healthy food, the company puts on weekly activities like indoor soccer, basketball, volleyball, softball, and every loves to hike when they can.","It can be hard sometimes to introduce new ideas to the development process.

Needless to say, the team-bond is strong, and employee personal health and wellbeing is fully appreciated and respected, and it shows because I go in to work I feel like everybody is happy to be there! Take this opportunity if you can and make the best of it, and be awesome.","Do notice I said job instead of career. As great as things can be, sometimes I don't see this opportunity as going much more past the job-realm. But your mileage may vary and if you are determined enough, anything should be possible.

148,LogicMonitor,It's a ride,2017-11-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Smart folks to work with and a general attitude of just getting stuff done, especially in the technical arena.  There is always work to do, but also latitude and encouragement to work on technical projects of your choosing as long as you are getting your assigned tasks and projects completed.  Some major features and integrations have come from engineers doing just this.","It is not for the feint of heart.  Things are moving fast which leads to a lack of structure.  This is a positive for some but not all as it can be frustrating to not receive constant feedback.  Those who work hard are generally rewarded, though not necessarily on the timeframe they may hope for."

The company I joined had keggers, a relaxed atmosphere, great sales performance, and lots of potential. By the time I left I was immensely relieved to be rid of the stress of working there, and I had one of the easier jobs! 

Despite already being a lean company, cost cutting was taken to a whole new level. They're hiring huge numbers of people but at a cut rate; they pay between 25-40% below market rate. Mostly they are taking advantage of younger people who don't know any better. They also quietly removed all the perks that made the place tolerable.

As others have pointed out the compensation plans are horrible. My manager fought valiantly just to get us a comp plan that wouldn't take money out of our pockets. The targets they gave the team were very unrealistic - I never saw a quarter where we exceeded quota, and most of the time we were very close to decelerators - you read that right, they put DECELERATORS in the comp plans. 

You'll be fought every time you try to take time off, accused of faking illness when you're actually sick, and generally abused. Take the advice I wish I could have given to the poor saps I saw being interviewed in our offices - RUN."

Through refinement of process, staff development, promotion from within and a desire to be better every day in all areas LogicMonitor EMEA is going from strength to strength!

The culture and belief that everyone can make a difference each day, starts from the vision of the VP & General Manager of EMEA. The management team take that vision and apply to each of their own departments. Each team and engagement are unique and not restricted to one rule for all, but empowered to do whatever it takes to make progress towards our team goals.

The team I work in say this is the best team they have been a part of. You feel as if you have a real opportunity to grow and be supported in your development. It leads to a feeling of being part of something special, where as one team you become customer obsessed.

The culture that made LogicMonitor a great place to work  and was fundamental part of the company started to decay as soon as the new owners brought  in ""their people"".
