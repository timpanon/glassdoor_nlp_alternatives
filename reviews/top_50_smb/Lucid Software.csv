0,Lucid Software,It's pretty good here,2022-04-01,5.0,Web Developer,Great place to work yes,"None really, the office snacks aren't great"
1,Lucid Software,Still a great place!,2022-02-15,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Still full of very friendly people that try to treat you like a human. Because of that, it’s still a great place to work!
It’s still possible to move around in engineering if you express desire to do so or if you’re unsatisfied with your current role.
The financial future of the company appears solid. (The cultural, not so much.)
Lucid social environment truly respects and includes all. Harassment is unheard of.","Lucid is now run by the marketing department. Do not question or critique them otherwise you will be reprimanded and censored by your own leadership, sometimes publicly.
Lucid’s core values have changed from a driving factor of how everything runs into a “nice to have” that feels largely ignored these days.
Lucid is big enough that bad managers exist and are not addressed. If you get one, try to move, there are still good managers.
Surveys are constantly sent out to see how people feel but are typically addressed poorly and outside of these leadership refutes complaints, unless they’re from marketing.
Process heavy focus stunts productivity of engineers that are just trying to write some dang code!
Inclusion and diversity is very healthy at Lucid and is to be commended! However, internal D&I initiatives have so far been more harmful than helpful."
2,Lucid Software,Trying to like it but I have concerns…,2022-02-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Our product is cool and customers love it. Benefits are pretty good and pay seems to be pretty good. CEO seems like a really good guy and it feels like they’re trying to innovate along with their competition.,"From my perspective you’ve got to have some political capital to be successful here. The whole teamwork over ego makes me a little nauseous. The values seem to be, like most IPO aspiring companies, just lip service. Probably because I’ve seen more ego than teamwork. I think they’re trying to grow up as a company but they’re having a hard time letting go of the home grown startup mentality. Marketing and branding is nowhere near what a enterprise software company should be and surprisingly we don’t flash our customer stories like we should which makes me a little uneasy. Miro got a $17B valuation in their last funding round which was a little validating yet a little discouraging. We have a long way to go and I think analyst are going to want a VERY clear picture of what problems we solve and the business impact of our solution."
3,Lucid Software,A tech company where people stick around,2022-01-15,5.0,Product Manager,"-Most people are here because they actually want to be here.

-Lucid has the energy of a start-up but the discipline of a mature company.

-The company is in a high-growth market (for obvious reasons, virtual collaboration tools have taken off over the past couple years)

-Teams work on truly thought-provoking problems (e.g. what is the best way to help a team accomplish a project in a visual way?)

-Lucid cares about its people. People encourage you to have a life outside work. 

-People don't take themselves too seriously here. Our CPO wore a bowser costume for Halloween last year.

-Collaboration is a lived value. You won't get far if you try to lone wolf everything.

-Leadership is invested in your growth. They are constantly asking about career goals, motivations and keeping an eye out for opportunities.","-As with any company, politics does rear its ugly head every now and then. Although, having previously worked at a Fortune 50 corporation, it's child's play here. 

-Depending on the job, compensation can be at or slightly below industry average. Not too big of a gripe though since cost of living in SLC is fair and definitely below that of the Valley.

-Company plans on requiring all employees (except Sales) to be in-office which, while not a problem for me, has been a source of friction for others, especially new hires

-Lucid has a habit of hiring most people locally instead of outside UT so diversity is an area of growth. Although, this is changing."
4,Lucid Software,Amazing Company!,2022-01-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The company truly cares about its employees. You can see that in their leadership, values, and benefits.
- Beautiful office with snacks stocked.
- Fast-growing! They're hiring like crazy right now because of the success they're having with the product.","- Not a remote-optional company. I think it's a culture thing, but they pushed back their return to office date like 3 times because of COVID trends. Though there is supposed to be a hybrid schedule when employees return, it'd be nice for some to have the option to work fully remote if their job allowed them to.
- Fast-growing! As they get bigger, the ""family"" environment and top leadership/employee relationship is harder to establish.
- Work/Life balance culture is dependent on what organization you're in. Some are really great about taking the vacation and encouraging their team to do the same. Some, not so much (or they say you should but then don't set the example by taking it themselves)"
5,Lucid Software,Fantastic place to work - loving every day of it!,2022-02-07,5.0,"Senior Director, Professional Services","- Outstanding people, top to bottom within the organization.
- The culture and values are how we operate day-to-day, and not just a bunch of words on a poster that we aspire to.
- The leaders inside Lucid are people-first, servant leaders. They are some of the best people I have ever worked for.
- The company's mission and purpose of helping teams see and build the future is something easy to get behind, and our products are fantastic.
- The performance evaluation process is exceptionally fair and non-competitive.
- This place knows how to party and have a good time!","- Compensation is a bit lower than industry peers, and too Utah-centric in its formulation
- The company is going through a lot of growth and is having to shift and change as that happens - this process is painful, though I personally feel like Lucid is navigating it well."
6,Lucid Software,Lucid really takes care of employees,2022-03-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Honestly, the people at Lucid are amazing. They make me excited for where I work and what we are doing is pretty awesome. Allowing for collaboration in this new world of hybrid work.",Hyper growth means there are some growing pains.
7,Lucid Software,You Won't Find Anywhere Else Better,2021-12-31,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"For several of us that have been in tech for quite some time, there is a natural skepticism that comes with working for any company. Along with that, you often wait to see whether there are egos or if there is a toxic culture waiting for you. What's interesting to me is that I personally have never felt that. There is a fine balance of talent, intelligence, empathy, and understanding at all levels of the company which shields you from the egos that are prevalent and rampant in other organizations. 

Please never lose sight of this and continue to do your best to maintain what makes Lucid special. It truly is its people and culture that make this a special place. I am honored to work for an organization that puts its employees before any number.",No major cons just a need to make sure that hires uphold our cultural values.
8,Lucid Software,Great Place to Work,2022-03-17,5.0,"Senior Manager, Operations",Allow autonomy to execute ideas and try them out. Pretty good benefits. Fun team environment that everyone wants to help each other.,Sr. Managers are in lots of meetings and don't have time to teach younger employees.

12,Lucid Software,Great collaborative environment,2022-03-01,5.0,Sales Operations Specialist,Everyone is great to work with. Managers are invested invested in your development.,They have a lot of talented employees so some people take below market salaries to stay at the company.
13,Lucid Software,Love working here,2022-02-10,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,Company is growing and there is lots of opportunities for personal growth as well. My manager is very engaged in helping me find new opportunities.,"Some challenges come with the growth, I used to feel like I knew everyone in the engineering department. Between the growth and optional office attendance during COVID that's not the case anymore."
14,Lucid Software,Still fast growing and a great place to work,2022-01-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Been working at Lucid for quite a while. The company continues to grow in large strides, but in a very sustainable way. Management does a great job at evaluating their options and do a great job at getting buy-in from everyone.","Sometimes the company gets a bit aggressive in what they want to accomplish and end up having multiple large, company-wide initiatives that end up putting a lot of stress on a few people who end up being stakeholders in several of those projects. Hopefully as the company grows and positions are filled, that stress will be reduced."
15,Lucid Software,Worth working for,2022-03-08,5.0,Senior QA Specialist,"Good culture, benefits, nonbias, diverse","Fast paced, less focus on polish"
16,Lucid Software,Best culture I've seen at any company!,2022-01-12,5.0,ISR- Inside Sales Representative,"Although I have only been at Lucid under a year, it's been the best time of my life. Management truly cares about your advancement as a person and in your career. Everyone has been really helpful in getting me ramped up which sometimes when joining a company it doesn't feel like that. I'm proud to say I work for Lucid!!","Compensation could be a little higher for the role itself but it is sales so if you hit your numbers, you'll do good. It just takes time which I would say is the only downside."
17,Lucid Software,Seriously wonderful,2022-01-06,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Literally everything. This company wins a best place to work (employee voted) award consistently year after year and there's a reason. You'll find an inclusive, healthy work environment, good work/life balance, a full and ever-improving compensation package, interesting work, transparent strategy, merit-based progression, and an amazing team of execs. I can't imagine a better company.","The benefits package becomes a little lackluster if you compare it side-by-side with some tech companies out of California, but it is still excellent."

I'm encouraged to create new ways of doing things and to be curious about my work. I'm motivated to continue exploring other positions and to find what the next step in my career will be. I belong here!,"I joined during the pandemic, so I haven't been able to experience working in-office yet."
22,Lucid Software,Great culture and values!,2021-05-17,5.0,Marketing,"One of Lucid's main strengths is its culture and values. They not only care about your well-being and work-life balance at Lucid, but everyone also embraces diversity and inclusion, making sure no one feels left out. Another big plus for me - no matter what department you join, you are always surrounded by such a talented and bright group of individuals who will push you to be better always. 

Lucid is a great company to tackle new challenges and learn something new everyday. You will typically get all the support you need from senior leadership and you manager - and the team is always open to new ideas. The marketing team, in particular, is filled with creative geniuses who set their egos aside and strive to continuously collaborate together (#teamworkoverego) to develop innovative and clever marketing campaigns to unleash to the public. It's just such a fun place to work at.","- Compensation falls behind what other software companies may hire for similar roles (especially marketing).
- Fully remote should be an option for employees
- Proposing new changes can sometimes take a loooong time and very lengthy discussions: if we want to set ourselves up for success in the future and beat our competitors to gain market share, we just need to act faster."

Excellent benefits, competitive pay, regular raises/bonuses

Lucid Values
TEAMWORK over ego
INNOVATION in everything we do
Individual EMPOWERMENT, INITIATIVE, and
PASSION & EXCELLENCE in every area

Lucid lives and breathes this message, and in turn seeps into my everyday work life. I may stay here forever.","Lucid isn't without it's faults.

All of it is amazing! Lucid is the real deal! I'm in love with where I work and I'm grateful for who I work with.","Compensation outside of the sales department isn't competitive with the current market space.

Lucid is a fantastic employer, and they know it; we are a desirable place to work and for great reasons but if we're going to play in the arena of the big orgs as we prepare for some big moves... we need to compensate accordingly."

Benefits are great and the culture is positive and strong.,The marketing department can be a little quiet. There isn't a lot of chatter whenever we are in at work.

40,Lucid Software,Everything's great except compensation  and PTO which continue to be below tech industry,2021-01-23,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Growth opportunities, some benefits, mission-driven leaders, younger culture that focuses on teamwork over ego, WFH stipend, decent focus on diversity and inclusion, incredibly stable outlook.","Compensation, compensation, compensation. I've seen swaths of people leave my department because other Utah tech companies have offered up to 40% more in compensation for the same role. Lucid leadership refuses to acknowledge that they pay below market and instead say that they continue to use a compensation research company to help determine salaries. Not convinced that it's working if area tech companies continue to poach Lucidites. Great if you're just starting a career but once your 4-5 years in, it doesn't become worth it anymore. Lucid is starting to appear in the same arena as places like Pluralsight, Qualtrics but the compensation means they aren't recruiting the talent needed to get to that level.

Unfortunately, PTO is quite restrictive for the tech industry. 15 days PTO as a SaaS company with ten years under its belt? Unlimited PTO is standard in many competing tech markets (and in many Utah tech companies).

Most benefits that are touted in response to concerns are focused specifically on parents (which are incredibly important) but considering the young crowd Lucid attracts, it just doesn't cut it. 

Grateful the CEO is progressive enough to celebrate Juneteenth and MLK Day but they took away our floating holiday to do so. Essentially, management is getting credit for being progressive while forcing employees to pay for it with a rare day off. A true statement would have been to allow employees to keep their floating holiday and close the company down on holidays celebrating racial justice."

Lucid Software as a parent company provides lots of benefits, activities, learning/networking, and a positive culture. People were comfortable being themselves. Lucid had all the benefits that I would expect at a company of this size.","I think that candidates need to know that Lucidpress is a completely separate experience from Lucidchart/Lucid Software. Except for getting the same benefits package, it might as well be a different company. For all of the glowing reviews about ""Lucid"", you are not getting the Lucid experience at Lucidpress, despite how it may be presented during recruiting. Lucidpress is really an afterthought to anyone I met from Lucidchart, and not once did I ever see a Lucid exec attend a Lucidpress-only meeting, ever. 

Lucidpress definitely felt like it was struggling during my time there. As a salesperson, I received one marketing generated lead per month, two if lucky. Seriously. Only real estate sales is able to consistently close deals, otherwise it's entirely based on luck. Lucidpress hasn't figured out how to pitch to other types of businesses, and there is a fundamental issue that most companies don't actually want non-designers editing their branded content, contradicting our ""brand consistency"" pitch. When we did trade shows, very few leads came through and even fewer ever seemed to close. Prospecting also rarely worked and conversion on cold calls or emails was extremely low. Deal sizes are minimal, and $5-10k feels like a lot to designer buyers. I was often confused why I was hired when we seemingly had no demand or viable market, and constantly second guessed why I was spending my time here. 

Despite the issues that seemed to exist, I didn't see leadership making significant changes. It seemed like Lucidpress leaders just wanted to maintain the status quo for fear of admitting that things weren't working. Real estate deals were presented as growth indicators, but without a plan to replicate them in other industries. The burden is put on sales reps to figure out how to sell the product, but it didn't seem like the company or leadership was willing or able to set any real direction for sales to follow.

Most importantly, I just think that anyone considering Lucidpress should be warned that it feels like a sinking ship. You're not joining the flashy unicorn of Lucid Software. It's not fair for anyone to think they're joining a growing part of Lucid when Lucidpress felt more like it's dying on the vine."
74,Lucid Software,*10 out of 10* Recommend,2020-02-27,5.0,Business Development Representative,"Lucid is a fantastic place to work. I've spent the last 1.5+ years working on the Lucidpress Sales team but can confidently say that the company as a whole invests in its people and works diligently to develop its employees. 

+Consistently exceed quota both at a personal and team level; given every resource and tool to do so  
+Receive ongoing trainings and attention from leadership to continue personal and career development 
+Have been awarded several promotions and have frequent career development conversations and know what my career trajectory looks like with Lucid","Sure, there are always things to get nit picky about especially in a rapidly growing company, but overall the pros far outweigh the cons. Any shortcoming or major complaints I could justify would be from lack of self introspection and individual empowerment. 

-Base pay may be slightly below industry averages in typical SaaS sales organizations, however the proven track record of success in hitting OTEs/quotas at Lucid far outweigh any additional base pay that may be received with other companies when only a small fraction of reps are hitting quota. With Lucid, I've always felt that my OTE is my ""base pay"" because it's consistently achievable and the opportunity to make more than my OTE is on the table each month by getting into accelerators."

87,Lucid Software,Pros and Cons for a fast growing company,2020-02-04,4.0,IT Analyst,"Lots of good people, good food and vibes, cool growth opportunities, cool silicon valley level group activities, company wide yearly retreat, budget for training etc. Some of these things are actual value and some are perceived value, extras. Will someone stay in a job they hate because they get free pizza every Friday? For most, no. Those are fun things to tell your family and friends about the cool new tech job you got. People stay for the job satisfaction, the people that they work with and report to, and salary. Things like that. Lucid still has that for the most part. Especially in Engineering department and other tech positions. Sales might not be as much.  When a company grows this fast, its hard to keep up, no matter what the position. But growth provides career and learning opportunities and makes it way more exciting to be at Lucid.  

Something that the company is doing really well at are things like inclusion, specifically around gender, race. leadership positions, raises etc. You can feel confident that they will hire/promote you if you are right for the job.","In my opinion you pay for all the extras out of your salary compared to what other companies would pay.

They've been able to attract talent that is innovative, hard-working, and generally fun to work with. They've mastered the art of marketing themselves as the ""fun"" start-up and utilize those perks to their advantage during salary negotiations knowing that prospects will take the pay cut for opportunity to work at a company that offers great culture and top-notch people. 

The quick list:
Stocked kitchen (most of the time)
Beautiful office and fun space
401k match
Great benefits","As with many companies that are growing quickly, their hiring criteria isn't as stringent as it used to be. They're experiencing large turn-over of employees who have been there for 2+ years and the management they've brought in has brought a more staunch and conservative culture to the once thriving and innovative teams.  

Lucid is not a start-up anymore. With 500+ employees and counting, you're not going to experience the culture that once was at Lucid. If you're looking for a cool, quick-paced, innovative and flexible environment you've missed the boat here.

The quick list:
-  Low pay (they say they use Radford averages, but I've gotten offers from other companies who also use Redford averages and the offers are 20% higher)
- Growing so quickly employees get lost in the shuffle (no raises/promotions unless you say you've got another offer)

Many of my best friends in Salt Lake were made at Lucid.","Rotting on the inside. Strictly from a sales perspective, not enough knowledge about other departments to comment. 
During the interview process and forward, beware of management promises, overly positive outlook, percentages about current team's performance, and talk of teamwork over ego. Take everything you hear from management with a grain of salt, and understand that the majority do not have your best interests at heart. 
If you decide to work at Lucid, think of your job with a Miranda warning - You have the right to remain silent (which I highly recommend).  Anything you say (or do) can and will be used against you. Good luck."

131,Lucid Software,Losing Veteran Employees as the Culture Changes,2019-12-04,3.0,Marketing Manager,"Many of the things I've loved about Lucid Software have changed in the last year (and many great employees have left), but this is what I originally loved about working there: 
— People knew and cared about Lucid's core values, like innovation, and teamwork over ego. 
— Managers trusted me and gave me space to produce my best work without micro-managing or putting me down. 
— I trusted Lucid's executive team to make the best decisions for the business and for its employees. 
— Historically Lucid has hired many of the best and brightest in the valley, which led to a robust and neurodiverse culture. I've worked with so many incredible people and teams there. 
— Snacks are abundant, and there's lunch on Mondays and Fridays.","Over the past year, I felt a seismic shift in the culture at Lucid. Of course, change is to be expected in a startup, but my real concern is that Lucid is moving away from the shared values and culture that made Lucid an amazing place to work — at least for me. 

For two years, I felt like I had the best job in the world. By the end, I no longer felt like a respected, valued, included member of my team — and I grew tired of being told by leadership that I was wrong to feel that way or that I wasn't seeing what I was seeing. Everything became very hush-hush. 

Micro-managing has increased too. My manager would tell me to decide for myself how to spend my time, but became very critical of any projects I suggested.  Asking for guidance, prioritization or examples made me feel like a nuisance.  Over time, I began to feel more like an isolated workhorse than a valued team player. 

When I tried to discuss these issues with leadership, they often minimized my concerns and sometimes denied they were even happening. Many times, I became angry and confused after referencing a previous conversation (from our 1:1s, for example), only for my manager to tell me he didn't remember it that way or that it never happened.  

Eventually, I stopped bringing things up or asking for guidance and growth opportunities, because I knew they were no longer open to me. And in the end, that's why I left."
132,Lucid Software,Poorly Run Sales Org,2020-01-05,2.0,Sales,"- Coworkers are typically awesome and Lucid does a good job of hiring good people.  The sales floor has a lot less ""typical salespeople"" compared to similar orgs. 
- The executive team is great and there is a decent level of transparency within the company.
- Benefits are great and they go above and beyond to help in this aspect.
- Weekly lunches/stocked break room.","- The initial, and probably most important con is the lack of pay.  The compensation is well below market value for all positions in the sales org and it is only getting worse.  If you're looking for traditional sales salaries, Lucid is not the place.
- Quota attainment is unbelievably low (around 20-30% in most cases).  Reps really don't ever feel like they have the ability to hit quota.
- Middle management is unexperienced and it shows.  Lucid acts like they want to expand into an enterprise level sales org but they don't have the management to do so.  
- The sales org in particular is suffering in the way of culture and overall morale.  When I was there, reps were typically looking for other jobs; management either had no idea, or didn't care.
- There is a greater push towards being in the office/at your desk simply so it looks good.  Management really doesn't have any answers and they are enforcing silly tactics to try and improve numbers.  (This is adding to the cultural shift as well)"
133,Lucid Software,Lots of good... lots of not so good...,2019-12-22,3.0,Sales,People at Lucid are great to work with. Benefits are good. Upper Management is very impressive. Great products. Annual retreat!,"Strictly coming from someone in sales, Lucid doesn’t show great appreciation for sales. Pay is well under market value. Product teams don’t actually listen to what sales needs. Marketing efforts are subpar. Lucid is very frugal with their spending, but with that said, when they do spend money, it seems like a huge waste most of the time. The company parties are boring, the swag they give employees is useless. They give our customers way better swag than us. I know that sounds picky, but sometimes it’s nice to get something out of the ordinary from the company to show appreciation. I’ve been at Lucid almost two years, and I’ve never once been excited about the swag I’ve gotten. When you make and give out swag that no one uses, it’s seen as a huge waste. When you have a holiday party at a subpar venue with no music or anything entertaining, it seems like a huge waste. When you have an SKO at an event hall and give out a t shirt to all of sales, it makes us feel under appreciated. Come on... you can do much better.. I come to Glassdoor to share this because I know I have no where of expressing these feelings to management, nor do I think they would care. I like Lucid because of the people, I’m a top performer on my team. Once the people on my team leave or I get a better offer somewhere else, my ears will be open."
134,Lucid Software,There is good and there is BAD,2020-01-08,3.0,Sales and Marketing,"Executive team is very approachable
Great product offering
Communication across the org is very good
A lot of smart individuals
Core values are really good
Monthly team activities","Worked in the Lucidpress side of the business. It is very different from working in the Lucidchart side. The two run their business very differently from each other and it is very obvious that the executives focus is on Lucidchart. It's great being the underdog and Lucidpress thrives on that, but it would be great to see more involvement from the executives in Lucidpress.
Leadership on Lucidpress is ok. There is a lack of experience and several of the department heads have been there since before Lucidpress was its own offering. They are great at what they do, so when Lucidpress began they jumped on it and are now in leadership, not necessarily the right leadership. Lucid doesn't invest in hiring the right leadership for Lucidpress to help it go forward to the next level, the current leadership is in place to keep things afloat, not very experienced. At one point you had the head of Customer Success and the department reporting to the head of Marketing, Sales leadership is awesome at sales but not the best managers. For example, sales was promised a trip/Presidents Club trip if quota was achieved by end of year like most organizations do. It's a few days before the trip takes place and Lucid forgot about Lucidpress reps and/or didn't consider them! And then last minute they decided to invite Lucidpress sales leadership to it and NOT the reps who actually hit quotas. It was a slap to the face for the reps, some of the leaders even tried to hide it from their reps because they knew it was a bad move on Lucid, but they still went on the trip and didn't fight for their employees. You can't blame it all on Lucid, but the Lucidpress leaders should have fought for their employees. Lucidpress leadership doesn't have the backs of their employees, they are too worried about making a good impression on the Lucid execs (the ones that don't really pay attention to Lucidpress) that they don't fight for their employees.  Leadership will not fight for you.
There is so much opportunity for Lucidpress to make a big splash in the design and creative industry but there is no real direction on how to do it. There are no leaders that have worked in the design industry before to really guide Lucidpress. They rely on what the customer has to say about the industry and the software to make decisions. That's not a bad thing but it seems like a lot of it is reactive than being proactive and industry leaders. You don't need to hire your competitors leadership to be successful in business, but when you have such a new and revolutionary product you do need individuals that can talk the talk and walk the walk in the industry you are in. I got to demo once to an AE that sells InDesign and the Adobe Creative Suite, and they were mind-blown at what we could do for the business user and non-creatives. He mentioned that Lucidpress in the hands of the Abobe Creative Suite would revolutionize their offering since these are issues they can't currently solve and have to talk their way around it. That's what Lucid Execs don't get, or don't know they have."
135,Lucid Software,Solid Company. Lots of Hustle. Truly Committed to Values.,2020-02-18,4.0,Sales Representative,"-Company has a solid product and continues to grow and grow. 
-Really focused on their two core products - Lucidchart and Lucidpress; they're not getting distracted by trying to build or acquire other things.
-They are committed to employee growth. They don't just throw people into management positions. They provide extensive manager training through a program called Learning at Lucid.
-They are serious about their values and committing to them. For example, our team was considering hiring someone who was highly qualified, but because he had an enormous ego, they decided not to. They really protect company culture. 
-Very conservative in their spending (almost to a fault), but it's so nice to be in a profitable company that isn't burning cash at breakneck pace. 
-Quality leadership.
-Lots of perks: annual retreat, stocked kitchens, catered lunch Mondays & Wednesdays, free Trax pass.
-Lots of hustle here while promoting a healthy work-life balance.","-Sometimes the company is so conservative on spending that employees have to lug all the conference gear on the airplane with them instead of having it shipped ahead of time. 
-Pay is a little lower than other SaaS companies.
-A lot of new hires are fairly recently out of college. 
-No mobile phone reimbursement program, despite the fact that I use my mobile phone for work calls. 
-The phone system is not good at all."
136,Lucid Software,A successful company that's been unable to scale its commitment to culture and people,2019-12-12,3.0,Marketing Manager,"I began at Lucid when it was a small(ish) startup. While I was extremely underpaid and overworked, I loved it. It was a place where opportunity was everywhere. You created your career at Lucid, and they gave you the runway to be independent and grab whatever you wanted - if you wanted it. 
I attribute my career trajectory to Lucid and its unique environment it created in its earlier times, and am grateful for the opportunity it provided me. I loved my early times at Lucid, but as time continued to move forward, I found Lucid’s commitment to great leadership, autonomy, startup mentality, and diplomacy to be waining. 
Lucid is a well-run business. Leadership is fiscally responsible and runs the company well from that perspective. I believe Lucid will continue to grow, will be poised for a great exit at some point, and be one of the great tech companies to come out of Utah.
While the cons I list below are straightforward, I still believe Lucid is a good place and can be a good place for someone in their career. I also don’t believe these challenges are particularly unique to Lucid, but call them out specifically because Lucid so heavily claims they are exceptions to the typical baggage that comes along with successful tech companies.
In 2016, I would have given Lucid five stars. But I have found much of those original core components of trust and culture to have diminished over time.","-Most of my comments below can be attributed to a single phenomenon: as Lucid has continued to grow and scale, it’s been unable to scale the culture, community, and opportunity it claims is crucial to its core.
- While there are Forbes articles highlighting the immense amount of trust and autonomy Lucid grants its employees, I believe that is no longer the case. Working from home is passive-aggressively discouraged and face time is a key component to being valued at Lucid. 
- A culture of passive-aggression reigns at Lucid due to Utah culture running deep. You will not be corrected, critiqued, nor offered direct feedback. You may be praised, and believe you are doing great. But you may find your annual performance reviews coming in low, promotions being postponed, and pay raises refused all whilst being told you’re doing a great job. It can be immensely confusing and frustrating.
- Lucid is no longer the hungry, tenacious, agile culture and company it once was. When I began, you were encouraged to grab hold of anything that needed to be done, run with it, and move quickly. It was chaotic, but there was room for growth everywhere. That has changed. It has become political, more bureaucratic, slower, and overly concerned with things that make work less enjoyable and meaningful.
- You will, most likely, be underpaid at Lucid. If you start at Lucid being underpaid, you will most likely be unable to change your situation unless you find another offer to leverage. This perpetuates because the claim of great culture is used as justification for low salary. I watched countless colleagues (and myself) be denied for deserved promotions and pay raises to get paid market fairness. However, if you find a competing offer, Lucid will be quick to suddenly counter - but only if you threaten to leave. 
While Lucid prides itself in hiring the smartest people, their definition of so is limited in scope, narrow, and sometimes ignorant. Their definition of intelligent and capable is limited to top business schools who often think and operate the same, which is why they continue to ask candidates for their GPAs, even after being out of school for over 15 years.
- Lucid claims it’s crowning achievement is its culture, and that you won’t find that anywhere else. Many employees are underpaid, unhappy, and under-supported, but have come to believe that they won’t find a great culture or environment anywhere else. I found that to be false, and have found its culture to have (negatively) changed heavily over the years I was there. 
- Management continually does not listen nor care when people are unhappy. Management (especially middle management) is not concerned about growth opportunities for those who report to them, not concerned in even hearing why employees may be struggling at Lucid, and refused to acknowledge or validate those. Eventually, I felt I needed to leave Lucid to continue learning or growing."
137,Lucid Software,"Good culture, but will also nickel and dime you",2019-10-21,4.0,Web Developer,AMAZING teammates. I've never met a company that lives their values more than Lucid. Be prepared for amazing co-workers that make it hard to leave.,"Lucid is very frugal and will nickel and dime you. Historically, they'll say that they are ""benchmarking salaries"" against a normalization process they went through a 1.5 years ago. However they don't share any of that data with employees. If they're going to use it as guides, they should share the data anonymized. Lucid, you shouldn't pay people in identical roles, a 20k difference for the same title & role. Expect to fight for fair market value salaries.

Additionally, Lucid has some weird personnel structuring going on."
138,Lucid Software,Forced entry,2020-09-24,1.0,Account Executive,We sell a cool product,Could respect current employees better
139,Lucid Software,Sales Rep at Lucid,2019-11-18,2.0,Account Executive,"Disclaimer: This review is purely for the Sales Org. I can't speak to the rest of Lucid:

-In the past, Lucid has been a fairly relaxed environment (at least when compared to a typical Sales floor) and extremely accommodating in terms of work-life balance. Being able to work from home or remote when needed, high degree of trust between Management and Reps etc. Despite a lot of the cons of Lucid, this has been enough to keep a lot of great Reps from leaving.
-In the past, most leadership has only cared about whether or not you hit your number, not how you hit it.
-Product is solid and generally very well-received by end-users. Easy to use and popular.
-Coworkers are typically awesome- Lucid generally hires intelligent and easy to get along with people with lower than average ego. Not near as many bros as you’d expect to find on a Sales floor. 
-Executive Leadership are a fantastic crew. Really smart people, fiscally responsible (Lucid's been profitable for some time now because of this) and seem to be genuinely humble as well.
-Quota has been typically attainable, but this is changing.
-Decent benefits (low premiums for healthcare, 401 K match, catered lunches twice/week, gym reimbursement, UTA train pass etc.)","-A lot of what I listed in terms of trust from Management and flexibility with work-life balance is rapidly changing, and based on what trickles down from Leadership, will very likely get even worse in 2020. More micro-management, expected to work longer hours, more focus on being in office with your butt in seat for appearances instead of focusing on attainment, which makes it much harder to work remote/from home. A general lack of trust from Management.
-While the C-level Leadership team is great, a lot of people in midlevel Sales Management have little to no actual Sales or SaaS closing experience. It feels like Lucid is trying to build out an Enterprise Sales team with no one on the Leadership team who's ever done that successfully before, and it shows.
-Positions are underpaid when compared to Market rate for the same level. Expect to make less than you would at a different company for the same position.
-Sales motion is highly transactional and low dollar-value. There’s a focus to try and land bigger deals by targeting Executives and trying to tie Lucid to initiatives, but at the end of the day, C-level leaders don’t care enough about diagramming to give you the time of day for a call, yet alone talk with you about their initiatives. In the eyes of 95% of our customers, Lucidchart is not a mission-critical app, and Executives don’t want to spend time talking about it.
-Sales Leadership decided to spend ~$250 K on having a guy come out and train the floor on how to speak to people “Above the Line” (Executives), but a lot of Reps (and several of the Managers too) see it as a complete waste of money.  It was a nice idea and it’s cool when a company tries to invest in its employees with training, but we could have got the same value we did from the training if we had all just read the guy’s book. Instead, we blew the remainder of our entire Technology spend as a Sales Team on flying the guy out to train, and after 3 months, no one is even using the stuff he trained on.
-Don’t expect anything but a cold shoulder and no appreciation if you leave, even if you’ve been at Lucid a while and/or been a top Rep.  We’ve had both Reps that chose to move on to different companies as well as fired Reps that have been Top Performers, and Lucid does nothing to appreciate them or thank them for their time. It all becomes very hush-hush that they’re leaving (not allowed by Management to tell people they’re leaving) and they’re shown the door. People normally only hear about people leaving via word-of-mouth and after the fact or on the Employee’s last day. Lucid does nothing to own the fact that they’re a Sales Team at a Tech company (which traditionally has high attrition) and people leave, it’s common in the industry. They act ashamed of it and try to sweep it under the rug rather than owning it and thanking employees for their service when they leave."
140,Lucid Software,Great company,2020-01-15,5.0,Account Manager,Everything about working here is amazing.,No cons to share at this time.
141,Lucid Software,Fast-growing company with an amazing culture and coworkers!,2017-11-06,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Coworkers are hardworking, smart, dedicated, supportive, and fun!
- Good work/life balance. We care more about getting work done than making sure you're working from 9-5. I don't feel like I'm being worked to death just to make the company more money.
- Management (and the whole company as a result) cares about employees as individuals. This shows in the great work/life balance, in conversations I have with upper management (they talk to me about my personal life and family), and in the family-friendly company activities.
- Lots of great perks: awesome health care benefits, tons of free food, team & company-wide activities, company retreat, awesome office space, foosball, ping pong, bouldering wall, family events (trick or treating, summer party, movies, etc.), 3-day hackathon for engineers, conference participation & attendance, community service activities, supporting Women Tech Council, etc.
- Lots of opportunities for growth, both as a company and as individuals within the company
- Collaborative environment. My coworkers are smart, but not ego-centric. They are willing to help anyone and everyone succeed.
- Everyone has a large amount of ownership over the products and you can have a direct influence the direction of the company and your team
- High values and morals. It is super important for me to feel comfortable with my company's ethics, and Lucid has never disappointed.","I'm sure there are some cons, but I can't think of any right now.

Oh, maybe the fact that we have pizza every Friday. Sometimes I get tired of pizza. But yah, that's not too important."

Gimmicky rock climbing wall
Lunches
Pretty cool people to work with
Decent medical benefits","Low pay. This company does do any market-rate research and they think the gimmicky physical benefits are worth more than they are. 
Absent-minded leadership. They seem to only care about you if you are not selling, and I realize that sounds silly, but they just don't care about you. I'm still a human and would like to be able to chat with leadership, but they seem like they never have time for you... unless you need to be reprimanded."
143,Lucid Software,Amazing Culture With Room To Grow,2019-09-17,5.0,Product Specialist,"Really good work/life balance. Relaxed environment, great workplace culture, amazing and talented people.

2. Depending on the department and manager that you have, work hours are flexible. From my point of view, it seems that as long as you're getting shiz done and adding value, that's what matters the most.

3. You get to work, network and build relationships with people that are smarter than you and/or that have previous ballin' business experience. 

4. The entire company has this ""Teamwork Over Ego"" mentality, and it's also one of the official company values.

5. The company/product is in this hyper-growth mode, which means that you have the opportunity to try and learn new things. You can easily see the impact that your efforts and hustle. #Boom","1. Not really a big cons, but historically, it seems that working remotely hasn't been an option for employees. Having said that, in January 2019, Lucid opened up its first international office in Amsterdam, so the idea of people working out of the Utah office seems more normal. Also , I believe that in the last 6 months, a few people have been allowed to work remotely, based on special circumstances."
146,Lucid Software,Great Place to work,2019-11-04,4.0,Senior Digital Marketing Specialist,"Lots of autonomy, lots of free snacks, lots of smart people, lots of fun.","As the company gets larger, it's losing it's start-up vibe and  becoming far more ""corporate""."

Lucid is truly an employee focused company that makes it easy to pursue your goals, both personally and professionally.  It's also nice to have a company that is so transparent with their ups (and downs), goals, and anticipated future.  It makes you feel safe that you won't be blindsided by a big change in the culture or leadership, which seems to be a theme in Silicon Slopes right now.  Overall, it's a company that is easy and exciting to be a part of for a very long time.","The growing pains of the company are affecting everyone, especially with the move of our product/tech teams.  However, I feel like the leadership has really stepped up to handle all the changes happening while keeping the values and culture aligned with Lucid."
148,Lucid Software,Best company I've worked for.,2013-09-26,5.0,Software Engineer,"I've worked for a couple of Fortune 500 tech companies and a medium size startup, and I enjoyed many aspects of those experiences. I worked with some very talented and accomplished people. They had great resources. Their products made a big impact in the world. At Lucid Software, the team is as talented and enjoyable to work with as any team I've had in my career.

People are capable and work hard. The focus is on the work and people don't have big heads. The CEO works to develop all employees, both personally, and by assignment through the other managers. People throughout the organization are asked to participate in conferences, interact with customers, and contribute to company strategy and planning meetings.

A lot is expected of me, but it is exhilarating as I'm provided latitude, trust, and support.","The work is demanding, but I would not have it any other way. I work hard, but my manager is aware of my efforts and sensitive to making sure the work is not too much. People who want a 9-5 job would feel uncomfortable here."
149,Lucid Software,Employees Come First,2018-03-06,5.0,Web Developer,"Employees come first at Lucid.  They really care about being an excellent employer that takes care of their employees.  Leadership is very engaged and accessible.  Pay is on par with industry and region.  Lucidchart is an excellent product with room for a ton of growth.  The culture is collaborative and not competitive, which has been so refreshing for me.","I started off unhappy with my compensation, but they have been very willing to raise it quickly as I've demonstrated excellent performance.  No current complaints."

I love the people I work with! They are wonderful people and also very bright. It is a blast to work on challenging problems with them. I have grown as engineer while working here by learning from my coworkers. The company is also great about asking what you want to work on and making sure that you are working on projects that you are interested in. The company encourages an upbeat culture with a yearly paid company retreat and a Foosball table and ping-pong table, which are in regular use.","I really don't have any complaints, and if I did, I would feel perfectly comfortable bringing them up in one on ones with my manager, and they would be addressed.

* While an expectation to work extra hours does not exist, there is a developing cultural pressure to do so.

152,Lucid Software,Perfect Fit,2014-09-22,5.0,Software Engineer,"My favorite thing about Lucid is that we get to work at a quick pace with relatively little overhead and process. Development drives the process instead of the other way around. It means that every week I get to work on a variety of projects and make contributions across the product. You can make a difference with the product where you want to make a difference. Lunch on Mondays and Fridays is great, as are monthly team activities, quarterly company activities, and the annual company retreat. Management is always looking for feedback. Office is a lighthearted and fun environment. It really is a fantastic place to work. Whenever friends or family ask, I tell them it is a perfect fit for me and has exceeded expectations.","I've had the thought the perhaps the company would benefit from having some more experienced engineers. Really though, having a lot of young people has its own advantages too."

The engineering team is second to none and work in a very collaborative team based environment.  Management is very transparent about the company goals and progress towards them.  Overall, Lucid is a great place to work and further a career.  I appreciate the provided lunches on Monday and Fridays as well as the stocked kitchen which allows me to stay at work and also gives me a chance to meet people who I otherwise might not interact with much in my normal day to day work endeavors.",It's hard to think of any cons.

173,Lucid Software,Having a blast!,2013-10-14,5.0,Senior Systems Manager,"This has been a very enjoyable place to work. I am amazed at how fast productive work happens. The politics of big business simply do not apply. I know that my opinion matters. The culture is very focused on personal growth and encourages ideas / opinions to be shared. On top of that, there are regular company wide foosball tournaments, pizza Fridays are also awesome!","Sometimes there is ""after hours"" work required. It is rare and not nearly as bad as other places that I have worked though."
174,Lucid Software,Amazing company with amazing management!,2017-11-07,5.0,Sales Development Representative,There is so much potential for growth at Lucid.  The management team is amazing and truly cares about your success.  The people are so talented and welcoming.  You will start to feel like they are a part of your family.  You will love working at Lucid.,You'll never want to leave the office :)
175,Lucid Software,Passionate people building great products,2015-02-22,5.0,Product Manager,They hire smart people and let them do their jobs rather than make them do their job. Best company culture I have ever experienced and I have had the pleasure of working at some really fun companies. Creativity encouraged from anyone in the company and everyone's opinion is valued.,"Work hours can be long some days, but we all do what we do out of love for the products we are building."
176,Lucid Software,Great place to work,2018-08-29,5.0,Software Engineer,"My coworkers and managers were some of the best people I’ve ever worked with and regularly keep in touch with. Lucid has a very good reputation in the Utah tech community, and having that on my resume has proved beneficial several times.","Pay didn’t seem to scale with seniority as well as I would have liked, changing jobs meant a significant raise, and I wish it hadn’t been that way."
177,Lucid Software,Great engineering culture,2019-05-09,5.0,Software Engineer,"Best software company I have worked for or can imagine working for. I get to work with really smart people on interesting problems using modern technology and engineering best practices. 

Lucid really lives its values, especially teamwork over ego. Almost everyone is approachable and helpful.","Lucid's open office workspace is central to its collaborative, team culture, but also means a lot of distraction."
178,Lucid Software,Previous employee review,2018-12-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Great benefits included. Paid health insurance including dental and vision. Cool perks like a company-wide retreat in June every year. Small perks like two catered lunches per week and a stocked kitchen. Great office space.,"Internal politics has started to run rancid through the organization as it has grown.  Some of the managers are not qualified and are not true leaders but some are as well. The politics started to wear on the culture of the company that was once great. Generally speaking, it seems like they don't pay competitive salaries for the industry."
179,Lucid Software,Amazing Learning Environment,2017-11-18,5.0,,"I have never worked at a place that values learning and development so much. The people around you are collaborative, supportive, and authentically want you to grow. You never feel like the smartest person in the room, and it’s wonderful.","Normal growing pains with a start-up. Some current processes are not scalable with the projected company growth. Other than a few minor changes that should be made, the company is amazing."
180,Lucid Software,"Great Company, but not necessarily for everyone",2018-04-20,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Outstanding company perks and culture. Free food, company activities, the best hardware and software for your work. They use world class tools and processes to deliver a product that is pushing the limits of web technologies.","Lucid expects a lot out of its employees and will prefer those who give more hours and more effort. If you are willing to put in the time, there is plenty of opportunity for career advancement."
181,Lucid Software,Great startup environment with a lot of talent,2013-10-16,5.0,Software Engineer,"The teams are all top notch. You will be working with some extremely bright engineers and a very capable and talented team on the business side. The product managers are reasonable and work well with the engineers, so you feel like you have a say in the direction of the company.","If you don't like to work hard or care about what you are working on, Lucid is not for you. We work hard and get a lot done, and expect that from everyone."
182,Lucid Software,Definitely my favorite company in Utah,2018-10-25,5.0,Recruiter,Great office space with plenty of amenities. They provide you with ongoing learning opportunities and have a good L&D program. Fantastic colleagues that are always willing to help.,The usual pains that come with companies in high growth phases. But the leaders tend to be open to feedback along the way and there's an understanding that we are doing our best to figure it all out as we grow.
183,Lucid Software,More talk than walk,2019-02-14,1.0,CSM,"The work environment is open and positive. The employee base is exceptional, and it's rare to find a coworker to dislike. The product offering is an easy sell. Customers are generally very happy with the work done.","Compensation is insulting. Lucid hires the absolute best talent in the valley but pays them like they are average. This is a stepping stone, not a career. They will give you future promises and tell you what you want to hear, but they won't make any real changes.

Office bureaucracy is overwhelming. When I first started, there was autonomy on an employee-level. The company has become a top-down, slow-moving machine. If you're looking for a fast-paced environment, look elsewhere."
184,Lucid Software,Awesome team,2017-12-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The team is amazing - smart and hard working people with low egos. The product is great - stable and a well-established product-market fit. The office is fantastic - spacious, great views, and fun features (climbing wall).","The traditional ""startup perks"" aren't quite as exciting as at other companies - the food in the kitchen is mediocre and usually runs out mid-week; the swag is not super-exciting; etc."
185,Lucid Software,Great Company!,2016-03-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Lucid is an exceptional company with a fast growth rate, very intelligent colleagues, and a proven desire to develop as a company. Overall, Lucid is a great place to work!","Lucid still has enough ""start-up"" in the company that ambiguity is a regular occurence. While challenging at times, this ambiguity enables employees to grow by taking on tasks which would typically fall above their ""pay-grade"" or experience level."
186,Lucid Software,Great startup with a promising future,2013-11-26,5.0,Software Engineer,"I feel like I work with some very smart people pushing pushing technology in the browser and because it is a small company I feel that my work is noticed, expected, and appreciated.  Working at Lucid Software has helped me to grow as a programmer and be far more confident in my abilities.",There are too many projects for too few engineers.  We could easily double the number of engineers and still have plenty of work to do.
187,Lucid Software,They care about me,2017-11-09,5.0,Customer Operations,"I've never worked at a company that cares more about me reaching my goals than they do about me working toward the company's goals. They fundamentally believe that if I'm doing what I'm interested in, I'll bring value to the company.",There are only 168 hours a week you could feasibly spend working there
188,Lucid Software,Best workplace environment,2018-06-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The most employee-friendly place to work at ever! Working here has been the best experience for me so far. The core values of the company resonate with me and I believe in the products. Moreover, there is teamwork over ego. They encourage transparency and they have an open-door policy. Literally! There are no offices. The founders and CEO sit amongst you.",Absolutely nothing. (Had to write something because it is a glassdoor requirement)
189,Lucid Software,Great people and potential,2017-10-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Incredibly talented and motivated colleagues

Great perks including annual company retreat, monthly team events outside of work, BBQs on the roof, stocked kitchen (never have to bring food :)), etc.",Fast growth environment means there is a lot to do and not enough time to do it!

194,Lucid Software,Typical startup with atypical employees,2013-10-14,5.0,Software Engineer,"The CEO isn't a scum bucket like so many other startups. The CTO is brilliant. The bar for hiring employees is extremely high, so every employee is intelligent, hard-working, and contributes to the value of the company. We are already profitable, so your stock is immediately valuable.",The environment is too open - no cubicles or offices - so the sound propagates more than I would prefer. Easily solved by headphones.
195,Lucid Software,Great place to work,2018-11-14,5.0,Software Engineer,"Lots of free food, free public transportation. Co-workers and Senior management are probably the most talented group you're going to find in Utah.",The base pay was a little low. Also the average age of employees seemed low so there's not a whole ton of experience surrounding you if you're looking for a place with lots of mentorship.
196,Lucid Software,The opposite of soul-crushing,2014-03-26,5.0,Marketing Manager,I have had many jobs that lose there shine after about 6-12 months. This company really hires the best and does what it takes to retain good people. Lots of fun. Hardwork but within limits. Clear communication about what is expected.,Working at a smaller company means tighter budgets in some areas. You can sometimes feel like you are the dumbest person in the room.

-promotions are quick for those who go beyond
-amazing learning opportunities from very smart people
-management genuinely cares about career growth of employees","-management is obsessed with meeting sprint requirements, even when they made mistakes in estimating difficulty
-the burden of their mistakes falls on the engineers, making for many stressful late nights & weekends trying to meet these arbitrary deadlines to avoid being fired or put on a “performance improvement plan”"
198,Lucid Software,Software Engineering,2016-01-25,5.0,,The company has a great culture and great people! People make sure that you are having a positive experience and care about you.

259,Lucid Software,A company the lives it's VALUES,2020-01-03,5.0,Director,"I've worked for companies that pay lip service to values, Lucid is not one of them. Values guide their decisions and impact their choices, even if it means they might lose temporary revenue or have to spend a little more. The management team is amazing, the executive team is driven, but at the end of the day, understand that people are the most important resource at Lucid. 

My family recently experienced a significant medical event, and Lucid literally could not have been more supportive of me or my family during our time of need. 

Seriously, a great company, full of great people, doing amazing things in the world with a wonderful product, but not to busy doing great things to go above and beyond for their employees. By far the best culture in Utah, Amsterdam, Melbourne, or anywhere else for that matter.",Keep the culture of empowerment and autonomy.  Don't let it change as the company scales.
