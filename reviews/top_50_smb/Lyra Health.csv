0,Lyra Health,"Mission driven product, fantastic interview process!",2022-03-28,5.0,Recruiter,"Hands down the best interview experience I've been a part of! Every Lyrian whom I've met during my on-sites have been welcoming, kind, and caring. Very diverse C-suite leadership, which is a huge plus!","None so far, everyone has been delightful!"
1,Lyra Health,"OK job, but make sure you're passionate about mental health",2022-02-02,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Wonderful and helpful colleagues
-Challenging work - you'll always have something to work on
-True collaboration - you'll get to meet many people across several teams and see how they all come together to create a great product
-People are really gung-ho about improving mental health. If you're ambivalent about it/just looking for a job, this company might not be a good fit
-Talent team walks the walk - great amount of diversity among different teams","-You may spend many hours working on something just to find out it has lost its value overnight. Doesn't always happen, just sometimes
-Hours can be really long as timelines are quite short. I imagine it depends on your department/middle management and the pressures at that particular moment
-The benefits and perks don't come close to matching other CA Bay Area companies. No 401k matching, no merit bonuses, and the PPO insurance options are awful if you live outside of California.
-You might think that there are many career opportunities in a start-up like Lyra...and while that may have been true in the past, it doesn't feel like the case anymore."
2,Lyra Health,Best Place I Have Ever Worked,2022-03-09,5.0,People Team,"Having worked across the Bay Area & East Coast, this is hands-down the best place that I have ever worked. 
What is great about Lyra?
-The people. On the whole, everyone who I work with is kind, intelligent, caring, responsive, and has a sense of humor. We collaborate easily and share a commitment to Lyra's mission.
-Remote work!
-The People Team goes above and beyond to create fun activities for all employees, and for the team to keep us connected. There have been workshops on how to make a perfect cup of coffee, a family magic show night, yoga and pilates classes, and trivia lunches, among others. 
-The work is fascinating and challenging, in a good way. How do you scale mental health services globally while keeping quality of care primary? How do you create management practices and a culture of belonging, psychological safety, and effectiveness? For our the People Team, how do we scale HR systems and processes to account for multiple variables, use cases, and stakeholders?
-The executive leadership team is experienced. The CEO and CRO have taken two companies together before. The other executives were all executives previously. This experience translates into steady leadership, clear company goals and communications around the goals, and cascading commitments of resources, efforts, and focus aligned to these goals. 
-There is a dearth of egoism and narcissism at Lyra. (Rare for tech companies)
-DEIB is operationalized. It goes beyond trainings and communications. For example, pay parity is effectuated at all levels of the organization. Another example is that there is a Diversity People Partner who works within the Clinical business unit to support the managers and team members with learning, practicing and teaching the Lyra's DEIB pillars and practices of equity and inclusion.
-The pay is competitive
-Lyrians, Lyra employees, are eligible for 20 free sessions of Lyra's services a year for themself or an immediate family member. This is an incredible benefit. It also feels like the company ""walking the walk"" that it talks with customers/clients.
-For the therapists and coaches who are employed by Lyra, there is an entire HR team just to support them. It allows Lyra to offer a higher touch employee experience and allows the People Team, and Lyra, to stay close to what support that the people who provide the direct care need.
-There are lots of opportunities for growth. Because Lyra is growing quickly, there are not only vertical opportunities (i.e., promotions), but also lateral opportunities, project leads, and other types of mobility.","Depending on your role, and because of the stage of the company, the work pace is intense. You won't find yourself working on weekends, but M-F, it is 100% all-in. Many different teams, like the People Team, have team-wide blocks on meetings for non-meeting work and self-care."

88,Lyra Health,I LOVE working at Lyra Health!!,2020-09-08,5.0,Blended Care Therapist,"I am very happy and excited to part of the Lyra Clinical Care team!! 

The work environment is very supportive and open to helpful critical feedback. The management team is highly respectful, very encouraging, and consistently supports its employees to continue to grow as clinicians and to provide the highest level of care for our clients. My clinical manager Mar has been truly wonderful to work with. Since I have started working at Lyra, I have honestly never felt like I was being micromanaged but rather supported and respected as a seasoned clinician. I am also very excited to be working under the leadership of the CEO David Ebersman, as well as Suzanne and Rachel. 

I have over 22 years of clinical practice and this has been a truly exciting experience to provide exceptional care with Lyra. The financial compensation rate is excellent as well as the additional benefits provided as an employee. I have been practicing Cognitive-Behavioral therapy for over 22 years and its truly exciting to be working on the forefront of the industry at this time of historical change that has paved the pathway for the expansion of telehealth beyond what was previously imagined. 

Within the platform, I am able to reach clients across the country (where I am licensed) to provided top quality care from the safety/comfort of my home office. My clients love the intuitive digital format Lyra provides through its digital exercises / practices. In addition, the weekly assessments allow for them to have accurate graphs demonstrating their ongoing progress and healing throughout the episode of care. Upon review, all of my client have reported that they feel the digital outcomes graphs are very helpful and provide accurate measurements of the variability they have felt themselves over the course of their treatment. Clinically, it has been very validating and empowering for my clients to visually observe the trajectory of their process of positive growth through these unique digital graphs.

I firmly believe that Lyra Health provides seasoned clinicians the venue to facilitate the best level of care by working with these effective measurement tools. Also the progress notes and paperwork are quite manageable and I do not feel the exhaustion and possible burnout I previously would work through while being in my private practice of over 13 years. Plus, no overhead costs which is also highly beneficial!! 

I sincerely believe due to the high level of integrity of the leadership team and the effective intuitive digital formats Lyra has developed, I am continuing to grow as a clinician to provide the most effective level of care for my clients possible. I am very happy and grateful to be part of the Lyra team and I look forward to many rewarding years with the company!!",None - I honestly love working at Lyra Health!!

Overall great company to work for, ethical, and really has a vision for the future of mental health!","The hourly wage could be a bit higher-the base is around $36/hour with bonuses it goes up to around $50/hour.
