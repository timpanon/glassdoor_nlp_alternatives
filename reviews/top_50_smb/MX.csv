0,MX,I love working for MX,2022-03-14,5.0,QA Engineer,"- Great work/life balance
- Great co-workers
- Remote
- Great benefits",- None come to mind
1,MX,Exciting place to work!,2022-03-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,MX is a great place to build! The caliber of people is in my opinion the most attractive part of working at MX. The care and quality of work is always displayed in the teams effort to execute.,Still learning through normal growing pains of an evolving company
2,MX,"Good Culture, and very culture focus, Low Pay",2022-02-21,4.0,Software Engineer,"- They really make sure to take care of you ( anything other than compensation ).
- Great co-workers
- Great managers
- Clean codebase, autonomy","- They usually offer compensation that is 30% - 40% lower than the market, that's the price you pay for great culture. Consider they received a great amount of funding.
- The company has a great mission, hence the higher up probably wants to be in control, which means, probably not IPO or selling it anytime soon. So company shares are worthless, well they worth something on paper.

=> Good company to work for, as long as money is not your concern. I can picture myself as a senior dev with everything paid off, and just living to code would love to work for MX forever."
3,MX,"Great people, great vision, great technology",2022-02-28,5.0,Backend Software Engineer,Everyone at MX strives to live up to the company values on a daily basis. The people are friendly and talented. MX does a great job at treating employees as people first which is very refreshing.,I don't have anything negative to say.
4,MX,A Great Company to Work For,2022-03-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,I support the company's mission. My co-workers are friendly and competent. I get lots of opportunities to learn and grow. I absolutely love the ability to be flexible with my schedule and to work fully remotely.,The pay could be a little higher.
5,MX,Easily the best working environment I've experienced,2022-01-18,5.0,Client Strategy Consultant,"It sounds so cliché these days, but the reality is that MX has an outstanding culture that permeates the whole organization. The MX values are discussed or referenced frequently. It's a truly collaborative place. Being smart and being right are valued as much as 'failing up' and speaking out.

Senior Management is deeply involved in the recruiting process and a lot of effort is put into ensuring cultural fitness. Having an ivy league education or having worked for a target company are not prerequisites. We have true diversity in that area and it's wonderful. I enjoy seeing real diversity at work when participating in meetings and truly intellectually diverse points of view.

This is the first mission-driven company I've worked for. The mission and vision doesn't take the back seat (or at least hasn't yet) to profitability and short-term success.

Not everything is perfect and wonderful (as I will outline in the cons), but I'd just say that all of the awards received as a Top Place to Work, aren't coincidence or manipulation of ratings.","- We are growing fast and we are facing some resource constraints that sometimes make it difficult to execute

- Our products are outstanding, but it feels like our marketing of them isn't really as good as it could be. They are difficult products to explain and create ads for, but some of our main competitors seems to have an edge in this area. Even with inferior products

- I haven't seen any signs that it will be a problem, but I am worried about the prospect of an IPO or an acquisition disturbing the great culture at MX

- Path to promotion is unclear. People do get promoted and internal advancement doesn't seem to be unrealistic. But we don't really have clarity on how to make that happen"
6,MX,"Great atmosphere, and very welcoming",2022-02-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"These guys really believe in making everyone feel right at home.

I haven't worked for a company that is so invested in people, whether they be employees or customers. MX touts the importance of the companies core values, values that I feel are integral to finding fulfillment. Even better, the company practices what it preaches and the outcome is incredible. I have been looking for a place like this for a long time and I'm excited to share in the MX vision.","Certain processes may be lacking, but MX is aware of it and is striving to fill in the gaps."
20,MX,Talented Coworkers,2022-01-26,5.0,QA Engineer,Having crazy smart coworkers was great,There were way too many meetings
21,MX,Come build mx!,2022-01-06,5.0,Mobile Developer,"Engineering led culture, foundation of trust and incredible overall company culture",Sometimes hard to get a large raise once you’ve already been working here for awhile.
22,MX,My opinion,2022-01-07,5.0,Software Engineer,Culture is awesome and very generous with PTO.,Some downside might be depending on your department you won't get to know others in the company as it is growing so fast.
23,MX,Onboarding is Great,2021-10-21,5.0,Software Engineer,The onboarding process has been really nice and organized. They really want to make sure employees are comfortable and have what they need. It's very organized so you can get most things done on your own if you prefer.,"This could be looked at as a pro; it took a couple of days before I was added to team meetings, but I was still doing onboarding so it gave me more time to focus on that. I know they are doing a lot of hiring so they were most likely busy with other things."
24,MX,Engaging and Fast Moving Company,2022-01-21,4.0,Client Strategy Consultant,"Solid product, fantastic team, amazing history and culture.","Product is extremely complicated, long ramp up period and sales cycle."

32,MX,Onboarding,2021-09-16,5.0,Project Manager/Business Analyst,"Onboarding can feel overwhelming. NOT if you are working for MX, though. They added so much personal touch that it almost feels like a second home. You get access to quality internal educational resources; and most importantly, you have space to digest new information, ask questions, and get comfortable with the tools that are used in the company.

55,MX,Well Taken Care Of,2021-08-09,4.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),I have worked here 9 months and find that they continue to put their emotional intelligence at the forefront. I can complain or ask for more training and I have several people who step in to aid and fix the problems. They are committed to my success and structured the comp plan well.,Things feel siloed. It took a bit longer to onboard than I would have liked. I am uneasy about my advancement into the company.
56,MX,Good Organization Left Leaning,2021-05-05,2.0,Frontend Engineer,"Benefits. The benefits are amazing! The facility is pretty awesome. You really get the feeling you are working somewhere important. Also, the community is quite awesome. The people are super nice and usually pretty real.","I left because I didn't have confidence in the maintainability of the software moving forward. There is a huge emphasis on the employees and the assumption is that if you take care of the employees you will end up with a good product. This seems good but I also noticed the existence of a quite large bug economy and tons of dead code. Also, the code was confusing with poor names and almost zero standardization to keep a reader from getting lost in the 40 or so methodologies used to construct the thing. There is a sense that we need to go fast which ultimately made a huge unhealthy mess."

If you are someone that works hard and can put your mind into a goal, you are in the right place here.","With such lofty goals, getting a vision to trickle down to every part of the company is difficult.

I interviewed with individuals that would be in my department, with individuals that I would be working with directly and a few indirectly. I had fantastic clarity on what was going to happen with each interview and always knew what was coming next and where I stood with the process.

Since I was brought on, I have had nothing but fantastic interactions with individuals at all levels of the organization. I have felt welcomed and wanted throughout the entire experience. I have had clear expectations set, generous amounts of resources to help me get up to speed with my role and the organization/business model.","I would have loved to receive an email the week prior to starting with detailed out explanation of what I could expect for my first week of work; especially with working remote due to COVID. I received my HR and Onboarding email, but would have LOVED to receive an email detailing out what I could expect as far as onboarding and training schedule is concerned. However, that is the only thing I could think of that would have been helpful that I didn't already receive."
64,MX,"Overall, it's a great opportunity with a great company!",2021-08-10,4.0,Tech Support,Amazing company culture it's a positive and uplifting environment to work in.

From the first call, I could sense this is a company that knows who they are and what they stand for. They know the value they bring to the world and it showed in their humble confidence throughout the recruitment process. That's something rare and cannot be faked. From day one, I wanted to be a part of this company.","The interview process took a bit long (7-8 interviews). While every interview was fantastic and I was told what to expect afterward, it would've been good to know from the start what the overall process would be from end to end to avoid any anxiety."
68,MX,Superb company to work for,2021-02-25,5.0,QA Engineer,"Great people and management. The management sincerely believes in the values they profess, and act accordingly. They work really hard to show appreciation for each of their employees. They have clearly defined career paths, and freely offer the support necessary for you to advance.

91,MX,Thorough Vetting Process,2021-04-06,5.0,Product Data Analyst,Great compensation and culture! Everyone is super friendly and welcoming!,None yet that I am aware of.
92,MX,"Amazing Company, Amazing Recruiting Experience",2020-12-03,5.0,Executive Assistant,"MX offers a unique and robust environment of inclusion and unity. That why it's called the MX Family. MX gets at the heart of providing value to their clients and their employees with a truly all-encompassing employment experience. Their Talent acquisitions and people operations was the smoothest I have ever experienced. My talent consultant was on point, very responsive, and made the whole process seamless.","The only con I can think of is that not all organizations can be as great as MX. Then again, that's not MX's fault."
93,MX,Amazing company! Takes care of their employees,2021-02-09,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"I just started at MX, and their onboard experience is one of the best! I am meeting awesome people and they are making sure that I an set up for success.",I dont have any that I can think of
94,MX,"Powerful products, amazing teams, and a great place to grow!",2020-10-15,5.0,Marketing,"I worked at MX for over 4 years and loved every single moment. I grew personally in my career, made a lot of new friends, and will cherish my memories there for years to come. Ryan Caldwell is a great leader and although things felt chaotic at times, he was quick to reign it all back in. Growing pains are normal for any startup and I look at how leadership adjusts and solves problems to determine if a company is on the right track to maintain a great culture. 

Top Takeaways:
1. Wanna get your hands dirty and build something great? That's MX. 
2. Craving work/life balance and a sense of purpose? That's MX.
3. Desire to work somewhere fun and meet some amazing co-workers? That's MX.
4. Great atmosphere with a lot of care put into employee well-being? That's MX.

MX is a great fit for anyone who likes to roll up their sleeves, learn every day, and love what they do. Great benefits, 401k match, and equity.","I left MX for another opportunity, but would not have even considered looking if I wasn’t dealing with a highly toxic executive who was mismanaging his team and very out of touch with reality. This was my only poor experience and unfortunately, at that time, the person over HR was not fit for their role and didn’t handle it appropriately.   No workplace is perfect! That executive is still at the company, but they’ve put a bandaid over the problem and hired other leaders beneath him who are better at leading and growing teams.   I have way more positive things to say about MX than negative, but this was the one I needed to get off my chest."
95,MX,Great hiring and onboarding process,2021-02-23,5.0,Software Engineer,I just started at MX and the hiring process was great and so far the onboarding process has been excellent.,I don't have any cons to report.
96,MX,"Strong Mission & Vision, Prepared to be Underpaid",2020-08-19,3.0,Software QA Engineer,"MX's mission and values are strong. They hire a passionate group of people to drive that mission forward. The company has a very flexible PTO benefit, among other useful benefits (massage therapists, catered meals, employee assistance program).","Prepare to have a very uphill batter for fair compensation, especially if you're a woman. (Also noting that the majority of women in the company are in more entry-level roles and very few hold leadership/management positions.)

Much of the management that submits comp changes are unfamiliar with the industry & regional standards. Those same individuals appear to be content with the salaries they're told from HR/Finance."
97,MX,"If you’re a woman, RUN.",2021-02-05,1.0,People Team,"When you’re in office, there’s perks and free food.","Very few women in leadership. No transparency around salaries. Rampant nepotism. First woman to get a promotion is the sister in law of the CEO. The whole HR department is a mess and terribly mismanaged. Swag is made for men, without consideration for women’s sizes or styles. Women’s voices are not recognized at this company. I was asked illegal questions about pregnancy and children in my interview by the CCO. Maternity policy is vague at best and as much as they claim to have unlimited PTO, coming back to work after having a baby offers no flexibility or policies to support the employee."
98,MX,It has been the best job I've ever had.,2021-02-20,5.0,Customer Support Representative,The best thing about working here is how supportive and understanding everyone is.,None so far! Everything has been great.
99,MX,Awesome Company,2021-05-04,4.0,Data Analyst,Amazing experience and culture. I love how they are always looking to plan ahead and improve the experience of their employees,The interviewing process is unique and identifies the best fits for the company. But the scheduling and length of it could be improved.
100,MX,Fantastic onboarding,2021-02-09,5.0,Enterprise Marketing Specialist,So far the onboarding has been incredible. You can tell everyone actually cares about the work they are doing and is excited and competitive.,no cons so far in the onboarding process.
101,MX,Email & Chat Customer Support,2021-02-17,5.0,Customer Support,"Flexible schedule, great benefits, and great leadership.",The pay is not very competitive.
102,MX,Perfect College Job. HANDS DOWN.,2020-12-26,5.0,Customer Support,"Flexible, Engaging, Innovative, Fun, Challenging",Pay is lower than most tech companies
103,MX,great place to work,2021-05-10,3.0,Senior Enterprise Account Executive,lots of growth right now,too many chiefs on each deal
104,MX,Mission Driven Culture = Job Satisfaction/Fulfillment!,2019-08-20,5.0,Creative Director,"MX is truly working to make the world a better place by tackling financial illiteracy head-on.  Our mission to empower the world to be financially strong informs everything we do.  I personally find a lot of satisfaction and fulfillment out of finding new and creative ways to educate our prospects, customers, and users on the MX solutions that will help them achieve their goals.   

I often tell people that at MX I really feel like I'm putting my creative powers to good use!  We're not selling snake oil—we're providing tools that make it easier for people to stay on top of their finances and ultimately alleviate their greatest stress so that they can live their best life!  

Imagine working with 250+ other people with a shared passion for making the world a better place—that's MX!  Sure we have the free food, snacks, awesome hangout space, great medical benefits and more that is expected in Silicon Slopes but that pales in comparison to the job-satisfaction I described above.  That's why I chose MX!!","Because we're urgently trying to get the word out and execute on our mission, sometimes we don't have the time to really polish.  I'm constantly wishing there was more time in the day!  That being said, it's getting better and we're working to try and get on the front-foot by planning far in advance and giving ample time to the creative process.  Always iterating!!"
105,MX,Real Deal!,2020-10-06,5.0,Director of Client Operations,"This company walks the walk. Mission, Vision, Values are not lip service so be ready to live the culture.","With so much growth, if you are looking for a place that has everything figured out in terms of major growth pains solved, this may not be the best place for you. If you like solving growing pains (good ones), then be ready to jump in with both feet."
106,MX,MX is the place to be!,2020-11-17,5.0,Sales Development Representative,Everyone you work with is here for a reason. Everyone is very positive and gives great feedback.,The work can be hard and exhausting but it is a great place to work. The cons outweigh the pros b a huge margin!
107,MX,Slow and thorough,2021-01-05,4.0,Applications Security Analyst,"Fantastic company culture. Medium sized startup with flexible allowances and perks for the modern worker. Cultivating vision and drive. Everyone is a leader, you pave the road of your own career.",Loose structure of accountability. Flexible nature causes tasks and communications to be handled at the leisure of involved parties in most cases. This breakdown can make communicating with coworkers feel like contacting a distant cousin who rarely has phone reception. Friendly attitude of peers mostly makes up for this however.
108,MX,Incredible people building an incredible product,2020-12-15,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Awesome people
- Interesting work
- Great work/life balance
- People genuinely care about what they do
- Growing",Can't use the incredible office for awhile.
109,MX,OK but not great,2020-11-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Coworkers are intelligent and hard working
Good COVID safety measures
Business outlook is good
Good products
HR is trying really hard to make things fun even though we are all working remotely","Handled COVID safety measures well, but now we are expected to work more than we did before
Not enough effort put into recognizing successes of employees
Not transparent how salaries and raises are determined
Adherence to values is only at surface level
Pay is average but time expectations are above average

If you can get an above average salary I would recommend working here. If you can only get an average salary then I would not recommend it."
110,MX,"Amazing company, great culture.",2020-09-22,5.0,Sales Solutions,New employee. Loved the interview process and felt like they tried to get to know me beyond my resume and made sure I was a good fit for the culture. Onboarding was smooth and seamless. I picked my equipment up at the office and went home and was walked through connecting it and setup with an IT team member. Everyone has been super helpful and positive.,None at all so far.
111,MX,"Great Company, But Not For Everyone",2020-04-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Strong executive leadership and one of a kind culture who truly lives their core values. Have a great product that is very impactful to the greater good of humanity. CEO is a great human and cares deeply about the company and the mission of the software. If you put in the work, you can pave your own career path here.","Extremely fast paced, workload and expectations can be taxing for those sensitive to stress. Similar to many start-up cultures, it can feel very reactionary (growing pains). Processes and communications across departments need improvement to better serve the bottom line and their alignment to business needs/initiatives."
112,MX,Great company!,2020-10-21,5.0,Implementation Specialist,I'm only 3 days in and the company culture has already blown me away!,"Honestly I don't have any down sides right now, but I'm only three days in :)"
113,MX,good overall,2021-01-11,4.0,Software Engineer,"good team members, overall supporting culture",need better management in some areas; also growth room isn't much.
114,MX,MX surpassed my already high expectations,2020-03-31,5.0,Product Manager,"MX is consistently rated as one of the best places to work for in Utah and growing at a rapid rate. There is a reason for that, they have a really impactful vision/mission, great product, and phenomenal leadership team that has created a culture unlike anything I've ever experienced.

- ability to work on something that is making a positive impact on peoples' lives
- transparent and approachable leadership
- lots of autonomy
- competitive pay
- fun perks
- growing like crazy so lots of opportunities for advancement
- happy and helpful employees, they will help you with any support needed",None at this time. Seriously this has been an incredible experience so far.
115,MX,Great Place to Work,2020-08-25,5.0,Software Engineer,"It's really awesome place to work. Amazing technology here, there is enough to spend a lifetime learning.","Very autonomous, so you get the benefit (and sometimes) difficulty of having to be self motivated in pushing yourself."
116,MX,Incredible company for those that are up for the speed and growth,2020-03-09,5.0,Manager,"MX has been on an incredible growth path for several years which is exciting for me. With this comes a lot of opportunity and interesting / difficult challenges. We are continually building; new services, new relationships, new ways to do things. We're not overly process driven, but continue to iterate to ensure we are doing things better tomorrow than we were today. There is a general foundation of trust that everyone is here to build a really great company and people have the support around them to make that happen. We treat each others as founders and hold each other accountable to achieve great things. The general team satisfaction is really high. I have had so much growth since being at MX. I'm constantly stretched and pushing for new heights. It's extremely rewarding. The executive leadership is transparent on where we are succeeding and where we have work to do. I love our Town Hall format where we meet on a regular basis to talk through the successes and challenge areas. Anyone can ask a question and it seems leadership is doing everything they can to make sure we as a team are working on the most critical things to make the biggest impact. I appreciate working for a mission-driven organization, where we see the impact to our customers and their end users and we're making a big difference. This company has the perfect formula of what I want in my career. I appreciate that this company is not a great fit for everyone. Team members come from very diverse backgrounds, and all are accepted and appreciated. But team members have to have a founder's mindset and the drive to provide the right level of value or they will not last here.","If you don't have a founder's mindset and can't take ownership to drive results and make an impact, then you could quickly become lost waiting for someone to tell you what to do. This is not a company for people who want to consistently be told what to do. You've got to figure it out - with your team's support."
117,MX,Best company to work for in Utah,2020-07-16,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Good work life balance, startup culture of founders",Can't think of any at this moment
118,MX,An amazing workplace with supportive people,2020-08-11,5.0,People Development Content Designer,"benefits, culture, people, building, management",the new hire process seems a bit out of date
119,MX,Just Hired but so far so GREAT,2020-07-01,5.0,Client Strategy Consultant,"Excellent People, Excellent Product, great benefits, strong trajectory",Darn COVID! I wish we were in the office to take advantage of more perks!
120,MX,Unique Hiring Process,2020-09-22,4.0,Customer Support,"The hiring process allows you to network with several leaders within the company.

Lots of benefits, and trust in employees. Unlimited PTO.

Competitive, but casual work environment.","Long interview process (2-3 weeks based on my experience). 

That's all I can think of for now."
121,MX,Incredible Company,2019-10-22,5.0,Software QA Engineer,"Here are the pros from my perspective: culture, benefits, management, philosophy, and perks. I love the people I work with, I love the people I work for, and I love the overall purpose of the company, to empower the world to be financially strong.","Sometimes the autonomy to do my job can feel like I'm not doing enough, but that's really on me to be accountable and speak up and ask for feedback. That can seem scary, but ultimately I know it's worth it."
122,MX,The Culture is REAL!,2020-03-17,5.0,Sales Operations Analyst,"They live what they say their culture is

Tons of food

Really cool workers

Awesome leadership 

Meaningful work

Other benefits","You have to be smart... it’s a tough industry, and a complex product.  Not a bad thing, just not a job for everyone."
123,MX,Autonomy and Personal Responsibility,2019-08-19,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Strong engineering culture. I feel empowered to get what I know needs to get done
- Helpful coworkers. Im surrounded by experts and love to learn from them
- High code standards. We are building software meant to last decades, not just software that works today
- Opportunity to grow. Freedom to work on the areas that interest you that you can bring the most value in",Don't expect to have your hand held here. MX has done a great job cultivating a environment where you are able to take the reins and go. Those needing to be managed may not find the environment to be suited to them.
124,MX,Practice what you preach,2019-10-21,5.0,Lead Software Engineer,"MX, like other software companies, has a mission statement and a set of values.  However, unlike other software companies, MX actually incorporates these things into it's day-to-day function.  The executive team truly cares about the wellbeing of their employees *and* their families.  As a member of the MX team, you are empowered to make a difference in areas that you are passionate about.",MX is growing... hopefully the great culture can be maintained throughout the growth.  Cautiously optimistic.
125,MX,Looks great from the outside,2020-02-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,The mission of the company is great; helping the world to become financially strong. Love that idea.,"You are brought in with this idea of family and wonderful support, when that is minimal at best.  

1. During the interview process; you interview with the CCO, who is offensive, asks illegal interview questions, and is the least liked executive at MX (backed by annual employee surveys).  He is in charge of interviewing for ""culture fit"" when in fact he is just asking awkward and personal questions claiming he is trying to really get to know you on a deeper level. There have been a few individuals that have received offers from MX that would have been an asset to the company, that turned down their offers because of the attitude of the CCO. If MX employed someone like him, it was obviously not a place they wanted to be.

2. MX thinks that free lunches, snacks, dinner, massages, etc. make for an amazing employee experience instead of supporting their employees, creating leaders (not managers; there is a difference <-- MX doesn't understand this obviously), and fostering employee development.

3. The current overgrowth. MX has been hiring like crazy for the past 5 months. They once made a claim that they would never hire just to hire, but instead try to find a good employee fit and grow with intention. Their current growth feels more like they are rapidly trying to reach an internal number so externally they can meet a mark (e.g. IPO, acquire a company, or sell). It is currently creating a disjointed and unsettled environment."
126,MX,Autonomous environment allows engineers to flourish but is not for everyone,2019-08-22,5.0,Software Engineer,"* At MX, engineers have autonomy to choose what to work on, to the point that engineers are expected to find and prioritize their own work.
* Arguments are candid and respectful.
* There are lots of exciting and meaningful projects to contribute to.","* Some engineers don't like the amount of uncertainty they are asked to work in.
* Engineers are expected to be very proactive to find out what's going on and figure out how they can help, and some people do not like that approach."
127,MX,"Amazing for Some, Horrible for Others",2015-12-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"MX is very polarizing.  Notice the reviews are either 5 stars or 1 star.  Nothing in between.  MX is for proactive people, not reactive people.  My personality meshes with the company and I love working here.  The compensation and benefits are fantastic.  We've recently added a phenomenal sales leader.  He has reshaped the sales department.  Which is where some of the negative feelings of former employees come from.  It is completely fair that they are unhappy.  The company now is very different than the company they were hired in to.  I would be upset too.  That being said, the company just had its best sales quarter.  And this quarter looks to be even better.  It has been my experience that MX management is completely open if you go and ask.  If you want them to read your mind and come to you, then you will feel like they aren't communicating with you.  The products and technology are amazing.  The company is growing quickly, more than double the headcount in the past year.  The opportunity to learn new things at MX is better than anywhere I've worked.  In some ways I feel bad for those who work here right out of college.  Wherever they work after MX will be a huge step down.",The growing pains are rough sometimes.  New employees every week.  Bringing new people in is time consuming.
128,MX,Job Review,2019-11-12,5.0,Deal Desk Analyst,The people are very inclusive and collaborative. They all work towards shared goals and maintain high standards of work ethic.,It isn't so large that you have a set-in-stone role. Rather you may have to wear different hats
129,MX,Awesome Company,2019-12-12,5.0,Video Producer,MX really cares about its employees and their personal career growth and success.,The company is growing quick so there is less and less room.
130,MX,"Great company, mission and vision.",2019-08-21,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"MX creates a challenging and rewarding environment and to me it’s addicting. The culture is certainly one of a kind centered around transparency, execution, empathy, high expectations and the mission. I can’t leave this place because there is only one culture like this!",Expectations around work life balance could use some attention.
131,MX,"Great place to work, learn, and grow",2018-02-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Mission driven organization that cares about the wellbeing of its employees. Introspective, transparent, and continually striving to improve. Though management styles vary by department, employees generally are given a lot of autonomy and ability to self-manage. Lots of opportunity to take on new projects, have an impact in different areas of the organization, and develop personally and professionally. There's a sense of what I like to call ""collaborative competition"" that keeps people striving to be their very best. 

Encourages balance in life with unlimited vacation policy, great breakroom for family and friends to enjoy, and lots of fun company get togethers for family to join.","Some of the pros would be cons for some people. Not everyone is really okay with autonomy and self-management, introspection, and transparency. These are ideals I think most people say they want, but I've seen a lot of people come and go who aren't able to operate well in MX's unique culture. MX is never an ""easy"" job, and that feeling of trying to keep up with all your awesome peers can become exhausting. Ultimately, each individual is responsible for managing their workload and making sure that they're contributing in a meaningful way without burning themselves out."
132,MX,Ex employee review,2019-10-29,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Small growing company with tons of room for personal growth. Very supportive product organization and nurturing mentors who care more about your overall health and happiness over deadlines. I was on an amazing team.,Pay was below market average and teams were understaffed.
133,MX,Awesome Company,2019-09-17,5.0,Software Engineer,This company values autonomy.  I have the opportunity to make a difference.,Not much of anything negative.
134,MX,Work/life balance is the best I've had,2015-12-12,5.0,Ruby Engineer,"One of my favorite things is the culture in engineering doesn't have an expectation to stay late after work.  You work hard while you're at work, but you can enjoy your family when you're off. The open vacation policy allows me to feel like I'm not living to work, but my work allows me to live how I would like.
Really smart people.  The team has only gotten better as it has grown.  Pretty pristine codebase where you can focus on building things and not constantly fighting technical debt.
Great leadership within engineering.  Questions from other engineers are encouraged, not discouraged and engineers aren't shamed in ""you should already know that"".

Good health, dental, and vision care, 100% disability insurance covered, can get 4% contribution from employer on 401(k), open vacation policy, catered lunches (twice a week), catered dinners (if you choose to work until 6:30).","Since it is a place with mostly self management and not top-level coming to you and assigning you things, occasionally I've felt a little lost in what to work on next with the lack of structure.  But overall it has turned out well as I've been able to focus and learn about projects I'm interested in."
135,MX,Great experience so far,2015-12-12,5.0,Software Engineer,"I truly love working here.  All of the engineers are so knowledgeable and you really get a sense that they believe in what they're working on.  The culture is like nothing I've ever seen.  It's very ""hands off"".  Brandon's (CTO) motto is ""we're not going to manage you, we brought you here because we think you can manage yourselves and that's how we feel we can get the best out of our people"".  You work on what you want to work on and what you have a real passion for.  Tons of perks, food and great people.  After 10 years working in retail MX seems like an oasis in the middle of the desert.  Amazing!","I guess this would be a con with most startups/small companies but sometimes things do fall through the cracks... nothing major though.  And if you give someone a quick little bump they will get on in immediately so I really don't even consider it a con.  Actually, all companies are like this.  I worked at a $7 billion multi national conglomerate and things fell through the cracks with them all the time, and they wouldn't get addressed for weeks!"
136,MX,Love It,2014-12-11,5.0,Software Engineer,"One of the first questions I was asked when I started at MX was ""what do you want to work on today?"" Seems simple, but it's really an amazing question. There wasn't a, ""you'll have to go through a training program that will take a couple weeks"" or a ""take a few days and get familiar with the code"" or a ""here's a list of bugs or tasks to get you going"".

We don't have management you are reporting to or sprint planning meetings that tell you what you're going to do. You are expected to grab a task and get it done and are trusted to get it done well. 

Beyond all that, the culture's great. We're a relatively small group that likes to work hard and likes to celebrate our successes.","The organization is really flat, so if you are looking to climb the management ranks, there isn't a lot of opportunities for that here. Also, there's a bit of a ""Swim or Sink"" mentality here. You aren't getting managed, so you better be able to manage yourself. Neither is a turn off for me, but it could be for others. 

This style of management doesn't fit for everyone, so if a ton of independence and autonomy doesn't sound like an environment you'll succeed in, that's ok."
137,MX,Great place to grow as an engineer,2015-04-15,5.0,Lead Developer,"Developers are given a lot of freedom to choose their projects at MX so I spend about 70% of my time working on problems that I find interesting enough to still be thinking about them when I'm falling asleep or getting ready in the morning.

The company is is an engineering-led organization, so I don't have to convince anyone that writing tests and taking time to refactor code is a good idea. Our organization is always looking for betters way to do something. As long as you can make a case to your fellow engineers for why you should spend time on something, you will get the chance to do it.

I really love working with engineers who are better than me in various ways. The engineering team is stacked with some of the best engineers I've ever gotten to work with so I'm learning a tremendous amount.","Because we have so much autonomy as engineers we don't always do a great job of giving support to junior engineers on the team. There's no official process for supporting them so unless we stop and think about it, it will get forgotten. If you want to be successful on this team you will need an assertive personality to make sure that your voice is heard and you get the support you need to finish projects."
138,MX,Thorough & Excellent Hiring Process,2017-10-18,5.0,Project Manager,"The best part of MX's hiring process was their transparency into what kind of company they really are, who exactly they're trying to hire and why, and their thoroughness in figuring out whether you'd be a good match or not. Not only do they consider your work history, but they also do not discriminate against a lack of a degree. Rather, they base their decision off of a lot of different factors. 
Throughout the entire process, MX kept me informed of the next steps and how they're feeling about hiring me so far. 
On my first day, my entire workstation was already set up, along with a really nice gift basket filled with goodies, including an MX shirt for myself and my 4-year old son.","The hiring process consisted of 5 separate interviews over a period of 4 weeks, which is a little tedious. However, that being said, it does give you the chance to vet the company as much as it gives them the chance to vet you."
139,MX,"Where purpose, passion and incredible people live.",2017-11-16,5.0,Client Strategy Consultant,"MX does so many neat things for employees and their families. From catered meals, massive work parties to service projects MX knows how to make a difference in their employees lives. The quality of MX employees is so critical to how we operate on a daily basis, we inspire and push each other to achieve more. One of the best experiences I have had is meeting with organizations that truly want to make a difference in their end users lives. Driving the cause of financial advocacy is such a crucial cause to securing our future, not only as individuals but in a much larger scope that can change the future of our country and ultimately the human race.","MX isn’t for everyone, it’s hard work and can be challenging in many ways. Accountability and contribution are not “nice to haves” but critical for survival in this environment. If you need a clearly defined work structure and someone to hold you accountable I would recommend looking somewhere else."
