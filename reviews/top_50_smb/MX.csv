0,MX,Very Strong Company,2022-04-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Top Level Leadership excellent
- great culture
- smart people
- aligned workforce","- high growth, initiatives don’t stick"
1,MX,Exciting place to work!,2022-03-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,MX is a great place to build! The caliber of people is in my opinion the most attractive part of working at MX. The care and quality of work is always displayed in the teams effort to execute.,Still learning through normal growing pains of an evolving company
2,MX,"Good Culture, and very culture focus, Low Pay",2022-02-21,4.0,Software Engineer,"- They really make sure to take care of you ( anything other than compensation ).
- Great co-workers
- Great managers
- Clean codebase, autonomy","- They usually offer compensation that is 30% - 40% lower than the market, that's the price you pay for great culture. Consider they received a great amount of funding.
- The company has a great mission, hence the higher up probably wants to be in control, which means, probably not IPO or selling it anytime soon. So company shares are worthless, well they worth something on paper.

=> Good company to work for, as long as money is not your concern. I can picture myself as a senior dev with everything paid off, and just living to code would love to work for MX forever."
3,MX,I love working for MX,2022-03-14,5.0,QA Engineer,"- Great work/life balance
- Great co-workers
- Remote
- Great benefits",- None come to mind
4,MX,"Great people, great vision, great technology",2022-02-28,5.0,Backend Software Engineer,Everyone at MX strives to live up to the company values on a daily basis. The people are friendly and talented. MX does a great job at treating employees as people first which is very refreshing.,I don't have anything negative to say.
5,MX,A Great Company to Work For,2022-03-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,I support the company's mission. My co-workers are friendly and competent. I get lots of opportunities to learn and grow. I absolutely love the ability to be flexible with my schedule and to work fully remotely.,The pay could be a little higher.
6,MX,Easily the best working environment I've experienced,2022-01-18,5.0,Client Strategy Consultant,"It sounds so cliché these days, but the reality is that MX has an outstanding culture that permeates the whole organization. The MX values are discussed or referenced frequently. It's a truly collaborative place. Being smart and being right are valued as much as 'failing up' and speaking out.

Senior Management is deeply involved in the recruiting process and a lot of effort is put into ensuring cultural fitness. Having an ivy league education or having worked for a target company are not prerequisites. We have true diversity in that area and it's wonderful. I enjoy seeing real diversity at work when participating in meetings and truly intellectually diverse points of view.

This is the first mission-driven company I've worked for. The mission and vision doesn't take the back seat (or at least hasn't yet) to profitability and short-term success.

Not everything is perfect and wonderful (as I will outline in the cons), but I'd just say that all of the awards received as a Top Place to Work, aren't coincidence or manipulation of ratings.","- We are growing fast and we are facing some resource constraints that sometimes make it difficult to execute

- Our products are outstanding, but it feels like our marketing of them isn't really as good as it could be. They are difficult products to explain and create ads for, but some of our main competitors seems to have an edge in this area. Even with inferior products

- I haven't seen any signs that it will be a problem, but I am worried about the prospect of an IPO or an acquisition disturbing the great culture at MX

- Path to promotion is unclear. People do get promoted and internal advancement doesn't seem to be unrealistic. But we don't really have clarity on how to make that happen"
7,MX,"Great atmosphere, and very welcoming",2022-02-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"These guys really believe in making everyone feel right at home.

I haven't worked for a company that is so invested in people, whether they be employees or customers. MX touts the importance of the companies core values, values that I feel are integral to finding fulfillment. Even better, the company practices what it preaches and the outcome is incredible. I have been looking for a place like this for a long time and I'm excited to share in the MX vision.","Certain processes may be lacking, but MX is aware of it and is striving to fill in the gaps."
21,MX,Talented Coworkers,2022-01-26,5.0,QA Engineer,Having crazy smart coworkers was great,There were way too many meetings
22,MX,Come build mx!,2022-01-06,5.0,Mobile Developer,"Engineering led culture, foundation of trust and incredible overall company culture",Sometimes hard to get a large raise once you’ve already been working here for awhile.
23,MX,My opinion,2022-01-07,5.0,Software Engineer,Culture is awesome and very generous with PTO.,Some downside might be depending on your department you won't get to know others in the company as it is growing so fast.
24,MX,Onboarding is Great,2021-10-21,5.0,Software Engineer,The onboarding process has been really nice and organized. They really want to make sure employees are comfortable and have what they need. It's very organized so you can get most things done on your own if you prefer.,"This could be looked at as a pro; it took a couple of days before I was added to team meetings, but I was still doing onboarding so it gave me more time to focus on that. I know they are doing a lot of hiring so they were most likely busy with other things."
25,MX,Engaging and Fast Moving Company,2022-01-21,4.0,Client Strategy Consultant,"Solid product, fantastic team, amazing history and culture.","Product is extremely complicated, long ramp up period and sales cycle."

33,MX,Onboarding,2021-09-16,5.0,Project Manager/Business Analyst,"Onboarding can feel overwhelming. NOT if you are working for MX, though. They added so much personal touch that it almost feels like a second home.

56,MX,Well Taken Care Of,2021-08-09,4.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),I have worked here 9 months and find that they continue to put their emotional intelligence at the forefront. I can complain or ask for more training and I have several people who step in to aid and fix the problems. They are committed to my success and structured the comp plan well.,Things feel siloed.

57,MX,Good Organization Left Leaning,2021-05-05,2.0,Frontend Engineer,"Benefits. The benefits are amazing! The facility is pretty awesome. You really get the feeling you are working somewhere important. Also, the community is quite awesome. The people are super nice and usually pretty real.","I left because I didn't have confidence in the maintainability of the software moving forward. There is a huge emphasis on the employees and the assumption is that if you take care of the employees you will end up with a good product. This seems good but I also noticed the existence of a quite large bug economy and tons of dead code. Also, the code was confusing with poor names and almost zero standardization to keep a reader from getting lost in the 40 or so methodologies used to construct the thing. There is a sense that we need to go fast which ultimately made a huge unhealthy mess."

I interviewed with individuals that would be in my department, with individuals that I would be working with directly and a few indirectly. I had fantastic clarity on what was going to happen with each interview and always knew what was coming next and where I stood with the process.

Since I was brought on, I have had nothing but fantastic interactions with individuals at all levels of the organization. I have felt welcomed and wanted throughout the entire experience. I have had clear expectations set, generous amounts of resources to help me get up to speed with my role and the organization/business model.","I would have loved to receive an email the week prior to starting with detailed out explanation of what I could expect for my first week of work; especially with working remote due to COVID. I received my HR and Onboarding email, but would have LOVED to receive an email detailing out what I could expect as far as onboarding and training schedule is concerned.

From the first call, I could sense this is a company that knows who they are and what they stand for. They know the value they bring to the world and it showed in their humble confidence throughout the recruitment process. That's something rare and cannot be faked. From day one, I wanted to be a part of this company.","The interview process took a bit long (7-8 interviews). While every interview was fantastic and I was told what to expect afterward, it would've been good to know from the start what the overall process would be from end to end to avoid any anxiety."
69,MX,Superb company to work for,2021-02-25,5.0,QA Engineer,"Great people and management. The management sincerely believes in the values they profess, and act accordingly. They work really hard to show appreciation for each of their employees. They have clearly defined career paths, and freely offer the support necessary for you to advance.

91,MX,Enjoyable Hiring Process,2021-03-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Talented people, teamwork galore, everything provided to do a great job",Now hire - still looking for cons. Will update when found.
92,MX,Thorough Vetting Process,2021-04-06,5.0,Product Data Analyst,Great compensation and culture! Everyone is super friendly and welcoming!,None yet that I am aware of.
93,MX,"Amazing Company, Amazing Recruiting Experience",2020-12-03,5.0,Executive Assistant,"MX offers a unique and robust environment of inclusion and unity. That why it's called the MX Family. MX gets at the heart of providing value to their clients and their employees with a truly all-encompassing employment experience. Their Talent acquisitions and people operations was the smoothest I have ever experienced. My talent consultant was on point, very responsive, and made the whole process seamless.","The only con I can think of is that not all organizations can be as great as MX. Then again, that's not MX's fault."
94,MX,Amazing company! Takes care of their employees,2021-02-09,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"I just started at MX, and their onboard experience is one of the best! I am meeting awesome people and they are making sure that I an set up for success.",I dont have any that I can think of
95,MX,"Powerful products, amazing teams, and a great place to grow!",2020-10-15,5.0,Marketing,"I worked at MX for over 4 years and loved every single moment. I grew personally in my career, made a lot of new friends, and will cherish my memories there for years to come. Ryan Caldwell is a great leader and although things felt chaotic at times, he was quick to reign it all back in. Growing pains are normal for any startup and I look at how leadership adjusts and solves problems to determine if a company is on the right track to maintain a great culture. 

Top Takeaways:
1. Wanna get your hands dirty and build something great? That's MX. 
2. Craving work/life balance and a sense of purpose? That's MX.
3. Desire to work somewhere fun and meet some amazing co-workers? That's MX.
4. Great atmosphere with a lot of care put into employee well-being? That's MX.

MX is a great fit for anyone who likes to roll up their sleeves, learn every day, and love what they do. Great benefits, 401k match, and equity.","I left MX for another opportunity, but would not have even considered looking if I wasn’t dealing with a highly toxic executive who was mismanaging his team and very out of touch with reality. This was my only poor experience and unfortunately, at that time, the person over HR was not fit for their role and didn’t handle it appropriately.   No workplace is perfect! That executive is still at the company, but they’ve put a bandaid over the problem and hired other leaders beneath him who are better at leading and growing teams.   I have way more positive things to say about MX than negative, but this was the one I needed to get off my chest."
96,MX,Great hiring and onboarding process,2021-02-23,5.0,Software Engineer,I just started at MX and the hiring process was great and so far the onboarding process has been excellent.,I don't have any cons to report.
97,MX,"Strong Mission & Vision, Prepared to be Underpaid",2020-08-19,3.0,Software QA Engineer,"MX's mission and values are strong. They hire a passionate group of people to drive that mission forward. The company has a very flexible PTO benefit, among other useful benefits (massage therapists, catered meals, employee assistance program).","Prepare to have a very uphill batter for fair compensation, especially if you're a woman. (Also noting that the majority of women in the company are in more entry-level roles and very few hold leadership/management positions.)

Much of the management that submits comp changes are unfamiliar with the industry & regional standards. Those same individuals appear to be content with the salaries they're told from HR/Finance."
98,MX,"If you’re a woman, RUN.",2021-02-05,1.0,People Team,"When you’re in office, there’s perks and free food.","Very few women in leadership. No transparency around salaries. Rampant nepotism. First woman to get a promotion is the sister in law of the CEO. The whole HR department is a mess and terribly mismanaged. Swag is made for men, without consideration for women’s sizes or styles. Women’s voices are not recognized at this company. I was asked illegal questions about pregnancy and children in my interview by the CCO. Maternity policy is vague at best and as much as they claim to have unlimited PTO, coming back to work after having a baby offers no flexibility or policies to support the employee."
99,MX,It has been the best job I've ever had.,2021-02-20,5.0,Customer Support Representative,The best thing about working here is how supportive and understanding everyone is.,None so far! Everything has been great.
100,MX,Awesome Company,2021-05-04,4.0,Data Analyst,Amazing experience and culture. I love how they are always looking to plan ahead and improve the experience of their employees,The interviewing process is unique and identifies the best fits for the company. But the scheduling and length of it could be improved.
101,MX,Fantastic onboarding,2021-02-09,5.0,Enterprise Marketing Specialist,So far the onboarding has been incredible. You can tell everyone actually cares about the work they are doing and is excited and competitive.,no cons so far in the onboarding process.
102,MX,Email & Chat Customer Support,2021-02-17,5.0,Customer Support,"Flexible schedule, great benefits, and great leadership.",The pay is not very competitive.
103,MX,Perfect College Job. HANDS DOWN.,2020-12-26,5.0,Customer Support,"Flexible, Engaging, Innovative, Fun, Challenging",Pay is lower than most tech companies
104,MX,great place to work,2021-05-10,3.0,Senior Enterprise Account Executive,lots of growth right now,too many chiefs on each deal
105,MX,Mission Driven Culture = Job Satisfaction/Fulfillment!,2019-08-20,5.0,Creative Director,"MX is truly working to make the world a better place by tackling financial illiteracy head-on.  Our mission to empower the world to be financially strong informs everything we do.  I personally find a lot of satisfaction and fulfillment out of finding new and creative ways to educate our prospects, customers, and users on the MX solutions that will help them achieve their goals.   

I often tell people that at MX I really feel like I'm putting my creative powers to good use!  We're not selling snake oil—we're providing tools that make it easier for people to stay on top of their finances and ultimately alleviate their greatest stress so that they can live their best life!  

Imagine working with 250+ other people with a shared passion for making the world a better place—that's MX!  Sure we have the free food, snacks, awesome hangout space, great medical benefits and more that is expected in Silicon Slopes but that pales in comparison to the job-satisfaction I described above.  That's why I chose MX!!","Because we're urgently trying to get the word out and execute on our mission, sometimes we don't have the time to really polish.  I'm constantly wishing there was more time in the day!  That being said, it's getting better and we're working to try and get on the front-foot by planning far in advance and giving ample time to the creative process.  Always iterating!!"
106,MX,Real Deal!,2020-10-06,5.0,Director of Client Operations,"This company walks the walk. Mission, Vision, Values are not lip service so be ready to live the culture.","With so much growth, if you are looking for a place that has everything figured out in terms of major growth pains solved, this may not be the best place for you. If you like solving growing pains (good ones), then be ready to jump in with both feet."
107,MX,MX is the place to be!,2020-11-17,5.0,Sales Development Representative,Everyone you work with is here for a reason. Everyone is very positive and gives great feedback.,The work can be hard and exhausting but it is a great place to work. The cons outweigh the pros b a huge margin!
108,MX,Slow and thorough,2021-01-05,4.0,Applications Security Analyst,"Fantastic company culture. Medium sized startup with flexible allowances and perks for the modern worker. Cultivating vision and drive. Everyone is a leader, you pave the road of your own career.",Loose structure of accountability. Flexible nature causes tasks and communications to be handled at the leisure of involved parties in most cases. This breakdown can make communicating with coworkers feel like contacting a distant cousin who rarely has phone reception. Friendly attitude of peers mostly makes up for this however.
109,MX,Incredible people building an incredible product,2020-12-15,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Awesome people
- Interesting work
- Great work/life balance
- People genuinely care about what they do
- Growing",Can't use the incredible office for awhile.
110,MX,OK but not great,2020-11-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Coworkers are intelligent and hard working
Good COVID safety measures
Business outlook is good
Good products
HR is trying really hard to make things fun even though we are all working remotely","Handled COVID safety measures well, but now we are expected to work more than we did before
Not enough effort put into recognizing successes of employees
Not transparent how salaries and raises are determined
Adherence to values is only at surface level
Pay is average but time expectations are above average

If you can get an above average salary I would recommend working here. If you can only get an average salary then I would not recommend it."
111,MX,"Amazing company, great culture.",2020-09-22,5.0,Sales Solutions,New employee. Loved the interview process and felt like they tried to get to know me beyond my resume and made sure I was a good fit for the culture. Onboarding was smooth and seamless. I picked my equipment up at the office and went home and was walked through connecting it and setup with an IT team member. Everyone has been super helpful and positive.,None at all so far.
112,MX,"Great Company, But Not For Everyone",2020-04-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Strong executive leadership and one of a kind culture who truly lives their core values. Have a great product that is very impactful to the greater good of humanity. CEO is a great human and cares deeply about the company and the mission of the software. If you put in the work, you can pave your own career path here.","Extremely fast paced, workload and expectations can be taxing for those sensitive to stress. Similar to many start-up cultures, it can feel very reactionary (growing pains). Processes and communications across departments need improvement to better serve the bottom line and their alignment to business needs/initiatives."
113,MX,Great company!,2020-10-21,5.0,Implementation Specialist,I'm only 3 days in and the company culture has already blown me away!,"Honestly I don't have any down sides right now, but I'm only three days in :)"
114,MX,good overall,2021-01-11,4.0,Software Engineer,"good team members, overall supporting culture",need better management in some areas; also growth room isn't much.
115,MX,MX surpassed my already high expectations,2020-03-31,5.0,Product Manager,"MX is consistently rated as one of the best places to work for in Utah and growing at a rapid rate. There is a reason for that, they have a really impactful vision/mission, great product, and phenomenal leadership team that has created a culture unlike anything I've ever experienced.

- ability to work on something that is making a positive impact on peoples' lives
- transparent and approachable leadership
- lots of autonomy
- competitive pay
- fun perks
- growing like crazy so lots of opportunities for advancement
- happy and helpful employees, they will help you with any support needed",None at this time. Seriously this has been an incredible experience so far.
116,MX,Great Place to Work,2020-08-25,5.0,Software Engineer,"It's really awesome place to work. Amazing technology here, there is enough to spend a lifetime learning.","Very autonomous, so you get the benefit (and sometimes) difficulty of having to be self motivated in pushing yourself."
117,MX,Incredible company for those that are up for the speed and growth,2020-03-09,5.0,Manager,"MX has been on an incredible growth path for several years which is exciting for me. With this comes a lot of opportunity and interesting / difficult challenges. We are continually building; new services, new relationships, new ways to do things. We're not overly process driven, but continue to iterate to ensure we are doing things better tomorrow than we were today. There is a general foundation of trust that everyone is here to build a really great company and people have the support around them to make that happen. We treat each others as founders and hold each other accountable to achieve great things. The general team satisfaction is really high. I have had so much growth since being at MX. I'm constantly stretched and pushing for new heights. It's extremely rewarding. The executive leadership is transparent on where we are succeeding and where we have work to do. I love our Town Hall format where we meet on a regular basis to talk through the successes and challenge areas. Anyone can ask a question and it seems leadership is doing everything they can to make sure we as a team are working on the most critical things to make the biggest impact. I appreciate working for a mission-driven organization, where we see the impact to our customers and their end users and we're making a big difference. This company has the perfect formula of what I want in my career. I appreciate that this company is not a great fit for everyone. Team members come from very diverse backgrounds, and all are accepted and appreciated. But team members have to have a founder's mindset and the drive to provide the right level of value or they will not last here.","If you don't have a founder's mindset and can't take ownership to drive results and make an impact, then you could quickly become lost waiting for someone to tell you what to do. This is not a company for people who want to consistently be told what to do. You've got to figure it out - with your team's support."
118,MX,Best company to work for in Utah,2020-07-16,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Good work life balance, startup culture of founders",Can't think of any at this moment
119,MX,An amazing workplace with supportive people,2020-08-11,5.0,People Development Content Designer,"benefits, culture, people, building, management",the new hire process seems a bit out of date
120,MX,Just Hired but so far so GREAT,2020-07-01,5.0,Client Strategy Consultant,"Excellent People, Excellent Product, great benefits, strong trajectory",Darn COVID! I wish we were in the office to take advantage of more perks!
121,MX,Unique Hiring Process,2020-09-22,4.0,Customer Support,"The hiring process allows you to network with several leaders within the company.

Lots of benefits, and trust in employees. Unlimited PTO.

Competitive, but casual work environment.","Long interview process (2-3 weeks based on my experience). 

That's all I can think of for now."
122,MX,Incredible Company,2019-10-22,5.0,Software QA Engineer,"Here are the pros from my perspective: culture, benefits, management, philosophy, and perks. I love the people I work with, I love the people I work for, and I love the overall purpose of the company, to empower the world to be financially strong.","Sometimes the autonomy to do my job can feel like I'm not doing enough, but that's really on me to be accountable and speak up and ask for feedback. That can seem scary, but ultimately I know it's worth it."
123,MX,The Culture is REAL!,2020-03-17,5.0,Sales Operations Analyst,"They live what they say their culture is

Tons of food

Really cool workers

Awesome leadership 

Meaningful work

Other benefits","You have to be smart... it’s a tough industry, and a complex product.  Not a bad thing, just not a job for everyone."
124,MX,Autonomy and Personal Responsibility,2019-08-19,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Strong engineering culture. I feel empowered to get what I know needs to get done
- Helpful coworkers. Im surrounded by experts and love to learn from them
- High code standards. We are building software meant to last decades, not just software that works today
- Opportunity to grow. Freedom to work on the areas that interest you that you can bring the most value in",Don't expect to have your hand held here. MX has done a great job cultivating a environment where you are able to take the reins and go. Those needing to be managed may not find the environment to be suited to them.
125,MX,Looks great from the outside,2020-02-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,The mission of the company is great; helping the world to become financially strong. Love that idea.,"You are brought in with this idea of family and wonderful support, when that is minimal at best.  

1. During the interview process; you interview with the CCO, who is offensive, asks illegal interview questions, and is the least liked executive at MX (backed by annual employee surveys).  He is in charge of interviewing for ""culture fit"" when in fact he is just asking awkward and personal questions claiming he is trying to really get to know you on a deeper level. There have been a few individuals that have received offers from MX that would have been an asset to the company, that turned down their offers because of the attitude of the CCO. If MX employed someone like him, it was obviously not a place they wanted to be.

2. MX thinks that free lunches, snacks, dinner, massages, etc. make for an amazing employee experience instead of supporting their employees, creating leaders (not managers; there is a difference <-- MX doesn't understand this obviously), and fostering employee development.

3. The current overgrowth. MX has been hiring like crazy for the past 5 months. They once made a claim that they would never hire just to hire, but instead try to find a good employee fit and grow with intention. Their current growth feels more like they are rapidly trying to reach an internal number so externally they can meet a mark (e.g. IPO, acquire a company, or sell). It is currently creating a disjointed and unsettled environment."
126,MX,Practice what you preach,2019-10-21,5.0,Lead Software Engineer,"MX, like other software companies, has a mission statement and a set of values.  However, unlike other software companies, MX actually incorporates these things into it's day-to-day function.  The executive team truly cares about the wellbeing of their employees *and* their families.  As a member of the MX team, you are empowered to make a difference in areas that you are passionate about.",MX is growing... hopefully the great culture can be maintained throughout the growth.  Cautiously optimistic.
127,MX,Autonomous environment allows engineers to flourish but is not for everyone,2019-08-22,5.0,Software Engineer,"* At MX, engineers have autonomy to choose what to work on, to the point that engineers are expected to find and prioritize their own work.
* Arguments are candid and respectful.
* There are lots of exciting and meaningful projects to contribute to.","* Some engineers don't like the amount of uncertainty they are asked to work in.
* Engineers are expected to be very proactive to find out what's going on and figure out how they can help, and some people do not like that approach."
128,MX,"Amazing for Some, Horrible for Others",2015-12-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"MX is very polarizing.  Notice the reviews are either 5 stars or 1 star.  Nothing in between.  MX is for proactive people, not reactive people.  My personality meshes with the company and I love working here.  The compensation and benefits are fantastic.  We've recently added a phenomenal sales leader.  He has reshaped the sales department.  Which is where some of the negative feelings of former employees come from.  It is completely fair that they are unhappy.  The company now is very different than the company they were hired in to.  I would be upset too.  That being said, the company just had its best sales quarter.  And this quarter looks to be even better.  It has been my experience that MX management is completely open if you go and ask.  If you want them to read your mind and come to you, then you will feel like they aren't communicating with you.  The products and technology are amazing.  The company is growing quickly, more than double the headcount in the past year.  The opportunity to learn new things at MX is better than anywhere I've worked.  In some ways I feel bad for those who work here right out of college.  Wherever they work after MX will be a huge step down.",The growing pains are rough sometimes.  New employees every week.  Bringing new people in is time consuming.
129,MX,Job Review,2019-11-12,5.0,Deal Desk Analyst,The people are very inclusive and collaborative. They all work towards shared goals and maintain high standards of work ethic.,It isn't so large that you have a set-in-stone role. Rather you may have to wear different hats
130,MX,Awesome Company,2019-12-12,5.0,Video Producer,MX really cares about its employees and their personal career growth and success.,The company is growing quick so there is less and less room.
131,MX,"Great company, mission and vision.",2019-08-21,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"MX creates a challenging and rewarding environment and to me it’s addicting. The culture is certainly one of a kind centered around transparency, execution, empathy, high expectations and the mission. I can’t leave this place because there is only one culture like this!",Expectations around work life balance could use some attention.
132,MX,"Great place to work, learn, and grow",2018-02-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Mission driven organization that cares about the wellbeing of its employees. Introspective, transparent, and continually striving to improve. Though management styles vary by department, employees generally are given a lot of autonomy and ability to self-manage. Lots of opportunity to take on new projects, have an impact in different areas of the organization, and develop personally and professionally. There's a sense of what I like to call ""collaborative competition"" that keeps people striving to be their very best. 

Encourages balance in life with unlimited vacation policy, great breakroom for family and friends to enjoy, and lots of fun company get togethers for family to join.","Some of the pros would be cons for some people. Not everyone is really okay with autonomy and self-management, introspection, and transparency. These are ideals I think most people say they want, but I've seen a lot of people come and go who aren't able to operate well in MX's unique culture. MX is never an ""easy"" job, and that feeling of trying to keep up with all your awesome peers can become exhausting. Ultimately, each individual is responsible for managing their workload and making sure that they're contributing in a meaningful way without burning themselves out."
133,MX,Ex employee review,2019-10-29,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Small growing company with tons of room for personal growth. Very supportive product organization and nurturing mentors who care more about your overall health and happiness over deadlines. I was on an amazing team.,Pay was below market average and teams were understaffed.
134,MX,Awesome Company,2019-09-17,5.0,Software Engineer,This company values autonomy.  I have the opportunity to make a difference.,Not much of anything negative.
135,MX,Work/life balance is the best I've had,2015-12-12,5.0,Ruby Engineer,"One of my favorite things is the culture in engineering doesn't have an expectation to stay late after work.  You work hard while you're at work, but you can enjoy your family when you're off. The open vacation policy allows me to feel like I'm not living to work, but my work allows me to live how I would like.
Really smart people.  The team has only gotten better as it has grown.  Pretty pristine codebase where you can focus on building things and not constantly fighting technical debt.
Great leadership within engineering.  Questions from other engineers are encouraged, not discouraged and engineers aren't shamed in ""you should already know that"".

Good health, dental, and vision care, 100% disability insurance covered, can get 4% contribution from employer on 401(k), open vacation policy, catered lunches (twice a week), catered dinners (if you choose to work until 6:30).","Since it is a place with mostly self management and not top-level coming to you and assigning you things, occasionally I've felt a little lost in what to work on next with the lack of structure.  But overall it has turned out well as I've been able to focus and learn about projects I'm interested in."
136,MX,Great experience so far,2015-12-12,5.0,Software Engineer,"I truly love working here.  All of the engineers are so knowledgeable and you really get a sense that they believe in what they're working on.  The culture is like nothing I've ever seen.  It's very ""hands off"".  Brandon's (CTO) motto is ""we're not going to manage you, we brought you here because we think you can manage yourselves and that's how we feel we can get the best out of our people"".  You work on what you want to work on and what you have a real passion for.  Tons of perks, food and great people.  After 10 years working in retail MX seems like an oasis in the middle of the desert.  Amazing!","I guess this would be a con with most startups/small companies but sometimes things do fall through the cracks... nothing major though.  And if you give someone a quick little bump they will get on in immediately so I really don't even consider it a con.  Actually, all companies are like this.  I worked at a $7 billion multi national conglomerate and things fell through the cracks with them all the time, and they wouldn't get addressed for weeks!"
137,MX,Love It,2014-12-11,5.0,Software Engineer,"One of the first questions I was asked when I started at MX was ""what do you want to work on today?"" Seems simple, but it's really an amazing question. There wasn't a, ""you'll have to go through a training program that will take a couple weeks"" or a ""take a few days and get familiar with the code"" or a ""here's a list of bugs or tasks to get you going"".

We don't have management you are reporting to or sprint planning meetings that tell you what you're going to do. You are expected to grab a task and get it done and are trusted to get it done well. 

Beyond all that, the culture's great. We're a relatively small group that likes to work hard and likes to celebrate our successes.","The organization is really flat, so if you are looking to climb the management ranks, there isn't a lot of opportunities for that here. Also, there's a bit of a ""Swim or Sink"" mentality here. You aren't getting managed, so you better be able to manage yourself. Neither is a turn off for me, but it could be for others. 

This style of management doesn't fit for everyone, so if a ton of independence and autonomy doesn't sound like an environment you'll succeed in, that's ok."
138,MX,Great place to grow as an engineer,2015-04-15,5.0,Lead Developer,"Developers are given a lot of freedom to choose their projects at MX so I spend about 70% of my time working on problems that I find interesting enough to still be thinking about them when I'm falling asleep or getting ready in the morning.

The company is is an engineering-led organization, so I don't have to convince anyone that writing tests and taking time to refactor code is a good idea. Our organization is always looking for betters way to do something. As long as you can make a case to your fellow engineers for why you should spend time on something, you will get the chance to do it.

I really love working with engineers who are better than me in various ways. The engineering team is stacked with some of the best engineers I've ever gotten to work with so I'm learning a tremendous amount.","Because we have so much autonomy as engineers we don't always do a great job of giving support to junior engineers on the team. There's no official process for supporting them so unless we stop and think about it, it will get forgotten. If you want to be successful on this team you will need an assertive personality to make sure that your voice is heard and you get the support you need to finish projects."
139,MX,Thorough & Excellent Hiring Process,2017-10-18,5.0,Project Manager,"The best part of MX's hiring process was their transparency into what kind of company they really are, who exactly they're trying to hire and why, and their thoroughness in figuring out whether you'd be a good match or not. Not only do they consider your work history, but they also do not discriminate against a lack of a degree. Rather, they base their decision off of a lot of different factors. 
Throughout the entire process, MX kept me informed of the next steps and how they're feeling about hiring me so far. 
On my first day, my entire workstation was already set up, along with a really nice gift basket filled with goodies, including an MX shirt for myself and my 4-year old son.","The hiring process consisted of 5 separate interviews over a period of 4 weeks, which is a little tedious. However, that being said, it does give you the chance to vet the company as much as it gives them the chance to vet you."
140,MX,"Where purpose, passion and incredible people live.",2017-11-16,5.0,Client Strategy Consultant,"MX does so many neat things for employees and their families. From catered meals, massive work parties to service projects MX knows how to make a difference in their employees lives. The quality of MX employees is so critical to how we operate on a daily basis, we inspire and push each other to achieve more. One of the best experiences I have had is meeting with organizations that truly want to make a difference in their end users lives. Driving the cause of financial advocacy is such a crucial cause to securing our future, not only as individuals but in a much larger scope that can change the future of our country and ultimately the human race.","MX isn’t for everyone, it’s hard work and can be challenging in many ways. Accountability and contribution are not “nice to haves” but critical for survival in this environment. If you need a clearly defined work structure and someone to hold you accountable I would recommend looking somewhere else."
141,MX,"Awesome Vision, Amazing Culture, Superb Platform",2016-04-18,5.0,Marketing,"Most people are here because they believe the financial industry is screwed up and that MX can change that for the better.  The MX platform is really cool to use, but what's even cooler is the fact that it helps individuals regain control of their finances and that is good for the individual, their community and the country.    Not surprisingly, people are passionate about the cause and deliver their best work.  And the passion is infectious.  Awesome culture .","It's hard work, but because it's a ""cause"" it doesn't feel like hard work.  It is definitely NOT a place to join if you just want to turn up and draw a pay check.  The company is growing rapidly so sometimes the startup mentality needs to be supported with more mature processes."
142,MX,Great company with a great environment.,2016-09-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"MX does whatever it takes to maintain a culture where you love coming to work. The work itself is hard and continually challenges you to better yourself through execution and thinking through hard problems to solve. There is never a dull day here at MX.

If you are looking for a place to challenge you and push your abilities while truly working towards something that has meaning and purpose, MX is the place for you. If you are looking just have a job to show up and collect a paycheck, this is not for you.","With so much going on, it is sometimes hard to keep the focus on completing objectives before the next fire arises. This happens a lot to startups and its something that we can and often overcome through communication and hard work."
143,MX,Best Job I've Had,2015-01-13,5.0,Office Assistant,"I usually hate working set jobs, as I've always been my own boss and that's where I see myself in the future as well. I love to be in charge of everything. Which is why I am so pleasantly surprised about working at MX. I expressed how I felt and they basically let me do my own thing. I'm in charge of my own schedule and can make my own plans as to when I'm going to accomplish things and do it without anybody breathing down my neck. What started as a plan to just work here during the winter has transferred over to the idea of staying here full-time. Ryan (the CEO) is extremely helpful and welcoming, and he knows the employees' names individually. I feel like I'm part of a big family here.","Right now there's not a lot of space, as their current offices are too small. I would expect that to get better in the future though, since they are constructing their own office building."
144,MX,"Great company, great culture, changing banking technology for real",2015-07-06,5.0,Account Executive,"Company has a very strong and hard driving culture which I love. This helps to create momentum in sales which allows for everyone to perform at a higher level. The sales team has a weekly meeting with the CEO to discuss roadblocks to get deals closed. This meeting and several other meetings are very helpful to get the support I need to be able to meet and exceed my quota. 

The income opportunity competes very well with any other Utah based tech company. I believe it would be very difficult to find a sales job with the same potential that MX has here in Utah.","Work/life balance can get a little tough. At times it is clear that the company expects work to come first - usually those times are pretty understandable, but are still taxing on home life."
145,MX,Great place to further your career,2017-08-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,MX does everything they can to make sure that you have the tools to get your job done.  No micro management and a very high moral work place.,Gaining weight from all the free food!
146,MX,Working with brilliant minds and amazing culture,2015-12-09,5.0,Ruby On Rails Developer,"I get to make amazing technology every day. I'm fairly new to engineering, and I can honestly say MX is the absolute best place for me to grow in my career. I'm pushed to my limits every day, but EVERYONE on the team is willing to help out. The environment is one of learning and fun. Regardless of language and assignment, I consider everyone on the engineering team a mentor. Our code base is quite intricate, but that pushes you to learn more and excel.","The platform is very difficult to understand sometimes. The ramp-up time for an engineer, especially a new one, can be long and difficult. At times, it can be frustrating."
147,MX,MX is a great place to work,2015-01-21,5.0,Devops,"MoneyDesktop/MX has been the best company that I have worked for.  I’ve worked with several startups as well as several larger companies and have really enjoyed the balance between a small startup and a larger organization.  MX puts the employee first and creates an environment where you can make a difference and have the resources needed to succeed.  The CEO has great vision, always understands the bigger picture and has consistently provided my team the resources needed (and some) to build a successful platform.  I couldn’t be happier here and enjoy working with so many top-talent individuals.",Lots of challenging problems to solve which requires extra time; Teams are growing fast and this is being spread out more and more each year.
148,MX,Fun place to work. Needs to deliver on the self-generated hype.,2014-12-23,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"I generally enjoyed working at MX/MoneyDesktop. There are lots of talented and smart people. Lots of potential growth in the market. Great employee perks with meals, work environment, parties, time off, etc. Managers let you do your job without micromanaging.","The company likes to create hype about products they can't deliver, like the mobile app that is like a year behind schedule. Check out the six bogus excellent reviews on this site on the same day. They frequently armpull to get positive publicity. I left because they were stingy on pay and found other companies that offered significantly more. CEO likes to throw his weight around and blame others when he's wrong. Several departments are revolving doors where no one seemed to stick. Company kept dodging talks with employees about stock valuations. Instead, in every company meeting the CEO talks about how they are right at the 'delta' before rapid growth takes place."
149,MX,A fun and rewarding place to work if you've got the dedication,2015-01-08,5.0,,"So far I've gotten to know people in sales, customer service, marketing, and engineering, and they all have in common very talented and hardworking teams.  Vacation time is really flexible.  Medical, dental, and vision are great.","The reason vacation time is flexible is because the bar for how much work needs to get done before no one will miss you is pretty high, so if you're taking more time off than you would with allotted vacation, it's because you're really kicking butt- may or may not be realistic for most.  If you need frequent feedback, this might not be a good fit; you have to be contributing in pronounced ways to know you're unlikely to be replaced."
150,MX,Surrounded By Talent and Passion,2016-03-05,5.0,QA Engineer,"It is utterly refreshing to see how well a development team can run when they are self-managed and passionate about their work. It's rewarding to see problems solved and deployed in a quick and efficient manner without excessive meetings and egos. 

Here's a small list of Pros that I haven't seen in other reviews:

- The catered lunches on Tues/Thurs allow for ""brown bag"" meetings where engineers can share new technologies they're excited about and innovative side-projects like Roombots
- Top-notch Marketing team 
- Very responsive and effective IT department
- Amazing internally developed tools that facilitate and automate our work 
- Very open and quick company-wide communication","When we strive to not only to be good, but be devastatingly good at what we do-- it can be intimidating. It can also be huge motivator."
151,MX,MX is the place if you are looking to be challenged while building something that matters,2016-08-04,5.0,,"The purpose and mission of MX is unmatched.
The culture and passion is palpable
MX cares about its people
Solving exciting and complex challenges that will have a positive impact on humanity
Explosive growth in a massive market","Very challenging environment  - If you are looking to coast, do not apply
Still operates like a start up - If you do not operate well in change, do not like to solve complex problems, don't like to be held accountable, avoid transparency, are opposed to candor and direct feedback or feel uncomfortable with moving quickly - do not apply"
152,MX,Interview and Hiring Process,2019-05-14,5.0,QA Engineer,"I had the opportunity to not only be interviewed by individuals from the department I was applying for but also had the chance to talk to others from different departments within the company. Giving a great overall feel of the company and culture.

I really enjoyed the getting to know my interviewers and overall it was one of the less  daunting interview process I have been through. The recruiting team let me know what to expect from the beginning and we there through out the process making sure it went as smooth as possible. 

My process went by rather quickly and I was officially offered a position within a week of my application.","There were several interviews on different days, the only reason I would consider this a con is that I am a commuter."
153,MX,Outstanding Culture - Best Company in Utah,2016-03-08,5.0,Software Engineer,"-They have a great company culture. 
-Everyone seems genuinely passionate about what they do.
-With that passion, everyone is happy to do what they do. 
-Yes, it's a self-management workplace, but that's not a bad thing because it allows you to learn how to be responsible for your own work rather than having someone constantly looking over your shoulder.
-Extremely open community. Easy to ask questions. Highly transparent. No politics.
-You are challenged beyond measure. This isn't a standard 'clock-in', do some work, 'clock out'.",No cons with MX at all!
154,MX,Great place to work if they would have been good about payroll and tighter on vision.,2012-02-07,2.0,,"We were solving a cool social and technical problem. The opportunity was great originally, profit sharing, feeling like you were making a difference, etc. The technical team was very talented.","They didn't pay us for a month or so, so several engineers left. Payment to some of those that left still hasn't been made more than a year later. IMHO the reason payroll was terrible is that the owners at the time weren't experienced in this type of business and didn't know how to manage it let alone come up with a vision for actually executing on the product."
155,MX,Not the best company to work for,2013-10-24,2.0,,"The engineers are very smart and talented. Management tends to only hire those that are top notch.

Engineers are encouraged to be active in the community specializing in their discipline.

Senior engineers get sent to multiple conferences per year

Sales representatives get sent to a significant number of conferences per year and are compensated extremely well with many job perks.

Ryan Caldwell is an excellent salesman and has amassed an excellent team of sales representatives. Because of this, business is going very well. MoneyDesktop's revenue is skyrocketing along with the number of clients they've partnered with.","There's a tight circle of friends around middle management, engineering. It takes a specific type of person to be included in that circle.

Engineers are encouraged to ask questions and discuss things with senior devs, however, there's no guarantee the engineer asking the questions will get treated with any amount of decency. Often times the response senior developers give is just shy of insulting.

No real opportunity of advancement within the company. They prefer to hire managers from outside of the company rather than promoting from within."
156,MX,AWESOME Culture+Mission+Product = MX!,2015-06-29,5.0,Operations Team Member,"What we're doing is amazing- from a technical perspective and overall company mission. We have lots of areas to improve and need dedicate people who aren't afraid of hard work. If  you're looking for a team that is driven, fun, and committed- this is your team. I joined the company because I knew it would be challenging and stretch me professionally.","We're a start-up, communication isn't our strong suit. We're getting better- lots of area here to improve. Our team has no tolerance for people who aren't willing to make us better- complainers won't survive here."
157,MX,One of my favorite companies ever!,2015-04-15,5.0,QA Engineer,Love the culture here and working on products that can make a difference in the end user's lives. Flat management structure means I get to work directly with lead developers that are truly happy to interact with others. The speed that things get done here is a huge plus.  I also love the transparency that you have as to the direction of the company and the willingness that even the CEO has to explain things to the company.,"Sometimes the pace is fast - but never frantic.  If you are used to working on long term projects with infrequent releases, this may not be for you.  Everything is provided for you here to succeed."
158,MX,One of the Best Growth-Stage Startups to Work For,2014-12-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Right product, right market, right time, not to mention superb execution in a tricky industry. Lots of brilliant high performers. Lots of responsibility and autonomy for those who seek it. Everyone who succeeds at MX succeeds on their own merit. Those in leadership or authoritative positions have always earned it.","There is pressure to put in extremely long hours, not because it's required, but because others are. The company is rapidly evolving so there is a risk that those who have the right skills for one stage in the company's lifecycle, won't have the right skills for its future unless they too evolve."
159,MX,Focused on working the problem,2015-12-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Objective problem solving, there is little room for personal ego. The CTO Brandon Dewitt frequently reiterates that in order to be an effective member of the team you have to be able to put your personal feelings and emotions aside. This results in an environment where the best ideas will bubble up to the top.","It is a fast paced environment and you have to be able to manage yourself, especially on the dev side. Sometimes a little more oversight might be helpful though."
160,MX,have respect for the little people,2018-08-22,2.0,Administrative,working on some good products with some really smart people,there is no work life balance
161,MX,This Is The Place!,2017-10-12,5.0,QA Engineer,"The hiring process was very intentional, resulting in a team of high-quality individuals. From Day 1, I felt very welcome and trusted to do good work without being managed (while still being paired with two mentors). Employees are taken very good care of (from free snacks and drinks to unlimited PTO and company parties).","I have yet to experience anything to frustrate me personally. However, I imagine that if you are not a self-starter and prefer guidance via close management, MX would not be a good fit."
162,MX,Exciting but chaotic. Needs organization.,2016-11-22,3.0,Engineer,"Lots of opportunities to learn and find your niche. In most departments, you're given autonomy to find worthwhile projects and complete them how you want. For people young in their careers, they are able to build a lot of skills and impact the company and product in ways not available at most places.

The benefits are pretty good with vacation, holiday, 401k, meals, snacks, UTA pass, good health coverage, etc. 

There are a lot of really smart people here, especially on the engineering team. Compared to other companies, the top guys really know what they are talking about and how to articulate it to other departments. Code requirements are strict, which keeps it clean, maintainable, and discoverable. 

If you are experienced before coming to MX, you'll probably be offered a pretty competitive salary. 

MX keeps closing big deals, and taking business from its competition.","Not sure why, but every contract gets delayed months or years before banks start using it. Even though the company signs lots of big deals, most of them seem to never get implemented with the bank. Part of the problem may be that MX tries to be everything to everyone from the CEO to sales, then those things don't get prioritized or presented to engineering, and thus never built properly. MX is more concerned with closing deals than making a good product that people or banks will use or find value in.

The operations side of MX is a trainwreck. For example, I once interviewed somebody for my dept, and we also had people sit in from 2 other depts. After the interview, everyone from my dept and the one working closest to my dept agreed 'let's hire this person.' Somebody from the third dept that was there to measure 'culture', and insisted the candidate was not qualified. The 'hiring committee' (who did not attend any interview) said the candidate's overall score was below minimum reqs (dragged down by the anomaly in the interview), and 2-3 weeks later the candidate was sent a canned ""we decided to pursue other candidates"" email. After all that, the interviewers and interviewees all get frustrated and feel like their time was wasted. 

In most departments, I never recommended friends, because I was confident they'd have a miserable hiring experience. MX insists they're never on a hiring freeze, but why can't they get anyone hired that the teams want and meets salary reqs?

Obviously the operations teams are struggling with mgmt; they have the highest turnover of anybody. 

When people do succeed within the company, they are never compensated or treated fairly. Even though the CEO has said in company meetings that 'MX won't match an outside offer', that's often the *only* time they can get a raise, even after trying to do it the right way. Before leaving, those top performers are often rewarded with more responsibility, more workload, more scrutiny from mgmt, no change in title or authority, a denial of more pay/stock, and less flexibility in their schedule. Then after they leave, mgmt talks of how inadequacy led to their departure.

Despite what he says, the CEO definitely acts like he is more important than anyone and everything else."
163,MX,Step up in the industry,2015-11-04,5.0,Product Owner,"I came to MX from another software company and the difference is astounding. The culture and the excitement, is infectious. There still is a startup feel to it, so there are times of ambiguity. Some people may see these times as unsettling, but I've found these times to be the best opportunity to prove your worth to the company. 

- Amazing products
- Ridiculously talented software engineers
- An engineering team that accomplishes almost unbelievable amounts of work
- Latitude in what you're working on
- A sense that you're working on something ground-breaking
- Interrupting the banking industry
- Quick paced and very competitive
- Tons of food and goodies
- Great HR and office support staff","I've heard this is a con, but I don't see it that way. I was offered a promotion at my former employer, the same time I was being interviewed at MX. When I had my final interview at MX, the CEO looked me in the eye and told me they hire fast and they fire fast. Meaning, if you can't contribute to the company, they don't have much patience for you. This scared my wife, but this was the thing that made my decision. I need to feel like everyone around me is contributing, and that they're at MX for a reason. My former company felt like everyone was tenured, and as long as they showed up to work there was a place for them - it was very demoralizing. All this said, in the six months at MX, I have never felt anything but appreciated. Not once have I thought I was being micromanaged, or placed under a microscope."
164,MX,An Amazing Place to Work,2017-09-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working at MX has been an amazing experience. I have learned a great deal here, both in my role and about the tech industry in general. MX is a start-up, and it has been an incredible learning experience to see how a company develops its process and watching the failures and successes is fascinating. I love that I have been able to contribute to a company where the people legitimately care; management on down and at a company that sincerely believes in its core values. One of the things that has really impressed me is each month there is a town hall, where the executive board answers employee questions and that level of transparency is new to me. It is also a great sign when a colleague announced that they were looking for a new position, the leadership has honestly helped him in finding something new and awesome. Many of the places I have worked have fired someone when they made the mistake of mentioned that they were job searching, so I found this refreshing. 
Another thing I really appreciate is the level of professionalism with my colleagues. There is an interesting dynamic where the CEO is riding around on a scooter and nerf battles wage, but yet I can honestly say that there isn't a single person in the entire company that I have any negative feeling towards. There is zero drama. 
I also really appreciate the flexibility. Basically the company expects you to get your work done and well, but I have not heard of anyone having an issue with work life balance. There are people that work remotely, people that come in ungodly early and leave early, people that work 3 days a week but stay late etc. Also, people bring in their families and pets all the time and there is a very community feeling. 

Then there are the benefits; there is catered breakfasts on Monday and Wednesday, catered lunches on Tuesday and Thursday, and if you stay past 6pm, free catered dinner, as well as an awesome fancy espresso machine. Also, there are amazing snacks. Also they ship out laundry, There is a gym, and a crash pad, and a game room. The people operations sincerely try to make MX the best place to work, and I can absolutely say that it has worked for me.","This is partly a pro and a con, but this is definitely not a company where you can get a lot of hand holding. You are expected to come in, have ideas, ask questions and learn. However, you won't last long if you expect to be told what to do constantly. 
Also, the MX 15 is no joke, the food benefits are amazing, but be watch yourself."
165,MX,Amazing company,2016-01-20,5.0,Software Engineer,"- The benefits are absolutely unreal
- The company culture is amazing. The management really cares about the difference they're making in the world with their product
- If you have something to say, you'll be heard. If it's a good idea, no matter what level of the company you're at, it's going to get done
- Everyone there is very candid and will give you their honest opinion, but it's always tactful","- The ""hands off"" engineering management can leave some employees lost if they aren't self-motivated to a high degree"
166,MX,Amazing company,2018-09-05,5.0,Account Manager,The interview process was really great! Even though you have to do quite a few interviews it doesn't feel overwhelming. You get to meet a lot of people and really get a feel for how amazing the company is and how wonderful the people that work here are.,I can honestly say there are not any cons for my hiring process. If I had to come up with something I would say the interviewing process can feel like in the beginning but you actually appreciate everything because you see how much they care about making sure you will be happy here.
167,MX,"Perfect company for top performers, definitely don't recommend for political or whinny people",2015-11-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"So I rarely make time for reviews like this, but, even though almost all the reviews are positive, after reading the negative reviews, they really got under my skin and I felt that, as someone who has grown to love this company and knows the reality of how things are, I wanted to, needed to, put in my own two cents.  Bottomline, MX is an AWESOME company, but it’s DEFINITELY not for everyone, and to me, that is a great thing, possibly the best thing about being here.  MX is a perfect company for collaborative, good-natured, intelligent, and purpose driven people.  It is a horrible, tough and brutal place for political backbiting types.  Those people don’t normally get hired here and the few that slip through the cracks can only last a few months before the culture starts to reject their political negative methods so much that it becomes clear it just won’t work.  

So a few people got excited about working for a great company like that and were able to fake it through the interview process and MX gave them a chance, from my perspective, that happens to even the best companies.  I am glad the company parted ways with them when it became clear they just were not a good fit and the company culture was being injured by them staying.  They would likely be happier anyways at a company with more of a corporate or political culture where they could thrive.  Both sides win by parting ways and MX gets to keep its awesome culture.  Having worked here for just over three years, I can tell you that I GREATLY appreciate it.  I get that some of them are bitter and write negative inaccurate reviews, but those few reviews are born out of their own frustration with the company parting ways with them, not any reality.  If you doubt that at all and are a good cultural fit, swing by and meet a few random members of the team.  Hear straight from people that will tell you their name, their job and their exact verifiable experience and how cool what they are building is.  I am grateful how vigilant the company is about protecting the culture.  To me, that is a great sign the company is a great place to work that protects its non-political culture.

With that more pressing frustration of mine voiced, MX in my opinion has a great purpose, mission, vision, team, technology, product, culture and future.  Granted this is based on my experience at past companies, but I feel like I have a pretty good perspective.  I would highly recommend MX for a purpose driven, intelligent, hardworking, good natured person.  Since I feel that after three years I am personally invested in this team, I ask that if you do not fit that description, that’s ok, but MX is likely not the best place for you and you will be better off elsewhere.  Hope this helps!","Mostly all positive and no major cons but I do have one ask.  I know we have rally’s and the like where we get little updates here and there, but I feel that we really do need more transparency on more specific company metrics.  The team believes in the mission and trust the management, we just want to be looped in to help in broader understanding of how the company is doing in all areas of the company, not just the area we work in.  I have heard this is coming.  You should make it happen as soon.  I think the team would love it.  I know I would."
168,MX,Work Culture Transformed My Career,2017-05-05,5.0,Software Engineer,"The biggest reason I love working at MX is selfish: personal growth. 

K. Anders Ericsson is the world's leading researcher on how to become an expert. To become an expert your practice sessions need 4 things. 

1. Focus on Improving Technique
2. Objectives Just Beyond One's Level of Competence
3. Provide Feedback on Results
4. Involves High Levels of Repetition

If those 4 things are there, then you're doing what Ericsson calls deliberate practice. Deliberate practice is the only way to really become an expert. 

Here's how these 4 elements exist every single day at MX's engineering team: 

1. Focus on Improving Technique: 

Code Quality & Code Discoverability (how easy it is to read & understand someone's code ) are 2 of the 3 core principles that govern MX's engineering team. 
There are virtually no deadlines for when your code has to be complete. So instead of focusing on just 'getting it done,' you focus on getting it right. 
We're not just writing code for a computer. We write code for the next engineer that has to use it. 
The focus on perfecting your code & the time they give you to do it allows you to focus on your technique while you program every single day. 

2. Objectives Just Beyond One's Level of Competence

My first day at MX, they told me this: ""Most companies assign you work. We don't do that. Here, you've got to take initiative and pick from a list of problems we have the ones you want to solve.""
To work on things just beyond your level you need 2 things: 1) freedom to work on things just beyond your level 2) challenges beyond your current level. 
By letting us individually pick the problems we want to work on, I'm able to pick problems just beyond my level every day. This has allowed me to grow rapidly. 
Since the problems in our industry can be so complex, every engineer here-whether junior or senior-faces challenges beyond their current skill level. 

3. Provide Feedback on Results

100% of Pull Requests @ MX are reviewed and approved by another engineer. Yes, 100%.
Every Pull Request you put up gives you the chance to receive feedback on how to improve which is critical to growth. 
To be honest not every PR has feedback on things to improve or change. Some PR's are really basic and simple. 
But I would say like 70-80% of pull requests have multiple comments with ways to improve. It's awesome. You learn so many cool new ways to write great code and do new things. 
(WHY all the code reviews? We work in Finance. Our code gets audited (soc compliance laws). To stay compliant, all code at MX has to be reviewed and approved. )

4. Involves High Levels of Repetition

MX's engineering team is < 40 people, but in 2016, we had 3,700 releases to production or just over 14 production releases every working day (M-Friday).

Since our deployment structure allows us to release code so often, we are all writing a lot of code every single day that goes through the review, approval, and quality checks. 

The culture here doesn't just push deliberate practice--it enforces it in many ways. 

I've loved working here and would recommend it to anyone looking to take their skills to the next level.",Sometimes there isn't the clearest vision about the vision of the company. Salary could be more competitive.

The team is VERY focused and into solving some pretty cool challenges in fintech and everyone is very aware of the impact on the world our solutions are having and will have.  Culture is vibrant and fun, but also brass tacks.  People here are all in and very dedicated to building what we are.  The company's growth has been meteoric, so the stock here really means something.  I also love that everyone I know can use the app/solution/platform and their lives will be much better for it.  I have worked at companies in the past that had cool products/solutions, but no one I knew had ever heard of it, much less used it, which made it less fulfilling.  They do all the great perks like, catered lunches and dinners, AMAZING break rooms, wonderful benefits, great offices, great equipment, flexible work schedule, unlimited vacation policy, and on and on.","Everyone is so candid and frank here that for some it can be tough.  For those that like candor and straight forward honesty, it is a huge plus, but for those that do not, this is probably not the place for you.  Also, everyone is pretty driven here, so for those that like that, huge positive, but for those that are not up for diving in and giving it their all, they will likely not be a great fit.  When someone does not contribute and help the rest of the team, the company is quick to communicate to that person that they are making others work less enjoyable or harder and part ways without unnecessary delay."

189,MX,"MX=Passionate, talented people",2016-02-22,4.0,Engineer,"Everybody who succeeds at MX can be described with one word: passionate. I’ve seen all the C-levels working on weekends, and at 3am. They don’t just unplug at 5pm, and they expect others to do the same, and be just as passionate. If you are one of those people who wants a stable, stress-free, 9-5 job, this is not the place. Period. The expectations are high, because the stakes are high. The things that the company has already done, and will do in the future, are incredible. There is such a rush in building a product and tool that will change millions, perhaps billions of lives, and having everybody around you sharing that goal and level of dedication. When something breaks, we aren’t looking for who to blame, but how can we fix it and avoid the problem in the future. 

On the flip side, when somebody isn’t playing by these rules, and looks to throw blame around, or doesn’t care as deeply at building, morale drops like a rock. Management is quick to fix the problem, before that can happen, so I thank them for it. I’ve heard it said dozens of times: we hire for the right attitude and passion, not for skills, which can be learned. That being the case, the people I work with have incredible skills and knowledge, and are willing to share and mentor what they know. We don’t just have a few rock-stars, a few prima-donnas who do whatever they want and couldn’t care less about anybody else, we have a full orchestra of skilled people working together to create things that are simply exceptional. 

The perks MX offers are pretty awesome: catered lunch 2 days a week, dinner whenever you work late, very-well stocked break room, UTA passes, laundry service, the list goes on. They provide these perks to draw the best talent, and to allow employees to focus on what’s important. So far, it seems to be working quite well.","The hardest part of growing a company from the startup phase is keeping the passionate/building culture of a startup, while greatly increasing the number of employees. Red tape becomes a necessary evil to manage resources and time, but management does what they can to keep things at a minimum. We’ve arrived at where we are at because management doesn’t accept anything but the best, and will say “This isn’t good enough, we need to make it better.” Most of the time, this is the extra push we need to make things better than we imagined, but sometimes, it simply isn’t possible. In that case, you’re stuck between a rock and a hard place: high expectations, and not enough resources/time to make it happen. Something has to give. Usually management understands, and the deadline is pushed back, or more resources are allocated, but before that happens, a lot of anger and frustration can develop. Not to mention stress. They want to have their cake, and eat it too, and demand that you make it happen. Put another way: good, cheap, fast; they want all three.

I’ve never grown a company to this size, so maybe demanding perfection is the only way to make it happen. However, in my opinion, the attitude of micromanagement is great for a startup who is still trying to get its feet under it, and doesn’t have a lot of resources to spare. Not for a company with 200 employees and plenty of cash. Stretching employees a little helps them to grow, but stretch them too much, and things slide through the cracks, and they can break from the stress. There is a fine line between the two, and I feel management is flirting awfully close to that line at times."
190,MX,Plenty of room for improvement,2018-02-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"I work with amazing people on my immediate team and am inspired by many others outside my team. 
Company perks- unlimited vacation, great parties, MX Gives program, food, treats, 1st floor, massages. 
A lot of people REALLY care about the mission, and you can feel it. 
Small company means you know or at least know of everyone, so there is a level of comfort you don't have at the big companies. 
There is still enthusiasm and drive to grow, and even though it is a hard road, it feels good to be a part of it.","It often feels like the perks are there to remind you that even though you're stressed every second of every day, you'll never have it as good anywhere else. You choose perks here or money elsewhere. The perks can keep you in a position you're not thriving in for a longer time than you should be there. 
Change is a little wild. Sometimes they iterate so quickly that you've barely trained and the process or tool is completely changed. Sometimes it's so slow that you lose valuable time and effort on something that is not effective. They need to get people to evaluate and consolidate tools internally.  
Pay can be a lot lower than standard for some positions and the fight to get more is exhausting. Good employees and prospects have been lost due to unwillingness to negotiate, and older employees are left fighting to catch up to new employees even though they have years of experience and data supports their value to the organization.  Some are leaving for 15-20% increases in pay and a decrease in stress, but the organization always falls back on ""they aren't loyal, they can't survive the refiners fire, MX is hard"" instead of recognizing that they are just behind the curve as a company when it comes to pay in some areas."

Great looking user interface.  High salaries.  Flexible hours.  Unlimited vacation.","Extremely high turn over and blind arrogance among executives.  The entire sales management team has turned completely over within the last six months and things don't seem to be getting any better (frustrating).  Working at MX is:  having to deal with intimidation, lack of true employee support, and having to live within a non-trustworthy work environment.  Bad news is swept under the rug and good news is hyper-inflated.  There are clicks at MX.  You are either in, or you are out (usually it depends on who hired you and if you are buddies with one of the executives).  

On the sales team, very few sales reps actually hit their quota.  Don't expect to make your base plus hit your number at plan.  It is very rare.  In fact, commissions are doled out sparsely. 

Many of the positive reviews on this site are in direct response to negative ones.  It seems obvious to many that executives at MX are falsely writing extremely positive reviews in order to counter the negative and truthful ones.  The negative reviews seem spot on - pay attention to those.  If you like the idea of working for an MLM, MX may be the right place for you. 

I've watched hard working, ethical, honest, and intelligent employees come to such a point of frustration with their work life that they've resigned without having another offer in hand.  I've also seen hard working individuals get pushed out and treated poorly until they resign; if not - they've been let go. 

Many current and former employees at MX are or were very unhappy.  If they're still currently with MX, they stay because of high base salaries, the constant dangling of a carrot in front of them - promises that huge deals will close, and fear of legal repercussions.  The MX reputation within the Utah technology community is really negative and widespread.  This is probably the reason that MX is trying to hire more and more employees from out of state - to escape their negative reputation among potential employees.  

Let's hope that this truthful and honest review stays up longer than a few days without MX's legal team threatening Glass Door in order to have it removed.  A good candidate is an informed candidate."

204,MX,A Lot of Mixed Feelings,2019-04-23,3.0,Data Analyst,Great Benefits. Great entry level positions and opportunities to move into technical roles with code-camp backgrounds. Some really great coworkers.,There's a fair amount of misogyny especially around upper-level management. The pay structure is very opaque and promotions can take months to go through. Concerns and criticism seem to be taken lightly.
205,MX,Don't Recommend,2016-04-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Hard to come up with some positive things to say about the company. I guess the stocked break room was nice and the catered lunches were good.,Management has little time for you if you're not one of the top performers. No real sense of direction and very high turnover. The technology is exciting but not very applicable to the end user. Near to impossible to hit quarterly goals. I do not recommend this job to anyone. Very hard ceiling to break through to make any real income.
206,MX,Account Executive,2018-06-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Free lunch 2 Days a week. Yay!,"The sales department was a very hostile environment managed by fear based tactics and micro management. Management all the way up to the C-Suite had unrealistic expectations. The CEO has his hand in every department and leaders from each department are afraid to “Lead” for fear of loosing their job so they end up being “managers” who just manage to the CEO’s expectations.

With a nice round of investors dollars the CFO decided to mass hire sales reps this was his solution to grow the revenues. Just hire more reps .... works if you have a system and process for maket penetration and if the market is large enough for that type of expansion however, management quickly realized that that was not the right approach so there was a mass lay off.

The culture is fake. Frivolous spending seemed to be a norm however, it was not focused around the right objective. It was to inflate and flex as if the culture at MX was amazing and that the company was doing better financially than it really was with hopes of luring in other poor souls to work there. The dollars should’ve been going into the mandatory integration partners/ Online banking and mobile banking providers... or front end account based marketing, online marketing, lead generation, ADM org or anything to assist in penetrating the market at a faster rate than competition. Most banks loved the personal finance mangagment (PFM) software that MX developed, it really is a wonderful app that banks and credit unions alike wanted to provide to their end users (customers/members). The difficulty was not to make potential customers excited about the software, the difficulty came when we had to tell these financial institutions that we had no integrations into their onine or mobile banking environment but that they could set it up as a separate page on their website and have folks toggle over to it and the re-authenticate... this approach was not suitable for highly secure and risk adverse financial institutions. Most would not agree to signing a contract. Some would sign an agreement but with the caveat That they would pay upon implementation if and only if the there was an integration between MX and. Their online and mobile banking providers. 

It was a heavy lift to get pen to paper in many cases and then once we did get folks to sign, good luck getting paid the commission. In fact, even when a customer would finally pay MX, you would have to chase down your commission check from finance and then battle it out until you’d get paid out the correct amount that you had rightfully earned."

208,MX,Be Cautious,2016-03-14,1.0,,"We are building a great product and there are some very talented individuals contributing. The ideas and mission the company is built on are well thought out and easy to get behind. Benefits are good and we do fun things like attend movie premiers and have parties for holidays. There is free food in the break rooms, catered lunches two times a week, and dinners if you stay late, discounted laundry services, and unlimited PTO (that some people use and others avoid, depending on their department and boss).","Be cautious of who you put your trust in and be sure to make friends with the right people. There are many intelligent, wonderful individuals I work with everyday, but some very manipulative and arrogant leaders as well. I have been asked to sacrifice time with family, friends and my personal endeavors to contribute more to the company. When I have gone out of my way to show that the company is more important than my personal life, I have been openly rewarded. I have watched others become burnt out and then cast aside when they try to regain some balance in their life. If you are at a place in your life where you want work to be your life then MX is a great place for you. I have heard leaders tell people that their families will understand why they see them so little when they realize what we are working on is so important. If you really believe this, then you will be very happy here. They call this ""passion"".
When people leave the company or are terminated it's always a surprise and big mystery of why they left. It makes work very uncomfortable, like you are always walking on egg shells hoping you don't do the same thing as the others who didn't make the cut."
