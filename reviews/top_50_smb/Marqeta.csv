1,Marqeta,Great company culture and people!,2022-03-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Amazing, smart people to work with and learn from
People team works hard to maintain company culture even remotely through fun virtual events and employee benefits","Undergoing some growing pains as a newly-public, rapidly-growing company"
2,Marqeta,Good place to work,2022-03-10,5.0,"Senior Manager, Operations","Marqeta is a great place to work if you are looking for a fast paced environment where you can be a contributor to the growth of the department . The pace is fast, but the people you work and collaborate with are the best of the best. I've been given numerous opportunities for growth and to partner with different teams. This is truly an environment of collaboration. Leadership from Jason Gardner is genuine and he truly cares about the culture and the people of the company.","Work/Life balance can be improved. Working in this environment is good, but long hours and working through the weekends needs to improved."
3,Marqeta,Constant Change and Shaky C-Suite Leadership,2022-03-23,2.0,Anonymous Employee,They over pay for talent due to incompetencies.,This company has no true vision or leadership strategy. It’s truly pathetic.
4,Marqeta,"Always room for improvement, but this company is amazing!",2022-01-13,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"1. Culture

The company in general has a very upbeat, transparent, and engaging culture. It commits to its values. Since I started working here, I have witnessed a sincere push to make things better, including our products, internal processes, communications, and working environment. These are things which are never perfect, and I feel that most people at Marqeta, including upper management, consistently strive to adapt and improve all areas of the business. In my experience, most people respond well to respectful, critical feedback. Standard procedure is to approach problems in a blameless and constructive manner. 

2. Diversity

The workforce is incredibly diverse with regard to socio-economic background, race, ethnicity, and education. In my experience, team members are respectful and inclusive of all individuals regardless of sexual orientation, gender, and other differences. Employees generally seem to make a concious effort to help everyone feel that they belong.

3. Compensation

From my perspective, Marqeta seems to have very competitive salaries and meaningful equity. The company demonstrates that it values its workforce by providing substantial pay and benefits.

4. Management

Every management team I've ever heard of has people severely criticizing them and their leadership. That is no different here. Managers are people too, and they make mistakes. The important thing to me is that they recognize them, accept them, and constantly strive to improve. I feel most management at Marqeta does this. Not all, but most, which is far more than I can say about other places I've worked.

5. Trust

Leadership places a great deal of trust in each employee. This has been a remarkable contrast from my previous employment, where employers appeared relatively distrustful of employees motivations and interests. Not so here. I feel Marqeta respects and trusts its people to do their work and do it well, while implementing procedures and infrastructure to avoid, mitigate, and learn from honest mistakes.

6. Product

Marqeta's card products are amazing. We're hitting a market with enormous potential. While improvements can always be made, I feel we're moving in the right direction here.","1. Tech Debt

This is probably true for almost any tech company growing out of its start-up phase, but the tech debt at Marqeta is real and significant. A LOT of effort has been going into paying down this debt, but there is still a lot to do here. Maintaining aging systems and processes is an unpleasant reality for most teams as we simultaneously build out new features and capabilities.

An unfortunate side-effect of this is that teams have less room for thoughtful innovation. We are under pressure to build more while keeping the older systems fully functional, which is straining engineering resources. Adding more to the workforce is helping here as well, but it will likely take some time to have a significant effect.

2. Prioritization Challenges

Teams at Marqeta have struggled to optimally prioritize work. A recent procedural change to improve the situation is being implemented (V2MOM), and though it has not yet been fully put to the test, I'm cautiously optimistic that it will have positive impacts in the way we prioritize our efforts moving forward.

3. Fires

The reality of working with critical production software that never sleeps is that when things fail, sometimes you've got to be the one willing to get up at 3am to fix it. Occasionally you'll be working some crazy hours. My first week on call was quite eventful (unfortunately) and I ended up working several hours over the weekend.

Team support works wonders here. My group has been excellent about trading schedules and giving team members a break when its needed. I'm not sure if that behavior is widespread throughout the company, but it absolutely needs to be.

That said, as more of our outstanding tech debt is tackled, the breadth and severity of fires is improving. Our team's on-call shifts have, thankfully, seen far fewer incidents over the past several weeks. As the company matures, and our processes, procedures, and codebase improves, I suspect on-call shifts will continue to improve as well."

16,Marqeta,"In my opinion, there is a toxic culture in the Legal Department",2021-10-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company is innovative and has a bright future;
There are a lot of really smart people that are laser focused on doing the best work of their lives;
Pay and benefits are above average; 
The CEO is a visionary and strong leader.","In my opinion:
 There are senior leaders in the Legal Department that are creating a toxic culture;
These leaders do not have the required skills or experience to adequately perform their duties;"
17,Marqeta,Truly a positive company culture experience,2021-10-07,5.0,Manager,"1. THE PEOPLE AND ATTITUDES: This is my first time at a start up, but in comparison to typical corporate cultures, it's very refreshing to be part of such a motivating and supportive culture. I feel like I can speak freely and all input (regardless of level) is valued.

2. LEADERSHIP AND VISION: the company has some kinks (what company doesn't?), but leadership holds themself accountable and focus is on how to improve the business (not on blaming people). The company goals are challenging but realistic and I'm excited to see where Marqeta grow/progress.","In the past, writing up the cons is the easy part but I'm struggling this time, which is a good thing. The main challenge I see is being short on resources, which is creates a significant backlog. However, that's a standard problem across industries right now and we continue to hire new Marqetans!"
18,Marqeta,A company experiencing heavy growth with great opportunities,2021-09-26,5.0,Senior Operations Manager,"I have been working for Marqeta for three months, geographically remote. This company is transitioning away from start up culture with the recent IPO in Summer 2021. There is plenty of opportunity to make your mark here by establishing new processes and helping to steer the company to handle exponential growth in the FinTech industry, worldwide. 

Pros:
- Great onboarding process
- Marqeta gives new hires the creative freedom to impact company growth with their particular expertise and experience. You get to build something. 
- Multi-cultural organization. You will be working with people from many backgrounds, countries and regions around the world.
- Company is expanding into new markets, globally
- Tools provided encourage collaboration and productivity
- Collaboration between areas is strong, eliminating the traditional siloed environment of companies that grow past the start up stage.
- healthcare premiums fully paid
- pet insurance
- compensation package includes generous restricted stock units","Technical debt is starting to build up, but that is common for a company in this stage of growth. Senior Management is starting to recognize the need to tackle this risk before it becomes a major issue.

Work/Life balance is important to leadership based on the following:
 - provided four Friday's off to entire company in August, 2021
 - bi-weekly Focus Friday (no meetings)
 - Freedom to set working hours (within reason to ensure business continuity)
 - However, this is a company in extreme growth phase, so expect to work a lot of hours. This is a potential con for some candidates, but not for those looking for a challenge and the opportunity to build something new."
19,Marqeta,"Place to grow, make change, make an impact",2021-10-11,4.0,Software Engineer,"There's a lot of encouraging resources for employees, from benefits to career growth to community oriented events to keep us connected
It's exciting to be a part of an up-and-coming newly-IPO'ed company that's a leader in it's corner of the market
The company is still small enough that you can genuinely make changes - whether it be through ERG work, directly impacting the direction of technology and product, or shaping company culture through a number of committees etc. Although growing, it's still family-sized and very open to change","Hard work and fast paced
Things are constantly changing - even how we plan our roadmap quarter to quarter!"
20,Marqeta,Busy with Tons of Growth Potential and Supportive Management,2021-09-20,5.0,Senior Information Security Analyst,"Leadership is appreciative and acknowledges the workloads. There is constant reminders to exercise work life balance and to take time off if needed. Much growth potential and opportunities to build who new systems and programs. Folks listen to each other and want to collaborate to build a stronger company. A lot of support and encouragement to take the lead and listen to ""outside the box thinking"".","Heavy workloads, quick turnarounds and not enough folks to do the work (scaling and hiring but the job market is tight). Scaling to adjust to a public company status and a lot of priority shifting while still growing."

Quality of work is valued, not just deploying new product/features by the day.","Recent operational and personnel changes due to IPO, resulting in uneven workloads and long hours for certain teams. However, the turnover seems typical of a growing company."
25,Marqeta,Nice People,2021-09-15,4.0,Software Engineer,Everyone that works here is super nice!,Don't pay for gym memberships.
26,Marqeta,A CEO that truly cares for his employees,2021-08-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The company is finding ways to lessen the ""burnout"" from having to work fully remote

- The transparency they provide to the company through All-Hands",Not any I could think of right now
27,Marqeta,Very mixed feelings,2021-08-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- People are generally friendly and willing to help
- Product has great product market fit and the company outlook is looking positive
- Leadership seems mature, not a ton of politics from what I can tell
- They preach and have had success promoting from within and care a lot about your longevity at the company","- Culture is pretty meh. It may be because the company was heavy on in-person before but there isn't a lot done to keep employees engaged remotely
- Manager level is really junior. They need a lot more training in unconscious bias and having more empathy
- Lack of documentation and organization. For a mature and public company, it seems pretty messy"
28,Marqeta,Classic growing pains,2021-08-19,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The product is fantastic and there are really smart engineers here working on fascinating problems. Top-level culture seems strong and opinionated in ways I believe in. Time off policies are remarkably flexible and I don't feel laden with guilt when I need to use it.

Remote work has been surprisingly painless and my teammates have been fantastic to work with. The company cares about effectively balancing COVID concerns with in-office work and has not forced back-to-office mandates.

The company's overall success is also definitely a perk. There's an air of positivity and a view that any problems can be figured out or solved. Compensation (at least mine) is competitive especially in light of the recent IPO.","All the hallmark pains of a rapidly growing company are there. Middle management seems horribly overworked and as a result, it doesn't feel like my management chain cares about me or my success. Numerous weekly one-on-ones have been missed or skipped unilaterally and issues I need escalated are ignored. There's also no effective way to communicate my concerns about my manager either: yearly reviews don't offer a space for upward feedback and there are no skip-level one-on-ones. Generally this doesn't feel intentionally malicious, but more that other issues and people are being prioritized over my needs and a manager's time is the bottleneck.

In a similar way, my work is constantly being reprioritized. Work I was told I would get to do the next quarter has, without failure, been changed to a different, usually less desirable project. I also haven't been given me the time to learn any systems at depth (many of which are rife with the usual tech debt) before swapping off a project. Again, this is largely out of necessity and not malice, but still drags on me.

What's most concerning is there doesn't seem to be an end in sight. The company is continuing to expand at this rapid rate, and the hiring pipeline for managers seems to be bottlenecked. The new CTO has brought even more repriotization and reorgs, which will hopefully result in more stability, but I'm not holding my breath."
29,Marqeta,Love it here. Get ready to work,2021-08-05,5.0,Business Development Director,"Supportive, interesting, and challenging work.","The hours are tough, be prepared to put out fires at all times.

I've been on short term disability for weeks now, and PeopleOps has been nothing but supportive. Also, prior to this disability leave, the health insurance failed to authorize my husband's primary medication and PeopleOps helped resolve that too. The performance of the PeopleOps team is representative of the culture at large which emphasizes competency, emotional intelligence, and healthy culture. Marqeta is working hard on diversity and inclusion through dozens of identity groups such as Black Card and Women in Technology. Leadership attempts during all hands meetings to acknowledge that we are all doing our best working from home during COVID and it is okay to not do that perfectly. It makes you want to show up and do your best. I think the benefits which include pet insurance for one animal are fantastic, so if you are a candidate, be sure to ask for details including whether your position is bonus eligible.","It's not really a con but rather an adustment. Marqeta is focused more on goals than dates and the new hire impacts their job description as the position begins.

It's actually attainable!","I can't think of anything specific; I've observed some overworked departments, but I feel like Finance/Engineering/Product Management are typically like that everywhere.

Conscientious, progressive upper management.","You can progress and grow if you're talented at Marqeta, but our engineering management is still learning how to center empathy. The worst of this is that instead of building community, a small number of people still get by on playing politics. Their behavior is not publicly addressed. It would be great to hear the CEO, CPO or ET discuss what it means to support your fellow engineers. Interpersonal relationships matter.

Managers and Principals come from other companies, and they don't realize that they are not at X company anymore. Their methods might be useful, but they don't know how to make those contributions based on the Marqeta Way and with Marqeta Values."

Company recognizes the need for more mature company senior leadership to get us to the next stage with the Chief Product Officer coming from Go Daddy, Chief People Officer from Pixar, Chief Financial Officer from Intuit, and Chief Marketing Officer from Mulesoft

* Healthy business outlook and even rumors of an IPO
* Culture is great and we care about our people and the community
* Leadership seems to care about employee feedback
* Great perks, stipends, health insurance plans, 401k matching
* Coworkers are great","* Laser-focused on ship rate and as a result, we accumulate massive tech debt
* Promotions may seem a bit random and dependent on who your manager is
* Poor engineering leadership, although that is changing and is something we're aware of
* Generally, a very inexperienced engineering team
* Comp is bad (but benefits are good)
* Lots of favoritism going on

About 9 months ago, things started to get better. But then the leader who was driving change left and now things are going back into the toilet.

95,Marqeta,95% Amazing,2019-10-11,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The list of 'pros' is really long, actually.
The basic ones are: 
 - Our office is beautiful, wonderfully situated, easily accessible and stocked with tasty amenities.
 - Our benefits package(s) seem reasonably good (6% 401k match, standard array of Insurance options, (including pet insurance through Trupanion, lol), three weekly catered meals, etc..).
 - An enjoyable social aspect, including events, happy hours, team outings, and a broad array of interest-specific slack channels.
 - A good range of coworker diversity (disclaimer: diversity can always be better) re: age, experience and history range, family-status, etc...
 
The ones which hold more weight are:
 - Working with great engineers and great managers.
 - Marqeta is a company of consequence. Every day when I come in, I'm working on things which are blazing the way forward for how the larger payments industry operates.
 - We have, among the tech org, a cooperative environment.
 - I am never bored. Every day has new and exciting challenges to work on.
 - I feel very satisfied with, and supported in, my professional growth at Marqeta. We are supported in learning new skills, approaching problems in new ways, learning new languages.","- Like many other tech companies, I feel like our hiring process is rough. On our applicants as well as on our employees.
- Engineering objectives are too driven by the business side. While I feel like my work-life-balance is typically pretty good, I am, and the tech-org generally is, feeling increasing pressure to output."
96,Marqeta,"So much opportunity to do great, great things",2019-10-07,5.0,Marketing,"From the moment I interviewed at Marqeta I was immediately taken aback by how smart, hard working and humble everyone was. Management is thoughtful and empathetic, focused on employee experience and self-aware to the pitfalls of high growth. A lot of really likeable people working hard together. 

Payments is a hard space, and Marqeta is growing quickly. There's a sense of opportunity and possibility in front of everyone that is really exciting - global growth, product expansion, revenue up and to the right... 

Put together - it's meant that my time at Marqeta has been defined by being able to attack huge problems, make real impact and make huge professional leaps in experience, and work alongside people who make me smile most days. I consider that a privilege. 

Oh, and there's a lot of snacks and nice lunches and general tech company perks.","Change is a constant - and there's a lot of focus on preparing for the future and aligning at the moment. It can require patience and a willingness to trust the bigger picture and take a deep breath.

As at any hyper growth company at this stage, there are ups and downs. But the product is revolutionary and Jason and the E team are working tirelessly to make right any wrongs that have happened and putting strategies in place to help the company grow up past its awkward teenage years.

At this company, you will find:
- some of the most passionate and intelligent people you will come ever across
- countless types of coffee on every floor - drip, cold brew, espresso, pour over, you name it.
- weekly themed happy hours
- monthly massages
- multiple lunches per week

They are putting in extra effort to ensure we understand the vision and priorities and are investing in more talent to ensure our success.   

Some specific pros:
- working on products that impact the world in a positive way.

100,Marqeta,Politics are getting in the way of progress and effectiveness,2019-09-05,2.0,Marketing,"Nice office, well funded, good location","This company has grown really fast and along this way, this has created a very siloed and political organization.  Each team is more concerned with carving out and keeping their territories over making sure the business as a whole is successful.  This creates a very stressful environment, and leaves employees burdened with treading carefully to not harm fragile egos or crossing political alliances to get their projects done.

The company has underinvested and under-resourced  devops, security, customer success, risk and compliance, and quality assurance.  All things that are critical in finch for both customer trust and compliance concerns - it is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode. 

The company also has a very insular mindset - not looking enough at feedback in the marketplace and customers to drive the business and decision making. The mindset is more of ""we know what's best, the competition is subpar, and we can innovate and adjust on our timeline - we are way ahead of everyone else and do not need to be concerned.""  This leads to critical feedback not being taken seriously and prioritized.

Product and Revenue team priorities are not aligned at all, and the product team is so focused on marching to their own beat, they are not listening to input from the marketplace, customer, sales, or implementation teams.  This leads to a lot of distrust across teams and makes selling needlessly hard.

On the whole there is a lot of distrust for marketing, and the role in the organization.  Unfortunately it is only the ""make it pretty"" department and has zero influence in the business.  That team is forced to be an order taker instead of driving the company brand, positioning, or even messaging.  It is a depressing place to be if you are of the mindset that marketing should lead and influence the business. Marketing leadership hasn't been able to take charge and lead either the team or their peers on the revenue team - leaving a very ineffective and slow moving department that can't get any initiatives done. Marketing leadership also micromanages and is bad at delegating leaving each small decision endlessly delayed by getting leadership from each marketing lead as well as the broader revenue and product teams - hampering productivity and delaying all tactics."

- Pay/comp and benefits is as competitive as any company at its stage of growth.

- East Bay location is convenient for many 

- Most people don't put in crazy hours at the office. Flexible work arrangements are welcome. 

- Most employees, overall, are extremely down to earth. For all its struggles with culture, I would not say that arrogance or ego is a driver.","-  Teams are quick to blame others instead of simply acknowledging that we don't coordinate or communicate well. Some of this comes from internal rivalry and fracturing within the company, and some of this comes from unclear re-orgs which leave day-to-day accountability and responsibilities unclear.  Culture has become way too catty and political for a company this small.

- Several leaders (Directors/VPs/Execs) don't seem understand to understand the ""tech"" of being a fintech company, and don't use things like data/metrics or technical considerations to drive decisions.

 - Prioritization just seems to be based on which sales prospect, existing partner or bank is yelling at us the loudest for feature requests, and changes roughly every month. Executives can't even collectively come up with a handful of shared goals or objectives.  

- Culture has now impacted the product itself - there were several embarrasing (and foreseeable) service outages this year and product development has grinded to a slow place."

Top individual contributor and managers with deep payments experience are leaving. Certain critical functions have been very understaffed for a very long time.

Very top-heavy and lots of leadership and management issues (politics and strange alliances). Lots of re-organizations have happened in most of the company since they kept losing or getting rid of employees for little to no reason (all levels). People who are let go are not really given a specific reason why based on data and decisions are made by people that seem to not have any data. Many good people have also left for bigger and better companies.

- it is a rocket ship so hold on!!!","- growing fast and hiring a ton always has challenges but management is addressing this in a good way
- we are no longer on one floor so finding folks can be challenging, then again you always have Slack
- lots of meetings, however this is being addressed to try to bring these down and do things more without having to meet."
114,Marqeta,"Great culture, strong growth, huge potential",2018-08-23,5.0,Management,"- Great work environment - smart, dedicated, fun people.   
- We are in downtown Oakland in a great location that looks and feels like Oakland.  
- Innovation - lots of companies talk about being innovators, particularly in Fintech, but we're really doing it.  
- We work with the world's innovators (check the website) and are changing how payment cards are issued and used.  
- We're growing like crazy both domestically and internationally.  
- CEO is great - has a well-established vision of what we're doing, creates an inclusive work environment, encourages people to do their best work, really engaged.  
- Leadership team is getting stronger.  
- Competitive comp package, including 401K with matching.","With rapid growth (business and employees) comes challenges.  The challenges are recognized and discussed openly, and plans are in place to address them.  These are good challenges (opportunities!) to have!"
115,Marqeta,Amazing company if we can survive the politcal cancer,2018-08-07,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Incredibly inspiring mission. We make painfully complex payments problems simple and easy to manage, so our partners can concentrate on building the world-changing innovations they’re passionate about.

- Most of the people are friendly, welcoming, supportive, and professional. Friendships you make here are likely to last decades.

- The groups where leaders with experience building teams were brought in and empowered to work their magic (customer success, risk, security, data analytics, production support, etc) work incredibly well.","- A few managers are more interested in political maneuvering and advancing their own career than in doing what’s right for the company and our customers. These folks are responsible for the vast majority of friction and division in the company, but there are no checks and balances in place to reign them in. 

- The inevitable frustrations that come from hyper growth are also present, but are much less of an issue than the personal politics.

- A lot of lip service is given to protecting the culture, but what “the culture” is has never been defined. Each group has its own wildly different subculture, which causes unneeded culture clashes on cross-functional projects."
116,Marqeta,Lack of growth potential,2018-08-14,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good  pay, benefits and catered lunch. Most the people are great to work with and hard working towards the benefit of the company.",Managers need to learn to work with other teams. I have witnessed discrimination and sexism within a certain engineering team.  There's clashing sub cultures. It can be frowned upon to attend social  company events if you're on certain teams. There's little to no room to advance here. It seems additional training and conferences were looked down upon (varies by manager)
117,Marqeta,Great opportunity to build something big,2018-08-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Incredible market opportunity,  talented and caring team, visionary leadership.",Pressure from supporting business growth is exacerbated by fast but ineffective changes in headcount and organizations.
118,Marqeta,Management - associate disconnect,2018-08-02,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Wins are celebrated, offsites can be fun, there are a handful of upper-level folks who are genuine, funding has been secured over short-term","Can be extremely gossipy and toxic at even the highest levels, absolutely no sense of job security, hugely dependent on a core set of clients, favoritism plays a big role in advancement"
119,Marqeta,Inexperienced managers and immature employees,2018-08-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Nice perks, outings during work hours, catered lunch and breakfast","I was sold on growth to further my career because I didn’t have it at my previous company. I quickly realized shortly after joining it was a lie. I decided to give  the company another chance and prove my worth and I no longer want to waste my time. Instead of putting people who has the direct experience, skills, knowledge and talent to bigger projects to help grow the company, they are doing entry level to mid level work as if managers are threatened by their skills. You need to be given the opportunity and exposure to bigger projects to grow your career and that is non existence. Managers are inexperienced with no prior management skills, they were given a VP title because of their years of service while other people who works hard were let go. People who deserves to be let go are not. Some employees are closed minded and immature, many whines, complains and plays the victim making it difficult to do your job. Some complaints are just ridiculous, their feelings were hurt so management now has to fix it. People also have been promoted because they were liked by their managers not because they work hard and have the right skills. It’s surprising to see people who been here longer, worked twice as hard been overlooked because simply the manager is playing favoritism."
120,Marqeta,Great company once. Now just a Good company.,2018-07-03,4.0,Operations,"-Management is reachable and typically willing to meet on anything.
-Great healthy snacks, lunches, above average benefits 
-Fun team members. Many share similar aspects to life.","-Management can say one thing but switch up in the next week. A bit of ego clouds decisions. They can sometimes be childish and unable to handle confrontations when someone does something wrong or not to their liking. 
-Work-life balance can be hectic. Burnout is a common theme due to not wanting to look like a slacker while peers around put in an extra 2-3 hours a day."
121,Marqeta,data engineer,2018-06-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great company, team to work for.","so far none, company is heading in right direction ."
122,Marqeta,What a horrible management system,2018-06-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good pay, food is aplenty, nice people","managers lie about career opportunity timeline,  are incredibly vindictive and narcissistic, pretend to have your back. experienced verbal abuse via email from managers. VPs could care less about any regular employees."
123,Marqeta,Did not enjoy my time there,2018-04-12,2.0,Engineer,"- Fast growing
- Nice people
- Approachable upper management 
- 2 days of free lunch (although this is maybe below standard for tech companies in the Bay)","- The multiple pivots in the company's lifetime means you have employee cohorts that weren't hired for the current vision, and don't have the right skillset to execute for the future goals. 
- The engineering talent is second-tier
- Lack of career development
- SO MUCH INTERNAL POLITICS
- No 401K
- Business model is VERY dependent on a few key partners (higher risk of failure)"
124,Marqeta,High-growth opportunity!,2018-04-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Company is doing exceptionally well so every opportunity is impactful. Great location for east bay folks. Best company I've ever worked for. Awesome experience professionally and awesome people.,None at this time! It's exciting to see Marqeta take off
125,Marqeta,"Fast paced, innovative and truly disrupting the payments space!",2018-04-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The CEO is incredible, extremely down to earth and treats his employees like family no matter your title or how long you've worked here. The company is doing really well and a leader in the space which creates excitement in the workplace. It is very much a roll up your sleeves and GSD environment so if this is not reflective of your mentality do not come here.",None that come to mind.
126,Marqeta,"Challenging and fun, but comes with your typical startup growing-pains.",2018-03-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Marqeta provides a challenging environment which breeds constant growth for individuals and their careers'. Marqeta also has some really amazing people, which lends itself well to creating an awesome company-culture.  Marqeta also has an amazing CEO who is very down-to-earth and genuinely cares about his employees.",Cross-team communication needs to improve. At times it seems like the company operates in separate silos.
127,Marqeta,Management,2018-02-13,1.0,,"Innovative fun group, lots of room for ideas.",Poor management decisions. Some positions are just a revolving door.
128,Marqeta,Great culture & environment!,2017-09-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Highly culture focused, emphasis on the team, encourages learning new things, quarterly hack weeks!",The commute up 880 N is not great.
129,Marqeta,Great company to build a career,2017-08-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Very smart people. Solid product and tech leadership with great teams.,Nothing really. As close to perfect as any place could be.
130,Marqeta,"Dream Job for Builders, Learners, Innovators, Challengers, Creators...",2017-04-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"-I joined Marqeta from a another Fintech company after meeting with various members of the team from top to bottom and researching the market opportunity. Marqeta sits at a very interesting merge point in Fintech, where we partner with leading disruptors in e-commerce, alternative lending, on-demand delivery, and other interesting use cases in the space. The opportunity to work across diverse sectors in a rapidly innovating space is rare, and Marqeta is leading innovation on the issuing side of payment processing that has seen little disruption in the current wave of Fintech growth. 

-The team is hands-down the most experienced, knowledgeable, and driven leadership teams that I have worked with in my start-up experience. Jason, the CEO, is one of the most passionate and dedicated entrepreneurs in the space, and he genuinely cares about the business, our customers, our partners, and the people working every day to drive the company forward. This drives the culture of the organization from the top down and back up again. 

-The problem-solving capabilities of this team are legendary. Seriously. We're charting new waters in the card issuing space; the quality of people across engineering, product, legal, revenue, data, etc. that are super passionate, dedicated, and focused on the challenges of winning the space makes me excited to come to work every day and confident about the future that the company is creating. 

-If you're a builder, learner, innovator, challenger, creator, driver...this place is for you. Marqeta is working with amazing companies to build things that have never been done before in the Fintech space, and it's a true meritocracy where ideas and innovation lead. You will never stop learning while at Marqeta, and the people that thrive here know how to capture knowledge and bring ideas to drive growth and solve interesting challenges. 

-Having worked at 6 start-ups with now a full year of experience at Marqeta, I can say that I have found my dream job. Our customers love us, the team is amazing, the company is growing, the work is exciting, and our vision in the space is driving the creation of an exceptional platform and the energy of those excited about innovation in Fintech.","-Like many start-ups, it's difficult to prioritize scalability projects while also trying to get the day to day work done. Even though we're slightly late to the party, we're moving in the right direction to build the foundation to ensure that we don't slow down as we scale. 

-At times, it can seem like we're too much in ""project management"" or ""task"" mode given the challenges of figuring out how to make big initiatives work. We need to keep pushing to get more strategic and elevate key thinking out of the weeds. Standardization and automation of certain tasks and efforts will support growth as we iron out the kinks."
131,Marqeta,A successful startup trying to scale,2016-03-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"* Great people! Probably the greatest team of people I have ever worked with. There are no slackers at Marqeta.
* Great culture. Jason Gardner (CEO) vets all hires and cares a lot about keeping Marqeta a great place to work. 
* Company is doing well and is solving the good problems of being too successful. Scaling up the systems and so forth.
* Catered food twice a week, it's usually pretty good.","* Not always much transparency. 
* Not always valuing smarter ways to do things. Everyone at Marqeta works hard and so it can be difficult to propose ideas that make things more efficient because it causes change. People feel they can just put in more hours instead of slowing down.
* Not clear how promotions or salary increases work. There is a ""flat structure"" in engineering which is cool socially but confusing in terms of career advancement.
* No 401k match yet but understandable due to it being a startup.
* No high scores for Marqeta on workplace diversity despite being located in Oakland."
