There is a really refreshing outlook and investment in all positions within the company (not just sales and management like most companies) both in compensation, stock AND work load/time spent by each team member. It's so fun consistently hearing how we can improve our clients AND our team member's experience in our everyday life by Newfront's investment and what we're focusing on improving.","With it being such a great company, it's also growing super fast so sometimes you feel that as a new employee."

4,Newfront,Exciting Place to Work and Feel Valued,2022-01-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Newfront truly cares about its employees. From constantly-enhanced benefit programs to frequent updates from the top leadership, the company shows that it values us all. Every day is a different day at Newfront with new challenges to dissect and new team members to meet (virtually!).","As with any growing company, there is uncertainty at times about roles and who is responsible for what.

There is a real feeling, here, that the company is poised for incredible growth both now and in the years ahead, and this excitement about the company’s future is tempered by a shared sense of vision and purpose supplied by the C-level management.  True to form, Newfront’s culture merges features of an innovative tech start-up and a built-to-last, retail insurance brokerage, with a strong focus on metrics and results.  It is a spectacular place to work, resources aimed at training and development are ample, and there is always strong support from teams and managers when needed.","Ideas and execution move fast at Newfront, and there isn’t always time to fill everyone in on why a certain decision has been made or what its consequences might look like for everyone involved.  Sometimes there’s the potential to feel like you’re on the outside looking in, but this is something that happens, to greater or lesser extents, at any company."

11,Newfront,I wish I never joined,2022-01-25,1.0,Client Service Associate,Great people working in the pod,"I met some good people, but many that were “passively” good with what I later found out had bad intentions and honestly I wish I never took the role. Originally I was chosen for the role to start at the end of November. After I was sent the offer and accepted, I was then advised that they did that in error because of a new acquisition, and the only way they could keep me onboard is to go through a temp agency and take my salary that was offered in an hourly rate form and was promised that on January 1st 2022, I would be fully on board and no longer with the temp agency. So I LEFT my FULL TIME JOB to join them because of this promise. Let me just tell you now, that NEVER happened. 

Training was only a week and both myself and others in training agreed we did not acquire any of the knowledge but at the end of it we were split in testing our knowledge where mine consisted of live accounts and theirs consisted of hypothetical situations and not live accounts. The pod I was in I feel like everyone was nice and helping, but some of upper management constantly made me nervous when we had conversations because of the backhand comments some made about my workflow. Fast forward, I had a death in my family and I was asked if I wanted to take time, I advised management that I wish I could but I know I just started this role and I can’t afford to miss days. MULTIPLE times (and I still have the messages) they advised me that I wouldn’t be penalized for it if I missed days. I come back after my family member passed, worked the shift and I get a call from the temp agency telling me that they were advised that was my last day due to “the company no longer needing that role to be filled”. Moral of it all was I left my job to trust a startup company to do right with their promises and fell flat on my face with nothing because I was given empty promises."
12,Newfront,"Toxic, secretive environment perpetuated from the top",2021-11-12,1.0,Account Manager,Merging with a bigger company so hopefully we get get better benefits and 401k match finally,"Be prepared to lose value on your equity, sucks to have your equity diluted by 50% when the company triples in value

Very political enivronment, if you're not part of the ""in crowd"" then you'll be in the dark about stuff happening in your own department

You get treated like a little kid, we have FOND points which we can redeem for like $5 gift cards instead of getting a meaningful raise. Underpaid and overworked across the board"

Technology development","One of the main missions of Newfront is to create a new way to do insurance. This is being accomplished through technological and software development on an ongoing basis. While the new technology is heading in the right direction, it is not there yet. The frequent updates can cause some head aches as you may have to relearn how to accomplish certain things from week to week. 

If you can pivot and learn quickly, work well with changing systems and are good at prioritizing the client experience. This may be the place for you."

19,Newfront,"Fast growing company, but still young",2021-04-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working in operations I have the distinct pleasure to interact with most of Newfront’s teams. I can say that Newfront promotes a culture of transparency and friendliness that makes it easier to get work done. Whenever I need something from someone in another department, I have no problem asking for help. Other places I’ve worked had a rift between departments and people even formed different “cliques” that made working life difficult. At Newfront, everyone is helpful and supportive, and I’d even say many of my teammates are friends. 

The company is also really flexible with work hours and vacation time, which makes it easy to balance out the sometimes heavy workload.","This company is still young, but we're quickly capitalizing on the potential. It can also be frustrating to work for a startup company, so if you plan on working here you should expect some unexpected struggles that wouldn’t be typical of a more established company."
20,Newfront,Tech Drives This Company,2021-04-15,5.0,Software Engineer,"Newfront thrives because we leverage technology to actually innovate in the insurance industry. The products and tools I help develop are unique in their own way, and I take pride in our contributions. We have product market fit as a business and need the technology to scale.

The engineering teams are really fun to work with and everyone is warm and collaborative in general. The environment is friendly and there are lots of smart people working with us. The team is committed to excellence. I think if you saw the way we work, you would be excited for how we’re going to shake things up.",It feels like Newfront has two cultures that have to come together for it to be completely successful.

42,Newfront,Great place to work for people with growth mindset,2019-11-06,5.0,Software Engineer,"This is an extremely fast growing company, which is what caught my attention in the first place. This means a ton of opportunity to build tech from the scratch, with thorough review from coworkers. Fantastic for people who like to communicate with end users and iterate on product.

The engineering team is run by experienced CTO and VP of eng, with a good mixture of junior and senior team mates. No bs, no politics. The entire team work hard and share life like a big family.  Normal 10-6 work hours. Modern tech stack (React + Express, AWS, Datadog, etc), open-minded on new tech (brought in GraphQL recently).

From my extensive job search before joining, Newfront is a rare find that has a mixture of young culture, good leadership, great market, and fast growing phase. I didn't regret a bit since I joined.","The goal of our tech team is to build great product to support the business side, so for people looking to build cool tech for the sake of building it, this is not the right place to be.

Also, we're building things as we're designing and spec'ing out. There may be some overlap between stages, instead of a nice waterfall process where eng is only involved once product/design is done. This may not suit the working style of some people."
43,Newfront,Overall a positive experience. Room for improvement in some areas.,2021-01-06,3.0,Account Manager,Strong well-defined company values and culture. Individual goals are linked to organizational goals. High organizational citizenship.,"I was apart of the 2020 layoff during the pandemic. Account managers have low job autonomy; my job was dictated by tableau reporting and everything was tracked. This translated as a perceived lack of trust in individuals from the people managers and contributed to a lack of engagement and motivation. My job became all about a favorable tableau report, which took the enjoyment out of my role. Displaying individual tableau performance reports for everyone to see also fostered a competitive rather than a collaborative environment among teams, which ultimately hindered individual and team performance. Low work/life balance."
44,Newfront,Work Hard - Play Hard,2019-11-21,5.0,Account Manager,"The entire culture of this company is simply amazing.  When you spend most of your day at work, it is important to love what you do and who you work with.  Never before have I felt so at home with a company.

We work hard, and we play hard.  Through team work and understanding the vision, we all come together to make amazing greatness happen and I am so thrilled to be a part of it!","With any newer company there will be pains in growth, and that is here.  But it is how the management team handles them that sets Newfront apart.  They want to hear about your suggestions for improvement and they empower each person to act to make change.  Its a fast paced environment with a constant changing system.  If you are unable to hang on for the ride, its not going to work for you."

63,Newfront,You want the truth about Newfront? Culture eats strategy for breakfast.,2020-06-23,5.0,Strategic Growth,"The leadership team tells all. They don’t care to hide anything, because we all need to be aligned to achieve greatness and greatness will come. In a short time, Newfront has developed into a mature brokerage firm, but the potential impact this company will have on our industry has just begun. Don’t believe me? Come find out for yourself. Don’t shorten your insight based on my review. It’s no secret that Newfront will share the vision and all the amazing details that come with it. 

As an employee of Newfront. Ask yourself, do you want recognition for your efforts and encouragement to share your ideas? Personally speaking, I believe the biggest reward is to be seen as an asset. If I believe in a company, work hard for a company, and deeply care about the direction of a company. I feel as I belong to that company. If you want to be valued and you want to be noticed as an asset, then join Newfront. You will be rewarded.","It really depends on what you want. If you want to work for a company which has a familiar environment of the old, the mundane work, the day to day grind, and a familiar setting. It’s not Newfront. 

Before joining, I was afraid of a fast growth company, because it’s extremely challenging to build a solid foundation if a company is moving too fast. I’ve never experienced growth like this before, so this is how I thought. I was proven wrong. Our firm is loaded with talent - LOADED; specially insurance professionals which continue to over achieve client expectation. 

We have countless of thoughtful appreciative letters from clients for how great our AM’s are doing. We all are working really hard to deliver the most impactful company anyone will experience. You really should have a passion to willfully contribute your time to your work otherwise it may become a con."

Do you want to work with executives who only have their high ranking jobs because of who they know? If you have answered yes to any of these....you are in luck, this is the company for you!","Working at Newfront is a terrible experience for anyone who speaks their mind. If you are a lemming or an experienced cult member, you will do great at Newfront. If you stray away from the cult leader's agenda you will be harassed, belittled, degraded and experience more gas lighting than you have probably ever seen. It doesn't matter how good you are at your job, it matters if you are willing to drink the kool aid. Overall, Newfront is a very abusive and toxic company. The entire leadership team and management team are clueless; they do not know insurance at all. The one person whom should know insurance, is disappointing at best.  If you are an experienced insurance professional, I do not recommend Newfront. They advertise that they are offering a better experience for everyone, but the technology isn't even built out enough to do standard insurance transactions."

It was never about insurance (I know). It’s always been about the technology (I know this, too). Look at the facts;  ridiculous commission splits (not sustainable in any business), producers owned their books so are free to take them when they leave. This would leave a small percentage of residual commissions for Newfront, which they will most likely sell. Has anyone ever seen a true balance sheet? It seems they may be ready to present their technology to the insurance world.  Everything else was a lie."

The excuse for poor work/life balance is that it’s a startup. Failure is not allowed at Newfront.

There is no career path or internal promotion despite the promise of opportunity to grow within the company.  As a company that claims to be “diversity forward” women and people of color are paid less across the board.

Upper management at Newfront is clueless and ignorant to how employees feel. They are deceiving and out of touch. Some employees have “gone on leave” and never returned. 

Beyond a flashy looking dashboard, there is no “groundbreaking” technology. Compensation is not competitive and benefits are mediocre."
