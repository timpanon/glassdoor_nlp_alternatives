0,Pacaso,Pacaso Maintanance Manager - Carmel,2022-03-30,5.0,Maintenance Manager,"The resources are tremendous & very helpful in executing team goals & vision. The support & methods communication via Slack, Backyard/Salesforce helps us accomplish tasks efficiently as a team. The team is comprised of great human beings with great character & many talents. The connection I have made in only two months working for the company has been an enriching experience!","As we work together, communication can sometimes be challenging. Work schedules for various departments are not always realized & sometimes deliveries do not arrive on time, homes are not always stay ready on time, & deadlines are pushed back."
1,Pacaso,"Hands Down, BEST Recruiting Experience of my career",2022-01-18,5.0,Legal Counsel,"The recruiting team is extremely responsive and willing to provide real-time insights on your candidacy, including feedback from interviews, follow up questions from the team, and clear deliverables for next steps. You are never in the dark about what's going on, what conversations they're having internally, and most importantly, where you stand. This is so unlike most places I've interviewed, and the transparency made all the difference and kept me excited through the process. Now that I'm on the inside, I see that recruiting's transparency and commitment to respecting how people think and feel about their work and potential are simply carryovers from the company's overarching culture of communication, respect, and decency.","I did have a lot of interviews, each about 30 minutes to an hour long. In the end, that track record and notes from the team made their hiring decision all the smoother, but this is not a place where you'll sweet talk one or two people and wind up with a job."
2,Pacaso,Truly is one of the best places to work!,2022-02-21,5.0,Owner Services,"The entire company is remote, which can be a positive or negative, but for me it's a huge positive. The flexibility of scheduling your day to ensure our own work/life balance is great. 

Hiring has been so impressive. I truly feel like I'm working with the best in the game. The interview process with Jacquie and management, was efficient and professional. 

I have nothing but positive things to say about the culture at Pacaso. Everyone is incredibly supportive, even though we're all connecting virtually.","Hours can get long, but that's startup life!"
3,Pacaso,High growth stage start up.  Roll up your sleeves and get to work.,2022-02-01,5.0,Home Manager,Great opportunity to be part of a company that’s here to stay and growing like crazy. No mater what position you hold your opinions and values are supported and they take time to listen to you. Flexibility in your work day is ultimately the best part of the company.,New start now up with a lot of evolving processes. Be ready to work a lot but also know that you will be paid well for your time and energy even if things gets crazy. Definitely a roller coaster of a day most of the time.
4,Pacaso,Thankful to be here,2021-12-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"-I've worked for companies where people join for the title, the benefits, the brand name, etc. Not here. Everyone truly believes in what we're doing, everything else is secondary
-Beyond the commitment to our product and consumer base there's a deep care for each employee, and I'm reminded of it daily.
-The growth we've seen month over month is pretty incredible and inspiring.","-We're a distributed workforce, so if you're coming from an office setting it may feel unusual at first. But our leadership team does plan team/company retreats so that you can meet your colleagues in person, and those connections are so meaningful when you finally meet someone in person after months of interacting with them virtually.
-Not a con, but a challenge: we have an amazing company culture and we're growing at a staggering rate, conventional wisdom says those thing eventually become mutually exclusive. Excited to see how our leadership team tackles that dilemma."
5,Pacaso,"Focused, well-run company. Amazing culture.",2022-01-26,5.0,"Director, Public Affairs","It's very rare to find a hyper-growth company with little operational chaos. Everyone is rowing in the same direction. Pacaso has recruited top-tier talent across the world and there's no question it's the ""secret sauce"" to our success.",Pacaso may not be a good fit if remote work isn't for you.
6,Pacaso,Amazing,2022-02-11,5.0,Sales Principal,Amazing culture and lifestyle and mission,"Lots of unknowns with start up, hiring too much too quick, don’t want to be lean and mean"
7,Pacaso,A Refreshing Company to Be a Part Of,2021-08-28,5.0,Market Principal,"Expert leadership who built the company with a mission that delivers on diversity, equity, and inclusion. The culture is amazing and employees are 100% on board with the mission and live by its core values. The company is fully distributed (no HQ), and provides a great balance between work/life but you still feel connected through tech. The company builds real connections through fun team building events, off-sites and company retreats for in-person experiences for employees. It's fast-paced, fun and rewarding. Most importantly, the leadership truly cares for, appreciates and supports all employees and clients - it's just a refreshing company to be a part of.","You may feel disconnected at times if you are used to a traditional or hybrid in-office environment, but you'll get used to it and learn to appreciate why the company chose to operate this way.  Your work/life balance will ebb and flow as it's a fast-paced environment, but the company recognizes this and always provides ways to support employees to improve balance."
8,Pacaso,"If you can get in, you'll love it",2022-01-14,5.0,Market Principal,"Culture is amazing: open door policy from top down, everyone is STOKED on the company mission to enrich lives by making second homeownership possible and enjoyable for more people.

9,Pacaso,Authentically happy working with an authentic crew,2021-08-23,5.0,Marketing Manager,"Pacaso is a purpose and mission driven company, not just one that says it is for sake of sounding modern. The company has fostered an environment enabling employees to work in coordination toward a collective vision, and an impactful vision at that. 

I started this role after WFH at another company due to Covid, and was a bit unsure about starting a journey at a fully remote company. However, this experience has far exceeded my expectations. Not only has every teammate I've met been genuine and kind, but the collaboration and productivity of the team has exceeded my expectations (including great virtual team events), even in comparison to past in-person companies I've worked for. Employees have ample space for ownership and an ability to make a meaningful impact. Working here was easily the best career move I've made thus far.","We've been growing so fast, which isn't a con but definitely hoping we can continue to scale the good things we have going. Doing the best I can to enjoy the moment while keeping a long-term view of what's to come."

Awesome benefits.","It is very fast-paced so being flexible is a must. There are times that I have felt overwhelmed however I mitigate that by reaching out for explanation/assistance or taking a break. Everyone is understanding and happy to answer questions.
Because it is a fully distributed company, I'm in a lot of Zoom meetings. Everyone is to the point and does not waste time in our meetings."
12,Pacaso,I LOVE my job!,2022-01-14,5.0,Corporate Paralegal,"Great communication, leadership, vision and culture...all rowing in the same direction",100% remote demands discipline but it's doable and rewarding.
13,Pacaso,Fulfilling Job With An Incredible Team,2021-08-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work that doesn't feel like work...is that pro enough? The mission and supporting core values are authentic and create an atmosphere of trust and support. Our leaders are accessible and walk the walk. Amazing feeling when you witness life-enriching moments in real time. One of the greatest times in my career. The pros far and away outweigh the cons and the positive, global impact of Pacaso will be long lasting. Sometimes it feels like a dream.",Work life balance can be challenging on the ops/sales side because real estate is 24/7 including weekends. Sales can feel like the tail of the dog sometimes when internal/external variables out of your control impact revenue.

The management is inspiring, transparent, and communicates a clear vision and purpose. As a product designer, I'm able to spread my wings and work on large, impactful projects that solve real problems and keep my creative tank full.","It's a young company, so the benefits are not Microsoft/Amazon level. That's not great, but the management is well aware and is working on improving those benefits year over year. The important thing to know is that people are valued at Pacaso, and that is so very important."
16,Pacaso,A Breath of Fresh Air,2021-08-24,5.0,Sales Principal,"I've always heard people say ""You never work a day in your life if you love what you do"" And I've never understood that sentence until now (without trying to sound cheesy). Of course it is still work, and there are good days and bad days but I've never worked for a company where I enjoyed every day because I believed in the company's mission to my very core! From admin to sales to engineers to executive, everyone acts as a team! We truly row together! Truly the most authentic company and the most enriching career I've had thus far!",It's not a start-up if you aren't constantly working to improve communication. I wouldn't say this is a con though because Pacaso is always improving communication and is fully transparent!

The people are truly amazing, as everyone relies on each other and works hard towards our company mission and goals. Upper management also does a great job being as transparent as possible with the progress of the company, which is greatly appreciated. I have no regrets coming to work here.","My only real con is being totally distributed, as personally I like to feed off the energy of other people in an office and enjoy building those in person relationships. I do think Pacaso does it's best to try to mitigate that."
18,Pacaso,Amazing people and culture,2021-08-23,5.0,Public Affairs & Communications,"I can't say enough good things about the people at Pacaso and the culture that we're building together. It's a company full of people who are invested in the company's mission, concerned with each others' well-being and development, and eager to help, regardless of one's job description.

I have never worked somewhere where I really believed in the mission and put the company's values into action every single day. The culture here is truly amazing.,Sometimes I miss the face to face interactions working from home. There are several departmental events as well as a company wide event that help with this.

I joined Pacaso from Zillow and I had loved working there for Zillow's first 10-15 years when it was an extremely exciting place to work. However, over time, and especially more so recently, Zillow had become less inspiring, too big, more bureaucratic, and less world-changing. 

Pacaso, by contrast, is still in hypergrowth mode. The people and culture at Pacaso are phenomenal. But equally important, the mission is inspiring. Also, management has worked very hard to keep an excellent culture even as we grow, and even though we are a distributed remote team.
