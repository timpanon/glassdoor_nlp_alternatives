0,Pax8,Outstanding Commitment to Employee Culture,2022-03-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Huge focus on employee engagement, communications, and well-being

Excellent benefits and salary

Solid work-life balance and boundaries

Accessible and honest leadership

Extremely talented and impressive leaders and staff

Exciting growth and ability to learn daily","Very fast pace and high growth isn’t for everyone

Large and growing global staff size can make cross-functional communication challenging"
1,Pax8,Great company but pay needs adjusting,2022-02-02,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people here are pretty awesome, a ton of intelligent, talented, caring individuals working together. Much of the leadership in my experience is very understanding that life comes first and work is just a means to an end. I have never had issues getting time off for illness, emergencies, etc. They offer unlimited PTO and they mean it (within reason don't ask for every Monday and Friday off) 

I have worked at this company for several years now and have seen it grow from a startup to much larger industry player, and aside from some growing pains, they have done admirably at it and have been able to adapt quickly to many changes, including COVID remote work","There aren't too many here, the one thing I would say, and I know I am not alone here, is that the pay is frequently well below market value. If you expect to get paid close to the average for a job title, and aren't in sales or leadership, you are going to be sorely disappointed."
2,Pax8,"No growth, bad management, under paid",2022-01-28,2.0,Sales,Great employees and friends from this company and good PTO.,"Young management, they honestly don’t know how to handle tough situations, they are not very educated on sales and provide no help or assistance or helpful career advice. You have to know people in order to get promoted here (especially into management). 

Pax8 severely underpays for the industry. If your looking to make money and your not a TOP account manager, don’t expect to make much money here. 

Quotas constantly change and they do not set you up for success to hit quota. Pax8 will claim they care about their employees but they clearly do not. They will dangle the fact that in the long run Pax8 will be worth a lot and that it’s worth it to stay and wait out all the changes . But changes have been happening for the past 2 + years and they keep saying it will level out and it has not. They also will promise you promotions in the future and then go back and change the promotion or tell you there are “no spots available” so you don’t get promoted as fast as they say. I would stay away."
3,Pax8,"Great Culture, Bad Comp",2022-03-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Great high energy sales teams

- Culture is second to none

- Great Benefits, PTO, H/D/V,","-Expect Promotional bottlenecks so major delays in what they set your expectations out as 

-Quota is meant to be reflective of performance but most KPIs we can control aren't even counted to quota.

- Lots of micromanagement just built into how the management is structured. Like having to ask permission to join certain groups to source candidates and then being denied cause the manager is too scared to bring it to upper-level

- constantly changing environment that they just kind of blow off as it getting better

- Other annoying red-tape stuff and double standards on policy"
4,Pax8,It has potential,2022-03-08,3.0,Anonymous Employee,C-suite leaders are smart and experienced. I have confidence they're focused on the right things at their level. Work life balance is respected.,"It's a quickly growing company so there are definitely people who have been promoted into leadership positions because they've been at the company for awhile, not because they're particularly qualified to be leaders and that causes some real pain for employees who have to work under them. 

Compensation is also woefully below market rate for Denver Metro and there are few advancement opportunities for those outside the sales org."
5,Pax8,Best company I’ve ever worked for… minus the pay,2022-03-16,3.0,Channel Account Manager,"We love this place. The people. The culture. Best of breed software, platform and services. No one would want to leave unless… (read cons)","Paid well below market value.  We are worth double on the market. That’s a big number.

9,Pax8,Lives up to the hype,2022-02-02,5.0,Vendor Success Manager,"Culture - people and vibe are very positive and fun
Growth - consistently see sales growth within the company
Team Work - everyone is willing to assist/help

All in all, working at the company is as advertised! If you heard positive things about Pax8, they're true","Nitpicking here, but sometimes it feels like our growth out paces our processes and improvements, but again, that stems from growing at an accelerated rate."

11,Pax8,"Great coworker environment, poor compensation",2022-02-04,2.0,Channel Development Representative,"-I really enjoyed my coworkers and peers. 
-Team events were a blast
-Fun culture despite working remotely
-Good sales experience","-Underpaid vs industry standard and underpaid vs cost of living in Denver. OTE for a CDR1 is only 60,000. I was promoted twice but my base of 39000 never increased. Inbound role but only get paid if you hit 75% commission (Account Managers still get paid out for hitting 50%). They justify this by offering stock that won't hit your pocket for years.
-I felt like I was lied to in my interview. I was told that the company would always prioritize promoting from within, but they massively over-hired outside account managers, severely slowing down promotion paths of employees who came into the company in entry level positions.
-Management will talk their way out of this by claiming ""things are always subject to change"".
-Account Managers/Sales side of organization is disrespectful to demand gen side of org (Talk to down to, ignore teams messages, etc.)
-Unrealistic quotas
-Seem to roll out changes without ever thinking them through or having proper resources in place to make changes successful
-Increased roles and responsibilities of position, essentially being turned into account managers for smaller accounts (require more hand holding, often less fruitful), without compensation of being an account manager."

Like a lot of organizations, there are some great people who work here.","Can honestly say that I have NEVER been treated with such vicious cruelty by a company in all my life! I was so happy and excited to go to work for Pax8, went into this job eyes wide open,  soaking up what I was learning like a sponge. I showed up on time, payed attention in training, was told I was doing a great job. Three weeks into training, WHAM! I am told I’m being terminated? No warning, no real explanation, other than the trainers (the same ones who were oh-so-supportive), are apparently wolves in sheep’s clothing.  The “People Ops” team (fancy word for HR) told me they really couldn’t give me any additional information, but I was welcome to apply for another position. Really?  Why? So you can sucker punch and backstab me all over again? I left a job to take this job and my livelihood was ripped right out from under me, three weeks into training? Don’t believe the platitude about how Pax8’s people are it’s greatest resource. Trust me, you’re really just a number."

15,Pax8,Incredibly Positive Experience,2021-08-26,5.0,Senior Accountant,"Pax8 is a growing company where opportunities are really endless due to constant growth. The Finance/Accounting Team is one of the strongest I had the pleasure of working with and they care about you as a human being above all else. 

The great thing about working here is that once you master whatever you are given....you are consistently fed new opportunities. For instance, I had a desire to explore Data Science for school and was fully supported by management to continue to learn and grow my knowledge base. They really do care and that is hard to come by. 

The team is super young and youthful which means they are adaptable and will always work through the punches.

CFO and VP and Director of Finance are top notch PEOPLE which makes the work so much easier to manage.",Growth can lead to instablility but if they continue on the same path then they will be incredibly successful. They are on the road to IPO no doubt.

58,Pax8,The absolute best company I have ever worked for!,2020-06-09,5.0,Marketing Operations,"There are so many amazing things about Pax8. They are unlike any other company and value each and every person. One of the many is it truly is like a family. Even with the current state of things and the company working remote, they have gone above and beyond to still try to maintain a level of community that is unlike any other company I have ever worked for. The C-level staff, the VP's, and managers always put the people first. 

There is tons of opportunity for growth and professional development but you have to voice yourself. I know in previous companies, I would typically be shrugged off or given false promises for advancement which lead to being discouraged and continued to fear voicing myself due to fear of continued rejection. I can say, if you work hard, have a passion for what you do, management does listen and will work with you to ensure you are achieving your goals and help provide resources to help ensure you are reaching your personal milestones in professional development. 

I love the collaboration that we have as a team and that we can openly speak about our concerns and roadblocks without being ridiculed. Leadership takes these things seriously and are always willing to help out and step in if needed to ensure that our team continues to be successful and meet deadlines. As many companies as I have worked for in the past, management usually just puts your concerns aside and doesn't ever follow up. I can say that Pax8 has been absolutely amazing in ensuring this doesn't happen.

Pax8 is a very fast environment and things do often change at the drop of a dime but you have to be willing to adapt but know that leadership is aware of the effort of work that would be required and allows you the time to ensure that changes are completed within a reasonable timeframe. You have to be willing to be flexible and adapt but understand that you have support behind you and if you do encounter roadblocks, these things are reviewed and next steps are created to ensure to navigate through these issues. 

If you want to look at working some place that will truly value you as a person and allow you to further advance your professional development and career, Pax8 is the perfect place for this to happen!","To be honest, I cannot think of any cons."

Immediately after starting at Pax8 it was clear that this was not the case, the people that I work with today  (cube mates and leadership alike) and the collective passion for the success of the company definitely the top pro of Pax8. If you are serious about furthering your career in the tech space and are willing to work hard on a daily basis to move up in a company Pax8 is the place you can make it happen.","Overall organization - Pax8 is competing with significantly larger companies, meaning we are quicker to make changes to better accommodate our current and prospective partners.

69,Pax8,"Very rare, tons of potential/growth",2019-11-07,5.0,Technical Sales,"Having worked in IT for more than I decade I can say from personal experience that Pax8 is the company that people are searching for. I have known many friends who have hopped around to find that one magical place and watch on LinkedIn as they move from one company to the next.

Lucky for me, I was able to find my next stint with staying power. I fully have the intention of working for Pax8 the next 4-6 years at least.

This is a place with a fantastic culture. Everyone is extremely helpful and willing to share knowledge with each other. Pax8 is very interested in educating employees so they can take better care of customers (Partners). They are all about promoting from within and like to see people rise up to the challenge.

Yes, there is the gimmicky beer on tap, ping pong tables, unlimited PTO etc. (this is tech) but on top of that, this really is a very good place to build a career.","This is still in startup world. There is a ton to do with not a whole lot of people to do it. (we bring on 30+ people per month) This is the nature of the beast.

We talk about unlimited PTO but there is never enough time. Always something else to do, partners to help, business to close.

Pay isn't the highest I have seen in tech but I believe long term with the success we are seeing they will correct this in due time.

We do need more focus on all non-sales roles to keep up with the growth."

There are some truly amazing people that work here, and there is a good company culture. I have had the pleasure of working with many very intelligent, talented, and kind people at my time here, and have ended up (unintentionally) making actual friends out of coworkers, something I have always tried to avoid keeping work and home life separated. The company also works with some cool cloud products, so a great way to get your foot in the door in the cloud computing industry.","This is the part I don't want to write because I truly do like the company. There is definitely a ""bro culture"" here, always has been. There tend to be promotions and hiring decisions that don't make sense for the role aside from the person in question is buddies with the right people. There is also a lack of clear documentation on somethings can leave aspects of work up for interpretation and cause in office conflicts on how something should be done. Lately (this was definitely not always the case) employee concerns appear to be brushed off. When the company was smaller it was a very tight knit group with a lot of collaboration, more recently however its more of a ""Do it my way or get out of my way"" mentality which I firmly believe is seriously hurting the company.  There also seems to be a constant flux in HR systems and insurance which can be a real pain in the butt. Lastly, and this is speculation based on my own personal experiences and those of my close coworkers, you can easily work yourself into a point where you can change jobs, causing you to be stuck in a role and preventing you from growing out of it."

72,Pax8,Growing Company,2020-01-13,4.0,Cloud Solutions Advisor,"Great Benefits (health/401k matching/stock options). They train the hell out of you and offer continued/ongoing education on the job. They TRULY hire from within and most people who work here are from referrals. Fun people and environment - they try hard to have fun (beer, nitro coffee & kombucha on tap, ping pong, bouldering wall in the office etc). The culture is fun - but changing daily.",Kind of Bro/Frat culture inherent. Need more diversity.
73,Pax8,Keep Moving Forward,2020-02-20,4.0,Sales Executive,"Incredible people, Regional Managers and HR that genuinely care about you and work with empathy to make sure you feel supported.
New structure for the sales team is on the way and will really help alleviate some of the pressure from the CSAs/CSCs roles.
Fully paid premiums on insurance, pet insurance, unlimited PTO and most managers actually understand the importance of occasional mental health days!
Fun events, great holiday party, and most teams have bonding events monthly so newbies can feel included right away.","-The ramp period is 3 months but don't expect anything to ""click"" until about 6 months in. An overhaul of the training program would be the best way to change this lag time. A better mix of shadowing and sitting with peers on what the job actually is vs hours of sitting in a classroom would be a good start. 
-38k is not and has not been a livable wage in Colorado for a while now. Yes you make commission and it is uncapped, but you won't the first few months on the job. The jump from CSA 1 to CSA 2 is a full 10k difference. You're required to have more experience than a CGS to be a CSA 1, but you make the exact same base pay. 
-Can feel like you don't have real direction in between training and being independent on the sales floor
-Was told pretty frequently that ""if you really want this"" or ""actually want to succeed"" to spend a lot of time at home studying on my own. It is always smart to learn about a new industry on your own time, but it should never determine if you sink or swim in your position as your training should enable you to succeed."
74,Pax8,Disappointing,2019-08-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pax8 is a fun environment - beers & kombucha on tap, snacks, scooters, ping pong, super ""bros club"" hipster vibe. It's pretty much every millennial's dream work environment to a T.","There are some amazing people who work at Pax8, but the handful of awesome people do not make up for the others. Pax8 chooses quantity over quality and it shows by the mass amounts of people they hire and the churn. You are valued as a number rather than a person. They paint a picture of a fun hip company with a lot of room and potential for rapid growth and that is how they justify underpaying their employees. -Unless of course you know someone, Pax8 is all about nepotism and is quick to hire, pay, and promote those that are in their circle. 
There is a significant lack of transparency from management and absolutely no accountability from their managers or HR. HR is virtually non-existent and has no authority. Because of this, the organization lacks ethical leadership, unity and collaboration. The company does not value honesty or integrity, and it's pretty unbelievable how often management looks away at dishonesty. On multiple occasions I personally witnessed unethical business practices endorsed at a high level."
75,Pax8,"Jump Ship. Don't Go Down With the ""Captains""",2019-10-21,1.0,Non-sales,"Anyone who is not in a management or ""leadership"" position is great! Unlimited PTO.","You see all the great Built in Colorado articles about this place, and you think it's going to be great, until you're there. The novelty of Pax8 wears off very quickly, the blinders come off shortly after walking in the place, and after a few weeks you see this place for what it really is. Toxic. The nature of the reviews are quite indicative of this.  It's quite telling how after a few bad, but honest reviews, the page is then flooded with very short and to the point ""good"" reviews. Makes one wonder if people were enticed, or god forbid, threatened, to post more positive reviews. After dealing with much of the leadership here, I wouldn't put it past them, and would suggest both those options are true. It's really quite sad."
76,Pax8,"Great culture, fast pace, lots of opportunities to make an impact",2019-08-26,5.0,Other,"The culture, the non-political nature of executive management, the friendly atmosphere, the ability to get things done (low/no bureaucracy), the budget to buy tools/technology and invest in people, the fast pace, the opportunities to advance/grow.","At 350+ employees, there are some areas that need more structure (without adding bureaucracy).  To scale and grow, there are some areas that could be improved - better communications, documented job descriptions, clear promotion criteria, focus on other department's needs (not just Sales)."
77,Pax8,Amazing Culture,2019-08-29,5.0,Sales,"Great culture, amazing people and lots of opportunity. Recently gave shares to all employees at their year mark. The team runs fast but seems to really care about the employees. Take time each month to give ""props"" to all the different departments. The opportunity to move up quickly and get promoted is real.",Hyper growth can lead to growing pains but we fail fast and correct things even faster.
78,Pax8,"The ship has sailed, or it's sinking, or...",2019-08-28,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Great people! Some truly brilliant minds.  Unlimited PTO is nice.  Did I mention the people?,"Where to start?  If someone were to ask me to briefly describe Pax8, I would compare it to the Hindenburg.  Full of allure and promise.  That is until the very moment, it came down in a fiery spectacle, to the horror of those that were present to witness it.  Before the scooters and interesting choice of colors for walls, this was ""THEE"" place to be.  There was a real sense of family and belonging.  Somewhere along the line, family and belonging (the essence of the true culture) took a backseat to the money machine (Sales).  I get it.  It's all about revenue, but, at what costs?  

The genuine talent / skill one brings to the table isn't valued nearly as much as, how many seats of Nth SaaS product a sales rep can land.  Sales seems to be the only department the members at the top of the food-chain focus on.  All promotions are primarily within sales.  The budget seems to end up with Sales.  All the love. You guessed it- Sales.  This is especially evident when sitting through the monthly All-Hands meeting, which is just sales and marketing blowing smoke for two hours.

Don't think you can bring your thoughts and ideas to anyone.  They'll mostly fall on deaf ears.  With the exception of a few members of the executive staff, no one really seems to care.  HR has no foothold within the organization.  The ladies that make up the department are absolutely lovely people.  I mean that sincerely.  However, practically everyone walks all over them.  Observing interactions between HR staff and Execs. harkens back to the era of the 40's and 50's.  These women aren't respected.

Back to the people.  They are for certain the shining light at heaven’s gate.  Pax8 is bustling at the brim with talented individuals.  Where this organization falls short is, they don't recognize 90% of them for being exceptional and going above and beyond.  Actually, that's false.  As of late, you come to work and do an amazing job, they can you!  Everyone is wondering if they are next on the chopping block.  Unfortunately, there also doesn't seem to be a reason for why so many talented individuals have been let go.  Employees aren't given any incentive to give their best, so, some look elsewhere.  Others are still hanging on to some promise that will never be delivered.  

Should you have any desire to move up at Pax8, make sure you're a member of the Club.  It's more like a fraternity/sorority house and, if you shy away from cliques, or Bro culture, polish up that résumé.  They don't take lightly to any challenging of their methodologies.  You're paid to be a drone, not to think.  Anyone up for this?  Assimilate if you so choose.  

There has been tremendous growth within the company.  At 350+ employees and bringing on 25 - 30 additionally every other month, it's no wonder things often fall between the cracks.  Or maybe it's simply the lack of communication between departments, Executives, everyone.  The CEO is an uncannily brilliant man.  Sadly, it appears as though he is often blindsided by some of the happenings within his company.  Hopefully, he can manage to get things reined in."
79,Pax8,Great company,2019-10-14,5.0,Software Engineer,Great engineering team. I enjoy the leadership. Open door policy works. Nice benefits.,As engineering team we were tossed around every time a new office location would come up
80,Pax8,"Good from far, yet far from good",2019-08-23,2.0,Non-sales,"Most of the people in non ""leadership"" positions are great. Potential career growth, but it solely depends on your department and manager.","Pax8 is a place where tenure outweighs experience, where niceties outweigh honesty and good decision making, and above all, where nepotism reigns supreme. Much of the leadership is made up of people who move their way through the ranks, which is good, but also faulty in its own way, as there is not much outside perspective brought into what is becoming a stagnant environment. The leaders who did not rise from within are friends of the others, previous coworkers, etc. Jobs handed out to those close, whose experience may not match exactly what is needed. Both these factors lead to wildly ineffectual leadership that has left many departments, some necessary to the day-to-day of the company, floundering, where good ideas die at their inception and ego reigns above everything. There is an air of that ""good ol' boys"" mentality that is palpable, and you better fall in line, nod your head, and say yes. Any challenge to the existing paradigm is seen as a threat, a threat to the only way leadership knows how to conduct the business, and a major threat to their egos. Good people are forced out, without a proper explanation, due to challenging the status quo, to asking questions, saying no to awful ideas, and more often than not, damaging someone in a position of ""powers"" ego. There is never a good explanation as to why good people are forced out, but the answer is there when someone's ""friend"" or one of the ""yes"" people is moved into the vacant position. There's only one word for it. Cyclical.

And the Chief People Officer will inevitably respond to this review, claiming ignorance, innocence, ambivalence, etc. But frankly, she is the worst offender of it all. While simultaneously destroying the ""culture."""

86,Pax8,More cult than culture,2019-08-26,1.0,Sales,"You could make 6 figures without really selling anything and there was a simple formula for success!  Shamelessly ingratiate yourself with the self-congratulatory, self-promoting Sales and Marketing leadership charlatans who relentlessly perpetuated a good story about “blowing up” and “disrupting” the industry by sycophantically liking and sharing every social media post they produced.  Flattery and imitation could get you everywhere it seemed.  Don’t forget to throw out “props” to everyone else around the company for basically doing their jobs.  Everyone and everything are “Awesome!”
To achieve your quota, you simply needed to be a good storyteller and convince new partners, who are in many cases already buying and using what you are selling, to buy it from you instead of somewhere else by offering them a cheaper price.  It’s sort of like reselling discounted Netflix or Spotify subscriptions and then making the grandiose claim that you are disrupting the entire streaming media industry because customers can now buy both services from your website instead.  But there is a catch, if they had a problem with either service, your partner would call you for help because they can no longer call Netflix or Spotify directly.  Don’t worry though, you could pass on those problems to others around the company so you could continue your storytelling and earn cash!  Cast your skepticism aside, and potentially your ethics, and you could do very well!","There were too many sales and marketing bro’s with pretty boy man buns who evidently believed that office administrators were there to be their mothers by cleaning up their messes in the kitchen and ordering their lunch deliveries.  Narcissism and immaturity were rampant. The pretentiousness and posturing at all levels could be nauseating at times.  You had to be very careful not to express your own thoughts or opinions or you will be shunned as a heretic.  If your working style and habits didn’t imitate the practices of the Anointed ones, IE; including the incessant use of whiteboards to “visualize” your thoughts, multicolored sticky notes arranged in columns to track your “To Do” and “Doing” tasks, etc., then you simply did not fit in.  Make your whiteboard renderings as busy and complicated looking as possible and leave them up for everyone to see.  It would make you appear smarter.  As for those tasks on sticky notes, the more the better.  They too will make you look more important and busier than everyone else.  Attend every meeting you are invited to and be sure to bring your laptop so that you can work on other things during the meeting.  Ask a question or two so that you can appear to be engaged while not really listening, then you can continue to safely pound away at your keyboard answering emails."

The company is gaining momentum in the market and bringing on new products so it is a great time to get in with a lot of upside.","Still figuring out some processes and procedures, but that is to be expected in a fast growing company. You should have previous technology experience because the products aren’t easy to learn. You also have to put in the hours if you want to be successful.

Disorganized and confused middle managers who don’t have much experience or any direction from executives.  Job roles & responsibilities change so frequently.  You can’t have a career path if you can’t see passed the next few months.  The best path for advancement is to become someones favorite.  Lots of extravagant offices and perks for VP’s and above and tons of money being spent, but 401k matching for the rank and file promised months ago never happened (its a ""paperwork"" problem).  Still haven’t found or seen the “culture” thats talked about all the time.  Company meetings are all about sales and marketing people talking about how great they are.

Watching the organization consistently hit goals month over month is fun and creates an exciting workplace as employees celebrate the monthly successes. The growth also helps to create tons of new jobs, for both new candidates and internal candidates alike. There is plenty of mobility within Pax8 and those who want to work hard can move up quickly. Most of the executive staff, especially the C-level employees, are brilliant, interesting people who take a genuine interest in the lives of their employees and the employee satisfaction and morale across the company.","One of the biggest downfalls is the lack of training. There is training for sales and other new hires during onboarding, but that seems to be where it ends. Because the company is growing so quickly, employees are often promoted to a manager or director level with ZERO guidance or training on how to be a successful manager and represent the company. This is contributing to employee turnover and it needs to be said over and over again that being good at your job does not translate directly into being a good manager. The company has a whole group supposedly dedicated to training but I have found their delivery to be seriously lacking. 
Another con - if you're not in sales or marketing, prepare to feel like you're basically invisible. Be ready to sit through monthly meetings praising the same people over and over for basically doing their job (i.e. attending marketing shows, hitting sales quota, etc). All other groups are pretty well left out of company recognition or special events to celebrate success. 
Constantly changing initiatives make it hard to have a clear direction and focus at times. By trying to do too much at once, everyone gets overwhelmed and things start falling through the cracks."

My first month out of training I was the top of my training class with the most completed appointments.  I started having health issue and because of this I required more time off. I have never had to request so much time off in my entire work career. Because of this I could feel the resentment from my manager and our relationship went down hill from there. .Whenever I asked my manager about going to the doctor he would make me feel bad for something that was completely out of my control. To add,  I went on a 7 week streak only reaching a few people due to vacation and holidays.  To combat this I was meeting with several senior reps and doing cold calls with them, calling from my cell phone, calling different leads every day, doing my own research. On top of this I was making 80+ call a day. My manager never offered to help me in those 7 weeks or warned me that my job was in jeopardy. I understand where the resentment came from, I had resentment for my own situation. 
The atmosphere reminds me of a frat house, just to give you an idea we had several kegs in our lunch room.For most this would be a pro, however, it makes for a very unprofessional environment.

Also the leads were not great. I was in the Mountain region and because we have very few shows, resulting in fewer hot leads as the other regions. We ended up getting new leads, however, they did not qualify for our program and/or the contact information was wrong. This made it extremely frustrating trying to do your job. 

If you are in recovery or are used to dealing with a more professional atmosphere I would look elsewhere. I wanted this to be the job I would retire at, but it wasn't the right fit.  I'm not perfect ,I have a part in this as well. I wish things could have panned out differently."
