Great/competitive base pay and amazing amazing amazing culture! Product is A+!,Commission structure could be a bit better to compensate more
1,Popmenu,We are in the good-ole-days,2022-02-15,5.0,Senior Product Manager,"I’ve worked at several companies over the last 10 years including a couple of Fortune 500 companies. None of those compare to my experience at Popmenu. It’s a very supporting environment where people simply want to do the best they can and get 1% better each day. From the leadership I haven’t experienced any harsh mandates or high pressure, which I believe is why our output is so high. Employees enjoy coming into work, they feel like they are making a difference, and they feel appreciated. I’ve worked on teams at other companies where leaders habitually lead with fear which ultimately eroded the morale, leading to less output, and employees that simply didn’t want to put in the effort. That’s not the case here. The leadership team at Popmenu gets it. 

When you think of the good-ole-startup-days of larger tech companies, I can’t help but think we are currently living in those times right now at Popmenu.","Nothing. It’s still a start-up-like environment. Not all roads are paved, so if you are an entrepreneurial type you will thrive here."
2,Popmenu,Best company I have ever worked for,2022-02-16,5.0,Client Support Specialist,"They are incredibly inclusive and welcome any type of person from any background. Upper management helps me get through the insecurities I have with being in a new position by teaching me new things and giving positive feedback. They always want for you to be better (for yourself not just for the company) and aim high with your ambitions in and outside the company, even offering career advice if you decide you want to leave. The community is incredible because even though I work from home, I still feel included. They're constantly reevaluating the benefits they offer to make sure that they are accommodating all of your needs (they recently added a pet insurance policy *mind blown*). The company ethos say it all, honestly. RAISE THE BAR! and they truly have.",Honestly can't think of any
3,Popmenu,Dedicated to A Sustainable Culture of Inclsuion and Growth,2022-02-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Popmenu is one of the only companies I've worked for where D&I doesn't feel like a box that they're checking off. Leadership is deliberate and intentional about each decision they make, and the transparency is always there - across the entire business. Popmenu regularly consults with employees across all teams for feedback, and thougtfully and promptly acts on that feedback. Your acheivements - no matter how small they seem - are celebrated and recognized. This adds to the pride employees feel about working for a company that is truly making a difference, and the feeling that your contributions big or small are helping make that difference.",None that come to mind
4,Popmenu,NOT SOUR GRAPES,2022-02-02,2.0,Account Executive,"Decent salary, and pay structure, commission ,bonus.","Beware this company if you are over 50! They profess a diversified culture that there was very little evidence of practice. It's a start-up with a lot of $$$$'s backing, with a bunch of people that are still trying to figure out what they are suppose to be doing. So coming in as a newbie was totally confusing, not to mention if you asked questions and they were not what higher ups wanted to hear or address...... Well lets just say you were perceived as someone who was"" not the right fit""... Sadly there were actually times I felt... BULLIED, by management and peers"
5,Popmenu,A culture of growth and support,2022-01-28,5.0,Account Executive,"Jobs where you can grow are hard, otherwise we wouldn't get paid and we wouldn't grow. Popmenu creates and fosters a community that is aware of these truths. There are more levels of support in this organization than any company I have ever worked in, start up or fortune 500.",There is a lot of self learning in this role and if you are not constantly learning and adapting you will find that the job is harder than it needs to be.
6,Popmenu,Purpose-driven company with great opportunities and the nicest people on the planet,2021-11-09,5.0,Head of Communications,"Why do I love Popmenu? How much time do you have?
*It's a company that is just as passionate about making a difference for its employees as it is about making a difference for its restaurant clients. *Kindness is core to how the company operates at every level within the organization (it literally says no jerks allowed in the company values). People genuinely celebrate each other's accomplishments and are quick to offer a helping hand. 
*Innovation occurs every single day here. The company is a top innovator in restaurant tech with an unmatched solution suite that is helping over 6,000 restaurants.
*Popmenu is growing by leaps and bounds. Compensation and benefits are competitive and there are amazing learning and career advancement opportunities.
*Popmenu is committed to DE&I. It's not about checking a box. The company embraces differences and strives to create an environment where every employee is supported and empowered to be their authentic self.","When a company is experiencing explosive growth, exciting new opportunities will keep coming. We'll continue to work as a team on identifying and managing the biggest priorities."

8,Popmenu,"Fair, transparent, and exciting!",2021-10-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Genuine culture: On a daily basis you can see team members living Popmenu's core values which is unique. I've seen so many companies talking about their values, but they make an insane effort to make sure it's real
- Business at eye level: There is a genuine desire of the leadership team to do right by our customers and their people - whether it's improving benefits or ensuring that compensation is fair and in line with the market
- Career growth: You see promotions coming through on a regular basis - both team members growing in their current role and making lateral moves into other departments
- Transparency and ownership: Employees are always kept in the loop about what's going on in the company, the market, or the investment community","- Intensity: It's a start-up and you get the chance to have a stake in the company's success... so if you are looking for a laid back role, you might better look at larger companies
- Growing pains: There are many processes and systems to be figured out. It's on the right trajectory, but you have to roll with the punches"

Wins are shared and celebrated all the time. Consistently feel like I am making a difference in the lives of our clients!,Not necessarily a con but it is a startup so sometimes priorities and focus can change quickly.

12,Popmenu,Amazing company that values and empowers their employees!,2021-12-08,5.0,Associate Recruiter,"I was recently hired on by PopMenu and after just one week, I already have a hundred good things to say. I wasn’t looking for a new position when this opportunity presented itself, but after speaking with one of the recruiters, I knew I would be making a mistake if I didn’t at least interview.

The interview process was more in depth than others I’ve had, which I appreciated because they wanted to learn more about me than just my experience. They were very informative throughout the process, making sure any and all of my questions were answered, and they were able to speak to the parts of PopMenu that go beyond standard information. I really appreciated how transparent everyone was, especially in regard to the company culture. The values are genuinely represented and practiced in day-to-day operations and interactions. 

This is the environment that allows people to learn, grow, and be successful while being supported through it all. Though I haven’t had the chance to meet every employee, my managers and team are absolutely amazing. The flow of communication is pretty seamless, and everyone is on the same page. We make decisions collectively so everyone has a voice, and every voice matters. You’re given new challenges to develop your skills and strengths. Efforts and successes are recognized, no matter how big or small.

I have never felt so welcomed and appreciated within a company before. We’re at the start of something great, and I cannot wait for what’s to come.","I cannot think of a single bad thing to note about PopMenu. Everyone is given the floor to address any issues they’re running into, daily, and solutions are always found. This truly is an amazing company."
13,Popmenu,Amazing Place to Make a Difference,2021-10-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Leadership truly believes in the power of the individual employee...I feel empowered every day to make decisions that will impact the business. There is a great level of trust not only within my team, but also across different teams. 
-Employees care about the work they do, and it shows through every day interactions
-You are working with a freaking sweet product everyday that is making a difference in over 6k restaurants...it's hard to not get fired up about that!","None for me!! I am truly grateful to say I love what I do! 

-I personally don't see this as a con, but you have to be able to think on your own and make decisions when needed to be successful, there is not a ton of handholding. It's an environment where everyone takes responsibility for their actions!"
14,Popmenu,Popmenu Company culture,2021-06-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Popmenu is a fast growing tech company and has nearly doubled in size since I started 8 months ago. The leadership team and founders put a lot of emphasis on company culture and do a great job at it. 

Their communication is transparent, managers are supportive and they do a great job at celebrating wins and acknowledging employees. It’s truly something unique to see a company not only talk the talk when it comes to creating an amazing culture but the also walk the walk and do everything to build a great company culture.","The only con I have is that the maternity leave is only 1 month. I know this is what’s common in the US but too me, this is insane. 
I know Popmenu is a startup and cannot provide all the best benefits to their employees as other bigger companies can but I also know that the founders care about their employees so as the company grows and gets more resources I truly hope that they can provide better benefits for new parents. 

Besides that, this is the first job I have ever had where I do not have any other cons. This place is really unique and I couldn’t be more proud to be apart of the team."
15,Popmenu,"Underpaid, Overworked",2022-01-14,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Remote work environment. Super friendly people at the company, most of them easy to work with and willing to help.","Pay was far below industry average and workload was overwhelming. Not nearly enough resources provided by leadership for us to do our jobs effectively. Onboarding and training was pretty much non-existent. Hopefully things are changing as the company grows, but would definitely not recommend based on my experience."
16,Popmenu,Amazing Place to Work!!,2021-11-05,5.0,Web Designer,"Popmenu is an incredible company to work for and with! The culture and environment at Popmenu are welcoming, inclusive, and supportive. We are truly a team as a whole.

Successes are celebrated together and support is around every corner. I've never loved a job more. You are supported and encouraged by not just your manager but all the way to the owners. A wonderful company with great values, supports its employees, and truly believes in its product and what it can do for the restaurant industry.","As a start-up, you have crazy days and quiet days, but nothing you can't handle, and expectations have never been unreasonable."

19,Popmenu,So far so GREAT,2021-09-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"So far this place is great. Everyone is nice and helpful with positive attitudes all around. I’m my role specifically I have the autonomy to get my work done at my own pace. My quality of life is at an all time high! And because of that I want to work that much harder to take care of my company. 

Everyone here works hard to make the lives of restaurant owners and employees easier, all while increasing their online strategy and business. This company actually listens to mom & pop restaurants and focuses on delivering what they need to be successful.",None so far but I’ll update if that changes.

21,Popmenu,Great place to be creative and think outside the box!,2021-06-08,5.0,Talent Team,"- Empowered to be creative & think outside of the box - raising the bar from standard recruiting norms 

-All teams are open and excited to collaborate together & cross-departmentally 

- A lot of transparency within the company & open communication - monthly updates to everyone on sales progress, product developments, team growth, marketing, industry updates, etc.

- Your ideas are heard, accepted & appreciated. Not frowned upon to challenge an idea or share opinions

-Every person in the company has a direct impact not the business and it honestly shows. People hired are contributing RIGHT away, we see it in the numbers and in culture. The organization depends on the talent team to hire the best talent to help us achieve our goals - it's rewarding to see and feel the impact we have every day","- There's a LOT of work to be done, across all teams to support growth. Work-life balance can be challenging when trying to keep up - but we're proactively building the talent team (and all teams) to manage this -- but it's also a start up in HYPER growth mode - so we all know what we signed up for by joining 

-I honestly can't think of anything else"
22,Popmenu,Incredible Place to Work.,2021-08-09,5.0,Sales Account Executive,"I've worked at quite a few restaurant tech startups and Popmenu blows them all out of the water. Leadership is thoughtful, present, accessible, and all HIGHLY qualified to get you where you need to be. In sales roles, a lot of times it's sink or swim, which there is to an extent here but they are here to throw you a lifejacket if you sink and not fire you. 
*Creative freedom to make sales
*Flexible hours
*NO MICROMANAGING AT ALL
*Equity
*Pay is great
*Great benefits","Training was a bit underwhelming but they are aware and are fixing that.
This is both a pro and con, but you need to be disciplined. You are self guided and given A LOT of freedom. It works great for me, but if you struggle with discipline, it may not be the place for you."
23,Popmenu,I'm not going anywhere,2021-11-08,5.0,Sales,"I've never been a part of such an all inclusive company. I don't say that by only the hiring standards, but the fact that everyone is a Family and there's no task to little or too big. Everyone performs, pushes and encourages the person next to them. High Paced and Exciting","If I had one, I'd list it....but if my biggest complaint is the traffic during my commute.... I'm in great shape!"
24,Popmenu,1 month in - feeling like family - poised for growth,2021-08-09,5.0,Account Executive,"The amount of talent at this company is incredible. From leadership to brand new employees, the team is welcoming, smart as hell, and ready to make a big splash in the restaurant tech space. Super transparent about direction and health of the company.

Popmenu cares for it's employees, frequently conducting anonymous surveys to see where they can improve. 
Recognizes outstanding performance from team members every month on our all hands call, 4 employees of the month every month - coworkers nominate each other, management doesn't choose.
Every employee shows up everyday ready to work hard and collaborate so that we can see Popmenu beat our goals.",Since it is a growing startup you can sometimes feel like you have the workload of 2-3 people.

32,Popmenu,Unlike any other,2021-04-19,5.0,Junior Marketing Specialist,"Popmenu provides a fast-paced independent work environment, with ample room for growth and career development. The management cares about your personal track, and often we are encouraged to completely own our workflows. While no work environment is perfect, Popmenu works diligently to eliminate the useless banter of a typical office environment, opting in for a judgement based on results rather than how long you're logged in or in the office.","The job requires a lot of independence, and you have to be ready to own your workflows, whether it's a success or a failure. If you're looking for a place that has pre-defined tasks and a manager who will always tell you what you need to do next, this is not the environment for you."
33,Popmenu,"Cold call all day, no good leads",2021-06-29,3.0,Account Executive,"-Startups can be exciting in general
-Work remotely
-Well-intentioned coworkers who communicate and help eachother out
-Hopefully you can truly help some restaurants that need a better website","-Not a competitive base salary
-Warm leads are far and few between, and not good quality. Spend all day coldcalling and emailing dozens of restaurants; thousands in a month.
-Training is just a few hours
-No employee handbook, vague HR policies. Be careful of 'unlimited PTO' - it is not defined, and sometimes means NO PTO."

2. We are always cheering each other on and everyones efforts and achievements are recognized and celebrated.

3. Fast paced environment where you get to see your impacts right away - never a dull moment!

4. As a start up employee you get to flex your entrepreneurial spirit.

5. You get to be a part of a team that is building a product that is truly making a difference in the restaurant scene. The fact that we've helped small restaurants owners stay in business during COVID is so rewarding. 

6. Working remote and flexible schedules. Management cares more about results versus time spent at your desk. We also have an office for any Atlanta based folks","1. Not a con per se, but if you prefer a work environment where things are 100% clearly defined you might not be happy here. At times we are building the plan while we are flying it. I'm all about the fast pace, occasional craziness that comes with a startup but it's not everyone's cup of tea."

I truly believe we make a clear and tangible impact on the restaurant industry every. single. day.","We are building the plane while we fly it—that sometimes means longer hours and less certainty than a typical 9-5.

- Intersting product
- Great teamates","- Hired a VP for the first time that made the work culture very toxic. 
- Any mistake he intimidates you with performance escalations.

- Company (I think due to his VP) is trying to get rid of a lot of people and replace them with ""all stars""."
38,Popmenu,Great company culture,2021-06-30,5.0,Account Executive,The company culture is what I relate to starting at a new restaurant. Everyone has the same goal in mind with agility to make changes on the fly that fit both customer and employee needs.,No cons to working at Popmenu

The product is very polished and very well built. The product, development and design teams move very quickly, rapidly expanding the product to fill the needs of the clients. This fast pace, however, does not result in a diminished product, the team is only ever satisfied with the best and what works.

54,Popmenu,"Great product, terrible management!",2020-02-24,1.0,Account Executive,Amazing new tech for the restaurant industry!,"Was let go in less than a month without reason! Sorry, the reason I was given after turning down other offers and taking a large pay cut with a start-up new to the market was she could just tell that I wasn't going to be happy here so she let me go before I quit in 6 months!  There was no training on almost anything and any training that was scheduled always got canceled due to the manager having something come up. I openly shared concerns about how territory and accounts were handled having worked for start-ups before and also launching several new products in the market.  I was told this was one of the reasons I was brought on board, but it pretty clear it was for my connections in the marketplace. After I introduced them to 2 large restaurant groups and third place where I knew ownership and was left out of the meeting because the meeting was set by her after I gave her the contact. I tried being professional and reach out to the owner and let him know what was going on and try to save my job because I believed in him and the product. He told me he would be happy to speak to me and scheduled a time for the next day. I called and sent a text and haven't heard from anyone since."

Genuinely love the people I work with and new ideas and feedback are always welcomed with open arms.
