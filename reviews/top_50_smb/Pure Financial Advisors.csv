This leads me to believe that the company cares for our job security and is focused on continuous improvement.","As I started my job, I had to invest longer hours to dive deep into my tasks and be successful.

73,Pure Financial Advisors,Growing company with a lot of opportunities,2019-08-27,4.0,Accounting Associate,"Growth has been pretty rapid over the past year or so, and it’s resulted in great changes for employees. There have been more resources for the company to make our jobs better, more opportunities for promotions and raises, and more high-tier clients to work with. It’s definitely been a winning situation for everybody who works there, especially the people who work hard (like me). This is definitely a good time to apply.",We work hard and your status in the company is determined by results. You can’t just skate by on the success of the company.
74,Pure Financial Advisors,Rewarding Environment,2017-05-23,5.0,,"Pure is providing services to the mass affluent that they desperately need.  From tax/financial planning to investment management the company is putting the clients' interests first.  Being a part of this innovative fast-growing company has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.  I feel like I am helping more and more families every day achieve their long term goals.  I have found that it is not easy to provide this level of service and is in fact very challenging.  In my opinion the employees who truly believe in the value comprehensive financial planning are the ones who thrive.  Pay is competitive and there is an entire marketing effort that brings qualified leads to advisors.   I love the team structure and there is a ton of opportunity to review your proposed strategies with different professionals (CFA's, CPA's, CFP's) within the firm.",There is a bit of a learning curve for new employees to truly grasp all the strategies the company provides to their clients.  That combined with the ramp-up time it takes for new advisors to build a book of relationships seems like it could be discouraging to the uncommitted.  It doesn't seem like there is any way to fake it here as the clients' interests are always put first.
75,Pure Financial Advisors,Great Place to Work,2018-05-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- 100% client focused. I've worked at a couple of different firms throughout my career, and I can thankfully say that they have all valued the clients they have, but Pure Financial takes it a step further. Most firms won't even speak to certain people unless they have a minimum amount of money to work with, but Pure's approach offers planning to anyone that needs it regardless of how much they have. 

- Systems are amazing. Virtually anything you can think of has a process and a system in place which streamlines workflow and reduces many issues that can inevitably result from people not following a similar process. This makes your job much easier and the client experience much more enjoyable.

- Management is top notch. Unlike the other employee that said management was poor, it's quite the opposite. In fact, our CFO was just chosen by the San Diego Business Journal as the 2018 CFO of the Year for a Medium Privately Held Company. I've never worked at a company who's management takes as much time out of their day to do training and aid their staff's efforts in reaching their goals.","This is hard to think of, but being that we are an organization that is growing quickly, we sometimes experience the growing pains. It's a major effort of our firm to branch out to new locations and continually hire more people to the team. As with any organization, this can bring expected challenges. Thankfully management does a great job in working through the growing pains."
76,Pure Financial Advisors,"Great Company, Amazing Team and Great Job Opportunity",2017-05-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pure Financial is an amazing company to work for. Pure Financial was created to provide our clients unbasis and holistic financial planning.  There are not many firms out there  that provide this level of financial planning.  It is great to work for a company where I feel I am part of a team and my ideas are heard.  As a growing company there is a tremendous amount of opportunity at Pure.  The President has been instrumental in my growth at the company and being my mentor.  He has the biggest heart for  all of the employees.   He has given his heart and soul to the company.  As a mentor, he always see the best in his employees and has them see for themselves what is possible by continually motivating them to fulfill on their full potential.","Like other growing companies, technology"
77,Pure Financial Advisors,Great Environment,2018-01-22,5.0,CFP,"The firm's marketing efforts are excellent, allowing employees to focus on servicing clients. The fee only environment eliminates conflicts and ensures employees are able to provide unbiased advice.  Company growth is impressive with several recent hires. Management has designed a very specific and effective process that is a win/win for the firm, employees and clients. The firm is actually doing real financial planning.","There may be a learning curve for those coming from areas of the industry not primarily focused on financial planning.  (The firm's focus on taxes is likely greater than at most firms specializing exclusively in asset management, for example.)"
78,Pure Financial Advisors,Best company I've ever worked for,2019-02-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The goals and objectives for each employee, and for the company on the whole, are very clear - we have direction and purpose. The work I do is valued by my supervisors and colleagues. The compensation is competitive and the benefits are excellent.  Importantly, the company and the people are honest and trustworthy in an industry that struggles with trust.","With Pure's relentless drive for growth, there is an expectation for everyone to put in long, stressful hours. It's easy for work-life balance to become unbalanced."
79,Pure Financial Advisors,Truly Exceptional Company - Thankful,2017-05-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Management is extremely motivated to grow this company. There is an atmosphere of family, unity, encouragement, friendship, loyalty, and Yes, Very Hard Work! If you are not willing to work hard, Do Not Apply. Please be leery of reviews that talk about the negative atmosphere - please take into account the reviewer. Possibly they were unable or unwilling to put in the effort expected. However, no company is perfect for everyone. No one is perfect. No manager or executive is going to make perfect decisions. This is because they are all HUMAN! But what I can say is that the goal of the executive team is to succeed. For ALL to succeed. They never expect more out of their employees than they give of themselves. We work hard and we play hard. I'm so very thankful to be a part of this truly exceptional company. Our president is a strong man with a huge heart. He works harder than ANYONE I've ever worked for or with! He wants the company to succeed and he wants his employees to succeed. Joe is a man of integrity and loyalty. He has a kind heart and wants the best for everyone.  If you are reading this review to find out about this company, please be aware of those who no longer work here. Yes, they may have some valuable comments, but there is a reason why people are let go or quit. It is not always because a company is 'Bad' but rather because the person couldn't handle the workload. Which is not necessarily a fault, just a fact. We value integrity and honesty.","The work load may seem difficult for the inexperienced, however Joe fosters a progressive learning environment .  His goal it to help each employee reach their personal and professional full potential."

I'm always working with the latest tools and software and they make sure everyone is happy in terms of bonuses, vacations, workload etc. It makes the day to day experience very enjoyable and a lot more satisfying knowing that my bosses have my back.",I'd prefer to work solo more often instead of in team environments.
81,Pure Financial Advisors,Our client focus is refreshing,2018-05-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Without doubt, this is the most client-focused firm I have ever worked with.

83,Pure Financial Advisors,Working for Pure has been an overwhelmingly positive experience,2019-05-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Fair pay, solid benefits and the work itself is pretty straightforward for the most part. The most important part to me though is that I have great relationships with all of my managers. I've had jobs before where management made everyday a hassle, so it feels good knowing my manager st Pure are around to support me and that I can rely on them when needed.",No complaints. No cons for me.
84,Pure Financial Advisors,Honest and ethical firm!,2018-08-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Our #1 priority is our client's satisfaction, not the company's profit, so we are actually told to make decisions that might cost us more money if it means the client is happy and will do return business with us. It's a refreshing experience in an industry where so many people are ordered by their superiors to cut corners for the company's profit.",Deadlines are the worst here.
