0,Quantum Metric,Interview at Quantum Metric,2022-04-01,5.0,Senior Recruiter,". Fast moving interview process
. Everyone is passionate about working there. I really bought into the people.
. Great culture",None that I can think of
1,Quantum Metric,Great company in a growth stage,2022-03-23,5.0,Marketing Team,"-A lot of opportunities to own projects.
-Great people. Seriously... I love working with everyone here.
-Success seems almost too easy for QM.
-Great culture. Remote work is the majority. They respect time outside of work hours. 
-VPs and C-level listens. They do a great job communicating what is going on, and what they are thinking about.
-Our CMO is easily the best CMO I've ever worked under. Efrat Ravid is world-class.","-Growth stage means a lot of projects flying everywhere. Organization is happening though, so I do think this aspect will be improved.
-We need an improvement on showing data-driven success for individuals.
-Not a whole lot of cons."
2,Quantum Metric,QM Culture,2022-03-23,5.0,Partner Delivery Manager,"#1 Company Objective, Happy People, Happy, Diverse Culture is at the core of every decision. We as employees are empowered and supported in our efforts to drive positive change.",Growing at a very rapid pace.
3,Quantum Metric,Love it here!,2022-03-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The people here at QM make it a special place to be! The remote onboarding experience was awesome!,No cons so far. Some typical start-up growing pains here and there.
4,Quantum Metric,"Lack of leadership, no vision & no defined goals",2021-12-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The product at QM is cool and useful.,"The leadership at this company is absolutely horrendous. They expect you to just 'know' what your goals for the future are, but do not help you build a career path. They do not enable their employees to be successful in their roles and often times do not even provide clear direction on deliverables. 

They also do not have a great remote policy. While everyone works remotely, they would like you to be working from a stationary set desk in your home which doesn't lend well to anyone who needs to travel for family or any other reason. They still very much operate as a start up (in the worst ways), by treating all employees different depending on if you're in the ""in crowd"", gossip is rampant, pay severely under market value for many roles, and they expect 150% of most employees because you'll ""be rewarded when we IPO"". Was told on a call once that it was EXPECTED I work 50 - 55 hours a week and not 40. 

They claim ""integrity"" as a core value, but they don't seem to live it as much as they preach it. They try to get you early on to buy into their way thinking, but in all reality its just a rouse so you don't question what is going on within the company."
5,Quantum Metric,A good company with a great vision and outstanding leadership,2021-10-01,5.0,Account Manager,"Quantum Metric is a really great organization because of one pretty simple reason. It knows who it is, where it wants to go (or be) and how to get there. That starts first with the people leading the charge, and so far, I have seen nothing but genuine care and excitement across the board for what QM is achieving and for what it is doing for its customers. 

Some additional pros:
- Customer centricity is in the blood of this organization, everything revolves around value and impact. 
- You are cared for and taken care of - the people here really want YOU to succeed more than anything else. 
- The product challenges you in ways that lead to growth. It's really very exciting and can do wonders in the hands of the right people. 
- Respect is in abundance. Both for your personal and professional needs.","As with any growing organization, nothing is set up perfectly. You need to be flexible and adjust how you do things which can be a bit of a pain. Not everything is codified or written out, sometimes you just need to go out and forge your own path (or process). 

Because most of the workforce is remote the benefits packages, while still pretty good, might leave you wanting if you're in a region dominated by one provider. But it's still comparable so keep that in mind as well."
6,Quantum Metric,Great Remote Startup,2022-02-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The majority of people here have good hearts and are well intentioned. The product is legit and the customers we're winning are a testament to the entire team. 

I've had no problems working remotely with my team, which spans across all US time zones. My manager is attentive to my needs and work aspirations.","As with any startup, there are natural growing pains: lack of role clarity, quick pivots, junior management."
7,Quantum Metric,"Seamless, transparent interview process",2022-01-20,5.0,Newly Hired,"From start to finish, the best interview process of my 16+ year career. The team was organized, communicative, and transparent on all subjects from the beginning (pros and cons alike). I was given the opportunity to meet with 7 people including leaders of other orgs with whom I'd collaborate, and ultimately the founder/CEO (he interviews everyone!). Despite several meetings to coordinate with busy schedules on both sides, things moved quickly which is always appreciated. Awesome job, Quantum team!",This is a review of the interview process- no cons. Can't wait to start!
8,Quantum Metric,Great Place to work,2022-02-23,5.0,Business Development Representative (BDR),"Great place to work, growing company with a vibrant CEO, and great perks!","Development path was not established until very late, confusion with the direction of certain sales teams."
9,Quantum Metric,Very weary of the near future,2022-01-19,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Most co workers are very friendly. Good grasp of the remote work lifestyle.,"The company only cares about an eventual IPO and they let you know about it. High level managers do not care about career growth for employees under them. Recently there has been a high turnover of employees and management ignores questions about it. I have seen fast food restaurants with less turn over.

Managers act like they are receptive to feedback, only to do nothing to address it."
10,Quantum Metric,Fantastic Company,2022-02-02,5.0,Senior Recruiter,"Great product, strong teams, leadership that is transparent - I'm very happy to be part of this company",None at this time - it's a great time to be part of QM

Great support from my immediate team, internal stakeholders, and executives as well. Positive atmosphere, innovation focused, and teamwork centric. It helps that our core pillars are Passion, Persistence and Integrity.","Aside from not being able to see my team face to face, nothing I can really think of. We do get to travel about oncer per quarter to get together, so that's nice."
17,Quantum Metric,I seriously love my job!,2021-07-31,5.0,SDR Manager,"Phenomenal growth, exceptional leadership who truly cares about you personally and professional, great product, well-funded, amazing culture, A+ players in all business units, tons of opportunity to grow your career. Everyone from marketing to recruiting to product are exceptional and it shows. The company really cares about their employees.","Extremely fast paced - can feel chaotic at times but I personally thrive in an environment that challenges me every day to be my absolute best. We work hard and play hard - everyone is on a shared mission. Personally, I don't feel like this is a con...if you aren't able to pivot and/or aren't a self-starter who shows initiative, you won't be happy here. If you want to work 5 hours a day and not push for excellence, you won't be happy here.

We expect a high level of passion, persistence and integrity, every single day."

19,Quantum Metric,Deceptive Culture,2021-12-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Plenty of incredibly smart, talented people
- Product is truly best in class","- Culture is very cult like. If you don't buy in completely (and I mean COMPLETELY) you will find it a difficult place to work
- Despite ""integrity"" being a core value, leadership is lacking in this department. They maneuver to get what they want at the workers expense and often to the detriment of the overall business objective
- Seems like they're churning through employees like crazy recently and when it was brought up to leadership they downplayed it like it was normal"
20,Quantum Metric,Exceeding my expectations,2021-11-09,5.0,Senior Account Manager,"Joining QM has exceeded my expectations! From the people to the product, to the customer's everyone is truly awesome! QM's core values aren't just something you read about but you see being demonstrated every day.

Product: so powerful and fun to use. Customers are constantly amazed and pumped to use quantum.",Vacation: the managers are extremely flexible but the overarching policy is more restrictive than most tech companies. Talks of unlimited time off is circling but no real moves have been made.
22,Quantum Metric,Great place to work!,2021-12-17,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"* good work life balance

They’re not a perfect fit for everyone, but if you’re the type of person who thrives in a startup environment (faster pace; less structure; more autonomy, learning, & opportunity), then QM is a great place to expand your career. If that’s your cup of tea, I can’t think of any downsides."
35,Quantum Metric,Worst Manager I Ever Had Was at QM,2021-04-08,1.0,Engineer,Many people love working here. Unfortunately I wasn't one of them.,"Like any workplace, your experience largely depends on how your manager treats you. There are many great and supportive managers here. Mine, on the other hand, was a combination of Cersei Lannister and Darth Vader who treated me like crap and also blatantly played favorites.

But wait, there's more!

Despite everyone's superficial friendliness, there are also some serious backstabbers who work here. Everyone is eager to get ahead. This means some people aren't above throwing coworkers under the bus and spreading ugly rumors to get an edge over others.

Some jobs have explosive career growth potential here. Some don't. If you're in the latter camp, you're pretty much SOL in some situations, unless you want to change careers.

The CEO tries to come off as caring but often comes off instead as creepy and culty with this all this ""I LOOOOOOVE YOU GUIZE, QUANTUM PEOPLE ARE MY FAMLEEE TOOOO"" phoniness that just makes you throw up in your mouth a little."
36,Quantum Metric,Working Parents - Check us out!,2021-06-23,5.0,Contract Manager,"Flexible, remote, positive vibes, hard workers, company values are truly reinforced in the culture. Kids pop in and out of Zoom meetings and it's no hit to your professional persona.",Not ideal if you are not comfortable working independently or if you get energy from having coworkers physically around you.
37,Quantum Metric,Great Start & Positive Outlook,2020-11-24,5.0,Salesforce Administrator,"The onboarding for new hires was phenomenal. I really felt that they wanted us to get to know the company as a whole and to explore how each team works. They've also done a great job of maintaining company culture even though we are all remote. Between all hands meetings, holiday celebrations over zoom, fun slack channels and 1 on 1 social calls to get to know one another it feels like I've met and been welcomed by nearly everyone. There is also plenty of opportunity to pursue projects you are passionate about vs. being told what to work on. It's only been a few short months since I started, but I can already tell this is a place I want to work for a long time.","There are a lot of meetings; at first I was keen to join to get to know people and the product better, but now that I am busier and I realize they are optional it is not so bad to attend occasionally."
38,Quantum Metric,"Supportive, Bold, and Fun Company Culture!",2021-05-04,5.0,Event Marketing Coordinator,"I love the flexibility Quantum Metric provides it employees. Your job duties aren't just what's laid out in your job offer letter, they allow you to flex and work on other projects as well. They are supportive, always allowing you to chase that one crazy idea!

42,Quantum Metric,"Ton of work, TON of fun.",2021-04-22,4.0,Marketing,"Smartest group of people I've ever worked with. Passion beams from every face you see on Zoom. There's a sense of ""team"" that makes you feel like you can do anything. Customers and employees alike are so fanatical about the product and culture that it really sucks you in! You will feel very connected to the mission, and your impact on the company is tangible.","Standard high-growth startup challenges - you will work VERY hard. If you need a map handed to you with prescriptive guardrails, look elsewhere. Be prepared to flex and pivot often. Leadership has not yet invested in some basic benefits like 401K matching, mobile and internet reimbursement, wellness stipends, etc."
43,Quantum Metric,Top notch leadership with a killer product,2021-02-26,5.0,Solutions Engineer Manager,"-Current leadership has awesome credentials and experience. Setting the course for a very promising future.

The product is more advanced than a lot of the marketing technologies in the space.

The whole company is forward thinking.

The people here are uniformly smart, driven, and often veterans in their field. The culture is healthy, people are supportive and approachable.

68,Quantum Metric,Amazingly talented team,2020-02-24,4.0,Marketing Director,"Quantum Metric is a collection of some of the brightest and most talented individuals I've ever worked with. It's very much a classic startup ""work hard, play hard"" mentality - with job responsibilities usually extending way past traditional roles. It's absolutely incredible what the team has achieved, and how fast we're accelerating towards success. It's a lot of fun to be along for the ride. Talent and hard work is recognized and genuinely appreciated by leadership. ""Team"" mentality is engrained into every employee; everyone is willing to jump in and help on any project, cross-functionally, and no job is too small, even for the executives. It's hard not to drink the kool-aid here!","Expect the usual pains of a startup. Our growth is generally 10 steps ahead of our processes, trainings, etc. In Denver, specifically, we're quickly growing out of our current office space. There is no company match on 401k contributions. The pace of change is very fast so if adaptation isn't one of your strong suits you will struggle. That said, it's very exciting for those of us that thrive in newness and growth."
69,Quantum Metric,Top tier quality,2020-03-09,5.0,Sales,"QM is the best kept secret, particularly in the DC area. Easily one of the best companies to work for. 

- great product, continues to mature
- plenty of people to learn from
- plenty of snacks and fully stocked fridge in Bethesda office. New office space in new building right by the metro. Walking distance to everything noteworthy",- most of the company is remote so outside of your immediate team or office. Company does a great job of trying to make sure it's maintaining a sense of inclusiveness and tend to Get together in Denver/Monument  (HQ) or Bethesda
70,Quantum Metric,"If you're looking for that #startuplife, you've come to the right place",2020-02-24,5.0,Finance,"Quantum is everything you could ever ask for from a modern startup and more.

- Employee Empowerment - At Quantum, each member of the team feels like they have a stake in the organization's success and has an opportunity to make significant and meaningful contributions.  Titles don't matter - if you have a great idea or great input, the door is open: get in the room and share it.

- Tremendous Talent - At Quantum you'll have the opportunity to surround yourself with people across the entire organization with a broad range of experience.  If you follow the mantra of ""surround yourself with people smarter and better than you"" you should have no problem finding people to meet these needs.

-  Experienced Leadership - Senior Leadership and the Company's advisory board bring an amazing wealth of experience, so this isn't some fly-by-night startup where you're worried if the company will still be around in six months.  You can trust the people around you, and more importantly, you can very swiftly earn their trust as well. 

I would recommend Quantum to my best friend and any member of my family.","The ""pro"" is the ""con"".  This is a startup to its very core, so if you're interested in a highly rigid, structured work environment or you're looking to join an organization where you can show up, work, go home, and not think about work again until you come back the next day, you may be more successful at a different type of organization.  

You're hitching a ride on a rocketship, and sometimes that means being asked to adapt, move quickly, and go the extra mile knowing that the people around you are doing the same for you. This isn't for everyone, but the reward is worth the investment."

When you start with quality people, trust them to execute and support them through solid vision, the results speak volumes. Leaders at Quantum believe in their team members' ability to get the job done, and they strike the right balance between listening, coaching and allowing talented people to drive. This has resulted in a great product, with superior technology, and a company full of evangelists who want to tell the world about it. There are really no underachievers here, but those who truly go above and beyond are always recognized and frequently advanced.","Even after a massive Series-A injection, executive leadership understands (rightly so) that Quantum must continue to move fast and operate like a startup in order to succeed. This go-go-go environment isn't for everybody. However, for those who love to deliver results and see their impact immediately, this is the place to be."
91,Quantum Metric,Sales,2018-09-17,5.0,Sales,"QM is my 3rd start-up and it's the best one yet!

We like to work hard, we like to win, and we like to have fun! Work/life balance is key - the people here get it. At this point in my career, this is exactly what I wanted; ability to  sell a hot & differentiated technology, ability to contribute to the growth of a company & EARN commission, ability to receive mentorship from exceptional leadership team, and to have a positive impact as a member of one of the best sales teams ever assembled.","It's an early stage start-up and the day to day can be a grind, but it's all part of the journey and everyone picks each other up.
