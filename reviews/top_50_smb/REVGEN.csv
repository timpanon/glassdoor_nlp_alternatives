0,REVGEN,Amazing Culture,2022-03-31,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"The culture at REVGEN is unmatched. The people are the best I've worked with. There is always a lively buzz in the office, music, and it is pet friendly! The managers truly care about your success here and do everything they can to help you hit your goals. This is a great job to help you get a ton of sales experience in a short period of time. This position is a stepping stone and when you finish your time here, they will help you find another amazing job making more $$. Not to mention REVGEN looks awesome on your resume.","This job is what you make it. You can work hard and put the effort in to be successful, or you can do the bare minimum and not make it through the program. If you're looking for a job to just show up to, and go through the motions effortlessly, this is not a good fit for you."
1,REVGEN,"Not what its advertised as, every sales team has different expectations",2022-03-17,3.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Good way to get sales experience when you cant get another job
Managers are good people","You get assigned a company that you will make sales calls for (110 per day), some teams take half the day to make the calls and others have to work all day into night to get their calls done, but everyone gets paid the same.
They describe it as a sales company but it is more like a call center because all you do is call leads and read a script that you have to follow otherwise you get scrutinized. 
Meeting will often start at 5pm and go til after 6, even though the job description says 8:30-5:30. 
They play your calls in front of coworkers, so this job isn't for the weak.
No PTO til after your third month which means for have 3 days you have to use in your 3rd month, otherwise they go to waste. It is only a 4 month program. 
Remote workers don't get any equipment to sue so you have to pay for your own monitors, headset ect. and there is no stipend for that.
Don't get paid base til a month after you start and commission 2 months after."
2,REVGEN,Legitimate Opportunity to Enter Tech Sales,2022-03-25,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"TL;DR Legit opportunity, challenging industry, worth trying.

Alright, folks, here it is. If you have looked at these reviews and are trying to decide where the truth is between the impossibly enthusiastic and the unrealistically negative, here it is. If you love to overthink everything and want the most information possible, this is the review for you!

Let me speak a bit about this industry as a whole from a never-heard-of-it-until-today perspective, and then I'll talk about revgen specifically.

What the heck is a Sales Development Representative (SDR)? Essentially, telemarketing. Nobody uses the word telemarketing anymore, I guess because it sounds non-glorious. Now, as a sales development representative, you won't be calling lonely senior citizens and trying to sell them magazine subscriptions, at least. You will be calling a specific contact at a legitimate business who (at least theoretically) should be qualified to hear a demo presentation of the software as a service (SaaS) product (which they likely need or are using a competitor already) that you are assigned to. 
You aren't even selling the product, you are simply selling these folks a no-obligation 20 minute demonstration of the product. Someone else (above you) is the one doing the actual presentation.
How does cold calling like this even make money? If you're calling a business that might need, for example, a service like Dropbox but geared for business-- how do they not have something in place already? How is this business functioning without something that they need-- and if they already have something in place, why would they ever take a cold call and consider changing a process based on a cold call? 
Well, it turns out that they do. Or, at least, about 5% of people do.
Due to the margins in the software as a service (SaaS) industry, paying people about 42k per year to cold call for eight hours a day is a great use of resources. (My mind was blown by this).

Okay, so, Revgen. Revgen needs you to succeed as a sales development representative (SDR) because they make money from contracts by placing you at a company as an SDR after you complete Revgen's bootcamp. In a sense, you are the product. But this means Revgen will do anything possible to see you succeed. You bring an honest effort to the table, and the managers there will jump through hoops and go to any length to see you do well. 
Upon graduation, Revgen wants you to be placed at a Shiny New Job that you'll enjoy and do well at because you're now representing Revgen. 

Maybe the biggest deal here is that Revgen has a well-connected network already. They know people. They have worked with so many companies already and have a good reputation in the industry. Have you ever asked yourself: ""where are all the good jobs at? --I know some of these folks aren't even posting on Indeed or wherever."" The network is a huge asset that someone in my shoes would never have access to otherwise. And these jobs pay good money! I didn't realize how much money sales jobs can pay.

Everyone is so friendly, managers and coworkers. I've really met some cool people with fascinating backgrounds-- plenty of them having nothing to do with sales.

This business is growing. They've expanded a lot in the past few years, and trajectory is continued expansion.","You are making 110 dials per day. You'll have time to accomplish this, don't worry about that part (plenty of your dials will go straight to voicemail (take only a few seconds for those) and plenty will be unanswered (takes about 30 seconds for those). 
You will, however, likely only speak to about 6 qualified ""decisions makers"" per day (on most ""campaigns,"" campaign just means the specific company you're doing the calling for). (This absolutely varies from one campaign to another, so you may actually be booking more than this, but this is a reasonable average). Out of those 6 decision makers, you will likely only schedule one demo per day. In a sense, that's one success out of 110 attempts. And that's doing a good job! It can be challenging to feel like you're succeeding by doing this. And there will be days when you make 110 dials (or more) and don't book a single demo. That can be discouraging. Hardest of all, it depends on luck, somewhat. If your list of ""leads"" (people with phone numbers in whatever industry you're calling) is bad, it will be harder than if your list happens to be great. Depending somewhat on luck, there may be weeks when you don't book a demo. That can be discouraging; HOWEVER, everyone you're working with gets it. They've all been there before. Everyone I've interacted with is happy to listen to you vent. AND Revgen reviews a call of yours at random once a month. As long as you're following their system, if your results aren't great because of external factors, they work with you.

I'm gonna touch on some of the cons in other posts:
""Toxic CEO"" I could see how John Rosar's personality (definitely type A) just isn't for everyone. He means business-- it seems everyone in the room sits up a little straighter when he is in the meeting. BUT. I've seen it myself. John Rosar WILL go to bat for you. If you complete the program, he will make any call, provide any recommendation, and you will always be welcome back at Revgen. And during the program, he will do anything to help you succeed.

""They don't train you/training is repetitive"" They definitely trained me. They have a systematic outline for sales that they have data to prove works pretty well. As you get more comfortable, there's also room to customize things a bit and make it your own. I doubt they're going to tell you some never-before-heard-of technique that works magically, but they definitely have a system.
I could see how training could be repetitive. The method and techniques are pretty straight forward. I believe the repetition comes into play to reinforce best practices. Or, maybe you've picked something up and someone else is still consistently not doing something to spec. So you'll hear the training again in group. Or you're doing pretty well, but there's still that room for improvement.

""If you miss quota, you get thrown under the bus"" Perhaps this was not in place at the time, but there is now a process in place where one of your calls is reviewed by someone other than your manager once a month. You get a score based on a rubric that's provided for you on day one that makes sure you follow the revgen process. If you get a successful call score for the month but miss quota, they will work with you. In general, if you are putting forth genuine effort, they will 100% go to bat for you.

""long hours/underpaid"" The hours are 8:30-5:30 Monday-Friday with an hour off for lunch from 12-1. Once a week, you will have a call review session from 5-6pm, so half an hour after your normal end of day. At the time of this writing, the base pay is 30k + estimated 12k commission for an ""on target earnings"" (OTE) of 42k per year. And, just to be clear, they really pay you, at the very start I was worried this was some catch, but nope.

Sales may not be for everyone, but this is a great way to find out if it's for you. Plenty of people in sales are cool folks who originally wanted to play guitar or animate or get a phd, but none of those things paid the bills the way sales does."
3,REVGEN,REVGEN is a phenomenal company and a great way to get your foot in the door into tech sales!,2021-12-14,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"In the spring of 2019, I graduated college and I started to apply for sales jobs everywhere. I probably applied to over a hundred companies. Almost all of them denied me because they said I didn’t have enough experience. Then I got a call from REVGEN and they gave me the opportunity to interview with them. In the summer of 2019, I joined the the REVGEN family as an SDR. During my time there, they trained me on how to cold-call, taught me how to overcome objections, gave me sales books to read, taught me how to speak clear and concise on the phone, and much more! REVGEN definitely gave me the tools and knowledge that I needed to succeed. After only five months at REVGEN, they set up interviews for me to other tech companies. After a couple weeks of the interview process, I signed an offer for a SDR position at a Fortune 100 Tech company. And now, in 2021, I’m an Account Executive (closing deals) for the same company and I’m making the money I’ve always dreamed of! REVGEN is a huge factor in my success and for where I’m at today. When many companies overlooked me for not having any sales experience, REVGEN gave me the opportunity and training that I needed to excel in the tech sales industry.",It is a grind but it will get you to where you want to be in life.

10,REVGEN,Amazing program that fully prepares you for the sales world,2021-07-30,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Revgen is the best company I’ve ever worked for. I was in the restaurant industry before I started, and had no sales experience whatsoever. The management/team goes out of their way to provide you with the proper resources needed to succeed. The environment is incredibly positive, and everyone tries to lift each other up and give feedback when needed. There is constant training/call training to provide feedback and make improvements daily. By the time you graduate (4-6 months), you will be ready to take on the next chapter in your career, and companies know you’ve had proper training!","-The pay may seem low, but considering the training/methods you learn in the short time you’re here, it makes it all worth it. 
-dial count is usually atleast 100 - 110 calls a day
-if you’re behind on your goal, you will need to put in the extra time/hours and stay late somedays in order to get there."
11,REVGEN,Over Selling,2021-07-13,2.0,Sales Development Representative,"Great co-workers, lots of training (pretty much as much as you want), great office environment.","Overworked, underpaid. Long hours, favouritism, overselling during first couple of weeks and interview process. 

Be prepared for not a lot of work life balance. You’re making about 100-120 calls a day. That’s 15 calls an hour if you’re on track to leave on time. This is possible but also hard if you’re getting a lot of people on the phone. REVGEN openly preaches hustle culture as it is a “sprint not a marathon” which is true, it is a 4-6 month program but at the same time, if your an adult with a family or a young professional with a social life you get very worn down. Opportunities afterwards are pretty much the same thing so if you’re looking to “accelerate” you’re sales career, apply somewhere else. You’re most likely going to go to another SDR position for an additional 6 months-a year. Therefore you’re starting all over. Not worth it!"

After the program, you will know how to overcome someone's objection and politely funnel said conversation in a direction that benefits you. Not only did REVGEN teach me how to succeed at my current job but they provided substantial networking opportunities to find a company that best fits your personal needs. In summary, if you want to make money while working for a company that appreciates its employees, REVGEN will show you how to get there.","The program is challenging, but nothing in life worth doing comes easy.

85,REVGEN,Good career decision for entry into tech sales,2019-02-20,5.0,,"First off, I’ll start out by saying REVGEN isn’t for everyone. It is hard work, your success correlates to how bad you want it. That being said, if you work hard, your time here will pay off and a lot of doors can open for you. For example, companies i applied to before REVGEN who rejected me immediately began reaching out to me on LinkedIn within a few months.
The work can be daunting (110 calls per day), but overall the work environment (downtown Raleigh, dogs in the office, happy hours, etc) and the people you work alongside with are cool and help the days pass by.
Overall I would say if you’re looking for a career in tech sales, this is a great starting point. You’ll work hard but by the time you graduate, other tech companies in Raleigh will want to hire you, no question. The management here really invests in your success and want you to succeed, but be prepared to work hard.
other pros:
- location 
- snacks
- dog policy 
- great networking opportunities
- great managers who are always open to help","-some holidays don’t count as PTO but they make you use your PTO for them. 
- cramped work space at times (believe they’re moving soon though)
-OTE is harder to achieve for some depending on the campaign"
86,REVGEN,Fantastic place to start your career and build a network,2019-09-04,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"-strong sales training and support from management
-long-lasting business relationships and network-building
-great place to start as a recent graduate or someone coming from a different career background

90,REVGEN,My best career decision yet!!,2019-02-12,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"What an amazing opportunity! I was fresh out of college with zero sales experience just trying to get my foot in the door. Getting an offer from REVGEN changed everything for me. After being an SDR for 5 month, I was able to land a position that I couldn’t be happier about. If I told you it was an easy 5 month I would be lying. There’s nothing luxurious about high volume dialing, but they do a great job keeping moral up. Between being dog friendly, the snacks, the happy hours, the supportive management they’ve really got culture figured out. 
Overall they’ve got a really good thing going!",The space. Moving into your new office will be a game changer for you guys.

92,REVGEN,Don't believe them,2019-08-20,2.0,Sales Development Representative,Co-workers great. Training program has great potential.  Definitely gets you connected to people in sales.,Management is young and inexperienced.  Really only one manager there that is worth anything.  Lots of favoritism from the start. You seriously have to have nothing else in your life to be able to work here.
93,REVGEN,Sales Development Representative,2018-02-09,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"This is a great place to start your career in sales.  The management team has extended knowledge and experience in order to teach you the ins and out of this industry.  There are also trainings every week to ensure personal and professional growth.  I learned so much from this company and I could not have asked for a better experience.  The management is also understandable and wants to see you improve and advance your career.  This is the thing I admired the most about RevGen.  As long as you hustle, want to learn and show improvement, the possibilities there will be to advance.  This is also a great place to network. The people who work at RevGen are awesome and there are also guest speakers who come in on a weekly basis. The culture is fun and energetic and everyone stays true to the company values and mission.","The only cons with RevGen come with the industry of sales.  There are long hours and you constantly have to hustle.  If this is a deal breaker, then sales may not be the industry for you."
94,REVGEN,Great stepping stone,2019-05-02,5.0,SDR,"I worked at REVGEN for 4 months and the program totally works. If you work hard and hit your goals, you will be connected to so many opportunities throughout the area. I'm now working for a company that I was super interested in before I got my job at REVGEN. The people make the company. I had awesome coworkers. The management team really takes the time to individually invest in you to help you figure out where you want to go, and they will be making cold calls with you. They also teach you how to understand your metrics which was really valuable for me during my interviewing. Oh and the dogs! Frequent cuddles with dogs break up the long workday. The new office is great from what I hear",110 cold calls a day can be a lot but they're just teaching you how to grind. Sometimes the computers and equipment would run slow. Definitely a startup. Previous office space was thrown together as best as possible. No benefits/very limited PTO but it's a short term program.
95,REVGEN,Great Opportunity!,2019-01-07,5.0,SDR,"So many great things about this company and it was the best decision I made in my sales career.

- Hands on training with great managers
- Weekly assignments that help grow your sales knowledge
- Collaborative environment 
- Excellent leadership
- Dogs!

REVGEN will get you acclimated with quota carrying goals and the stresses involved with it and prepare you for an SDR role in the future. They also help you get placed once you graduate the program which is fantastic!","This job is a grind and you have to know this before starting. You pretty much hit the ground running and if you aren't ready to put in the work then this probably isn't the right job for you.

You bring the hustle, and leadership will bring the resources/ training/ connections necessary to take steps in your career you may have never thought possible. Getting an “education” from Revgen will put you miles ahead of your competition. What makes Revgen so unique is that their product IS sales training, where as most companies have sales training as an afterthought. A true family environment where everyone cares about the success and happiness of their neighbor. Oh, and can’t forget Gus the office pup :-) Don’t miss out!!","Those who do not understand the long term advantages of Revgen and are looking for a short term gain will not like the hours/pay.

98,REVGEN,"Amazing CEO, amazing platform, amazing opportunity",2018-11-09,5.0,SDR,"Hands down, the best part of working at REVGEN was the CEO, John Rosar.  I have worked numerous other professional jobs and have never had the exposure and ease of access to converse with the CEO of a company.
Beyond that, the main objective for this company is to be an accelerated sales training program.  This means that you will be expected to hustle.  With that being said, with great responsibility comes great rewards.  I never would have been able to catapult myself into the tech SaaS sector without the help of REVGEN!
-Also, the culture is great!  Very exciting to work there each day!","I would say that this is less of a con and more of just something that should be expected for a career that holds high reward.

-good place to make friends","-low base pay
-advertised pay is not what you will make because it is nearly impossible to meet on-target earnings
-co-workers can be clique-y 
-CEO is a loose-cannon and will go off yelling at employees for arbitrary reasons
-watched like a hawk and constantly told to ""keep dialing"" which is often degrading 
-a lot of drinking culture, which is fun for some but not everyone
-long hours that are not advertised as such; often reprimanded for leaving work on time
-clear that the main objective of the company is to make money without regard for the dignity of SDRs; it's not stated up-front that they profit from recruiting you out to another company, but it's not a secret that they take a lot of revenue from doing this"

106,REVGEN,Great Start-Up Company and Best Place To Work For Ever,2015-06-03,5.0,,"The atmosphere RevGen brings to the table is amazing when it comes to the employees, management staff and overall vibe of the place. 

If your looking for a place where you can earn based off the work you put into the place than RevGen is the place you want to start to launch your sales career.

If your looking to come here and slack off on the ping pong table all day long than this probably isn't the ideal place for you as you spend 3 months here in preparation to move over to Citrix.   

I'd say the best thing about this place is that if you stumble over yourself than everyone will extend a hand to help you jump over that hurdle and make the jump with you. You are never alone here and there is never bad attitudes. I've honestly never seen anyone frown here everyone is always high energy and smiling and that surprised me coming in because I thought it would be the typical work environment filled with your group of positive happy people and the group of negative people but everyone here falls into the same category of happiness.

RevGen was one of the best moves that I could have ever made and I don't regret my decision in coming here because the knowledge that I've acquired I can take anywhere in my life and apply it and that's exactly how work should be. This isn't just a job you are in training and if you come here to learn and not just earn you will set-up yourself up for success.

There are tons of pros to this place but I don't want to rant on forever. Just go fill out the application on the website and take that leap of faith. The water feels good :)","I've read some of the reviews on here and there are comments saying that RevGen should tell you that less than 10% actually make it over to Citrix. These are probably the ones who were playing ping pong all day long rather than actually doing what they were hired to do and that's WORK!!

If you come in here and do your job each and everyday and make the calls and set yourself up for success and meet your monthly goals than you won't have any problem going over to Citrix.

It's very important to note that this company and Citrix are looking for those ambitious individuals who are going to come in every day focused and get the job done it's as simple as that.

So I guess that con is if you can't get yourself to think in a way of success than RevGen and Citrix isn't the place for you.

Besides that this place ROCKS and a great place to come CRUSH IT. Really and truly you have to be self-motivated and a self-starter because the management staff isn't going to hover over you watching you work which gives you plenty of time to play on your cellphone, watch youtube videos and play around all day and that's a sure way to make sure you don't succeed.

On the other hand if you come in and do your job than I can promise you and guarantee that you will succeed at this job every single day in. 

Anyways .. that's enough of that there are no Cons to this place so don't be mislead by those who slacked off. Come in and get it done."
107,REVGEN,2 thumbs up!,2019-03-29,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"I was on a unique campaign at REVGEN, so I can't speak of the SDR experience directly, but I can speak of the culture, and the leadership team.

As far as the SDR managers, I always saw them working one on one with their teams. Very hands on. Constantly encouraging. I never saw a manager leaving a room to give a silent scream or throwing their hands up, which I thought was rare in a sales company. I think all of the manager there truly enjoy what they do and are passionate about helping each new person that walks in the door succeed.

The HR staff is AWESOME. If you have come in as a new employee/SDR and have done what it takes to move forward they will help with things most places won't. For example, your resume. 

The CEO is passionate about this company. I think its fair to say he is passionate about anything he does and believes in. When you work for someone who has passion in building their company, they will take leaps and bounds to make it successful. While a SDR would mainly go to their manager, the CEO, John would absolutely meet with anyone if they asked him to. He wants his employees to be successful. He believes in their model. If something isn't working he wants to change it. He is involved with morning training's and additional training if needed. He will challenge you and if you take on that challenge, it will only make you better. 

I would highly recommend this job to anyone want to start a career in Sales. You know whats great about starting at somewhere like REVGEN, you learn the skills to be successful in the next job OR maybe you learn that you don't want to be in Sales. Either way you learn and that will make you more successful in your next step.","I truly don't have many cons, but I have some feedback on other cons mentioned above. Headphones- they were pretty awful there for a while, but that was resolved. I couldn't even here someone if they were talking to me directly with my new ones. The office- the temporary location wasn't ideal but the CEO did everything he could to make it efficient. Regardless, the new office space is AMAZING. It's worth going by to see.

The only other feedback that could be con I suppose is- you. It takes a special person to be in Sales. As a new SDR everything you thought you knew will be challenged. You will be frustrated on days, but if you work hard, grind and hustle the reward is so worth it. The sky is limit."

They are always there to help even if you aren't placed on their respective teams.
- HR staff is a pleasure to work with. Helps keep the morale up by sparking up conversation, occasionally asking how you are doing and always keeping us stocked up with the best snacks.
- The office is currently located in the heart of downtown and with ease of access to some of the best restaurants/coffee shops that make for a great lunch time escape.
- You will meet people from all walks of life here and if you're lucky you might even walk away with a load of new friends.
- 110 dials may seem hard to achieve but as long as you stay dialed in and on track you will definitely afford yourself several mental breaks throughout the day. It is is certainly not unattainable unless you are easily distracted.
- Impressive book of resources for your career advancement.","- Pay ""OTE"" is strongly dependent on what campaign you land on. You have no say in what campaign that will be.
- The teams are often too big for the managers and that lessens the chances of you scoring one on one time if you need extra training.
- Some of the campaigns are very experimental or not performing and with only 4-6 months to prove yourself it is very overwhelming and not a true measure of your skill.
- The office is not the most aesthetically satisfying and plans to move continuously get pushed to a later date.
- CEO is a wildcard. At times a great guy with an impressive business model. However, strongly overshadowed by the way he carries himself in the office both in front of SDR's and behind closed doors. A very ""my way or the highway"" style of running his business."

There are a few good managers there and HR is pretty cool 
Dogs in the office","This is a contract position so no benefits and they will terminate reps just as fast as they will hire despite claiming to be a sales training program. It almost felt like a scam as the pay was low and training was sub par. Hit 100% of your quota if you miss quota despite over exceeding on dials and putting forth the so called hustle they will still put you on Performance improvement plan triple your quota and offer no legit training or assistance to keep you. They will hire just about anybody with a pulse. They might have good reviews but behind the glass door reviews a lot of reps are unhappy with management and feel thrown under the bus. Even employees who so called ""graduated"" dont have great things to say about REVGEN. I have seen managers write up employees for mistakes that they were never trained on and then admit they were the cause for the mistake even though they wrote you up. Management also has no idea about the campaign they are managing which leads to huge miscommunication but dont worry they will blame it on the reps then go recruit whoever can speak on the phone to come replace you. 
Values are a joke and probably just made up to look good and get new bodies into the seats. if you are looking to get into sales through a Sale Development role just go apply to the company you are interested in. Everybody knows that to be successful requires hard work and also anybody who is successful knows that sometimes we fail despite our best effort REVGEN speaks the language of those who overcome adversity and push through adversity but at the end of the day its all manipulation to keep you from quitting or to overwork you and underpay you. I never right reviews like this but REVGEN has left a foul taste in my mouth."
