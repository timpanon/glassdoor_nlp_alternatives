0,Sales Empowerment Group,Great Company,2022-03-17,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),Culture is 10/10. The structure of the company is 10/10. Training is 10/10.,0 cons in my perspective.
1,Sales Empowerment Group,More than I expected.,2022-02-18,5.0,Business Development Representative (BDR),"I had a phone interview with SEG and the next day they put me through an interview with one of their clients, called me that same day and offered a second interview the following day. After about 4 hours from my second interview, I had a job offer! The interview process was very quick and I gladly accepted the position. They matched me with the right company efficiently and quickly!

With no previous sales experience.. I went from doing 0 role plays to 10+ role plays a week and have seen improvement day after day!
SEG is not your typical sales training program. They really focus on enhancing your sales skills, your communication & relationship building skills; both over the phone and via email/LinkedIn. 

EVERYONE on the team is supportive, they want to see you grow and they always leave room for you as an individual to improve.
Overall, SEG is an awesome program to get your feet wet and kickstart your sales career!","A remote position may be a con for you, but definitely a PRO for me :)"
2,Sales Empowerment Group,Wonderful company!,2022-03-04,5.0,Businesses Development Representative,"Sales Empowerment Group is a wonderful company! They offer amazing training for new employees, to get you comfortable in your new role. They have great managers in place, who you can tell actually enjoy their jobs and are open to suggestions and really hearing you. There is always someone you can contact if you have any questions and I really feel supported working here. The work/life balance is like no other. They stress the importance of carving time out for yourself. I am so happy to be working for this company!",There are no cons to working at Sales Empowerment Group
3,Sales Empowerment Group,The most thorough and well-thought out company I've ever worked with.,2021-12-17,5.0,Business Development Representative,"From the moment I first spoke to a recruiter all the way through training, this company has been professional and supportive. My recruiter sent me tips and tricks days leading up to my second and third interviews in order to help me land the job. They made sure I knew where I stood within 24hrs of the last interview, and had me onboarding within 12 hours of the job offer. If they see your potential, they make sure you have the tools to land the job.

Training was quick and efficient, with higher ups being VERY involved (my training was lead by the CEO 3/5 days) in setting up expectations and giving you the tools to succeed in this position. Its not a go-go-go sales position; they would prefer you be a consultant than a sales person, which is so, so nice. 

Overall, everyone in this company cares about you and your success. It's so refreshing to be with a company that doesn't want to run you into the ground.",None at all! Everything is great thus far.
4,Sales Empowerment Group,BDR,2022-01-21,5.0,Business Development Representative,"Unreal training program by experts who actually care! 

Sales is a whole new world for me. Somehow within a week, the people at SEG made me feel like I've been doing it for months. They surround you with experts who give you all the information needed to start a career in this new virtual world. Even though their whole goal is to get employees hired away, I believe they will support me for my whole career in sales. Great people. Epic Training. They challenge you to be great. Will you answer the call??? Also...... I'm coming for that wall of fame!!!!",I'm going to miss the people I trained with! The people in my group were awesome. I think we will continue to chat all the time at least.
5,Sales Empowerment Group,Great training + team,2022-01-26,5.0,Business Development Representative,"If you are looking to get more comfortable with Sales and launch your Sales career, SEG is the place for you! The training was some of the BEST I have ever seen. The SEG team is friendly, knowledgeable, and knows how to develop you into a more effective BDR/ Salesperson. Amazing opportunity for anyone looking for remote flexibility and sales development.","The only cons I can see are it is a remote/work-from-home opportunity, especially in a sales role, this makes it easier for you to fall behind/ not hit numbers if you lack time management/ focus. Also, if you are not comfortable with the nature of sales it may be challenging."
6,Sales Empowerment Group,Amazing work culture and people,2022-02-11,5.0,Business Development Representative (BDR),"The people at SEG have to be the most helpful and encouraging people ever. The whole experience was great, from the onboarding to the intense training. They have created a welcoming atmosphere that makes it easy to learn and grow. They somehow managed to find a balance between being challenging and holding your hands through the process. My favorite thing about it is that everyone makes themselves very available to help you in any way.",I have 0 cons about SEG
7,Sales Empowerment Group,If you're into building a foundation for any Sales gig check this company out,2021-11-05,5.0,Business Development Representative,"-In depth Training, they want to build a foundation for success and really prove it in the trainings by role playing, shadowing, and pushing you to get out of your comfort zone. 

-Virtual one on one time with Executives who have been in the industries you will be assigned to for years
- Support and Culture are HUGE. They make it a point to include every single person in after work hours events and make sure you get to know everyone in the company EVEN before you start. 

- Pay is fair and gives you something to work towards every month so that you can bring even more money home. 

-Hours are GREAT, I get to spend way more time with my family","I'm too young right now in the company to see anything, but nothing showing red flags of yet or at all"
8,Sales Empowerment Group,Great Training,2022-02-11,5.0,Business Development Representative (BDR),Within one week the SEG gets you feeling comfortable with the skills needed to be a successful BDR. SEG will continue to mentor you well after your training week is over. If you're looking to get into sales with little to no prior experience SEG is the place to work. I could not recommend them more!,I have nothing to complain about. SEG will listen to any concerns you have and provide you with great solutions.
9,Sales Empowerment Group,Best Training Experience I've Ever Had,2021-11-05,5.0,Business Development Representative,"Today is Friday. Today marks my first week with SEG. Started Monday first day on the job and I have to say that the training at SEG is nearly impeccable. The time, resources, and energy that the SEG management team dedicates to its new employees is just outstanding. 

The training is INVALUABLE. No other way to put it. I have gone through several different trainings in my life and this is hands down the best training for a position that I have ever gone through.","Can't say there are any cons so far. Maybe, I MIGHT discover some in the future. But at this point in time, I have nothing to complain about. No cons, no negatives.

SEG has been extremely flexible with time during training this last week."
10,Sales Empowerment Group,Training,2021-12-17,5.0,BDR,"SEG goes through extensive training in the small duration of one week. Where most companies leave you feeling frazzled and unsure if this is a position you can see yourself pursuing, their training does a great job on ensuring you’re more than ready, comfortable, and familiarized with everything in order to do your new job the best you possibly can. The entire team, even those not working directly with you, proves time and time again to be a helping hand and genuinely rooting for your success within the company.",I honestly have no cons with SEG
11,Sales Empowerment Group,Awesome Training and Guidance,2022-01-07,5.0,Business Development Representative,The training at SEG is top-notch. I have grown and attained plenty of knowledge in the last few weeks. I feel more confident each day with the role and any questions I have I can ask directly to my manager who's readily available. Very Professional. Highly recommend.,"There is a lot to learn, which can be tiring at times, but SEG makes sure to give long breaks and helps assist in any questions you may have. Hard work will pay off in the end."
12,Sales Empowerment Group,"So Far, So Great!",2021-10-29,5.0,Business Development Representative (BDR),"I have honestly nothing but great things to say about SEG so far. I started my training class about a week ago and it has been great. All of the managers and upper-level execs are extremely helpful and proactive about helping with any issues you may face. It's a very comfortable and informative environment. Brian, the CEO, is always checking in and very involved, which is rare in large companies like this. They value work-life balance and take any advice that employees give them on how to improve the company seriously!!","The only con I can think of is that a lot of their positions are remote, so make sure you're comfortable with that. However, you are always welcome to come work in their office if you are nearby. (I've never been but I hear they have ping pong tables)."
13,Sales Empowerment Group,Good company when new to sales,2022-03-10,4.0,Business Development,Everyone is willing to help.,They are quick to replace you.
14,Sales Empowerment Group,Senior Business Development Rep,2022-02-05,5.0,Senior Business Development Representative,"Great culture, and they understand work life balance.",Wish the base pay for meetings was more than $50
15,Sales Empowerment Group,Fantastic Management,2022-01-19,5.0,Business Development Representative,"I've never felt so supported within a company like this. You can tell how much effort every single manager puts into training, and they're all so eager to help you thrive.",I have none at this time.
16,Sales Empowerment Group,BDR Review,2021-11-12,5.0,Business Development Representative (BDR),"The training is excellent, as someone who did not have much of a sales background, it helped me get comfortable pretty quickly. 
The team collaboration is amazing. You can also get a hold of a manager, or a higher level person, by email, or phone pretty quickly. 
Everyone is genuinely willing to show their tips and tricks in regards to how they do things
Overall everyone wants to see people do well","The training can be nerve racking if you are new into sales, but after the second or third day those nerves go away and you start to get comfortable."
17,Sales Empowerment Group,Amazing Company to Work For,2022-01-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,so many growth opportunities and exposure to start-ups right at the beginning of your career. Top sales training and getting paid for it? It’s way worth it and an investment for the rest of your career,Clients may not be as communicative as you would like.
18,Sales Empowerment Group,Great atmosphere to work in!,2022-01-07,5.0,Business Development Representative,Hands down the best training program I've every experienced! Every manager is there to help you in any way that they can. Super supportive team always there to make sure you succeed.,Can't say anything bad about SEG!
19,Sales Empowerment Group,SEG Experience,2021-11-19,5.0,Business Development Representative,"I learned more in 5 days than I learned in 5 months at my previous sales job. Everyone at SEG is nice, understanding, engaging, and organized. You can feel that they are here to help. It is not an easy job but everyone made me feel so comfortable which allowed me to get better everyday. I am so grateful for this opportunity and experience as I know it has put me on the right track for success.",Nothing comes to mind. Very pleased and excited. Thank you SEG!
20,Sales Empowerment Group,Best Decision I've Made,2021-11-12,5.0,Business Development Representative,"Excellent management team that wants nothing more than for you to succeed. The sales training has been and will continue to be super valuable for me as a sales professional. If you want to grow in a sales career and become a top performer, I highly recommend you start your journey with SEG.","I've worked sales jobs in the past, went through sales training in the past, SEG has exceeded my expectations. And for that I have nothing negative to say about this organization."
21,Sales Empowerment Group,"A Place Where You Care About Your Work, And Your Leaders Care About You",2021-05-07,5.0,Business Development Representative,"The best thing SEG has going for it is the culture. They deeply understand the importance of a work life balance, which unfortunately is something you don't see a lot at other companies, especially other sales companies. SEG understands that when you're respectful of an employee's time, they'll work that much harder for you.

Everyone I've gotten to work with so far has been so generous with their advice, their guidance, and their time. There's a big value placed on teamwork and camaraderie that makes coming into work every day a pleasure.

I haven't been with the company long, but with a work environment like this, I sure plan to.","This might come down to how I personally set it up, but there has been an issue with emails. They've primarily been contacting me through my personal Gmail account, but I also had to set up an Outlook account, and from *there* another Gmail accent for the campaign. Maybe I could tinker it so I only have to deal with one work email, but I've been worried that I'll miss a work call or appointment because I didn't go through all three inboxes to find it."
22,Sales Empowerment Group,See Rating,2022-01-07,5.0,BDR Representative,"Great mentorship, good jump off point",Feels like a contractor with client company
23,Sales Empowerment Group,top-notch training for newcomers and those experienced in sales,2021-10-29,5.0,Business Development Representative (BDR),The sales managers at SEG really provide you with the foundation and resources that are necessary to become confident and well-poised for the sales industry. role-playing is a big part of training at SEG and helps immensely by putting you directly in the shoes of a BDRs' daily routine. At SEG the managers really care about your success and are always there for you if you need support.,Only 1 week of training and the role-playing can get repetitive
24,Sales Empowerment Group,Great Company to Work For,2021-11-19,5.0,Business Development Representative,I just finished my training with SEG and I already know that they're fantastic to work for. This is my first real job and SEG is ensuring that I have the tools to succeed in a competitive business world. All of the management is awesome and it's very exciting to work here.,None that I can think of so far.
25,Sales Empowerment Group,"Great Training, Positive Learning Environment",2021-06-04,5.0,Business Development Representative,"1) Training was really good, and the managers all had very helpful advice and were super constructive in their feedback. Lots of people in my training group, myself included, had no previous sales experience. They never made me feel discouraged but offered a lot of really helpful solutions to problems I was facing. I went from having no idea what I was doing to having a sense of confidence in my sales abilities after my SEG training week.
2) Everyone, including the partners, is very approachable. Each of them has let us know that we can come talk to them at any time, for any reason.
3) They seem to use a lot of positive reinforcement. Everyone is ready to celebrate each other's successes.
4) They recognize effort first. If you're not getting meetings right away, the managers will work with you to help you get there. As long as you put in the work, they're not just going to fire you because you didn't get x amount of meetings in a certain time period.","Everyone has a different approach to sales, so you'll probably get a lot of conflicting advice. This team will help you figure out what works for YOU though."
26,Sales Empowerment Group,Successful 1st week of Trianing,2021-12-17,5.0,Buissness Development Representative,"Truly care about being as personalized as possible. 
Great roleplaying",Their are no cons at all
27,Sales Empowerment Group,Really great company,2021-05-28,5.0,Business Development Representative,"Got me set up with a client in just 3 days after applying to them. Really quick response after applying. The best part was all the help they give you to get ready for the interview. The help they gave me got me to excel at my interview so much so that they gave me a job offer just 3 hours after the interview (that's the fastest response I'd ever gotten)! 

The training they give you is amazing too. There's so much interactive roleplaying that lets you get used to talking on the phone with clients. I came in fresh and honestly just a week in I feel like I can do well with this job.","They slowly ease you into your company (that you will be working for along with SEG) as the training progresses, so you don't really learn much about what your company does till a few days into the training. It's not really a downside since they only just teach you the basics at the beginning but I can see it being helpful to absorb information that's more relevant to what you'll need."
28,Sales Empowerment Group,SEG completely changed my life and I’m forever great FIO and blessed to have worked there.,2021-04-08,5.0,BDR Representative,"When I first started at SEG I thought I was nothing more than a pro athlete with no work skills to my name. From the moment I stepped into the office everything changed for the better. SEG is full of hardworking people from the CEO, managers, all the way down to the BDR’s. They truly care about each persons individual development as well as the companies. Working for Erin, Scott, and Joe has been one of the best experiences in my life. Without the encouragement, warm welcoming, and the support from Erin my manager I don’t know what I’d be doing now. I recently got promoted to full time at my company. Looking back on the hard work I put in for the 8 months at SEG, I recommend anybody trying to jump start their sales career should check out SEG. So to Brian and the rest of the amazing people at SEG thank you for allowing me to grow and for showing me that work experience isn’t everything. That it’s the heart and the desire of that individual to achieve greatness.",Nothing comes to mind at all.
29,Sales Empowerment Group,Excellent place to work and grow your sales career!,2021-10-05,5.0,Sales Manager,The environment and culture here is great. Everyone is supportive and wanting to help you succeed and grow you skills as a sales professional. Management is easy to talk to and always available to help.

30,Sales Empowerment Group,Great place to learn the basics and start your career,2021-09-17,5.0,Business Development Representative,There are a lot of great reviews here and they are correct. Sales Empowerment Group has done an amazing job of helping me be a great sales person. I would seriously recommend this company to anyone who is interested in a career in sales. You will not find a better place and I really enjoy going to work everyday.,No downsides really but sales is not for everyone.
31,Sales Empowerment Group,Builds Amazing Confidence,2021-10-14,5.0,Sales Trainee,"After just one week of training, my confidence is way higher. There is extensive information on sales tactics as well as peer and mentor feedback on assignments.","All of the classes are virtual, which can be a downside but this is the world we live in now! Better safe than sorry."

The team welcomes you with open arms, the new hires were great, the whole staff is awesome. They get you prepared for the challenges in sales, and are very personable!",No cons here at SEG.
34,Sales Empowerment Group,Great training,2021-06-11,5.0,Business Development Representative,"1) Being completely new to sales, I think that the SEG team did a great job at introducing the basics of sales and then further building up my knowledge of the industry with practical advice and situations. I feel well equipped to start being a BDR.
2) The whole team is very approachable and caring. Although the training is done fully remotely, I feel like I could reach out to anyone through email or LinkedIn and get valuable constructive feedback.
3) The role playing was extremely helpful. I got to understand what a good sales pitch should contain and then practicing building one.","Training was pretty spaced out throughout the first week, which meant I had a lot of unexpected breaks during the day. It could have been more concise instead of lasting the full week."
35,Sales Empowerment Group,"You will learn, and you will do great",2021-10-02,5.0,Business Development Representative (BDR),"Great training, great pay, great people. The Job training they give you is revolutionary by itself.","There’s none, honestly. This is a group of people that care about you doing great."
36,Sales Empowerment Group,Worse Job I've Had,2021-11-17,1.0,Business Development,"Possibility of moving on with a company you've been contracted to work with, but it's all based on sales metrics","-Very low diversity, also no LGBTQIA+ person has lasted longer than three months-this was specifically talked about frequently among the other employees
-Terrible pay for a job in downtown Chicago, 38,000 is not enough to live off of
-It's a sales gig and you can be fired at any moment for not meeting your targets
-No work-life balance"
37,Sales Empowerment Group,"Great company, all of the managers and CEO are great",2021-06-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I just finished my group training with SEG today and everyone on the team was extremely helpful and gave great feedback! The CEO Brian was very helpful and was there at every step to help us along the way! I really appreciated their hands on approach, and even though we were working virtually everyone still managed to make it feel like we were in office with them! Great company.","Everyone had different feedback and their own style on how they liked to do things, so sometimes it would get confusing during role playing with the other bosses, but over all it allowed us to see different perspectives."
38,Sales Empowerment Group,"If you like sales, this is for you. If not, steer clear",2021-10-20,4.0,BDR,"-Attentive managers that want to help you succeed

40,Sales Empowerment Group,My First Sales Experience,2021-03-05,5.0,Business Development Representative,"This is my first sales experience and just completed my first week of training. Let me tell you, I have never experienced an organization where everyone takes the time to get to know you and sets you up for success. Even the CEO is involved and helps with training! I was really nervous to start on Day 1 and now after completing Day 5, I feel more confident. Their training program really prepares you for any scenario; all the role playing has been really helpful. I would highly recommend starting your sales career with Sales Empowerment Group.","If you're new to sales, the beginning of your training may seem a little challenging and overwhelming but I promise you by the end of the week you will understand their training style. You'll look back and say, OK, that wasn't so bad! The management team has also been really involved with training and they really take the time to help you learn and grow!"

The support that I have received over the course of my time with SEG, has been world class. Everyone was so welcoming, and you could tell that everyone genuinely cared about your personal success.","The only con was that the repetition in the training, do to the need to fully grasp the material."

47,Sales Empowerment Group,A Truly Great Company,2020-12-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"First and foremost they truly care about their people. Your managers and mentors will go to bat for you. They have in depth training on sales and the account you are working with.

The CEO and executives are always thinking of ways to provide incentives and make this the best experience they can. They listen to feedback.
Your managers will help you improve your skills.
You have good work/life balance
The goals and numbers you're expected to hit are very reasonable and not overbearing.
All of your coworkers are good people who are willing to help you.
With Covid they are still finding ways of maintaining an exciting company culture, but before they would do plenty of office activities to keep you motivated.

Probably the most important thing is the opportunity to work with a company or a certain industry that would otherwise be hard to get into on your own. Specially true if you're right out of college or little experience like I had.","Not so much a con, but since it is sales you get what you put in."

My client and SEG has trained me on the industry, how to communicate with C-Level people and more importantly I have so much confidence that I can do this long-term. The training is great and my manager is in the trenches with me on a daily basis. I had a chance to do my first account review (at 90 day mark) with the CEO and CFO of a billion dollar Medical company I work for. It was nerve-racking, however, it made me even more excited on my career.",The training is intense and it is not for everyone.

The commitment to the employee's success is welcoming and, more importantly, genuine. If you do your job, they'll look out for you.

-Since my first day, SEG has provided me with opportunities to engage and interact with my colleagues of all levels in a comfortable, personal way on a daily basis. I've formed friendships and close bonds with some other employees; and while, I still haven't talked to probably over 1/3rd of the office, there is a surprisingly, infectious communal atmosphere that just seems to persevere. 

-Office location is super convenient and has a lot to offer around it.","In sales, mindset can be a very defeatist art sometimes, especially if you are just starting out. So, just finding the resilience to be willing to get up and keep trying is a major aspect of this position, which has the potential to be intimidating for a lot of people.

You learn a lot fast and build skills for a sales career - whether that's continuing as a BDR or becoming an Account Executive or sales manager in the future.,"Hard to think of any, to be honest. If I were to come up with one it'd be that if you're not really sure if sales is something you're interested in, the BDR role here might not be a great fit. But this holds true at any organization.

Leadership helps you stay motivated by keeping your goals before you and incentivizing you to try harder. 
Everyone enjoys competing at SEG which breeds a positive atmosphere and creates a selling frenzy.

99,Sales Empowerment Group,You will get out what you put in,2020-07-01,5.0,Business Development Representative,"Management and ownership are heavily invested in making sure you learn, improve, network, and have access to resources to be successful. If you are transitioning from a different career, a recent college graduate, or just new to sales in general, then SEG is an excellent place to learn foundational skills that will help launch your career. Their business model is essentially to pair you with another company to work inside sales for that client while getting extensive sales training from SEG. They are invested in making sure you become successful and get hired off full time to that client. If for some odd reason something happens with that client and you are not hired off to them full time (and you are a good person/hard worker), they will help you get another position with a different client instead of you having to job search on your own.","Some of the BDRs don't take the job as seriously as they should so don't pick up on bad habits or get lazy. The immature employees turn into complainers which is not a unique problem to SEG. You will get out what you put in. The pay isn't top dollar, but again SEG is more about launching you into a long term successful career rather than a quick cash grab as a BDR."

Management is always putting on competitions for the floor so there is room to get some extra money or prizes. I have been able to grow every day and hone my sales skills for the future. 

The training was excellent, and if you take it seriously you will see the results and your commissions will reflect it!The work/life balance couldn't be better. Work starts at 8 everyday, but ends at 4:30! Management encourages to not ""take work home with you.""

- Great networking opportunities
- Fun in and out of office activities throughout the month
- A helpful transition out of college and into the real world
- The overall job is not hard and is very straightforward
- Help you improve and grow in sales
- Perfect for temporary job","Do not let the good reviews fool you like it fooled me. Overall, SEG is a great opportunity if you are seeking help to get hired for a sales position in an industry of your liking since they let you pick and choose from the different types of accounts. However, SEG itself is all over the place. I was straight out of college when I started working with them and had no idea what I was stepping into. The recruiters make it seem like it's a wonderful place to work for and an opportunity of a lifetime, but it's nothing like that. Everyday I felt like I was not treated as an adult with potential because I was constantly talked down to and destructively compared to others around me. There is no room for personal and/or professional growth here because it honestly feels like you're back in high school, which is not somewhere you want to be right out of college. I can go on and on, but the main reason for this review is to warn job seekers because I wish I was warned."
106,Sales Empowerment Group,AMAZING COMPANY,2020-05-01,5.0,BDR,"This company is honestly the best company that I have ever worked for. If you were in sales before, you know that sales is hard and it is a grind. SEG continues to make sales a fun environment. One thing that is amazing is that they have your back.

In my time one person went from hitting the phones to actual outside sales (and she was a rockstar who grinded for so long, it was long overdue). Basically if you are trying to make lots of money and move up in your career, there are plenty of places to do that. This aint it.

We've worked closely with my account which, alongside SEG management, has supported me in this learning process. Overall this has been a great experience.","As with any inside sales job, working the phones gets very repetitive and can drain my motivation from time-to-time.

-Room to grow. This is the biggest one. The company is growing like crazy right now and if you are willing to do the work then not only are there opportunities to get hired by your client, but there is ample opportunity to move up in SEG itself.","The only thing I would say is that the temperature of the office is not always the best, but it's not a huge deal when you're working in a job you like everyday."

125,Sales Empowerment Group,I have Been Working at SEG,2019-09-26,5.0,BDR,Everyone has the chance to prove their way into being hired on by their client account.  Those who put in the effort will put themselves in a great position to do just that. Those who try to just skate by (do minimums on dials) probably wont get hired on by their account or have it take a lot longer (this creates some healthy competition),Some people are there to just try and get by/don't show signs of trying to improve themselves when they have a great opportunity in front of them. If your a hard worker it can be a little irritating being surrounded by them.

After being here over a year, I have worked with multiple Managers and I can definitely say that they all have the BDRs best interest in mind when providing feedback and coaching. It's no question that I have progressed a ton since when I first began. This has been in large part do to SEG's hands on coaching and encouragement. It has been a great first job out of college and I have learned a great deal.",The job can be a grind and hitting the phones for hours every day isn't for everyone.
127,Sales Empowerment Group,great launching pad,2020-01-24,5.0,Business Development Representative,SEG is a really fun office and I genuinely like the people I work with. The atmosphere is really casual so you can dress pretty comfortably.

The Office - Being able to collaborate with people on different accounts and strategize prospecting techniques is helpful in the approach to your role. It is helpful that majority of the employees fall in the same demographic, making the work collaboration more natural and easier to assimilate.

- Resources - In one office you are able to approach anyone from the CEO to HR to Business Development Reps in a matter of seconds. Along with that, having access to some of the SEG technology resources is super helpful","I don't have any pressing cons to share. It is what you make it.

I will not lie, it can be hard at times and management will coach and push you to new heights.  You are actually picked by SUG's partnering client with the plans of hiring you away in 9-12 months.  I was picked by the CEO and the VP of Sales from my partnering client and I am 2-3 months away from being hired away.  SUG teaches you the sales world - researching companies, sending out customize emails, how to use LinkedIn, cold calling and setting qualified meetings.  My Manager can be tough at times, however, I realize the big picture and I know that it will lead to my advancement in my career.  He is a very nice person, however, he does expect me to hit my metrics & meeting marks each month.  Lastly, I like that the VP of Sales for my partnering client actually comes to our site and spends time with me.  SUG is a great place to work if you are driven and do not mind hard-work.","Over the past 6 months we have added many more accounts and management.   The CEO has high demands and you can tell that is pushed down to management.  If you are someone that doesn't mind to be held accountable then you will flourish,  If not, it usually ends pretty quickly.  That means some of my friends have left."

140,Sales Empowerment Group,Sales Executive,2018-02-06,5.0,Sales Executive,"Great place to start your career. You're in an environment with (mostly) young professionals that are right out of college. This naturally creates an energetic, competitive environment. Ping pong tables, complimentary cereal, snacks, etc. The fun environment makes cold calling for 8 hours a day a lot more doable. 

You're hired for a client - so it's in your best interest to make sure you like the client before accepting the position. 

Enjoyed that there was hourly reports on our numbers. Gave us a goal to constantly work towards versus monthly goals that seemed far off and hard to reach. 

Lastly, had one of the best managers I ever had at SUG. Still keep in touch.","On the flip side, also had one of the worst managers ever at SUG. It was really upsetting to deal with that individual on a daily basis.

It can be hard for some people to stay motivated and driven while in a such a fun environment. This causes the managers to be hard on some people, but they really do have your best interest in mind. It can come across as managers looking out for themselves (i.e. they need you to perform, in order to meet their goals)."
141,Sales Empowerment Group,Room to Grow,2018-02-14,5.0,Business Development Representative,"To be honest, my first months at SUG were shaky and a lot of change was going on but those changes made the best work environment. This company has grown in such a short period of time and I am extremely happy with my decision to stay in the shaky months because now I am thriving at an amazing company. 

The people here are some of the best people I have had the pleasure to work with and there is a lot of opportunity for employee engagement through company organized activities including  daily huddles, holiday celebrations, company wide incentives, and many happy hours! It is not hard to find a friend within this ever-growing organization.

The CEO, Brian, has come to be one of the most approachable members of management. He truly does care about the individuals he works with every day and when you come to him with a plan he will do everything in his power to see it through.","If you are not persistent about your own professional growth you will fall between the cracks. Yes this is an entry level job but it can turn into something so much more if you put your success first and ask for the positions, promotions, and responsibilities you want.

Not much to complain about but with the company growing so fast we need more space, more bathrooms, and more resources as a whole. However, it is rumored that we will be expanding our offices soon which should take care of all that."
142,Sales Empowerment Group,My 2 Cents.,2018-08-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Sales University Group provides in-depth training, consistent coaching and a collaborative, team-focused environment.

Leadership all have open door policies from the CEO to Sales Managers,  and feedback can be given directly to leaders during Town Hall Meetings or anonymously through a SUGgestion box - Thanks for bringing those back!

Perks include: Great benefits choices, office provided snacks, and company sponsored happy hours to encourage team building and camaraderie among coworkers.   

This is a sales culture and results are an expectation. If you are serious about starting a career in sales this is a great place to start.  There is a lot of cold calling and some days are challenging, but that's sales!","This isn't really a con, but can be perceived as one if you don't understand the work involved.  The BDR role is focused on lead generation and appointment setting for their clients.  It's definitely the hardest part of sales and it requires a lot of cold calls and emails.  If you don't want to make cold calls, this is not the job for you."

-Clear goals and expectations of your role as a BDR.

-Sense of morality and understanding, instead of hubris comes from managers.  (Also, no Micro Managing and they trust you to do your job) 

-Transparency is also on the rise here over the last 6 months from management.  BDR’s are now in the loop as we continue to grow, and our feedback is valued.     

-BDR’s get an opportunity to work for 2 growing organizations at the same time at SUG, and will have the chance to both interact, and be promoted off to billion dollar companies.  

-Constant training and encouraging educational environment for anyone new, or used to sales.

-SUG promotes creativity and education within a sales environment and allows you to learn about lead generation, marketing, email crafting, CRM best practices, and social media selling.","-Office is in an amazing location, but could be a bit more colorful.

It's a relatively young crowd, and everyone in the management is awesome. They really value your growth and development as a salesperson. There is so much to learn about how start-ups and small businesses across a variety of industries function too. By working at SUG, you will gain legitimate business development experience and good friends that you can carry with you when you leave for the rest of your career.","There are a lot of different accounts at SUG. Some of them may be a better fit for you than others. I'll reiterate from the posts below that if you aren't willing to do the work, make lots of dials, and take on the challenges of inside sales, then perhaps SUG (or any sales position in general) isn't the right place for you. However, if you are willing to work hard and show an openness to learn and grow, then the management will happily assist you in taking the track you want to pursue with the company. There is a light at the end of the tunnel for those who are ambitious and willing to persevere."
147,Sales Empowerment Group,High School !,2019-11-15,1.0,BDR,Jokes are funny I guess,This place is becoming a huge joke. There are like 2 good people in leadership and the CEO scared everyone else into being condescending. I either feel like I’m in high school or elementary school when I go in. Honestly it’s getting worse every day and you can feel the tension. Whenever there’s happiness or laughter in the office the ceo or management shuts that ish down with a huddle designed for pre-k shaming.
148,Sales Empowerment Group,Great Business Development and Fun! Great place to work!,2018-01-10,5.0,Sales Manager,"-A place that cares about its people. Setting up BDRs for eventual hiring-off, promotion, internal growth. It is apparent that if you work hard, you will be noticed and rewarded. Hard work is valued. I also want to note that I have never felt that 80's sales aggressive mentality here. That was my biggest selling point in coming to this company. It is sales, but sales that is a fast track for your professional development.
-Culture is great too. A lot of artists work here and we tend to share our various projects with each other. We have contests such as pie-in-the-face, gift cards, and other incentives and competitions between teams. 
-Communication. You can talk to top management truly whenever, as our CEO and President are constantly on the floor working with us. They are always available to talk your motivations, questions, and wants for the future.","-The business is rapidly growing, and so the process (and addition of a lot of newbies) is just a tad chaotic. But a lot more exciting than chaotic.  :)"
149,Sales Empowerment Group,Amazing,2016-11-03,5.0,Business Development Representative,"I have a lot of great things to say about this company but unfortunately I can only write so much. With the amount of great reviews this place has you'd think they were all fake. They are not.

Working here is not only great experience but it gives you higher standards for what to expect from your work place. Communication between the associates and managers is unlike anything I've ever seen. The culture is something that separates SUG from any other business development environment. It does not feel like a call center. Coming to work, really, is like coming to another home. Everyone gets along and you make not only great professional connections, but friends as well.

Upper management, including the CEO and COO, have been some of my favorite people to work for.  When you feel like you're ready for the next steps in your career, communication is all it takes to get things going. You can easily pop your head into their offices and they are more than willing to address your concerns.",I really can't think of any. Some times the associates leave food in the fridge too long?
150,Sales Empowerment Group,Solid Company,2018-07-20,5.0,BDR,"I have worked for SUG for 9 months.  Of course, like any sales job, it can be great days and tough days based on my success.  SUG had a great training program, my client was great to work with and most of all I enjoyed the people that work at SUG.  At times, we lean on each other when we are struggling throughout the day, which it is good to bounce ideas off of each other.  My Manager is pretty young, however, I like that he has walked in my shoes (previous BDR) and can relate to the ups and downs of sales.  Overall people care for my well-being and they have a big push to get you hired away after 9-12 months.","Since SUG has so many clients you need to make sure you are working for a client that really cares.  I believe the majority of the clients do, however, I have seen a couple of situations over the past 9 months that I was not sure.  My client was great!!!!!!"

The managers here truly care about their employees, and you really don't find that much in this day and age. 

The training is also great. I had sales training before this job, which was good, but for some reason  I became much more confident and knowledgeable about the sales process after working here. They provide you with different tools and sales techniques that will best mend with your personality. 

The last thing I'll mention is the culture! They definitely hire people with similar attributes, values, and characteristics. I was always happy in my environment there and pleased with the people I got to work with.","Since this is a third-party sales company, there can be some ambiguity with the length of how long the clients will continue utilizing Sales University Group's services."

The managers are awesome and have your best interest. They genuinely care about your success and will go over and beyond to help you improve. With only being at SUG for 3 months, I was hired on by my account and I owe the opportunity to the management team. They pushed me to work hard and showed me that work hard does really pay off. 

The culture of this company is what makes doing cold calling from 8-4:30 so worth it.

I loved my team, and hated to leave them.","-Several accounts pulled out during my tenure there. If one of the larger accounts pulled out, the company could be in serious risk of going under. So, when any month isn't the best month in the history of the company, management is constantly breathing down everyone's neck, even though they start every sentence with ""I'm not a micro-manager, but..."" 
-They will sell you on millennial culture, the cereal bar, the ping pong table (which they took away more than a few times).  These things are designed to distract new members of the work force from realizing that they are being underpaid with weak benefits and the most minuscule sick/vacation policy I have ever seen. 
-Recently, they began having meetings telling employees that recruiters reaching out to them are essentially liars and can't offer them a better opportunity than SUG. This is obviously something only a desperate individual would do to hang on to talent that is starting to realize this company is a complete and utter joke.

Not everyone makes it and it is not easy.  However, if you stay the course and work-hard great things will happen.  The client bumped my pay plan by $20,000……………which is what SEG and the client told me in the beginning.  The people are wonderful and the CEO, Tracy Wood and Brandon are great.  The training is second to none and if you do hard-work it will pay-off.","We have people come and go.  I would say 20% of people cannot take the accountability.

-Fairly relaxed office atmosphere. The BDRs are pretty easygoing on the whole, and account managers do try to put you in a position to be successful.

-System is in place to create fun events in the office. Free beer once a month on Fridays, recently did an office talent show, etc.

-Ongoing initiatives in place to improve company culture through open discussion Town Hall meetings, led by a recently promoted VP.","-Your experience here really depends on what account you get assigned to. Some accounts truly intend to hire you, other accounts don't. Some accounts are easier to set meetings for than others. It's luck of the draw.

-Commission is misrepresented as $50 per meeting set. It is $50 per meeting set - before taxes. The actual figure after taxes is around $33 per meeting set. 

-The open floor is not always conducive to staying on track. You have to get used to hearing other people talk loudly around you, which can be distracting."

Training is thorough and is extremely helpful in the long term.
CEO and President make sure that you aren't just dialing, there is a plan to be hired on by the account in 1-2 years.
Everyone is super open and inviting, upper management aren't afraid to have one-on-ones with people.
Beer 30 fridays are fun with lots of out of office activities as well.","With growth comes growing pains, some of my favorite mangers were fired recently due to ""decisions"" made by other stack-holders in the business for reasons that weren't clear but I get it.
The account you are on will really shape your experience. Some are harder than others.
If you aren't hitting your numbers, you get micro-managed.
Lack of transparency at times, but overall good."
169,Sales Empowerment Group,Ideal Work Culture--right here!!,2019-03-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"SEG is such a good, supportive place to be and come in every day. 
Everyone is so nice and caring (and also funny, we crack good jokes around here), and makes the day the day quite enjoyable and entertaining.
The work is rewarding,  the management team genuinely cares about your well-being and your career aspirations, and the BDRs are just the best. Good people that work hard, care, and also play hard. 
We have a Nintendo 64 hooked up at all times (super smash bro. tournaments), as well as ping-pong, fooze-ball, etc. We also have karaoke afternoons after work during beer 30s. 
There is definite growth opportunity, whether if it is with your client or internally (SEG is in a really big growth spurt right now). 

Thankful for the opportunity and wouldn't wanna be anywhere else :)",can't think of any :)

Since being here the CEO, COO, and managers truly care about my growth. I've learned so much in so little time. Going into a new client, I feel they're making sure my next one will best fit my work ethic. The working environment is not stiff, its relaxed and fun. I never felt bad about making a mistake, its a learning process here. If you need to build a sales/marketing career, this is the place to start!",No cons really. The work is hard sometimes but what isn't? I do feel all workers should have a promising future of getting hired in a specific amount of months if they're working hard.
171,Sales Empowerment Group,My take on SUG,2018-03-19,5.0,,"In an age of revolving door corporate jobs, it's refreshing to be at a place that sees the value in you. If they feel you aren't a great fit in one lane, they'll extend the honor of placing you in a  lane that best meets your needs. Here are some perks:
1. Cultural diversity
2. Young culture 20-40 somethings.
3. Casual attire
4. Bi weekly pay
5. Occasional themed Fridays
Monthly commissions on checks","I won't lie, the current building is a little tight at times which can be a hassle. This is cause much growth underway. But a few months from now, we'll be in a new building with many benefits (huge space, gym membership, etc.)."

Frequent company bonding events that bring the whole team closer and closer.
Salary pay and bonuses based on performance so you can have that security as well as the motivation to work harder. 
Great sales experience and upward mobility to allow continued career development.
Fantastic entry level job. 
Open minded and easy to talk to higher-ups.
Open floor plan makes me not feel trapped.","Open floor plan also contributed to distractions.

They work with their clients to incubate future sales talent.  The majority of sales associates are recruited away by their client in 12 months.   In the meantime SUG focuses on setting qualified meetings for partnering clients.  It truly is a win for the client, for the sales professional and for SUG.","If you do not like to be held accountable or management structure this is not the place to work.  The clients expect performance.  However, if you do well, you get a bump in base and your role usually changes."

It is not only a fun place with great people, but you can interact other client companies and you have the opportunity to get promoted rather quickly into those companies. It's in a great location in the city and often times we had a lot of fun outings. Lastly, management has an open door policy.

On a professional note, I just started my new job and we covered prospecting. I honestly can say that I knew more about researching my target clients and the tools to do so ( Sales Naviagator etc) then the person showing us how to prospect.

The healthcare benefits are really the best. Gayann and Tracy really do listen to the BDR 'sand look out for thier wellebeing and happiness a.

CEO Brian is really passionate about the company as well and is always making sure that BDR's feeling listened too  and respected.","Hire people who really want to go into Sales. This may be hard to do but I think it would make a world of a difference.

It's a game-changer when you're challenged to come up with and execute actionable solutions for your clients that get them to where they want to be.,"Like any young and fast-growing company, structure and process is something that is still being defined so, in order to thrive here, you need to be someone who's self-motivated, adaptable and excited about creating opportunities that may not exist today."

181,Sales Empowerment Group,Business Development Rep,2018-08-08,4.0,Business Development Representative,"- Young office life
- Managers understand the BDR role and the troubles that come along with it
- Managers are easy to communicate with 
- Hard work gets noticed","- Tough day-to-day job
- If you're not genuinely trying to get into sales, you won't want this job
- Getting ""matched"" on an account isn't as easy as it sounds 
...if you're looking into SUG for a job - my advice would be to heavily research the company that they are trying to match you with and really think if sales is the industry you want to start a career in. People will complain about the pay but any entry-level sales position starts at roughly the same pay scale."
182,Sales Empowerment Group,My experience at Sales University Group,2017-10-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's a great entry level position for those who are new to sales. I have received some excellent training from my managers that will be of use to me throughout my career (e.g. how to use LinkedIn & Sales Navigator effectively, time management, and résumé tips to name a few). 
Additionally my managers have also shown on multiple occasions to be genuinely concerned with my personal as well as professional well-being.",Sometimes the client you are paired with isn't the best match for you.
183,Sales Empowerment Group,Great Opportunity For Young College Grads Who WANT to Work in Sales,2018-02-02,5.0,Business Development Associate,"I worked at SUG for just under one year. My actual experience there fit with exactly what I was promised when I first started the job. I made on average eighty to one hundred calls per day, and then I was hired out ten months later. Now I am making six-figures in that same company just a year-and-a-half later. I loved my co-workers there and still keep in touch with many of them. They have fun activities in the office, and occasionally fun company outings. In training they taught me to effectively listen to the prospect's needs and identify pain points with open-ended questions; a tactic which I still use to this day.","The company tripled in number of employees while I was there. There were clear signs of growing pains occasionally. I have to admit that at times I felt uncertain/anxious about the future of my career at SUG. I was first placed on an account which didn't work out, but I trusted the process with patience, and everything worked out well in the end.

I do have to say that I had a great experience at SUG because I wanted to stay in sales long-term. Many of the SUG employees (like myself) got a liberal arts degree with no clear, financially secure career plan right out of undergrad. I felt that sort of frustration for years, and it's particularly miserable with crushing student loan debt. I sense a lot of that frustration in these negative reviews. Here is an important factor to keep in mind: An entry-level sales position is not just like any ""real job"" which you are qualified to take with a liberal arts and sciences degree. Succeeding in sales requires a tremendous amount of grit. You need to be prepared and willing to sustain all sorts of emotionally exhausting experiences if you want to succeed in not only SUG but in any sales role in general. If you don't want to make lots of phone calls each day, experience regular criticism, and pu yourself through periods of uncertainty to advance your career, then don't work in sales. If you don't want to be working in sales five years from now, then don't work at SUG."

There isn't much else to say I just need a 20 word minimum for this section. 

Actually, the location is a great location. State and Hubbard","Such low pay that it makes it impossible to live in the city and save for future plans; like we're all lectured about. 

They throw you to the wolves and on the phones. Now to a certain extent this is fine; because for the most part that is how you learn but they put up this huge front to their clients that there is all of this training involved and how they develop you throughout the process. False..

The job itself is zero fun, you'll feel like a robot - tough to enjoy. Then again it's not manual labor if that's how you want to look at it.

193,Sales Empowerment Group,Great Company to Work and Learn,2018-02-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Fast growing company with great opportunities for a person who is willing to learn and work hard. A great place to start a Sales career. Management is supportive and I felt had my best interest in mind and not just the company. Fun atmosphere and a lot of great coworkers that I miss.,This is not a job for the unmotivated. You have to be willing to put in the time.
194,Sales Empowerment Group,Best Job I've Ever Had!,2016-03-17,5.0,Business Development Associate,"Sales University Group is a great place to work for recent college grads interested in getting a successful sales career off the ground. There is plenty of opportunity for growth here. There is a clear and relatively quick path of promotion for those willing to work hard and do what is reasonably expected of them. I worked in inside sales at another company in Chicago for seven months before transitioning over to SUG. I can say with full confidence that you will not find another inside sales work environment where you are treated with more respect than at this place.

The management here has given me nearly full independence on my strategies for setting meetings and how I carry out my daily tasks. If I ever have any problems, they are usually quick to address them. I have increasingly exceeded my performance expectations. I consistently earn double or even triple of the commission which I was told I could expect to make in the interview process five months ago.

This company strives toward a culture of valuing employees' development. They offer further training for those who need it, and routinely ask for our feedback. We now have opportunities to build our resumes outside of our daily tasks at work too. For example, I now sit on the Employee Policy Council. Other employees participate in the philanthropy council and engagement council. We are not scolded for taking breaks every once in a while; and we hold sales incentive competitions every week. We also occasionally hold fun company events after work (holiday parties, Bulls game suites, bowling, etc.). This is definitely a fun place for twenty-somethings to work in Chicago. Great co-workers too!","This company is growing rapidly. There were under 20 people working here when I first started. Now there are over 40 people working here, most of whom were hired in a one-month period. Communication with individual accounts can become difficult to manage at times now, depending on the account. 

Sales isn't for everyone. SUG does everything they can to make the process fun and motivating, but if you aren't willing to make a lot of phone calls, then this job isn't for you. Some accounts do better than others as in many inside sales offices too."
195,Sales Empowerment Group,An Honest Review of SUG- A Great Place to Work,2017-01-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I found working at SUG to be a great experience for several reasons. 

Firstly, you will develop sales skills that you can use for the rest of your life. Cold-calling either C-level executives or lawyers or doctors is a great way to sharpen your communication skills. It forces you to refine your approach until your strike the right balance between courtesy, professionalism, positioning your pitch, and most importantly active listening skills. As you start to get more comfortable doing this, you'll realize you've developed a very helpful skill that you can take with you anywhere. 

Secondly, management is great to work for. Their approached is very balanced. You will be accountable to your daily activity, and you will be coached to refine your appraoch, but you won't be micromanaged or sense that you're contantly under the gun. They'll give you the input you need to highten your sales ability. While you should expect to be accountable, you will be able to figure out an approach that works best for you. 

Thirdly, the team environment makes it a really fun place to work. From my experience, sales tends to attract people who like to think on the upside, as thinking on the upside is one of the most important parts of the job itself. You will work with some really smart, fun, and cool people. 

Lastly, SUG provides some great professional opportunities. SUG does outsourced sales for their clients; after a certain period of time, you have the opportunity to get hired on to work with your client directly, and this may include a significant pay increase. Also, from the sound of things, SUG will be expanding and there will be some opportunities to get promoted within. 

All in all, there are a lot of good reasons to work at SUG. SUG helps you develop sales skills you can use for the rest of your life, the management strikes a good balance between coaching you to improve you sales ability without micromaging, there is a fun team environment, and there are opportunities to get hired on or to get promoted within. You can start a sales career here and the skills you learn in your first year provide a solid foundation.","There really are no cons about working at SUG. I have worked in many environments, and this is a great one."
