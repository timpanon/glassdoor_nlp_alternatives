0,SecureLink (TX),Good place to work from home,2022-02-04,5.0,Technical Operations Analyst,Excellent place to work. Everyone is supportive.,Information is somewhat tribal knowledge but is being addressed
1,SecureLink (TX),Changing for the worse,2022-03-31,2.0,Software Developer,A Good work life balance,"Low starting pay and a quick salary cap. Other tech companies pay over twice as much (not exaggerating), especially since inflation has picked up. 

Attrition skyrocketed recently. 

Some management is very unqualified to manage people and would do better in other positions. Lots of gossip and blatant favoritism."
2,SecureLink (TX),Concern Regarding the Path Forward,2022-02-10,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Most people are great, work hard and work well together. The team has come together to do amazing things and will continue to do so if given the opportunity.","Retaining these great people is a challenge SecureLink is facing because the obvious solution of ""pay people what they're worth"" seems to be off the table. I'm watching people leave faster than we can find new employees because SecureLink paid below market years ago and has not attempted to rectify that or keep up as the market changes."
3,SecureLink (TX),Was a great company to be a part of a few years ago,2021-12-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are some amazing, talented, brilliant, and all around amazing people at SecureLink however these folks seem to be leaving at a steady pace for better opportunities. The amazing culture of the company has been steadily declining over the past few years and with remote work the culture took a massive hit and new executive leadership is detracting from the former culture instead of creating a new culture that fosters loyalty.","1. SecureLink pays WAY below market rate for everyone except execs (i'm assuming here). Everyone that has left has gone on to a new role with a %50+ pay raise.
2. Senior Management lacks diversity and although they are trying to make improvements the culture has started to skew very ""sales bro"" and that is very off putting.
3. Transparency - This was something that was amazing a couple years ago and now it seems like no one knows what is going to happen next or what the plans for the company are.
4. While complaints and concerns are absolutely heard (Lexi is amazing) - there often seems to be a lack of any action and some people continue to thrive while producing nothing but negativity."
4,SecureLink (TX),The Best of the Best,2021-10-04,5.0,Senior Business Development Representative,"- The culture (really though). It's a laid back and truly caring culture where everyone is a resource and happy to help. 
- Leadership is really talented and there to support you and help you succeed. ""No dumb questions"" approach, with management truly invested in their teams.
- The benefits are top of the line. It's great having the peace of mind that your health insurance is fully covered and that contributions are being made to retirement and HSA accounts.
- They like to promote internally and are there to help you in determining career path and helping you get there. 
- Work hard and it does not go un-noticed. Hard work is certainly rewarded. SecureLink loves to celebrate success!

In short, SecureLink provides you all the resources and support you need to be successful and have fun doing it.",I racked my brain for cons but I honestly can't think of any.
5,SecureLink (TX),"Continued growth, exciting changes ahead!",2021-10-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This company has bold aspirations. It's growth goals are bold. It's solution/product evolution is bold. Do we have it all figured out, nope. Have we shown the willingness to admit when we have a few approaches that are off, yes. SL and it's owners are poised to make the needed investments to bring our solutions together under a unified umbrella which will be important to our customers. It's cliche to say that it cares but it does. The company cares about it's people and lets leadership invest in it's own ideas around professional and personal development.",Everyone has a pace. At times I do wish that we were able to increase the pace of some of the other folks to allow us to move faster.
6,SecureLink (TX),Doesn't get much better than SecureLink!,2021-07-22,5.0,Current Employee,"Amazing work/life balance, unlimited PTO & flexible schedule - get your work done & done well & you can take the time to rest & enjoy living life to the fullest - so crucial to not burn out! I have the support I need without being micromanaged, great leadership. I have loved the opportunity to explore different areas of the business & find a niche that fits my interest - lots of opportunities for career growth & changing your career path.","Salary paired with traditional benefits (HSA contribution, PTO, etc) & non-traditional benefits (made to order chef for breakfast/lunch, office amenities, gym) is spot on; however, I think w/ a shift to remote work for many employees, salary has shifted to being less competitive w/out those non-traditional benefits."
7,SecureLink (TX),Best Place to work hands down,2022-01-12,5.0,Software Developer,"Respectful and considerate to employees
Career mobility within the company
Passionate about learning and teaching skills",Fire-hose of information which can be intimidating
8,SecureLink (TX),LOVE IT HERE,2022-01-12,5.0,BDR Representative,"Great teams, Remote available, Dope office",none that i can think of
9,SecureLink (TX),Great place to work!,2022-01-05,5.0,Content Manager,Great PTO; Catered lunches; engaged management; lots of room for growth; good pay,The office is super far away
10,SecureLink (TX),"Career builder, Positive Culture and Benefits",2021-05-17,5.0,Technical Operations,"SecureLink as a place to work is a unique combination of establishing an opportunity for those seeking to build a career and want to have fun while doing so. Unlike a clock puncher, daily deliverables are not mundane checkboxes but learning opportunities for your own development, whether building communication (internal/external) or technical skills.

An overall positive culture in which teams across the org integrate for the same goal of success in the product and its customers. 

In '20, there was no hesitation by the board to put restrictions and enforce work from home. This gave the feeling of putting the employee base first.","As an organization, a place to work, there are no major flaws. There are times where it can feel as though the pace of our internal growth has not stayed in sync with the growth of our deployment base. However, external components such as '20 have directly impacted that which teams are making efforts moving forward. While we expect to return the office remote/working from home does not replace the culture and team collaboration experienced when working in the office. Though one would expect neither of these ""cons"" is exclusive to SecureLink's operation, as many businesses have experienced this in the last year."
11,SecureLink (TX),New and thrilled to be here,2021-09-09,5.0,Chief Executive Officer,"The culture and the people are really great. The company does an outstanding job of creating a great place to work, learn, and grow. Lot's of loyal, long standing employees as well as people just starting out. Onboarding and ongoing development is a real strength. Accountability, focus on results, and customer success are all a big part what makes SecureLink awesome. Oh yea, and the in office restaurant (Slinky's) is killer (when we get to go to the office).","Not many so far :) Maybe only the location, the building is excellent, Bee Caves is not totally convenient for everyone, but not that big of an issue WFH and a future hybrid model."
12,SecureLink (TX),Sales,2022-02-01,3.0,Account Executive,Awesome environment and growth potential,Start up feel with leadership lacking in some areas.
13,SecureLink (TX),Great culture. Great Market. Crazy Smart,2021-09-10,5.0,Marketing,"The company genuinely cares about every member of the team. While growing the company is a clear objective, feels like we are as concerned about taking care of our people while we grow. Love that 'fun' is an operative word in our culture. Three day weekend EVERY month!",Struggling with acting bigger than we are. Remote has its challenges of keeping us all together on message and functioning as one. So many new people we've never even met!
14,SecureLink (TX),Flexible company with amazing leadership but low pay,2021-09-21,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have really enjoyed my time at SecureLink. I am challenged, love my team/manager and love the flexibility the company has to offer. Leadership is transparent and makes you feel important. I really don’t think I could find a company that is a better fit culturally for me right now.","The only con in my eye is the pay. Austin has boomed in the last year and the standard of living has increased well past what SecureLink pays their employees in my opinion. With remote work, we no longer get the free breakfast/lunch perk and it does feel like some of us are paid below market value. This would be the only reason/motivator if I ever did choose to leave this company."
15,SecureLink (TX),"Came For the Culture, Staying for the Courageous Curiosity",2021-09-09,5.0,Recruiting Coordinator,"Securelink's onboarding is one of the most thorough I've been a part of. Not only do you learn the product, but you learn the people and can quickly pick up on cultural norms and mantras. 

The company itself is on the move and the massive growth is exciting for everyone on every team in ever department.

Looking forward to eating with my team again post-Covid.","Disclaimer, haven't been here long enough to have a con. BUT considering the interactions I've had colleagues, there aren't very many."
16,SecureLink (TX),"It’s okay, good enough",2021-08-28,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Cool people and pretty good benefits. Never have trouble getting my requested days off. Appreciate how careful execs are being with coming back to the office.,The pay. Working in a customer facing position is stressful. The pay is very low. There’s no reason why employees should be stressing over money and being able to pay their bills.  Pay is below market rate. I know with 100% certainty that there will be many people moving on to higher paying positions with benefits equal to it greater than what SecureLink offers.  Please understand people work for money exclusively - everything else is an added bonus
17,SecureLink (TX),Great Leadership,2021-09-09,5.0,Software Developer,"The biggest pro is the leadership. I feel fortunate to work in an environment where I feel supported and where everyone is committed to helping each other grow and succeed. Individuals at every level are proactive in making themselves available and providing assistance for obstacles large or small. It feels good knowing that your team has your back, and that part of the culture is strongly reinforced from the top down.","I can't think of anything that warrants a ""con"" comment"
18,SecureLink (TX),Great company and people!,2021-09-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The flexibility and work/life balance are great, I feel like the company wants to make sure people aren't getting burnt out. Everyone I've worked with is great, collaboration is awesome and I feel like it's a space when people can be comfortable with presenting their ideas. I feel like the company cares about providing opportunities for employees to learn and listens to employee feedback.",There have been a few growing pains but that's normal within a company.
19,SecureLink (TX),Best Place I’ve Worked,2021-07-22,5.0,Contract Manager,"Everything is clear from the start. I know exactly what I am responsible for. I never worked with technology sales before but the new hire orientation really helped me understand the products. Everyone is willing to help and accessible. Benefits are great. Each month we get an email about a theme (for lack of a better term) of the month and I feel they truly try their best to make the office as inclusive as possible for everyone, and it works.",I can’t think of anything. The end of the quarter/months can be a bit crazy but that is any position where sales are involved.
20,SecureLink (TX),Amazing company culture and people,2021-10-04,5.0,Demand Generation Specialist,Everyone is very supportive and collaborative. You will always feel heard. No matter what life throws your way SecureLink will make sure your work is flexible to support you during those life events. Great work-life balance.,I have never experienced a con since working here.
21,SecureLink (TX),Great Company Culture,2021-10-17,5.0,Professional Services Consultant,Great company to work for with a ton of opportunity for growth.,"Compensation was a little low to start, but it’s a rapidly growing company, so I imagine it will get better."
22,SecureLink (TX),Great place to grow with great people,2021-07-26,5.0,Office Manager,"I joined SecureLink towards the beginning of the year, and have been so grateful for the opportunity. This company has done so much to help foster growth, and push me to learn so much. I have enjoyed working between all the different departments, and learning so much about the tech world. My coworkers and director have done a fantastic job at welcoming me into the team( even with Covid causing so much of our team to work remotely), and being a team driven towards supporting each other and helping us strive to learn more and be better overall.

The benefits have been so incredible as well, like the complimentary breakfast/lunch, 100% medical. HSA and 401K match, and such an awesome work space. Golf simulator, Ping pong tables and game room are pretty awesome too!","The only downside (which is at no fault to no one) is the challenge of Covid and having the team work mostly remotely. We have adjusted so well to how to handle the Covid situation and letting employees work in a situation that makes them most comfortable(100% remote, 100% in office or Hybrid). There has been no pressure to return to the office which has been so comforting. I do wish I could experience what the office life was like prior to Covid, just so I could see what a full office is like, however I do think more employees will gradually come into the office as life goes back to normal. I just want to be able to enjoy all the great benefits and perks with the awesome people we all work with in person already! But overall, I have nothing but good things to say about the company, or my experience working here."

24,SecureLink (TX),Awesome place to work,2021-09-10,5.0,Vice President,"Great group of hard working, fun people. Very interesting, mission critical security product in a fast growing market. Ownership is investing heavily in the company and product.","I'd say commuting to Bee Cave is a con, but since we are remote that's not really a problem anymore."
25,SecureLink (TX),Super nice and smart group of people,2021-09-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Everyone I've met has been so smart, nice, and eager to help. Great attitudes all around.","It's hard to get to know co-workers when working remotely, but that goes for any company these days."

31,SecureLink (TX),Not keeping up,2021-10-26,3.0,Data Scientist,Day to day it's nice to work here.,Terrible maternity leave & they are sketchy about telling you the policy.
32,SecureLink (TX),Voted best place to work for a reason!,2021-02-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,This is a fast-growing company that has a super fun and unique culture. It's a place to learn a bunch and make a BIG impact. Honestly the best career move I could have ever made.,"No equity options available (typical for private equity, bummer) and not the best parental leave (4 weeks) policy. At least compared to the other beyond standard benefits we get, it just doesn't seem to really match up... idk, just always struck me as odd. Plus other companies dominate us on this one."
33,SecureLink (TX),A rare place in software,2021-07-14,5.0,Account Executive,They truly care about you as a person. They give you the tools and learning you need to perform. They believe in creating relationships long term. This goes for employees and customers.,Glassdoor made me list 5 words minimum here
34,SecureLink (TX),Account Executive,2021-05-17,5.0,Account Executive,"Great team, great office, everyone cares a lot about making this a great environment, easy to coordinate and ask for help from others, lots of opportunities for growth both personally and company-wide","Product is very niche, kind of in its own space and solved a very specific problem. If the customer didn't have that problem it could be a tough sell. Also hasn't changed drastically in a long time."
35,SecureLink (TX),Great Company; Wants People Who Culturally Fit in; Loves to Train,2021-02-12,5.0,QA Engineer,SecureLink as a whole is very much about the type of person you are and how you will fit in culturally. They take their time to train you and get in you situated into your role. There is continued learning on their product and they support your individual career goals and cross team promoting. The health insurance is amazing. They also cover phone+internet bills!,I believe the pay could be better for all roles.
36,SecureLink (TX),Entry-Level Hiring DONE RIGHT!,2020-09-09,5.0,Employee,"Lots of companies say they hire entry-level employees, but they fail in two key areas: 1.) they post entry-level jobs, but proceed to require 1-2 years of experience so people with no experience (AKA entry-level candidates) don't even get a look, and 2.) they don't do what it takes to really develop those employees, making for a really bad experience.

SecureLink puts its money where its mouth is on this! First of all, they really are open to candidates with no previous experience. Once those employees are on board, SecureLink makes sure those employees have the resources they need like a really extensive orientation program, boot camps, career paths, ongoing training, and full access to all of LinkedIn Learning's library of content. SecureLink and its managers really are committed to developing and even promoting!

SecureLink also really values it's employees and demonstrates it every day from paying 100% of employee health benefits to how they've handled COVID (basically, we're still 100% WFH and will be until it's safe to go back).","Lots of reviews mention the commute. The office is in Bee Caves, but it's totally worth the drive (and of course, right now, no one is driving anywhere)!"

39,SecureLink (TX),Great culture and team!,2021-02-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"SecureLink is a great company to work for. The culture is great, and they've done a great job of maintaining it through growth. Everyone is smart and by and large, excited about their job, coming to work and doing what is needed to get their job done. They encourage you to take ownership of your work and you know what you need to do to succeed. The benefits are a great bonus too!","None really - when we're in the office in non-Covid times, depending on where you live in Austin, the commute can be lengthy."
40,SecureLink (TX),Amazing work-environment that pushes fun and development,2020-03-04,5.0,Technical Operations,"The culture at SecureLink is everything as advertised; friendly and fun, while being professional and success-driven. Conversations are often casual, and most people in the office are approachable and friendly. At the same time, teams know when to get down to business, and the success of the company as a whole is always at the forefront of everyone's days. In any role at SecureLink, the opportunity to advance your professional skills, technical or otherwise, is immense; many people move about in the company as they discover new passions and skills. There is also a major push for fun, leisure when possible, and a host of benefits that suit the employee first, not the employer. Can't recommend enough.","For the technical operations team specifically, expect to be excluded from most in-office socials; this is just the nature of the job, needing support constantly during business hours, so happy hours or company-wide leisure activities are often skipped out by the team to keep up with work (not to say fun can't be found within the team itself, it very much can be).

Additionally, if working from home is a deal-breaker, it should be noted that after the first 6 or so months of training, work from home is a consistent feature of the job about half-time."
41,SecureLink (TX),"Great Team, Culture, Benefits, Training and Growth Opportunities",2021-01-24,5.0,Account Executive,"I am somewhat new with the company, but everybody I have met and everything I have seen have been great. This company really values the lives and growth of their employees, and makes sure to check all boxes for culture and environment by having a great office, perks and team atmosphere to ensure everyone does well in their career.

I'm looking forward to the future with this company, and hope others join as the company continues to grow.",None that I have noticed.

Since we've grown so much over the last few years, there is always something exciting in the works!","Working from home makes it so hard feeling connected to others (in and outside of our departments). Sometimes it feels like we're losing the ""fun"" aspect while we're in this setting. I realize there's only so much we can do right now, I just hope we don't entirely ignore the ""HAVE FUN"" part of our mission until we are back in the office."
45,SecureLink (TX),CSM,2021-03-24,5.0,Customer Success Manager,Transparency from executive leadership team,communication between departments can take a long time or not get prioritized

- Leadership is very open and transparent.

- (When the office was open) We get free breakfast and lunch. I can't wait for that to come back. WFH for months really reminds me what a valuable amenity that is!","- It's really cold in the office. 
- This isn't really a con, just a note. Since we are a growing company, career development is a still a work in progress. The good news is that management and leadership are really invested in creating those paths and opportunities for professional development for those employees who want to pursue it."
47,SecureLink (TX),Great Company,2020-12-23,5.0,Business Development Representative,"I was hired during Covid, and the Onboarding team was ready to go in the ever-changing virtual climate.

Having fun is literally part of our mission statement.","I live pretty far from the office, but luckily was a part of a flex WFH (pre-COVID) that made it much more bearable."
49,SecureLink (TX),Great Environment,2020-09-29,5.0,Software Architect,"While a lot of companies say they focus on their employees, SecureLink most certainly does. Everyone is expected to be a high-level contributor, but with that expectation comes freedom to do your job and help to create value for both yourself, SecureLink, and SecureLink's customers.","Depending on the department, raw monetary compensation can lag behind other opportunities. That said, the whole package is really solid. I've worked here a long time, and this truth is a testament to the overall culture at SecureLink."
50,SecureLink (TX),Awkward,2020-02-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,There is free breakfast and lunch. It is served by surly kitchen staff. You can order food from a certain menu provided. The benefits were great. They hire people with little experience and give them a chance. Pin pong and pool are popular daily activities.,"I have to say the amount of reviews on here talking about ""transparency"" are silly. Maybe I wasn't in the know but the culture is extremely feminized. And not in the nurturing, sweet, and understanding way. In a talk behind your back, don't tell people things directly, and get numbers on my side so I feel like I'm right kind of way. The office is cold and feels loveless. People are not stoked to interact with anyone. When I was new I saw the same people for months before they even tried to have a dialogue with me. Others never did. I witnessed heated confrontations between women that were unprofessional and would not have been tolerated had they happened between men. My department was childish. Say a conflict arises between two people. If management gets involved, they will seperate you, and speak with the people individually. Not do what good management does, and intermediate a conversation between the people involved. They prefer to be all powerful and definitely let it go to their heads. If you want to go to work keep your head down, be dominated by las socialistas, and not develop meaningful relationships, all aboard!"

There is a great mix of continually being challenged but also being recognized for the hard work that is going on even if we are remote. Being in the office makes this easier and the fact we are maintaining this effort and culture in a WFH setting is greatly appreciated.","Not much to mention here. We are all facing new challenges (and opportunities) to take on and adapt to, but this also offering up a path for growth and development.

Not a SecureLink specific item, but I think we could all use a little less video conference meetings in our lives."

56,SecureLink (TX),Great place to learn and grow!,2020-09-25,4.0,Business Development Representative,The culture at SecureLink is very casual. People are always willing to help and management is open to feedback. The folks here are really sharp and always look to find new ways to get better.,With WFH during Covid-19 has made it harder to feel connected coworkers. Management does what they can to make sure we're all having fun but it's hard in this environment. Plus I miss Slinkys!

Here are some of the highlights: 
•Comprehensive training program for both general information about the company and product, as well as job-specific training 
•Dog-friendly office
•Incredible culture that exists because everybody has bought in. SecureLink is not one of those companies that claims to have a great culture but has one that is clearly forced and uncomfortable. The culture is real and is a factor in every aspect of the team.
•Breakfast and lunch are provided and cooked fresh daily
•Beautiful building owned by the company with only SecureLink employees inside
•I repeat: Dog-Friendly Office!!","•Many reviews mention the commute - it's a ways from downtown, but a beautiful drive! I have one of the longer commutes in the company, but I actually love seeing the beautiful Texas Hill Country every day!"

 So far, my experience has been great. My colleagues have made an effort to set me up for success.
The food is free, and the pay is fair. 
I appreciate that my boss asks how I'm doing in our one on one meetings and that my executive boss makes an effort to meet with all of their employees at least once a quarter.","There aren't really any that I can think of. Sure, the commute is long, but it will be long for someone no matter where the office is. Every company will come with little annoyances here and there, but I think that SecureLink is a pretty excellent place to work."

61,SecureLink (TX),Great place to work for the smart and motivated,2019-08-22,5.0,Senior Systems Engineer,"There are three key things than make it worth it working at SecureLink on the engineering team. First, it's a best idea wins sort of place, so as long as you're right, or good, or both, you can do a lot, and make a considerable amount of change. This can cut both directions though, so if you aren't very good at your job or wrong, you'll feel it. Second, self-development is pushed pretty hard - there's a firm expectation that you're going to grow your skills while here. Third and last, there's a lot of room for experimentation / figure something out activity. That seems to flow out of that focus on skills development, but the real outcome is basically that you need to be good at your job, keep getting better at your job, and do that with a lot of autonomy.","Depending on your work-style, some of SecureLink's peculiarities may not make it the best place to work. There's a lot of direct communication i.e. it's a best idea sort of place so there isn't a lot of pulling punches for your bad idea. Not that anyone is mean, but don't expect subtle, passive communication."

SecureLink treats it's employees with an amazing benefits plan, from free breakfast and lunch to full health coverage. Hard to imagine another benefit that we are not currently receiving. Another thing worth noting - the executive team has an open door policy and it shows. There is a high degree of transparency when it comes to company performance and if you have a good idea (regardless of position), you can be sure that leadership will take your feedback to heart.",The only con I can think of is where I chose to live and my daily commute - SecureLink has been nothing but great so far!

The company sets the pace when it comes to employee quality of life -- with free breakfast and lunch (which probably equates to a hidden $7,500 salary bump when you think about it), and the people are interesting, very much, and driven for success. You'll make great friends here and work with interesting and varied customers. The PE backing also means you're getting best of breed training in whatever business unit you happen to be in.",The commute to Bee Cave can be tough for some and there isn't a work-from-home policy yet.

HR is toxic
If you’re in you’re in, if you’re out you’re out. A lot of clicks that have worked there since the beginning. 
Sales targets for Vista companies are very high which will result (and already has resulted) in constant executive level turnover. 
Turnover is constant and will continue to be until Vista exits (sells the company)

In talking with my coworkers it's clear that growth within the company isn't just possible, it's probable.",The work flow is being standardized right now and I think that is a necessary improvement as the company grows.

125,SecureLink (TX),Growing small company with big company benefits.,2017-01-31,4.0,Product Manager,"You are in charge of your own destiny.
Everyone from the CEO to the Head Chef (yeah we have a head chef) is accessible and open to suggestion.
The company frequently values opinions and is transparent about the business, company and individual goals, financial targets, challenges and the future.
The people are nice.
We have lots of great benefits. Breakfast and Lunch is made fresh and there is a fixed menu or you can order what you like and they will make it. All the typical games like pool, ping-pong, foosball, shuffleboard, boxing simulator, golf simulator, full gym and outdoor volleyball court etc.. lots of fun stuff to do. A wheel of fortune for folks that have gone above and beyond that week, cash prizes from $50 - $500. 
People here tend to work hard and play hard.
There is a hands-off management culture that empowers you to be the best you can be and holds you to self-identified goals. The office has a great family vibe, there is an onsite bar and restaurant and it gets used by workers, families and friends. You will have the opportunity to grow and be challenged in a positive environment. You are expected to speak up and own the outcome, its a huge part of our mission; Have fun, and create value over the long run. Very competitive salaries and additional opportunities to share the fruits of your labour by taking part in the employee stock purchase program.","There has been a lot of steady growth and that has meant some new structure and processes are being put into place. This part of the culture is not perfect and you will be part of a group of people with good intentions that are trying to find a balance between structure, fun, accountability and excellence. Fortunately, if you are vocal and open to change you will have a say in how this is developing. Biggest downside for those who care about it is that we are out of downtown and not really part of a business park where we meet people from other companies near where we work. If that is important to you, you should know that we own our building and take great pride in making it a fun place to invite others."
