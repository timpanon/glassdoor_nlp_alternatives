2,Service Express,Culture and Growth,2022-01-31,5.0,SMB Account Executive,"I started as an SDR at Service Express and from the start leadership was putting me into a position to grow and learn.

The job is made easier by the tools that are given for cold calling and account build out

Leadership will always make an effort to accommodate your work schedule when personal life matters arise

Commission structure is strong combined with a competitive base. Plus, as good amount of PTO provided

Everyone here is willing to lend a helping hand and that culture is created from the top down","The SDR role is cold calling which is never fun

As the organization grows there have been pains around territory shifts and projects"
3,Service Express,"Disappointed, frustrated, burnt out",2021-11-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- A group of great people
- Work variety","- Working people until they have nothing left to give (both inside and outside of work)
- Company strategy is not well thought out or communicated from the top down (besides the goal of 500M, but HOW?) 
- Told to find solutions when issues arise, but solutions are ignored when presented 
- Teams are growing but there is no plan for structure so people are left with no clear answer to who their leader is 
- Understaffed and asked to do more and more with no support to make decisions because ELT members want the final say on everything big and small
- Several new hires were promised growth, flexibility, upper mobility, and more just for it to not be reciprocated 
- Vision talks go nowhere. 
- 3% raise if you are lucky when inflation is currently around 6% in the U.S."
4,Service Express,Good Culture and Growth Focused,2022-01-05,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Management invests time and energy into the professional and personal growth of the people they hire. They're selective, but the people they select are given time and room to grow, They've built a solid structure for helping their people grow, it is not a sink or swim environment. 
The team is definitely leveraged as a platform to promote from so movement higher into the company both within sales or into other departments is common.","Growth is expected, if you're looking to get to a comfortable position as an SDR without higher aspirations (either in responsibility or financial success) mgmt may eventually look to fill your seat with someone with a higher ceiling that's looking to grow"

9,Service Express,False Advertising,2021-11-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work from home. 
People are willing to help for the most part.","Cultish, led by old boys society who stay in the bubble. They all love spaghetti. A lot of them being thrown on the wall on a monthly basis. I’m not sure if they completely lost touch with reality or they are fully aware of problems but don’t care as long they are big fat and happy. 
Lots of talk but not a whole lot of walk. Marketing/social media team loves to promote and obnoxiously post on LinkedIn that we have the best culture in the world and we are all about people. They obviously live under the rock. 
If you push back or express your concerns, you will be called a negative person and get put on a watch list. After about 2 years, you either turn into a puppet, lose your identity, soul is up for grab OR if you are smart enough, you will start looking for a new job. 

The lack of diversity is very concerning too. Company continues to hire the same profile that fits the mold. Bonus point and fast promotion for look alikes and came from the same previous company. 
No raise for the last two years, pay is below standard. I heard upper management get big bonuses every year. Go figure."

12,Service Express,Great Place to Grow Your Career,2021-12-06,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"Service Express is a great place to grow your career. I came into this company having worked at many different places and this is by far the best culture I have been around. I started my career at Service Express as an SDR and learned the ins and outs of prospecting. The job was great at setting me up for success as I learned how to navigate CRM, strategize on accounts with my sales partners, and understand the tech jargon more. 

Like many of my peers, after committing myself to the role I was given the opportunity to be promoted to an account executive. Being an SDR gave me a fast track to being successful in the AE role. In the AE role I was challenged in a hunter role to go out and find new business opportunities. This was especially exciting knowing that I was contributing to a company looking to grow quickly. My quick success as an AE allowed me the chance to be promoted into my current position as an SAE. This role has been a huge blessing both professionally and financially for my family. 

Although my path is not what everyone does, as there are many opportunities for SE employees to move into roles within the company, it allowed me to fast track into my current role as an SAE. 

I believe that culture is the most important aspect of an organization. SE talks about culture throughout each work day. It's plastered all over the walls and the growth in the organization to sustain the culture is very encouraging. I would highly recommend people looking to grow in their sales career give us a look. You will not find a better place to call home.","With any growing organization there are some areas of improvement. I believe Service Express's biggest challenge in the next few years will be to remain grounded in what employees bought into in the first place, the culture. Those that have left were often not able to adapt and be agile to a fast pace tech organization. If you are able to adapt with changes and take challenges head on you will thrive at Service Express."
13,Service Express,Great Mentoring and Coaching,2021-11-30,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Its awesome to come to work and collaborate with other high caliber individuals !

They have the best prospecting tools on market and are constantly looking at what new technologies could be beneficial. 

They invest heavily in professional development. I was able to expense a book each quarter sometimes more often in order to develop my skill sets on the job. 

Leadership is PHENOMINAL. They built a lot of trust with me and didn't micro manage. They have all done the role themselves and know the ins and outs of it, but allow you to do what works best for you to get your results and let you take ownership of your work. Metrics are tracked so it makes it really easy to identify what areas to work on and what actions are producing positive results. During our coaching conversations they helped me to improve in areas I needed help with. If I ever needed anything to drive my work strategy and be more successful they bent over backwards more times then a Cirque show to make sure I got it. 

During months that are more challenging the conversations with leadership are never negative or disparaging they talk about the story behind the numbers with you and are always constructive/productive and focused on what can go better next month. 

Its the least cut throat sales environment I've ever been apart of. The culture and comradery that they foster in the team as a whole makes it alot of fun to be apart of. There are alot of happy hours and bi annual team outings. If we hit weekly team goals together you get a half day on Friday. Its a rush when the team gets momentum and achieves it week after week. Everyone has separate territories and teammates are really willing to help each other/share knowledge/different prospecting techniques which helps everyone grow really quickly. The managers don't have egos and are cool with helping each others direct reports as well. They only care about the individual and the teams success. As long as YOU APPLY YOURSELF on this team, you will succeed PERIOD. I was promoted off the team in 2021. I still work closely with the SDR team and hold them in high regard !","The only Con I can think of is, you might get paid slightly more at a bigger company, but the work life balance is really good so the extra time I would end up working for not much more pay isn't worth it to me I'd rather like and trust the people I work with and actually be able to clock out and enjoy my personal life."

16,Service Express,Service Express shares the WHY which empowers their employees!,2021-09-28,5.0,Lead Field Service Engineer,I've been with Service Express for 15 years. The thing I like about Service Express is the culture and the people. Sometimes decisions are made and we don't understand them - all we have to do is ask and our Leaders will share the WHY which empowers us as employees to be fully engaged. This is a great place with tons of opportunities. I look forward to another 15 years or more here!!,Benefits could use some improvement and overall paths to other careers within the company could be made much clearer.
17,Service Express,Focusing on their people,2021-12-02,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Great culture. Leadership truly wants you to excel in the roll and help you reach your personal, professional and financial goals. High energy, competitive team. The SDR role acts as a great foot in the door at a growing business with great opportunity.","Some people might not care for the competitiveness and high energy. That would typically be figured out during the interview process though. You are cold-calling prospects, and some can be rude, but that's just the nature of the job."

20,Service Express,Top Notch company,2021-10-27,5.0,Sales Executive,Amazing company to work- been here for just over 2 years. Unlike any sales organization I have been apart of. The support that we get from our leaders is nothing I can compare to. The industry (TPM) we are in- great place to be- training is phenomenal and gets you up and running quickly. Service side of the house does an incredible job.,Very fast paced selling environment- hard work pays off. Bit of a month to month grind- tough to compete with OEM during COVID times.
21,Service Express,Too Good to be True?  Nope,2021-11-02,5.0,Account Executive,"Incredible culture - kind and friendly people at every employee level, high level of focus on employees and helping them achieve their personal, professional and financial goals. Training is comprehensive, relevant and practical.
Hiring process was quick and efficient. No wasted time and arbitrary hoops to jump through.","I work outside of the Grand Rapids area, so I don't get to go into the company HQ, which is a bummer since it looks like a fun, inclusive and high energy environment."
22,Service Express,Decent Entry-Level Job for Someone Just Out of College,2021-11-24,3.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"• The people at this company are excellent. That is the biggest perk of working here. This community will take you in under their wing and make you feel like you belong. They truly do hire the best; kind, driven, team-oriented people, willing to give you the shirt off their backs to help you succeed. Healthy competition is purely for motivation and entertainment purposes only.
• Management is very hand's off. As soon as you prove you're willing to put in the work, they'll trust you to do your job for the most part. They're also very understanding when it comes to general life interruptions/obstacles.
• Hybrid remote/on-site work environment accommodations. However, they do prefer people working on-site for the benefit of team camaraderie as it does make a significant difference in productivity and overall wellbeing for most.
• They're decently up-to-date on the tools/resources/platforms that are necessary to excel in the SDR field. 
• There is a lot of opportunity for growth within the company, but you have to set yourself apart in some way (i.e. through your personal results or finding a specific niche you excel in, which still takes time) and it's crucial to build relationships with the right people first. 
• The Directors (and some of the managers) within the SDR department are incredible leaders. They have HUGE hearts for each member of the team. They continuously pursue improvement in their own lives/professions, and truly want what is best for you as an individual. They will push you to a breaking point, then build you back up better than you were before… that is, if you're willing to make the necessary changes and continue to trust in them.
• Health benefits are OKAY. You can expense one new book a month, pay for half your gym membership, and they'll often host fun outings/happy hours, and provide regular free meals. 
• It's a great opportunity to make life-long friends, develop yourself as a young working adult, recognize your weaknesses, build on your strengths, face rejections, and learn how to communicate effectively.","• Compensation. They are underpaying most of the SDRs. They haven't adjusted our base salaries to inflation. This past year they actually raised our quota and cut our commission a little bit, but presented it to us like it was an opportunity to make more... which left us all scratching our heads...
• We're growing faster than management can handle and the culture has taken a serious hit because of it. Cliques are inevitably formed, but it's never really addressed with the team. Toxic banter between each other is actually encouraged sometimes. Gossip is becoming more and more of a problem and it's hardly addressed.
• The systems and processes we use are broken. Your territory and the rep you're partnered with will play a HUGE role in your success, and I think management knows this... but they'll never admit it despite it being common knowledge amongst the team. Your best bet is to suck it up and pray there will be a change soon. 
• Too much emphasis on numbers. If you're a top performer, you'll be placed on a pedestal and offered way more opportunities to be involved in other leadership-focused activities (which makes sense). The problem is the numbers lie. An SDR can set an ample amount of meetings with the wrong people and have them ""hold"" without actually explaining our services over the phone or qualifying the prospect. These kinds of ""top-performers"" are idolized and then given opportunities to teach other SDRs, which backfires on the team's overall success. 
• Suck-ups are promoted, but genuine skeptics are isolated and gas-lighted until they lose their minds and leave. If a flaw in the system (and they are many) is pointed out to leadership, it's denied, brushed under the rug, and you'll be scolded for questioning the system in the first place. This is by far one of the biggest cons of being on this team. Management touts innovation and transparency, yet practical solutions, good intentions, and true talent end up walking out the door. It's heartbreaking to watch. This team will continue to slowly crumble if management keeps treating people like this and promoting the wrong people into leadership positions."
23,Service Express,Not what it once was. Would not recommend.,2021-11-22,2.0,Senior Account Executive,"- Most employees are really great people.
- Great place to start a sales career or get into IT.
- Good work/life balance.","--- Focus has become solely on their goal of “$500M by 2025”. The rest of the tagline officially reads “the Service Express way”, however it should actually read “at whatever cost”. They’re cutting everywhere they can and EMPLOYEES ARE LEAVING IN DROVES. Executive leaders do not seem to care. CEO continues to blog about excellent leadership and culture while turning a blind eye to what’s really happening.
--- The company used to provide top notch service that you could be proud to sell. However service techs are not being replaced when they leave and the work is being outsourced. Customer problems are on the rise which means an account executive is spending a lot of their time putting out fires and dealing with unhappy customers.
--- Quotas continue to climb while account lists shrink. Comp plans were MAJORLY SLASHED in 2021 resulting in a massive drop in earning potential for sales reps.
--- No raises were given to anyone in sales in 2021 despite record setting sales in 2020.
--- Mixed bag with sales leaders. Some are great. Others are not. Many are micromanagers. The company has hired a lot of people from Enterprise (car rental company) and those leaders have fired performers without cause or notice. They have changed the culture. People on these teams are not happy.
--- Service Express touts their amazing culture. In fact, they shout it from the rooftops. But it is not felt. There is a major gap between what is reported on social media and what it’s actually like to work here.
--- There’s almost a cult mentality perpetuated by leadership that it’s the best place ever to work and you’ll be terribly unhappy if you leave. That’s not true.

Summary: If you want to move into sales, this is not a bad place to start. Go in as an SDR, work hard, and move up the ranks in sales. Learn everything you can. But don’t stay there for long if you care about your career growth and earning potential. At whatever point you stop growing, take what you’ve learned to another company. You’ll learn and earn more. If you’re already a mid-senior level seller - I’d steer clear of Service Express unless you need an entry point into IT. It is otherwise not worth your time. And if you're an employee that's reading this - you're not crazy. The company has changed. Don't sit around hoping things will get better. There is life after Service Express."
24,Service Express,"Not a bad company, but you must drink the Kool-Aid",2021-06-11,3.0,Field Service Engineer,"Surrounded by a bunch of great people...all smiles..part of the allure of the field service job is the allusion that you are your own boss, most of the time, Was never micro managed there...Benefits are decent","kool-Aid dispensed by the drumload. Constantly told how they are for their people, but, in a Field Service environment, all I can say is ""Yeah, right!!"" First off , no pay for being on call. You give up a week of your life to be on call and get nothing in return, unless you get called out, then you get OT, and, if the ticket qualifies, a 2 hour call out(straight time). not worth giving up a week, especially if you don't get called out. 

No company vehicles...no vehicle allowance, and not even reimbursed for mileage at he Federal rate. They only give you 85% of the Fed rate, while they probably write off 100%. Now wonder a lot of the FSE's drive clunkers... 

And don't refuse to drink the Kool Aid, failure to buy into the culture makes you a marked person...so just sit back, smile and wave, and sing the Kumbaya like you mean it, even if you don't."
25,Service Express,Great company to work for,2021-12-03,4.0,Sales,"- Service Express does an excellent job at hiring genuine people. Rarely you will find an individual who isn't willing to lend a hand 
- The resources and tools given to employees are designed to make them successful and are tops in the industry
- Team events planned outside of work (happy hours, offsites etc.)
- Management puts an emphasis on your growth inside and outside of the office 
- If you are willing to take coaching advice and be pushed by your peers/leaders, opportunities for growth will arise",- Management's bandwidth to assist with their direct reports can be challenging with growing teams

Very fast promotion from SDR to SAE. 
If you inherit established territory and accounts you are off to a great start.","The culture in sales is very poor and the leaders are amateurs. The #1 sales strategy is making 500-1,000 dials a week. Salesforce is being used as a micromanagement tool. Lots of politics for a company this size, watch your back! 
No employee retention strategy, barely any recognition, poor engagement and no career roadmaps. Attrition rate is very high and top talent is walking out the door."
29,Service Express,"Glorified call center. Do anything else, do not do sales development.",2021-11-05,2.0,Sales Development Representative,"Work life balance is second to none. Team outings like happy hours etc. are held often. Opportunities to earn half days Fridays. If you are lucky enough to work with solid account executives they'll be more helpful than any SDR leadership. Potential to be a solid starting place for a sales career. 

You can gain some solid experience.","Cold calls. Lots of cold calls. You will get burned out fast if you have a tough territory or do this for longer than a year.

SDR leaders have no real sales experience. This matters because they suck at coaching. They'll ask you what you think you should do and never actually give any real guidance or coaching. A couple of them can be incredibly condescending and will talk down to you. They will oversell the amount of opportunity there actually is with SE for SDR's. There's a reason for high turnover and they will spin every exit from the company to a positive when they are not and they know it.

A lot of two faced people at this company. Very political. Watch your back. A huge ""suck-up"" culture on the SDR team. Those that drown in kool-aid get ahead quick. Leadership plays favorites and those favorites get promoted fast. 

Some SDR's are blessed with ""golden territories"" where they easily set meetings exceeding quota yet are actually terrible at the job (go listen to some calls). Others grind hard and barely meet quota and are put on performance plans.

Overall Sales Dev is a glorified call center. Emphasis on glorified because they glorify it a lot here. There is a lot of misleading positive reviews here from SDR's that haven't been on the team very long so take it all with a grain of salt."

- loved the work I did and the growth during my time","- Has turned into a Burn and Churn environment (I was working 50-60+ hours a week for the last year with delegated work sent my end as well as my role duties)
- Disconnects with Leadership where new projects were being rolled out without any forethought or project management put into place by them Expected to do the work and figure it out with little direction other than being told it needed to be done. Would set unrealistic expectations and timelines for this work to be completed then get mad when it didnt work
- Not able to push back and say no to things, meet with the phrase ""reduce the friction"" making healthy boundaries a hard thing to achieve
- No structure to bigger plans that needed it
- The phrase "" People Power"" today at Service Express seems to mean more about having people to hit numbers and the company goal of 500 million by 2025 rather than growing people 
- Very late adopters of DE&I concepts and still has a way to catch up to other companies 
- Pay wasnt up to par with other similar positions at other companies
- When asking the ""Why?"" behind certain actions, would often be met with vague generic responses 
- Change was to often and to quick, went through 4 sale models in 2 years with no real plans in place; however, it it's good change then it would take months if not years for something to happen

32,Service Express,Great place to start your career in sales,2021-07-02,4.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Service Express is a fast-growing, progressive company-the people are very nice and truly focused on helping you grow and investing in you.","The company in general is a Sales company- fast paced, big personalities, ""sportsmanship mentality"" carried throughout. The SDR team consists of people from all different backgrounds (not just sales) and very ""fun-oriented"" and metric driven. If you want to start your career in Sales, it's a great place to go. I will be honest through and say that if you don't see yourself in Sales and not driven by numbers, the role will feel monotonous. One thing I didn't realize when first starting with the team was the magnitude of how much cold-calling I would be doing (Typically 5-6 hours a day average for most people). The team makes it fun through, they do Zoom calls and take breaks, go on walks, and split up the day where they can."

Sales VP Management is non-existent. Regional Sales management is unaware of the market. Turnover is out of control, just look at the career page on company page.

Rocky Mountain management is lacking. Dont wear your ""Client First"" hats, don't do your funky hair days, I dont care how much beer/seltzers you drank over the weekend and dont care to see your floating keg pics. Dallas Management has been a joke....Western VP's have no idea how to sell in IT...""can I upgrade you to a midsize?'.....""What about the insurance plan?""...

If you are a professional sales executive, stay far away....Culture is a joke outside of Corporate.

You had a great past, new management has killed morale. Sales VP's disguise their concern over fired employees to a pipeline review."

I have very positive things to say about our recruiting process and my time working with our recruiting team.,I really don't have anything negative to say. Each day they find ways to improve and work very hard to ensure we are hiring the right people.

You have the ability to make a lot of money, they give you the tools and training to do extremely well. If you focus on driving results you will be rewarded.","It's sales, high volume of cold calling."
55,Service Express,The BEST place to work,2019-11-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I left a job to start my career here. I am surrounded by smart and talented people who want to see me succeed here.  There is a lot of talk around here about making sure people “find the right seat on the bus” and I have found mine in my current role. I am pushed to do more, to do better, and to set larger goals but am always asked by my leader how they can help make it happen. I am encouraged to make suggestions about how I see my job evolving, and am not afraid to speak up in meetings and offer my opinion about how I can contribute to making things run more smoothly within the organization. 

There is definitely a lot expected of you, and working here is not for everyone. There is no better culture to be a part of in my opinion, although it sounds like each office has a culture that varies slightly. If you are willing to put in the time and effort it is very possible to be successful and happy here. 

Additionally, the retirement benefits are good, as well as the maternity leave policy. Service Express also pays half your gym membership, and allows employees 16 hours per year to volunteer at organizations of their choice.","The health and dental benefits need some work. The costs have continued to go up, while the cash in leu has stayed the same several years. The increased cost in benefits do not grow at the same rate of pay increases."
56,Service Express,Great Place to Work,2021-02-23,5.0,Field Service Engineer,Amazing Place to work. Love the culture and the people from top to bottom are even better. Would recommend Service Express to everyone I know.,None that I can think of.

- It seems like outside of software there might be some areas of the business that have a good culture","- Lack of technical direction
- Legacy software with deep rooted problems
- Poor technical leadership
- Constant focus on quick wins
- Blame individuals for systemic problems
- Spent 50% of my time running SQL updates to get people unstuck
- Benefits were not good relative to other companies"

They told people to make those.,2020-10-13,1.0,Sales Development Representative,"Easy money, large young team, have the chance for half day fridays.",The job is absolutely ridiculous. I think they should be audited for telemarketing rules they break everyday. If you don’t like sitting on an auto dialer or making 500+ outbound touches a day then stay away! They will have you on an auto dialer for 2 hours of the day and you could call through 300 people. As soon as someone answers get ready to talk. There is no strategy and they continue to give out gimmicks so customers will say yes to meetings. Avg turnover rate for position is 1 year.
62,Service Express,Amazing Culture,2021-01-22,5.0,Senior Account Executive,People love the company and their work. Everyone feels like they are contributing and works their butts off.,Not many I can think of. They have incredible perks and benefits
63,Service Express,"Good Company, Growing Pains",2020-02-20,4.0,Senior Account Executive,"Culture in HQ seems to be very positive, but if you are outside sales, the culture diminishes pretty fast.  They have a niche market and many of the service member's provide excellent service to customers.","The industry is evolving quickly and many customer's are moving to the cloud.  With on premise hardware decreasing, this will continue to make the market more competitive and a race to the bottom in pricing.  While SEI has a great model with W-2 engineers, this can be a negative tradeoff as they are more expensive than most competitors when essentially providing the same service. They were also recently bought by a new PE firm, which has already negatively impacted quotas with a 40-60% increase and little room to make good commissions unless you absolutely crush your number.  They also promote people into Sales Management based on performance, which is not a great practice as you get manager's with sales success, but no idea on how to be productive leader's."
64,Service Express,Great Company Culture- Amazing to work for,2020-08-24,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"The leadership in this company fantastic. They are very understanding, let you know what is expected of your role, and help you to grow professionally.

Service Express invests in their sales team and will truly invest in you as a person and a professional. I assure you the culture is unmatched and you will enjoy coming into work everyday. The quotas are very achievable as long as you put in the work - they also love to promote from within. This organization is spectacular.,I really cannot think of any.

69,Service Express,Unlike No Other,2020-02-10,5.0,Field Service Engineer,"The company core value is 'To help our people achieve their personal, professional and financial goals'. Service Express truly cares about their employees and backs every word of it up with actions. I have been here 3 years now and it is unlike any other tech company I've worked for which includes IBM and TGCS.  It is a pleasure to wake up and want to go to work!","We are a small company so benefits are slightly lower than my previous employers. That being said, this a Pro as well because we are continually growing and improving on the benefit package and opportunities."
70,Service Express,Growing Company,2020-11-20,4.0,Lead Field Service Engineer,"Growing company, great people. Flexible schedule.",Our culture has changed and when employees bring that up to superiors they don't acknowledge or correct it. Excuses can't fix the disparity between what we claim our culture is and what it really has become.
71,Service Express,Great company overall,2021-01-12,4.0,Senior Account Executive,Great culture... sales is especially tough but rewarding.,On you’re own in sales to make it happen... not as much support as other companies I’ve worked for in the past.

80,Service Express,Outstanding Culture,2016-06-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"At Service Express everyone is part of the same team, working towards achieving their goals.  You are given constant feedback on areas that you excel so you can celebrate, as well as areas you can improve.  When it comes time for an annual performance review, it is just that, a review.  Each day the bar raises and you are provided new opportunities and challenges to grow and stretch.  You do work hard, but your work is important and you do not feel like a number.  I have been a part of Service Express for over 20 years.  I have seen the company grow consistently every year. Throughout all of the growth, the culture of Service Express has remained the same.  You are accountable and responsible for your actions, but you are also empowered to make decisions and are given the tools you need to be successful.  The company truly cares about you as a person and your personal life, not just the work you do.","There are two areas I feel are areas to continue to work on.  I say areas to work on rather than cons.  They are communication and collaboration.  As we continue to grow I sometimes find that multiple teams might be working a similar project, but not together.  So in the end you might get duplication of efforts vs multiplication of efforts.  The better we communicate and more we force ourselves to collaborate the better results we will have.  These are areas of focus to continue to improve on."
81,Service Express,Incredible company to work for.,2019-10-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Amazing culture and employee oriented.  Truly shows lot of care on employee development as well as customer care. Executive Leadership is all about coaching values and doing things with positive attitude.,Not that I have seen so far.
82,Service Express,"Terrible Management, no growth, pretend to care about personal growth",2019-09-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,A lot of free food(that is changing). Some Departments are Great and Some are absolutely terribly run - very few in between.,Management is 99% men and most higher levels are brought from outside of company so they do not know much about how the company works or really care - only looking to make themselves look better for their next job.  A previous co-worker is about to get promoted for not doing their job but rather because of being obsequious person.
83,Service Express,Excellent culture-great place to work!,2019-10-31,5.0,Regional Manager,Emphasis on  personal development and employee engagement,nothing I've seen  so far!
84,Service Express,My Honest Opinion,2017-03-13,5.0,Technical Support Specialist,"Some people will talk about the culture as a ""drink the Kool-Aid"" mentality, and when you first join it will seem that way. But when you see the culture in action and find that management isn't peddling a lip service, you find yourself bought in wholeheartedly. I have been with the company for 5 years, I started as a Field Service Engineer and have been promoted to a support specialist. In my time here no one has ever mislead or lied to me about my responsibilities or expectations. I have known what was expected of me from day one. I came from an industry outside of IT, the company provided me training and the tools to learn and advance professionally. Management has always encouraged people to do what they are passionate about. In my time here management and my teams have always showed a genuine interest in seeing me succeed and fulfill my potential. Along the way they have given me the tools to do so, it has been up to me to get it done. SEI encourages there employees to be honest, upstanding members of their community by giving them days off to use toward community service.","I genuinely have no Cons to mention, anytime I have had an issue I have brought it up and we found a solution. It would take an extreme situation for me to leave SEI."
85,Service Express,"At Service Express, your co-workers become your family - collaborative work environment + work life balance.",2019-11-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work life balance, culture, training, opportunities for growth, great relationship with co-workers!",Only con I can think of would low PTO days & high insurance cost.
86,Service Express,Great culture at a growing company,2014-12-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Service Express is the best company I have ever worked for.  The company is founded on helping employees achieve personal, professional and financial goals.  They recognize that when people are able to achieve their goals and are engaged that they will do great work and take care of customers.  We believe in working hard, having fun and getting great results.  

Opportunity is everywhere in this growing company.  The pace of change is fast but logical and controlled.  For a motivated, talented person this is an environment that challenges you to grow and stretch beyond your comfort zone.  Employees are encouraged to follow their passion and try new ways to solve problems.  The leadership team knows that people doing what they love on a daily basis will yield great results.

SEI puts people first.  Time off is never a problem and is encouraged.",Hard to find dramatic cons.  SEI is a challenging place to work.  It is not for everyone.  You are accountable to produce results.  If you want a job that allows you to coast or not develop this is not the place for you.
87,Service Express,Good place for short term,2013-11-14,2.0,Senior Account Executive,"Good base salary. Good place to break into IT sales without much technical knowledge. Service people tend to deliver what sales promises, so you can sell with confidence.","Tend to Hire too many sales people than territory can support. Increasing turnover of sales people. Very little training and no support once you are in the field. Several managers were good sales people 10 years ago but now do little to support their reps other than request more reports. Never ending reports on activity. I have never had less support from a manager than what I have had here. Sales managers seem to have life time job security. 
Mentality is there will always be a need for the service they provide when in reality it is greatly diminishing. They have adjusted in the past to such changes but their current pace is not keeping up with the pace of change in the industry today."
88,Service Express,Sales Sales Sales,2019-07-30,4.0,SDR,"Awesome company, not-so awesome job. Being an SDR is tough work. It will pay off in the end. Work hard play hard.",The job itself can be grueling. The team members are there to help out though. You can voice your career goals within the company but they don't necessarily give you the resources to get there unless you want to enter the realm of higher-up sales.
89,Service Express,Great Place for professional development,2019-12-22,4.0,Field Service Engineer,Professional Development is a high priority,No work life balance. No compensation for being on call.
90,Service Express,I've never had my personal values align with a company like I have with SEI.,2016-04-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working for a company who values are aligned with your own makes all the difference and that is why I chose SEI as an employer. Almost 4 years later I have no regrets and have never been put in a place where I have had to compromise my values or beliefs. SEI is a growing, fast-paced, results oriented organization and therefore is not perfect, however at the end of the day it is an ethical company who places customer service and their people above all else. It's a relief to be able to tell others about SEI, knowing that we can actually back up and deliver on our promise to prospective customers and employees (which can be rare most places now a days).","SEI is not a company where most employees can get away with just doing what's in their job description.  Because of our growth, employees are often stretched and required to do more for a period of time until we hire or bring in the resources necessary.  That's not the best job or environment for many people while some people thrive in it."
91,Service Express,Company with great culture and strives to make employees succesful,2019-05-28,5.0,Field Service Engineer,"The company really does strive to build a fun, hard working, motivated employee base. They allow you to take care of customers and fix issues.  They push you to strive to be better with goals you set for yourself and they help you achieve. They always make sure you know where you stand and take the time to get to know you. They truly care about their employees and want to see them succeed. From day one, they push you to be a part of the team and really be a part of the culture they have. They want you to feel accepted and happy. Great company with decent benefits. I would highly recommend to anyone thinking of applying here to do so. You will not be disappointed if you get hired.","Still a smaller company that is growing. Benefits could be better, but they try their best for the size of the company. The interview process is rigorous and long, but it does weed out people who do not want to be a part of the culture."
92,Service Express,Field Service,2019-10-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Great training programs to get junior engineers ready for the field,Rapid growth that presents challenges to employees
93,Service Express,All the tools necessary for success,2016-01-18,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"From day 1 the SEI provides you with all the support and direction you need to have professional success and achieve your goals.  SEI wants employees to achieve their goals and the company wide culture and support helps to make this happen.  Constant focus on how to grow professionally (professional goals), but also become a more well rounded person in general (personal goals).  The MGMT allows me to work autonomously but are also readily available for immediate support whenever needed.  I certainly appreciate the confidence they have in me to do what needs to be done.  The potential to achieve financial goals is supported by a great product/service offered, and the company that backs it.","I have yet to find the con that stands out, but if you don't like cold calling, or don't have that ""hunter attitude"" this may not be the position you are looking for.  As I said before they are great with allowing me to work autonomously, but with that comes self discipline to do what needs to be done on your own."
94,Service Express,Good Company,2019-11-12,4.0,Field Service Engineer,Great atmosphere and great culture,does not pay for being on call
95,Service Express,Best decision I have made professionally,2016-01-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Calling Service Express ""employee focused"" would understate the company's level of commitment to employees. The entire company is built on the principle that if employees are individually thriving, the company will thrive too. So they make sure employees thrive through providing the tools they need for success, having conversations about life and career goals, and providing extensive ongoing training. Personally, I entered the company as an entry level employee and through time and resource investment by management, as well as consistent company growth, I developed as a business professional and was promoted fairly quickly. Even with the promotion, the opportunity here feels endless to me.","Service Express is extremely transparent and goal oriented. This is not a problem if you are an achiever and enjoy stretching yourself to hit goals. However, if you are not goal oriented and uncomfortable with other employees seeing your results, you will become stressed and it may not be the best fit."
96,Service Express,great place to work,2019-07-29,4.0,Field Service Engineer,Most of the people are very friendly,Local management are not trained properly
97,Service Express,A great company with great opportunities for growth,2016-07-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been with SEI for over 5 years and since day one, my managers have never ceased to work with me and support me to achieve my goals and vision.  There is always support available for whatever problem or issue you may be facing.  I love the fact that I'm empowered to make decisions to run my company.  SEI has a great culture and we strive to keep it feeling like friends and family, rather than just work associates.","I wish the insurance benefits weren't so expensive, but they're not bad compared to a lot of other companies.  I also with we had company vehicles, but there is mileage reimbursement."
98,Service Express,Growing Pains,2014-10-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The culture has always been employee first.  They preach & teach professional & personal development.  The compensation is fair.  The work life balance is excellent.  I've never been and didn't know of anyone who was ever turned down for vacation time or to leave early for a family event.,"Things have started to shift in the culture from open communication to confused communication.  Many of the front line and middle management employees weren't sure who to report to or were told to report to multiple people.  People are being promoted based on their friendships with the executives as opposed to actual achievement.  SEI is being viewed by many employees as becoming an ""HR state"".  Things are much more tight lipped than they used to be."
99,Service Express,A work environment that feels like family,2015-04-07,5.0,Field Service Engineer,"Employee oriented - this company revolves around it's employees and helping them meet and exceed their goals.  Salary is competitive, at least in my experience and position.  Time off is never a problem, and you are encouraged to treat the business as if it were your own - you are allowed to make on-the-fly decisions.","Depending on your position, travel is extensive as well as training.  You are required to use your own vehicle for service, although mileage is reimbursed.  A company car would be a plus."
100,Service Express,Field Service Engineer,2016-11-15,5.0,Field Service Engineer,"I just want to start off by saying that I chose to miss my grandmother's funeral to attend my final interview with SEI in Grand Rapids because I was in a dead end job and I wanted and needed something better. It ended up being one of the best decisions of my life and I know my grandmother would have approved. 

This company Absolutely works for their Employees not the other way around. Coming from Local Government work before here which was cutthroat and you fearing the existence of your job everyday, and then interviewing at SEI where it seems like a completely different world and wondering what everyone was on? Once you join this company and you take in the amazing culture that this company has you begin to see that everyone isn't ""on"" anything. This is truly the way it is here and more companies should embrace this form of culture because the history shows amazing results financially as well as employees being enthusiastic and engaged. 

They continue to work with you on your personal, professional, and financial growth. You create your own ""Vision"" which has these types of goals for the long. Your manager will meet with you throughout the year to go over where you are and what you can do or what path will help you achieve them. I absolutely buy into this companies culture even after going through the brutal work environment I used to be in. 

This month which marks 4 years of employment here I hit two very big Vision goals. A promotion that achieved a professional goal and a financial goal I had set to not hit until 2018. Don't get me wrong there are NO handouts here if you are willing to put in the hard work and effort your goals CAN be achieved, I am living proof and owe everything to this place.","Currently there are no company vehicles for field techs. So you do have to use your personal vehicle when you are working. You do get mileage reimbursement, but it does fluctuate depending on gas prices."
101,Service Express,Field Service Engineer review of SEI.,2017-04-01,5.0,Field Service Engineer,"For six consecutive years, SEI has been named a 2016 Best and Brightest Company to Work for In the Nation.

Excellent training program. 

Great support staff. 

SEI provides its Engineers with all the necessary tools they need to succeed. 

SEI rewards and recognizes hard work. 

If you're looking to work for a company that actually assists its employees reach their personal, professional, and financial goals, then look no further.  This is the vision of SEI. 

Great opportunity to grow with a growing company.","SEI provides its employees with full benefits, but the cost is a little more than larger corporations."
102,Service Express,Regional Sales Manager,2016-01-06,5.0,Regional Sales Manager,"I can explain the reason to come to work for SEI in one word, ""CULTURE"".  It is a breath of fresh air coming to a company like this.  Their mission in life is to help employees achieve their personal, professional, and financial goals.  I noticed right away this isn't something they just say either, they work to help you get to your goals and visions.  You will see many people here that have worked here their entire careers.  However there is also a good mix of people that have come from other industries also.  The one resounding thing you will hear from all of them though, is this is the best place they have ever worked.  I am still learning the processes and procedures, but one thing I picked up right away is the culture.  It is impossible to avoid and it is contagious.  Best thing about that is it bleeds over to the client and that is why we have a 98% customer retention rate.  Once we get you on board, more than likely you are a client for life.

I am excited about the future here and can't imagine ever leaving.","Still looking for these.  I have been to several different branch offices and have spoken to several people in the company and still poking for information about something bad and not getting anywhere.  I know all companies have good and bad days, and I will experience them in time, but when you have to search for things like this, it is always good."
103,Service Express,The place to grow your career!,2016-08-25,5.0,Field Service Engineer,"Quarterly reviews ensure there are no surprises when your annual review comes around. When you share what you want to do (either personally, professionally or financially) your manager works with you to make that happen. You're going to work hard, but you're going to see the results, and everyone has your back.","For someone who wants to ""coast"", there are no pre-planned paths. You are expected to participate in planning your own career, which can be a turn off if you're just looking for a job. SEI is a place for a career."
104,Service Express,"Growing company, great culture!",2015-05-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"SEI is doing it right! They truly look at each individual employee and see them as a person first, with goals and plans for the future (personal and professional) and then help fit your career into those goals. They have great teams with genuine passion and excitement about their work. They invest in the company and the company 's tools/resources wisely and make sure employees have what they need to be successful.","Although the interview process was lengthy, it helped to get to know so much about the company and the people before you started. No surprises."
105,Service Express,Great place to work-Relaxing work environment-Great training,2019-05-30,5.0,Field Service Engineer,"Management is exceptional. They are always available to assist in any way they can. The  company takes good care of their employees and they make sure your work/life is well balanced. You also receive lots of training in order to be very knowledgeable in your field. The work environment is very pleasing. All the offices are modern, and equipped to make you feel very comfortable. Everyone  is very friendly and outgoing. The team work is outstanding. I can't complaint about anything. I am very happy to be working for Service Express.",No Cons at all !!
106,Service Express,Field Service Engineer,2016-11-15,5.0,Field Service Engineer,"The people and the opportunities. SEI values it's employees and strives to let people learn from their mistakes. The pay and benefits are very good and the culture is one of working with the Employees' vision goals. We care passionately about our  4 core objectives:

Excellent Customer Service
Employee Engagement
Margin Retention
Revenue Growth

It's how we get things done - the right way.","As a Field Service Engineer, ON Call is a necessary part of the job. Work/Life balance can suffer from time to time. SEI tries to accommodate this as much as possible."
107,Service Express,My career would have been better if I had listened to my gut and passed on SEI employment,2014-03-07,2.0,Field Service,Work life balance was fair until SEI doubled stand by time without pay.,"Lots of promises made during recruitment phase, which is way too long ( red flag), in reality very few became reality. In fact a lot of promises were down right lies, on the service side.

Talk of vision is just that, when the CEO isn't around. If you are over 45, a female or minority, don't expect your effort to be appreciated, especially in Detroit!"
108,Service Express,Cult-ish,2016-04-13,2.0,Field Service Engineer,"Fair compensation and benefits.
Worked with some great people.","Culture is very much 'drink the kool aid or else'. I would say it's a good place to work as long as you do what you're told and don't ask questions. Questioning the 'SEI Way' will not get you anywhere.
Everything felt very rehearsed and forced at corporate office... like they were still trying to convince me this was such a great place to work. The messaging felt so arrogant from the top down... We're the best: company, CEO, Mgmt, etc. nothing more than our opinion of ourselves.. Good people, just the arrogance of how they constantly talked about themselves clouded the message for me.
I'm sure there are employees being encouraged to go on here and say it's the greatest place in the world to work and there are no negatives. Please ask questions before you join this cookie-cutter company."
109,Service Express,Absolutely Wonderful Place To Work,2019-06-13,5.0,Field Service Engineer,"There are many reasons to work at Service Express. I'll start with my top 4. My number one reason is the Culture. This cant be expressed enough. I LOVE WORKING HERE. The people and the environment are what make the culture so great.

Second, the Flexibility. As an Engineer we have a lot of flexibility when working with our team. Service Express expects us to do the right thing at all times and rewards us with flexibility of our schedules. As long as our customers are taken care of and remain a priority, no one will be making sure you're at your desk at 8:01am

My Third would be the availability of growth. Service Express encourages you to grow and will push you to grow. We do not like to see people fall behind or become complacent. You are encouraged to take initiative and take chances.

Fourth would be the Work/Life Balance. We are encouraged to make sure there is balance between our work and life schedules. If you have a busy week or need to take time off for whatever reason you can. There is generally no reason to be denied time off at least in my experience.","In my personal opinion, there are very few downsides to working at Service Express. If I had to pick one single downside it would be that the Field Service Engineers have an On Call schedule. To me, that is just part of the job. I don't necessarily consider it a ""Con"" but others do. The only other CON would be that as an Engineer you have to drive your vehicle. You DO get paid mileage but not the National Average for Mileage. This means that there is a lot of maintenance and fuel costs involved as well as depreciation from high amounts of mileage."
110,Service Express,"Great company, second to none culture.",2016-11-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"SEI focuses on employee success.  Employees are encouraged to develop personal, professional and financial goals.  Quarterly meetings with your manager help keep you on track.  Company is growing and there is a ton of opportunity to grow with it.  Fast paced environment.  Great place to be in the field.  Excellent processes and focus on customer service.","SEI is not for everyone.  As with any growing company, there is constant change. You must continue to grow or you may get left behind."
111,Service Express,SAE,2017-06-02,5.0,Sales,Best company culture! I have worked for many companies in my life and I'm so proud to be here. Onboarding and training is phenomenal!! The company truly invests in people and want everyone to be successful! The leadership team really cares about the employees. Everyone is so happy and helpful.,Some internal softwares could be better and I know we are changing vendors and trying to make things better and easier for employees.
112,Service Express,It could be worse ..... but I could be oh so much better!,2016-05-31,3.0,Field Service Engineer,"I love the customers, I love my career in Field Service. I love most of my coworkers. Work/Life balance is good.","The better you are in a particular job the more likely you will stay there at least until you leave. There is no set upward mobility path. The pay is 18% less than industry standard. Unlike every other field service company in the United States you aren’t paid an on call flat rate just for being on call. No company vehicles. You are paid mileage, but it is well below federal standard (40 cents instead of 57).  The Culture at Corporate is the best I've ever seen, but most of the local field offices .... ugh."
113,Service Express,Middle Management,2014-12-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great work/life balance. People first culture. Fair compensation. Sense of appreciation and value. Great teams, both front line and leadership. Growing company in a stable field. Team members have an opinion in future teammates.","No cons. Success here is based off of the work you put in. It's not easy as we continue to grow and achieve our goals, it's just better."
114,Service Express,Amazing,2015-11-20,5.0,Supply Chain,"SEI is certainly not an EASY place to work at, and it has a high bar for its employees, but you will find nowhere else with the opportunity and the people that you find at SEI.  great people, great systems, great culture and values.","We hold on to some non-performers for too long.  Understandably we need to give them every chance to succeed, but the long term effects are more than we estimate."
115,Service Express,Senior Account Executive,2018-04-20,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"The company does a great job or focusing on both the individual employee and the business itself. Great compensation, benefits, and the company will provide you all the tools you need to do your job.","Virtualization had started to reduce the amount of physical servers on the market, which was the bread and butter of the company. However, the company was looking to expand its service offerings to other types of equipment."
116,Service Express,Consider pros and cons carefully,2015-08-30,3.0,Senior Sales Executive,"Great way to get into IT related sales. One of the simplest sales there could be... Within 5 minutes of meeting with a prospect, you will know if there is any need for the services you can offer. The primary service you will be selling is extended warranty on hardware... very simple and very profitable.
Good base salary and fair commission.","I saw someone on here said they sensed a hint of arrogance in their interview process and that was very accurate of the overall company culture in general. SEI has been very successful in their niche but the niche is very limited. You hear a lot about the growth of the company but most markets where they are established are saturated very quickly... So for the most part, their growth has been through expansion into new cities/territories. please be aware of that fact if you're interviewing for a position in an established territory. At every level  of your interview process, ask why the position is open. If you get an answer like I did that 'more sales reps equals more sales', run away.  If a company cannot do the research on the potential opportunities in an area and give you some data that will support hiring another sales rep, you have no idea what you will be walking into.
 Everyone is very nice and helpful at the corporate office but what they do better than anything else is sing the praises of themselves. 
Sales Managers don't seem to be held accountable for their performance and brought very little sales process/ original input to the table in my experience. There is a script you are to follow for your prospect meetings and it is fairly effective.
Major Conern... There seems to be no formal sales performance reviews, as I saw several reps let go with no notice or (PIP) performance improvement plan to assist anyone in improving their performance. I would think HR would develop a more formal process but that seems to be another area where the company is still very small minded."
117,Service Express,happy former employee,2016-12-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,This company will push you to be the best version of yourself. They focus on building on your strengths rather than your weaknesses. Pay is great and commission opportunity is there,Company is growing quickly- theres a high demand for results-as a result the position can be extremely stressful at times

119,Service Express,Best place I’ve ever worked,2019-01-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Company culture is world class. Ability to grow and learn at a growing company.  Unlimited opportunity to grow with the company.  Vision and SR5.,Service Express is not for everyone. If you want a job where you can coast or stay static you will not like it.
120,Service Express,Best in class!,2017-09-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Emphasis on employees.  Plenty of growth opportunities.  Great facilities.  Consistent and long term leadership.,Not a place to work if you want to coast.  You are constantly challenged and there is a lot of feedback and accountability.  This is only a negative for those who do not want to be challenged.
121,Service Express,Walk the Walk,2018-08-13,5.0,Customer Support Coordinator,The company values honest feedback while building around their core values. There are no secrets or office politics to be found. Everyone pushes one another to become better than they were yesterday.,The benefits package are not as robust as larger corporations.
122,Service Express,More than just a job..,2019-05-30,5.0,Field Services Engineer,Strong culture driven working environment were employees are rewarded for hard work and extra efforts.,Health care coverage could be more affordable to employees.
123,Service Express,Senior Sales Exective,2016-06-02,1.0,Senior Account Executive,The spirit in the Corporate Office in Grand Rapids and your first day of on-boarding will astound you. Too bad it doesn't trickle out to remote offices.,"Florida offices have been revolving doors for years. Professional team members treated as if they are kindergartners and micromanaged to the point of having no air. Definitely a 'good ole boy' mentally. Mileage paid .40 way below what should be reimbursed. Misrepresentation. State core values are employee personal, professional, and financial goals. Every quarter you are to update those and management is to discuss with you. Never do. It's just another spreadsheet item that creates a roadblock in activities. Busy work is ridiculous. Listen to your inner voice ""Run"". It is not what corporate portrays."
124,Service Express,Working at SEI,2016-07-14,5.0,,"Best company I have ever worked for, by far!  You truly are in charge of your own future in our company.

126,Service Express,Account Exe,2015-04-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,NONE! This is a horrible DEAD END Job!,"I should have listed to my gut and NOT taken the job. They are all about activity. This isn't a bad thing if it productive, but they don't allow you to qualify prospects and make you take meetings even if its not a good fit. Sales management is OLD school and think that COLD CALLING is the only way to do it. That might have worked 20yrs ago but times have change. You have to make 100 calls a day and you HAVE to track each call on a worksheet and what time you called. You MUST have 20 meetings a month!  The market is dying and they are NOT doing anything to keep up. HQ has a set of values / culture that does NOT transfer to ANY other office. This is a DEAD END job"
127,Service Express,Growing pains.,2018-03-12,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great company, Great people, Great culture and a growing industry.",Company is growing extremely fast and is slowly loosing some of the core principles and values that made it so great.   I don't believe that this is stemming from senior leadership but rather from some of the new management that has been brought in from the outside.
128,Service Express,employee,2017-06-28,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"At Delta you are able to make decisions  without being micro managed.  At SEI, employees were released for duplication of job.

137,Service Express,Place to work,2016-06-15,3.0,,Workplace flexibility is second to none.  My manager did not keep track of my coming and going and thus I was able to do my job when I was able to make it in.,The leadership is a little stuck on itself.

141,Service Express,"Committed to customers, too committed to self-image.",2015-08-31,1.0,Field Service Engineer,"There are some people that work there that try to live and work ""the SEI way"". Being away from the office, taking care of customer issues.  In most cases, they do whatever it takes to resolve customer issues as quickly as possible above and beyond the contractual response requirements. Most customers see and appreciate that effort.","The ""SEI way"" is a fiction of the imagination of the leadership team and all of the employees know it.  Failing to toe the company line about the ""SEI way"" is the fastest way to unemployment. The employees who fell for ""the line"" try their best to look out for each other, the others espouse the mantra when senior leadership is around and can't stand each other (in most cases) the rest of the time.  We had a large office, the most knowledgeable engineer in the office did zero training with anyone else.  We received the most training when we had another manager in covering our office for a couple days.  I was an ""excellent"" employee until I said something that made someone in management unhappy.  I had been told that the ""SEI way"" was to work with ""problem employees"" to help improve them.  Immediate termination coming only for the worst offenses. I came in to work one day and found out I was no longer employed and for a totally different reason.  The management person in question couldn't list the actual reason.  It may have changed since I was there but I did not find this to be the case in any office I visited during my time with the company."

-Instead of training and coaching to success you are told to just make more phone calls.  If 100 phone calls isn't enough then you should be making 125 a day.  Then 150 a day.  If you have 30 companies in your territory that could be a good fit then call them 4 times a day.  If that does not work then call them 6 times a day.
-The company focuses on hardware maintenance.  Everything slse is a hit or miss depending on what they feel they can accomplish.  You don't know the other possibilities until long after you needed them.  Communication of capabilities is not at the forefront.
