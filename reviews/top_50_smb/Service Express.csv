2,Service Express,Culture and Growth,2022-01-31,5.0,SMB Account Executive,"I started as an SDR at Service Express and from the start leadership was putting me into a position to grow and learn.

The job is made easier by the tools that are given for cold calling and account build out

Leadership will always make an effort to accommodate your work schedule when personal life matters arise

Commission structure is strong combined with a competitive base. Plus, as good amount of PTO provided

Everyone here is willing to lend a helping hand and that culture is created from the top down","The SDR role is cold calling which is never fun

As the organization grows there have been pains around territory shifts and projects"
3,Service Express,"Disappointed, frustrated, burnt out",2021-11-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- A group of great people
- Work variety","- Working people until they have nothing left to give (both inside and outside of work)
- Company strategy is not well thought out or communicated from the top down (besides the goal of 500M, but HOW?) 
- Told to find solutions when issues arise, but solutions are ignored when presented 
- Teams are growing but there is no plan for structure so people are left with no clear answer to who their leader is 
- Understaffed and asked to do more and more with no support to make decisions because ELT members want the final say on everything big and small
- Several new hires were promised growth, flexibility, upper mobility, and more just for it to not be reciprocated 
- Vision talks go nowhere. 
- 3% raise if you are lucky when inflation is currently around 6% in the U.S."
4,Service Express,Good Culture and Growth Focused,2022-01-05,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Management invests time and energy into the professional and personal growth of the people they hire. They're selective, but the people they select are given time and room to grow, They've built a solid structure for helping their people grow, it is not a sink or swim environment. 
The team is definitely leveraged as a platform to promote from so movement higher into the company both within sales or into other departments is common.","Growth is expected, if you're looking to get to a comfortable position as an SDR without higher aspirations (either in responsibility or financial success) mgmt may eventually look to fill your seat with someone with a higher ceiling that's looking to grow"

9,Service Express,False Advertising,2021-11-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work from home. 
People are willing to help for the most part.","Cultish, led by old boys society who stay in the bubble. They all love spaghetti. A lot of them being thrown on the wall on a monthly basis. I’m not sure if they completely lost touch with reality or they are fully aware of problems but don’t care as long they are big fat and happy. 
Lots of talk but not a whole lot of walk. Marketing/social media team loves to promote and obnoxiously post on LinkedIn that we have the best culture in the world and we are all about people. They obviously live under the rock. 
If you push back or express your concerns, you will be called a negative person and get put on a watch list. After about 2 years, you either turn into a puppet, lose your identity, soul is up for grab OR if you are smart enough, you will start looking for a new job. 

The lack of diversity is very concerning too. Company continues to hire the same profile that fits the mold. Bonus point and fast promotion for look alikes and came from the same previous company. 
No raise for the last two years, pay is below standard. I heard upper management get big bonuses every year. Go figure."

12,Service Express,Great Place to Grow Your Career,2021-12-06,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"Service Express is a great place to grow your career. I came into this company having worked at many different places and this is by far the best culture I have been around. I started my career at Service Express as an SDR and learned the ins and outs of prospecting. The job was great at setting me up for success as I learned how to navigate CRM, strategize on accounts with my sales partners, and understand the tech jargon more. 

Like many of my peers, after committing myself to the role I was given the opportunity to be promoted to an account executive. Being an SDR gave me a fast track to being successful in the AE role. In the AE role I was challenged in a hunter role to go out and find new business opportunities. This was especially exciting knowing that I was contributing to a company looking to grow quickly. My quick success as an AE allowed me the chance to be promoted into my current position as an SAE. This role has been a huge blessing both professionally and financially for my family. 

Although my path is not what everyone does, as there are many opportunities for SE employees to move into roles within the company, it allowed me to fast track into my current role as an SAE. 

I believe that culture is the most important aspect of an organization. SE talks about culture throughout each work day. It's plastered all over the walls and the growth in the organization to sustain the culture is very encouraging. I would highly recommend people looking to grow in their sales career give us a look. You will not find a better place to call home.","With any growing organization there are some areas of improvement. I believe Service Express's biggest challenge in the next few years will be to remain grounded in what employees bought into in the first place, the culture. Those that have left were often not able to adapt and be agile to a fast pace tech organization. If you are able to adapt with changes and take challenges head on you will thrive at Service Express."
13,Service Express,Great Mentoring and Coaching,2021-11-30,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Its awesome to come to work and collaborate with other high caliber individuals !

They have the best prospecting tools on market and are constantly looking at what new technologies could be beneficial. 

They invest heavily in professional development. I was able to expense a book each quarter sometimes more often in order to develop my skill sets on the job. 

Leadership is PHENOMINAL. They built a lot of trust with me and didn't micro manage. They have all done the role themselves and know the ins and outs of it, but allow you to do what works best for you to get your results and let you take ownership of your work. Metrics are tracked so it makes it really easy to identify what areas to work on and what actions are producing positive results. During our coaching conversations they helped me to improve in areas I needed help with. If I ever needed anything to drive my work strategy and be more successful they bent over backwards more times then a Cirque show to make sure I got it. 

During months that are more challenging the conversations with leadership are never negative or disparaging they talk about the story behind the numbers with you and are always constructive/productive and focused on what can go better next month. 

Its the least cut throat sales environment I've ever been apart of. The culture and comradery that they foster in the team as a whole makes it alot of fun to be apart of. There are alot of happy hours and bi annual team outings. If we hit weekly team goals together you get a half day on Friday. Its a rush when the team gets momentum and achieves it week after week. Everyone has separate territories and teammates are really willing to help each other/share knowledge/different prospecting techniques which helps everyone grow really quickly. The managers don't have egos and are cool with helping each others direct reports as well. They only care about the individual and the teams success. As long as YOU APPLY YOURSELF on this team, you will succeed PERIOD. I was promoted off the team in 2021. I still work closely with the SDR team and hold them in high regard !","The only Con I can think of is, you might get paid slightly more at a bigger company, but the work life balance is really good so the extra time I would end up working for not much more pay isn't worth it to me I'd rather like and trust the people I work with and actually be able to clock out and enjoy my personal life."

16,Service Express,Service Express shares the WHY which empowers their employees!,2021-09-28,5.0,Lead Field Service Engineer,I've been with Service Express for 15 years. The thing I like about Service Express is the culture and the people. Sometimes decisions are made and we don't understand them - all we have to do is ask and our Leaders will share the WHY which empowers us as employees to be fully engaged. This is a great place with tons of opportunities. I look forward to another 15 years or more here!!,Benefits could use some improvement and overall paths to other careers within the company could be made much clearer.
17,Service Express,Focusing on their people,2021-12-02,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Great culture. Leadership truly wants you to excel in the roll and help you reach your personal, professional and financial goals. High energy, competitive team. The SDR role acts as a great foot in the door at a growing business with great opportunity.","Some people might not care for the competitiveness and high energy. That would typically be figured out during the interview process though. You are cold-calling prospects, and some can be rude, but that's just the nature of the job."
18,Service Express,Stay Far Away from this Company,2022-03-02,1.0,Data Center Technician,None that i can think of,Will work you to death have no personal time. They always want you to be on call 24/7.

20,Service Express,Too Good to be True?  Nope,2021-11-02,5.0,Account Executive,"Incredible culture - kind and friendly people at every employee level, high level of focus on employees and helping them achieve their personal, professional and financial goals. Training is comprehensive, relevant and practical.
Hiring process was quick and efficient. No wasted time and arbitrary hoops to jump through.","I work outside of the Grand Rapids area, so I don't get to go into the company HQ, which is a bummer since it looks like a fun, inclusive and high energy environment."
21,Service Express,Top Notch company,2021-10-27,5.0,Sales Executive,Amazing company to work- been here for just over 2 years. Unlike any sales organization I have been apart of. The support that we get from our leaders is nothing I can compare to. The industry (TPM) we are in- great place to be- training is phenomenal and gets you up and running quickly. Service side of the house does an incredible job.,Very fast paced selling environment- hard work pays off. Bit of a month to month grind- tough to compete with OEM during COVID times.
22,Service Express,Decent Entry-Level Job for Someone Just Out of College,2021-11-24,3.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"• The people at this company are excellent. That is the biggest perk of working here. This community will take you in under their wing and make you feel like you belong. They truly do hire the best; kind, driven, team-oriented people, willing to give you the shirt off their backs to help you succeed. Healthy competition is purely for motivation and entertainment purposes only.
• Management is very hand's off. As soon as you prove you're willing to put in the work, they'll trust you to do your job for the most part. They're also very understanding when it comes to general life interruptions/obstacles.
• Hybrid remote/on-site work environment accommodations. However, they do prefer people working on-site for the benefit of team camaraderie as it does make a significant difference in productivity and overall wellbeing for most.
• They're decently up-to-date on the tools/resources/platforms that are necessary to excel in the SDR field. 
• There is a lot of opportunity for growth within the company, but you have to set yourself apart in some way (i.e. through your personal results or finding a specific niche you excel in, which still takes time) and it's crucial to build relationships with the right people first. 
• The Directors (and some of the managers) within the SDR department are incredible leaders. They have HUGE hearts for each member of the team. They continuously pursue improvement in their own lives/professions, and truly want what is best for you as an individual. They will push you to a breaking point, then build you back up better than you were before… that is, if you're willing to make the necessary changes and continue to trust in them.
• Health benefits are OKAY. You can expense one new book a month, pay for half your gym membership, and they'll often host fun outings/happy hours, and provide regular free meals. 
• It's a great opportunity to make life-long friends, develop yourself as a young working adult, recognize your weaknesses, build on your strengths, face rejections, and learn how to communicate effectively.","• Compensation. They are underpaying most of the SDRs. They haven't adjusted our base salaries to inflation. This past year they actually raised our quota and cut our commission a little bit, but presented it to us like it was an opportunity to make more... which left us all scratching our heads...
• We're growing faster than management can handle and the culture has taken a serious hit because of it. Cliques are inevitably formed, but it's never really addressed with the team. Toxic banter between each other is actually encouraged sometimes. Gossip is becoming more and more of a problem and it's hardly addressed.
• The systems and processes we use are broken. Your territory and the rep you're partnered with will play a HUGE role in your success, and I think management knows this... but they'll never admit it despite it being common knowledge amongst the team. Your best bet is to suck it up and pray there will be a change soon. 
• Too much emphasis on numbers. If you're a top performer, you'll be placed on a pedestal and offered way more opportunities to be involved in other leadership-focused activities (which makes sense). The problem is the numbers lie. An SDR can set an ample amount of meetings with the wrong people and have them ""hold"" without actually explaining our services over the phone or qualifying the prospect. These kinds of ""top-performers"" are idolized and then given opportunities to teach other SDRs, which backfires on the team's overall success. 
• Suck-ups are promoted, but genuine skeptics are isolated and gas-lighted until they lose their minds and leave. If a flaw in the system (and they are many) is pointed out to leadership, it's denied, brushed under the rug, and you'll be scolded for questioning the system in the first place. This is by far one of the biggest cons of being on this team. Management touts innovation and transparency, yet practical solutions, good intentions, and true talent end up walking out the door. It's heartbreaking to watch. This team will continue to slowly crumble if management keeps treating people like this and promoting the wrong people into leadership positions."
23,Service Express,Not what it once was. Would not recommend.,2021-11-22,2.0,Senior Account Executive,"- Most employees are really great people.
- Great place to start a sales career or get into IT.
- Good work/life balance.","--- Focus has become solely on their goal of “$500M by 2025”. The rest of the tagline officially reads “the Service Express way”, however it should actually read “at whatever cost”. They’re cutting everywhere they can and EMPLOYEES ARE LEAVING IN DROVES. Executive leaders do not seem to care. CEO continues to blog about excellent leadership and culture while turning a blind eye to what’s really happening.
--- The company used to provide top notch service that you could be proud to sell. However service techs are not being replaced when they leave and the work is being outsourced. Customer problems are on the rise which means an account executive is spending a lot of their time putting out fires and dealing with unhappy customers.
--- Quotas continue to climb while account lists shrink. Comp plans were MAJORLY SLASHED in 2021 resulting in a massive drop in earning potential for sales reps.
--- No raises were given to anyone in sales in 2021 despite record setting sales in 2020.
--- Mixed bag with sales leaders. Some are great. Others are not. Many are micromanagers. The company has hired a lot of people from Enterprise (car rental company) and those leaders have fired performers without cause or notice. They have changed the culture. People on these teams are not happy.
--- Service Express touts their amazing culture. In fact, they shout it from the rooftops. But it is not felt. There is a major gap between what is reported on social media and what it’s actually like to work here.
--- There’s almost a cult mentality perpetuated by leadership that it’s the best place ever to work and you’ll be terribly unhappy if you leave. That’s not true.

Summary: If you want to move into sales, this is not a bad place to start. Go in as an SDR, work hard, and move up the ranks in sales. Learn everything you can. But don’t stay there for long if you care about your career growth and earning potential. At whatever point you stop growing, take what you’ve learned to another company. You’ll learn and earn more. If you’re already a mid-senior level seller - I’d steer clear of Service Express unless you need an entry point into IT. It is otherwise not worth your time. And if you're an employee that's reading this - you're not crazy. The company has changed. Don't sit around hoping things will get better. There is life after Service Express."
24,Service Express,"Not a bad company, but you must drink the Kool-Aid",2021-06-11,3.0,Field Service Engineer,"Surrounded by a bunch of great people...all smiles..part of the allure of the field service job is the allusion that you are your own boss, most of the time, Was never micro managed there...Benefits are decent","kool-Aid dispensed by the drumload. Constantly told how they are for their people, but, in a Field Service environment, all I can say is ""Yeah, right!!"" First off , no pay for being on call. You give up a week of your life to be on call and get nothing in return, unless you get called out, then you get OT, and, if the ticket qualifies, a 2 hour call out(straight time). not worth giving up a week, especially if you don't get called out. 

No company vehicles...no vehicle allowance, and not even reimbursed for mileage at he Federal rate. They only give you 85% of the Fed rate, while they probably write off 100%. Now wonder a lot of the FSE's drive clunkers... 

And don't refuse to drink the Kool Aid, failure to buy into the culture makes you a marked person...so just sit back, smile and wave, and sing the Kumbaya like you mean it, even if you don't."
25,Service Express,Great company to work for,2021-12-03,4.0,Sales,"- Service Express does an excellent job at hiring genuine people. Rarely you will find an individual who isn't willing to lend a hand 
- The resources and tools given to employees are designed to make them successful and are tops in the industry
- Team events planned outside of work (happy hours, offsites etc.)
- Management puts an emphasis on your growth inside and outside of the office 
- If you are willing to take coaching advice and be pushed by your peers/leaders, opportunities for growth will arise",- Management's bandwidth to assist with their direct reports can be challenging with growing teams

Very fast promotion from SDR to SAE. 
If you inherit established territory and accounts you are off to a great start.","The culture in sales is very poor and the leaders are amateurs. The #1 sales strategy is making 500-1,000 dials a week. Salesforce is being used as a micromanagement tool. Lots of politics for a company this size, watch your back! 
No employee retention strategy, barely any recognition, poor engagement and no career roadmaps. Attrition rate is very high and top talent is walking out the door."
29,Service Express,"Glorified call center. Do anything else, do not do sales development.",2021-11-05,2.0,Sales Development Representative,"Work life balance is second to none. Team outings like happy hours etc. are held often. Opportunities to earn half days Fridays. If you are lucky enough to work with solid account executives they'll be more helpful than any SDR leadership. Potential to be a solid starting place for a sales career. 

You can gain some solid experience.","Cold calls. Lots of cold calls. You will get burned out fast if you have a tough territory or do this for longer than a year.

SDR leaders have no real sales experience. This matters because they suck at coaching. They'll ask you what you think you should do and never actually give any real guidance or coaching. A couple of them can be incredibly condescending and will talk down to you. They will oversell the amount of opportunity there actually is with SE for SDR's. There's a reason for high turnover and they will spin every exit from the company to a positive when they are not and they know it.

A lot of two faced people at this company. Very political. Watch your back. A huge ""suck-up"" culture on the SDR team. Those that drown in kool-aid get ahead quick. Leadership plays favorites and those favorites get promoted fast. 

Some SDR's are blessed with ""golden territories"" where they easily set meetings exceeding quota yet are actually terrible at the job (go listen to some calls). Others grind hard and barely meet quota and are put on performance plans.

Overall Sales Dev is a glorified call center. Emphasis on glorified because they glorify it a lot here. There is a lot of misleading positive reviews here from SDR's that haven't been on the team very long so take it all with a grain of salt."

- loved the work I did and the growth during my time","- Has turned into a Burn and Churn environment (I was working 50-60+ hours a week for the last year with delegated work sent my end as well as my role duties)
- Disconnects with Leadership where new projects were being rolled out without any forethought or project management put into place by them Expected to do the work and figure it out with little direction other than being told it needed to be done. Would set unrealistic expectations and timelines for this work to be completed then get mad when it didnt work
- Not able to push back and say no to things, meet with the phrase ""reduce the friction"" making healthy boundaries a hard thing to achieve
- No structure to bigger plans that needed it
- The phrase "" People Power"" today at Service Express seems to mean more about having people to hit numbers and the company goal of 500 million by 2025 rather than growing people 
- Very late adopters of DE&I concepts and still has a way to catch up to other companies 
- Pay wasnt up to par with other similar positions at other companies
- When asking the ""Why?"" behind certain actions, would often be met with vague generic responses

32,Service Express,Great place to start your career in sales,2021-07-02,4.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"Service Express is a fast-growing, progressive company-the people are very nice and truly focused on helping you grow and investing in you.","The company in general is a Sales company- fast paced, big personalities, ""sportsmanship mentality"" carried throughout. The SDR team consists of people from all different backgrounds (not just sales) and very ""fun-oriented"" and metric driven. If you want to start your career in Sales, it's a great place to go. I will be honest through and say that if you don't see yourself in Sales and not driven by numbers, the role will feel monotonous. One thing I didn't realize when first starting with the team was the magnitude of how much cold-calling I would be doing (Typically 5-6 hours a day average for most people). The team makes it fun through, they do Zoom calls and take breaks, go on walks, and split up the day where they can."

Sales VP Management is non-existent. Regional Sales management is unaware of the market. Turnover is out of control, just look at the career page on company page.

Rocky Mountain management is lacking. Dont wear your ""Client First"" hats, don't do your funky hair days, I dont care how much beer/seltzers you drank over the weekend and dont care to see your floating keg pics. Dallas Management has been a joke....Western VP's have no idea how to sell in IT...""can I upgrade you to a midsize?'.....""What about the insurance plan?""...

If you are a professional sales executive, stay far away....Culture is a joke outside of Corporate.

You had a great past, new management has killed morale. Sales VP's disguise their concern over fired employees to a pipeline review."

I have very positive things to say about our recruiting process and my time working with our recruiting team.,I really don't have anything negative to say. Each day they find ways to improve and work very hard to ensure we are hiring the right people.
49,Service Express,A company that stands by it's employees,2021-05-11,4.0,Senior Account Executive,Great company culture and great growth opportunity!,Some of the stand alone offices do not echo the splendid culture that the corporate home office in Grand Rapids prides itself in partly due to outside hires from other companies.
50,Service Express,Top Notch Company,2021-05-21,5.0,Field Service Engineer,"Flexible schedule, competitive pay, training, great benefits",No cons. I love everything about this company
51,Service Express,Sales,2021-05-18,5.0,Sales Development Representative,Incredibly Team oriented company with stead growth year over year,No cons to list at this time
52,Service Express,Great,2021-07-13,3.0,Billing Specialist,"atmosphere, cozy, nice people, but very micro managed",Micro managed at the least. None of the leaders know what their employees do on a daily basis
53,Service Express,Great culture and advancement,2021-04-17,5.0,Account Executive,"company is growing, lots of room for advancement at HQ or branches",growing pains associated with acquiring companies
54,Service Express,"""SDR - Sales Development Representative""",2021-02-09,5.0,Account Executive,"PHENOMENAL team atmosphere, great leadership, extremely transparent, consistent commission opportunities and set up for success. You have the ability to make a lot of money, they give you the tools and training to do extremely well. If you focus on driving results you will be rewarded.","It's sales, high volume of cold calling."
55,Service Express,The BEST place to work,2019-11-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I left a job to start my career here. I am surrounded by smart and talented people who want to see me succeed here.  There is a lot of talk around here about making sure people “find the right seat on the bus” and I have found mine in my current role. I am pushed to do more, to do better, and to set larger goals but am always asked by my leader how they can help make it happen. I am encouraged to make suggestions about how I see my job evolving, and am not afraid to speak up in meetings and offer my opinion about how I can contribute to making things run more smoothly within the organization. 

There is definitely a lot expected of you, and working here is not for everyone. There is no better culture to be a part of in my opinion, although it sounds like each office has a culture that varies slightly. If you are willing to put in the time and effort it is very possible to be successful and happy here. 

Additionally, the retirement benefits are good, as well as the maternity leave policy. Service Express also pays half your gym membership, and allows employees 16 hours per year to volunteer at organizations of their choice.","The health and dental benefits need some work. The costs have continued to go up, while the cash in leu has stayed the same several years. The increased cost in benefits do not grow at the same rate of pay increases."
56,Service Express,Great Place to Work,2021-02-23,5.0,Field Service Engineer,Amazing Place to work. Love the culture and the people from top to bottom are even better. Would recommend Service Express to everyone I know.,None that I can think of.
57,Service Express,Great Place to Work,2021-02-23,5.0,Hardware Sales Associate,"Transparent leadership, growth, opportunity, and great people that I consider some of my best friends.",Fast growth not for everyone
58,Service Express,Legacy software and bad software development culture,2021-04-27,1.0,Software Developer,"- Management took time to listen to problems
- It seems like outside of software there might be some areas of the business that have a good culture","- Lack of technical direction
- Legacy software with deep rooted problems
- Poor technical leadership
- Constant focus on quick wins
- Blame individuals for systemic problems
- Spent 50% of my time running SQL updates to get people unstuck
- Benefits were not good relative to other companies"
59,Service Express,Great place to grow,2021-01-07,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),Training and opportunities are definitely abundant and there is a supportive team of coworkers and managers,Not too many downsides to the company. Job can be tough but the team is there to help
60,Service Express,Great place to work,2021-02-16,5.0,Chief Operating Officer,"Great positive culture, always growing and new opportunities are created to grow your career",I can't think of a negative
61,Service Express,Not everything it seems to be!!! Look at all the aug 24 reviews. They told people to make those.,2020-10-13,1.0,Sales Development Representative,"Easy money, large young team, have the chance for half day fridays.",The job is absolutely ridiculous. I think they should be audited for telemarketing rules they break everyday. If you don’t like sitting on an auto dialer or making 500+ outbound touches a day then stay away! They will have you on an auto dialer for 2 hours of the day and you could call through 300 people. As soon as someone answers get ready to talk. There is no strategy and they continue to give out gimmicks so customers will say yes to meetings. Avg turnover rate for position is 1 year.
62,Service Express,Amazing Culture,2021-01-22,5.0,Senior Account Executive,People love the company and their work. Everyone feels like they are contributing and works their butts off.,Not many I can think of. They have incredible perks and benefits
63,Service Express,"Good Company, Growing Pains",2020-02-20,4.0,Senior Account Executive,"Culture in HQ seems to be very positive, but if you are outside sales, the culture diminishes pretty fast.  They have a niche market and many of the service member's provide excellent service to customers.","The industry is evolving quickly and many customer's are moving to the cloud.  With on premise hardware decreasing, this will continue to make the market more competitive and a race to the bottom in pricing.  While SEI has a great model with W-2 engineers, this can be a negative tradeoff as they are more expensive than most competitors when essentially providing the same service. They were also recently bought by a new PE firm, which has already negatively impacted quotas with a 40-60% increase and little room to make good commissions unless you absolutely crush your number.  They also promote people into Sales Management based on performance, which is not a great practice as you get manager's with sales success, but no idea on how to be productive leader's."
64,Service Express,Great Company Culture- Amazing to work for,2020-08-24,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"The leadership in this company fantastic. They are very understanding, let you know what is expected of your role, and help you to grow professionally. Its great working with competent people who know how to work as a team.","You have to use PTO for sick days, however, you acrew more PTO the longer you work for the company. You start out with a decent amount of PTO, and you get a free day off for your birthday."
65,Service Express,Great company to work for!,2020-12-14,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"Caring, engaging, and help you achieve your personal, professional, and financial aspirations","Growing quickly, lots of new initiatives are rolled out frequently."
66,Service Express,Great place to work.,2020-08-24,5.0,Sales Development Representative,Awesome work environment. Service Express invests in their sales team and will truly invest in you as a person and a professional. I assure you the culture is unmatched and you will enjoy coming into work everyday. The quotas are very achievable as long as you put in the work - they also love to promote from within. This organization is spectacular.,I really cannot think of any.
67,Service Express,culture culture culture,2020-11-17,5.0,Sales Director,exceptional company culture and in a industry that is growing,"not many, work to empower the field"
68,Service Express,Amazing Company,2020-11-06,5.0,Senior Account Executive,Great management. They really care about employees and want to see them do well.,Changes through the company can be pushed out fast
69,Service Express,Unlike No Other,2020-02-10,5.0,Field Service Engineer,"The company core value is 'To help our people achieve their personal, professional and financial goals'. Service Express truly cares about their employees and backs every word of it up with actions. I have been here 3 years now and it is unlike any other tech company I've worked for which includes IBM and TGCS.  It is a pleasure to wake up and want to go to work!","We are a small company so benefits are slightly lower than my previous employers. That being said, this a Pro as well because we are continually growing and improving on the benefit package and opportunities."
70,Service Express,Growing Company,2020-11-20,4.0,Lead Field Service Engineer,"Growing company, great people. Flexible schedule.",Our culture has changed and when employees bring that up to superiors they don't acknowledge or correct it. Excuses can't fix the disparity between what we claim our culture is and what it really has become.
71,Service Express,Great company overall,2021-01-12,4.0,Senior Account Executive,Great culture... sales is especially tough but rewarding.,On you’re own in sales to make it happen... not as much support as other companies I’ve worked for in the past.
72,Service Express,Fantastic company,2020-10-19,5.0,Account Executive,"Fun, employee oriented, lots of opportunity",Not great health benefits but there are changes being made

74,Service Express,BEST PLACE EVER,2020-08-24,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"culture, pay, opportunity to grow",Working until 5 at times is tough. But thats all I can say
75,Service Express,Unlimited earning potential,2021-01-05,4.0,Senior Account Executive,Tremendous help from corporate/marketing/biz development,A ton of cold calling to set meetings
76,Service Express,Servant Leadership Culture,2020-08-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Very supportive leadership team committed to helping you leverage your particular strengths.,"If you like it, you'll love it. But if the culture isn't a fit for your personality, you'll be miserable."
77,Service Express,"Amazing company with a great culture, great time to be apart of the TPM industry.",2020-07-08,5.0,Account Executive,"Leadership is invested in you on a personal, professional and financial aspect. They truly care and want you to succeed.",Been with the company for a year and see no cons at this time.

79,Service Express,Still the best place,2020-03-30,5.0,Account Executive,"Culture, company growth, new opportunities",Health benefits could be improved
80,Service Express,Outstanding Culture,2016-06-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"At Service Express everyone is part of the same team, working towards achieving their goals.  You are given constant feedback on areas that you excel so you can celebrate, as well as areas you can improve.  When it comes time for an annual performance review, it is just that, a review.  Each day the bar raises and you are provided new opportunities and challenges to grow and stretch.  You do work hard, but your work is important and you do not feel like a number.  I have been a part of Service Express for over 20 years.  I have seen the company grow consistently every year. Throughout all of the growth, the culture of Service Express has remained the same.  You are accountable and responsible for your actions, but you are also empowered to make decisions and are given the tools you need to be successful.  The company truly cares about you as a person and your personal life, not just the work you do.","There are two areas I feel are areas to continue to work on.  I say areas to work on rather than cons.  They are communication and collaboration.  As we continue to grow I sometimes find that multiple teams might be working a similar project, but not together.  So in the end you might get duplication of efforts vs multiplication of efforts.  The better we communicate and more we force ourselves to collaborate the better results we will have.  These are areas of focus to continue to improve on."
81,Service Express,Incredible company to work for.,2019-10-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Amazing culture and employee oriented.  Truly shows lot of care on employee development as well as customer care. Executive Leadership is all about coaching values and doing things with positive attitude.,Not that I have seen so far.
82,Service Express,"Terrible Management, no growth, pretend to care about personal growth",2019-09-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,A lot of free food(that is changing). Some Departments are Great and Some are absolutely terribly run - very few in between.,Management is 99% men and most higher levels are brought from outside of company so they do not know much about how the company works or really care - only looking to make themselves look better for their next job.  A previous co-worker is about to get promoted for not doing their job but rather because of being obsequious person.
83,Service Express,Excellent culture-great place to work!,2019-10-31,5.0,Regional Manager,Emphasis on  personal development and employee engagement,nothing I've seen  so far!
84,Service Express,My Honest Opinion,2017-03-13,5.0,Technical Support Specialist,"Some people will talk about the culture as a ""drink the Kool-Aid"" mentality, and when you first join it will seem that way. But when you see the culture in action and find that management isn't peddling a lip service, you find yourself bought in wholeheartedly. I have been with the company for 5 years, I started as a Field Service Engineer and have been promoted to a support specialist. In my time here no one has ever mislead or lied to me about my responsibilities or expectations. I have known what was expected of me from day one. I came from an industry outside of IT, the company provided me training and the tools to learn and advance professionally. Management has always encouraged people to do what they are passionate about. In my time here management and my teams have always showed a genuine interest in seeing me succeed and fulfill my potential. Along the way they have given me the tools to do so, it has been up to me to get it done. SEI encourages there employees to be honest, upstanding members of their community by giving them days off to use toward community service.","I genuinely have no Cons to mention, anytime I have had an issue I have brought it up and we found a solution. It would take an extreme situation for me to leave SEI."
85,Service Express,"At Service Express, your co-workers become your family - collaborative work environment + work life balance.",2019-11-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work life balance, culture, training, opportunities for growth, great relationship with co-workers!",Only con I can think of would low PTO days & high insurance cost.
86,Service Express,Great culture at a growing company,2014-12-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Service Express is the best company I have ever worked for.  The company is founded on helping employees achieve personal, professional and financial goals.  They recognize that when people are able to achieve their goals and are engaged that they will do great work and take care of customers.  We believe in working hard, having fun and getting great results.  

Opportunity is everywhere in this growing company.  The pace of change is fast but logical and controlled.  For a motivated, talented person this is an environment that challenges you to grow and stretch beyond your comfort zone.  Employees are encouraged to follow their passion and try new ways to solve problems.  The leadership team knows that people doing what they love on a daily basis will yield great results.

SEI puts people first.  Time off is never a problem and is encouraged.",Hard to find dramatic cons.  SEI is a challenging place to work.  It is not for everyone.  You are accountable to produce results.  If you want a job that allows you to coast or not develop this is not the place for you.
87,Service Express,Good place for short term,2013-11-14,2.0,Senior Account Executive,"Good base salary. Good place to break into IT sales without much technical knowledge. Service people tend to deliver what sales promises, so you can sell with confidence.","Tend to Hire too many sales people than territory can support. Increasing turnover of sales people. Very little training and no support once you are in the field. Several managers were good sales people 10 years ago but now do little to support their reps other than request more reports. Never ending reports on activity. I have never had less support from a manager than what I have had here. Sales managers seem to have life time job security. 
Mentality is there will always be a need for the service they provide when in reality it is greatly diminishing. They have adjusted in the past to such changes but their current pace is not keeping up with the pace of change in the industry today."
88,Service Express,Sales Sales Sales,2019-07-30,4.0,SDR,"Awesome company, not-so awesome job. Being an SDR is tough work. It will pay off in the end. Work hard play hard.",The job itself can be grueling. The team members are there to help out though. You can voice your career goals within the company but they don't necessarily give you the resources to get there unless you want to enter the realm of higher-up sales.
89,Service Express,Great Place for professional development,2019-12-22,4.0,Field Service Engineer,Professional Development is a high priority,No work life balance. No compensation for being on call.
