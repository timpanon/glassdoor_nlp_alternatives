0,SimplrFlex,Best company to work for,2022-03-09,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"Work when you want, weekly pay, what’s not to love.",Nothing it’s an amazing company.
1,SimplrFlex,Great option for a SAHM,2021-12-26,5.0,Expert,"I'm a full-time SAHM to three small children, ages 4,2, and 8 months. I am also a military spouse with a husband who is relocated every 3 years. In this phase of our lives, SimplrFlex has been such an amazing option! It's something I can work on during naptime or after bedtime very easily. Even if I only work a handful of hours one week, it's still money in my pocket that I wouldn't have otherwise had. It can also move with me as we move to various duty stations with my husband's career. I""m super grateful for the opportunity to have some work/income right now and I only have positive things to say about this company :)","I don't see any real downsides other than the fact that it is customer service and it may not always be the most fulfilling work. That being said, it can be fulfilling when you stumble across a customer who is super grateful for the work you do."
2,SimplrFlex,So Grateful for this company!,2022-02-20,5.0,Expert,Excellent flexibility. There is so much support available by the company. It has been a huge blessing to work with Simplrflex.,"As of yet, I have no cons to report."
3,SimplrFlex,Amazing company,2022-01-17,5.0,Expert,Beyond thankful for this job. The flexibility is absolutely amazing and you can tell they actually care about their employees and want them to succeed.,I do wish there was more potential to move up in the company.
4,SimplrFlex,"Incredible opportunity, great company and community to be a part of",2021-07-19,5.0,SimplrFlex Expert,"This job was an incredible opportunity for me, I was stuck at a job I was very unhappy with for years until I was able to quit and start working for this company. Flexible hours from the comfort of your own home, good pay, friendly community, the pros heavily outweigh any cons of working for this company and I am very happy to be a part of it!","With a job like this the only con that I can think of, which being said really falls onto the person and not the job itself, is with the freedom of working whenever you want to make sure that you can make and follow a schedule for yourself. Time management was something I had to start working on for myself when starting and getting into the groove of this job, but that is already a valuable skill to have and this just helped me work harder at that. Like I stated earlier, the pros heavily outweigh the cons - I can hardly think of any!"
5,SimplrFlex,Flexible job for stay at home parents and students,2021-12-30,5.0,Expert,Flexible schedule and supportive management,Nothing as of now since I am new.
6,SimplrFlex,Great Company,2022-01-08,5.0,Expert,Love working for them! Such a wonderful place.,I wish tickets flowed more.
7,SimplrFlex,I have never known such freedom,2021-06-10,5.0,Expert,"I love working with Simplrflex! By joining Simplrflex I was able to leave a very toxic environment. 
This is a REMOTE position, I'm able to work when and decide how long I want! It's all dependent on how much I want/need to bring in that week. 
There are ""Specialists"" available if I ever get stuck, and they are always very helpful. 
The company is also very open to suggestions from Experts, which is refreshing and makes me feel like I could stay with them for a long time!","Sometimes I will attempt to resolve a customer's issue but after a bit of back and forth, it's apparent that I cannot help, so I have to escalate which means I don't get paid for that ticket even though I did work on it. 
Corp is aware of this and is working on a solution, but it's still disheartening. 

This is a 1099 position, this can be scary at first not having that guaranteed paycheck but I'm able to bring home the same as my previous w2 position, sometimes more.

I feel that these are minor nuances and not big enough that would keep me from recommending everyone to apply."
8,SimplrFlex,Okay if there's no escalations,2022-01-15,3.0,Anonymous Employee,can make a lot during peak periods,"escalations, pay, unfair, reviews can be very unfair."
9,SimplrFlex,Great Company! Very Supportive!,2021-10-15,5.0,Expert,Simplrflex is a great company. I am able to create my own schedule. The leadership and support staff are always encouraging and ensure that you have the tools you need to be successful.,Not necessarily a con but the Flexibility forces you to manage your time!
10,SimplrFlex,So thankful for Simplrflex!,2021-01-19,5.0,Expert,I started in 2019 and ended up taking a huge break when I got a different job. That job ended up not supporting my move from Oahu to GA when my husband left the Army and I am so thankful that Simplrflex allowed me to reactivate my position with them. I honestly cannot believe how much better the platform is now and how much it has grown. I use this as my full time job and can make $1000+ a week when I choose to. This is a huge blessing to our family as my husband was medically retired and I am the only one working. I am able to help our 3 boys with homeschool and still greatly contribute to our family. I really love this job. The volume of tickets has greatly increased since I started and I love that I can steadily make great money.,"The only con for me is when customers leave a negative review for things that are out of my control such as delays in shipping. It can make you worried, but luckily, it seems to balance out."
11,SimplrFlex,Amazing,2021-08-12,5.0,Expert,"SimplrFlex is amazing. I can work from home. Stay with my children and work as much or as little as I want to. I am a military spouse and moving a lot so keeping one job is hard. SimplrFlex helped us a lot. We can do more things, spend more time with fun traveling and re-do our home. SimplrFlex is amazing.",There are no cons for SimplrFlex. I never had any issues. Thank you so much
12,SimplrFlex,A place who's motives are actually in line with their actions,2021-07-13,5.0,SimplrFlex Expert,"This is not a paid review. I was desperate for a job after Covid hit. Being mentally ill and the isolation of Covid really took a toll on my comfort being in the public. I have anxiety speaking publicly, and when I heard about SimplrFlex it sounded too good to be true. I waited 3-4 months on the waitlist, kind of left my mind. One day I got an e-mail that there was an opening, and that was that. I cannot express my gratitude to have the ability to be a part of a community like SimplrFlex. I haven't been there long but I have only ever had one job in my 20+ job long resume where your employees treat you this way aside from this one. They constantly check-in, they - actually - listen to feedback and do their best to incorporate it. They offer you incentives. They make sure you're comfortable. They treat you like a human. I actually enjoy it and the freedom to work as much or as little as you want is remarkable. I also think the motives behind SimplrFlex are wonderful too -- providing empathy and real human connection to clients and customers instead of the AI-automated world we live in nowadays. There is a giant community of coworkers always willing to help you. Everybody is always kind and never makes you feel stupid or isolated. I could go on and on. I hope this business continues to accelerate because Adam and the team deserve it in a way I can not express for making this opportunity possible for so many people who need it. It takes a second to get into the flow of things, I procrastinated out of fear & anxiety for a long time. Don't give up! You'll get it. I stand at all 5-star reviews currently, and it's because SimplrFlex makes you WANT to excel for them to show your gratitude. I see that SimplrFlex was voted one of the top places to work in 2021, and Adam was voted as one of the best CEO's of a company. These titles are deserved. Advice -- In the beginning, don't hesitate or waste time in avoiding reaching out for help. They will help you and you will learn so much quicker and get the curve of things.","The only cons are hardly real cons. There is a paradigm in having such freedom to work whenever you want, because you can work whenever you want so forcing yourself on a schedule is difficult. But this is an issue with myself, and not SimplrFlex. Escalating tickets sucks but it's really not a big deal, just move on, I don't think it's out of control. Sometimes people just want to have a conversation which can cause a ticket to time out, but again, the majority of 'cons' have no weight in comparison to all of the positives -- kind of pointless to even mention."
13,SimplrFlex,Great company to work for,2021-09-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I can create my own hours. Really easy to get work done while staying at home with my children.,No cons - I love my job!
14,SimplrFlex,Thankful for this Company!,2021-02-28,5.0,Expert,"It has given me the opportunity to make extra money for my family while I am staying at home with them. It pays for my daughter's braces, gymnastics, and piano lessons. Everyone is very friendly and goes out of their way to help you when you need it. It will pay you as much as you are willing to put into it. The more tickets you take consistenly the easier it becomes. Adam is a great person to work for and is always looking out for his workers!","I don't like it when I have done a lot of work towards a ticket and then I am forced to escalate. It doesn't too often, but it is always disappointing. I would love it if you could submit for a partial pay if you feel you have put in a lot of effort."
15,SimplrFlex,Great Company!,2021-08-02,5.0,Customer Service Specialist,I really enjoyed working for SimplrFlex. They train well and set you up for success in your role. It was extremely flexible which was incredibly important for my family.,The slow days is definitely a con. Also- not being able to reject a chat because you’re already busy and having that affect your time and rating was a little frustrating.
16,SimplrFlex,Awesome work from home job,2021-03-10,5.0,Expert,"Flexible, positive and helpful feedback from the company whenever I reach out for guidance, communication with specialists and management is always available, specialist are always helpful and do not make you feel bad for asking questions, community is positive and helpful. There are a ton of help articles available and training on some partners. I feel SimplrFlex truly wants our work experience to be positive. I love that they make a point to reach out every so often to say thank you or send a surprise gift for reaching a goal. The work is fairly easy and it allows me to stay home with my children. A true blessing for my family in this season of life. All around great experience.",The only con I can think of is that there are learning curves and that can be hard in a virtual setting. That being said help is always available if you reach out.
17,SimplrFlex,Great company!,2021-09-22,5.0,Expert,SimplrFlex provides me a flexible work-from-home position!,Sometimes tickets are slow to come in.
18,SimplrFlex,Great company,2021-08-18,5.0,Customer Service Expert,"-You can work when you want.
-You can work from any location.
-Awsome specialist support!
-Management is great at responding to issues and taking ideas into consideration.","-A lot of escalation tickets.
- Some companies do not put good solutions to tricky tickets."
19,SimplrFlex,a true blessing,2021-11-08,4.0,Customer Service Representative EMAIL/CHAT,"Works great with busy mom schedules, very flexible.",slow flow at times not stable income
20,SimplrFlex,A good source of extra income,2021-08-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Flexible hours and easy web based platform,Should not be considered as a full-time
21,SimplrFlex,So far so good.,2021-01-17,5.0,Expert,"You get to set your own schedule and I can work around my other job at a school. The specialists that you reach out to for help have mostly been very kind, patient, and helpful even though I feel like I have to reach out a lot as I am new and still learning.","It does seem like a lot of tickets need to be escalated back to the business partner, in which case you do not get paid no matter how much time you have already put into the ticket. Also, you have no access to read customer reviews that are less than 5 stars. Its a bit hard to grow and do better when you aren't sure what you did wrong in the first place. It would be nice if there was a way to keep customer reviews anonymous while still allowing the expert to read what the customer had to say and see where we fell short of hitting the 5 star review mark."
22,SimplrFlex,Wonderful opportunity,2021-06-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Simplrflex has been an amazing addition to my life. I am able to make my own schedule and make as much or as little as I want each week. Support staff available and positive work culture. Whether you are looking to use this as a part time or full time position, you have the freedom to choose your path.",I have not experienced any yet!

Time is very flexible and the pay is every week!,Hope they will add some benefits like 401k or option for their employees if they wanted to pay for it.
24,SimplrFlex,Greatest Company For Extra Money,2021-05-11,5.0,Expert,Working for SimplrFlex allows you to make your own schedule and work as much as you want! It is very flexible for people with children and the help is phenomenal. Questions are easily answered and the staff is great to work with and talk to!,"The only Con is all the escalated tickets cause time to be lost from working during a day. Some of the macros are extremely long and confusing, but once you get a hang of it, it is smooth sailing."
25,SimplrFlex,Great flexibility,2021-09-08,4.0,Customer Service Expert,"They have flexible hours, weekly pay, consistency, and good support.","Not W-2

This company is great with communication and wanting us to succeed.,"I'm behind on the training, so it is a little overwhelming to catch up. But that is on my own doing of being a procrastinator. They offer training to help their employees succeed and give notifications of newly available pieces of training."
27,SimplrFlex,Amazing opportunity,2021-03-31,5.0,Expert,"I absolutely LOVE that I can work anywhere at any time, great training videos/powerpoints for partners we are associated with. A great way to earn extra cash, simprlflex specialists are so helpful as well. I really love simplrflex! Oh, and I forgot to mention there is ALWAYS great incentives to earn more money!","No cons on my end, only that I don't have enough time in the day, I wish I was able to be on the platform more than I am."
28,SimplrFlex,Best place to work at!,2021-01-24,5.0,Customer Service Expert ( Non Voice),"SimplrFlex offers the flexibility that works perfectly with my family's lifestyle. Working remotely for a company that cares about its employees is something that I'll always be thankful for. So far, I've gained remote/virtual customer service experience that will help me in the future as well. SimplrFlex is one of a kind and is a job that cares and provides assistance to everyone, including the employees and its customers.","There are many things to learn about the different company's rules, but with time and practice, it'll get easier in the long run."

35,SimplrFlex,Best Company,2021-04-22,5.0,Customer Service Representative,I have never worked for a company that values their employees as much as SimplrFlex does. They truly go above and beyond! The amount of support that I have had throughout my employment is not seen in many companies anymore.,There are no cons to working for SimplrFlex!
36,SimplrFlex,Great company,2021-05-11,5.0,Expert,"Work whenever and how much you want. Pays weekly. Guidelines are pretty clear, there is always someone to help.",The work is consistent if you're consistently active on the site. Can't find much fault with this company.
37,SimplrFlex,Amazing company to work for!,2021-03-18,5.0,Expert,"flexible, not difficult, ability to log in and out at will, incentives are great, swag was very generous, everyone very helpful","some companies make it near impossible to help their customers, thus having to escalate, Popeyes and BK need a better delivery system, Tim Hortons needs to figure out their promotions and points system"
38,SimplrFlex,Great company for extra cash,2021-03-02,5.0,Expert,"Extremely flexible, a very straightforward operation, and no hidden gimmicks. The hiring process was well thought-out with the test tickets and the way they were evaluated/graded. They have figured out a way to hire qualified individuals without an extensive interview process that some individuals struggle with. Well done.","It can be frustrating when you work hard on a ticket and end up having to escalate the ticket, which results in no pay for the time put in."
39,SimplrFlex,Wonderful Company to Work For,2020-09-25,5.0,Expert,"SimplrFlex is the first company I have worked for that truly values its employees. The Specialists go out of their way to make sure we as Experts have everything we need. If there is an issue we are experiencing, they do their darnedest to get it fixed and figured out. 
It is awesome to be able to work when and where you can, so long as you have a laptop or desktop. 
SimplrFlex provides a constant way for you to learn and improve. Just another way they show how much they value us, the experts.","At times, there are very few tickets for them to disperse amongst the experts, which leaves you sitting there for several minutes with nothing to do, which can be frustrating when you only have a limited time to work. This is at no fault to SimplrFlex, though. It like going to a job in person and having a slow day."
40,SimplrFlex,Great Company!,2021-03-23,5.0,Expert,You get to choose your own schedule and the work is fairly easy once you get the hang of things.,Sometimes there are things that we are just unable to handle so we have to miss out on a bunch of tickets and escalate them to the partner level which means you miss out on being able to help the customer and resolving the ticket.
41,SimplrFlex,Very flexible!,2021-05-19,5.0,Expert,"- flexible
- incentives 
- work-from-home
- work anytime and however much I want",- none that I have encountered.
42,SimplrFlex,They Aren't What You Think,2020-09-23,1.0,Expert,Flexible schedule. Can be busy at times.,"What I find sad about this company is that they want to make sure you review them positively within 30 days of being recruited. This way, when you post a positive review, it makes more people want to apply. The Specialists and upper management are a joke. They have their favorites. How they treat some Experts is atrocious. I think they want good reviews to make their clients think they provide a good work ethic, and they do not.

They go through more ""Experts"" than they do water. If you voice your concern, it can because of an issue. Anyone under the Specialist level are minions to them. I am sure not everyone feels this way about the company, but they know they are wrong. Paying $1.50 per ticket (most of which you don't get paid for if they are escalated) is ridiculous. You can work very hard on a customer ticket (days even), and if it turns up that you have to escalate it back to the client (the vendor/business), you will NOT get paid for it. Basically, you are working for free.

What it seems like is that they want people who say nothing, have no opinion, and just take the abuse that most of the Specialists and upper management give. Working from home should not be this heartbreaking. You can And WILL be replaced at the drop of a dime."
43,SimplrFlex,Fantastic company to work for!,2021-05-04,5.0,Customer Service Expert,"Flexible work schedule.

I contribute to my household income, yet I have plenty of time to raise my kids.  I like the challenge each ticket gives me.  I like the feeling of helping people out.",It is not a job that would provide a full income.  It is only supplemental.  There are sometimes when I can be logged in for a longer time period and receive minimal tickets. It can be a little bit feast or famine with the inconsistency in the number of tickets received.
116,SimplrFlex,Garbage,2020-04-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,None . Working here was garbage,Everything. Nothing about this place is nice

It's very flexible and if you have kids as I do, you can work with around their schedules so you don't miss valuable quality time with them! Pay is weekly and never fails to come through on time. If you ever need any help with tickets, help is just a chat away! My final thoughts are: if you love the customer service field, this is the absolute best opportunity for you. I never thought I would find a true and honest work-at-home job that didn't require cold calls or selling. I would definitely recommend SimplrFlex to anyone looking for a way to make a little extra money to help with the never-ending daily expenses!",There is honestly no cons in my experience!
120,SimplrFlex,You do a lot of work for free.,2019-01-09,3.0,Expert,"Easy to do from home, some tickets are resolved quickly and easily, fun to do if you enjoy customer service","Sometimes you can be logged in for a full day and get 1-3 tickets.
Pay is very low, 1.50 per ticket that you resolve. 
If you spend two days going back and forth with a customer and then the ticket has to be escalated you get absolutely nothing. This has been happening a lot lately, where customers are being sent the wrong items and we are required to ask them for photos of the items before we can escalate the tickets, but as soon as we verify they got the wrong item- we have to escalate. So essentially you do all the leg work and don't get paid for it. 
A majority of the companies you represent have bad return policies or send bad products, so you deal with a lot of unhappy people. Or some of the companies have no info available for you, so you may spend an hour looking for an answer, then have to reach out for help and still have to escalate the ticket resulting in getting paid nothing."
121,SimplrFlex,This has been a dream!,2019-06-26,5.0,Expert,"You don't have to be on the phone to work from home! My biggest issue as a stay at home mom is I cannot work over the phone. Simplrflex has given me the opportunity to make decent money from home at my own pace. I can log off to make lunch for the kids and get back on and start earning again. There's always someone available if you need help. They also pay weekly via PayPal, so I don't have to wait forever and I'm not being paid in gift cards or useless points. This is actually a real job with real earning potential.","Some days can be slower than others. However, I always have tickets to work on. It is never empty."

-Interesting work.","-It would be nice to see an adjustment in the compensation.  Without going into too much detail, if you have a question you can't assist with, you do not get paid anything for it.  In the future, it would be nice to see something small for these."
129,SimplrFlex,It was good... until it wasn't...,2019-05-12,2.0,,You can work from home. You can make as little or as much as you want to make.,"You do a lot of work on tickets that a lot of times you do not get paid for. You also have a employee review number. This is not necessarily a good thing because no other job gig or otherwise has non-qualified non-employee persons judging whether or not another non-employee is worth keeping around. 

They will send you emails about a number being low and tell you that you are at risk of being deactivated when their clients unfortunately are not the cream of the crop and have a lot of issues with their own processes and relay those same issues to the platform  and that somehow is reflected on you like it is your fault. There is literally nothing we can do if a customer is not happy about being told no they can't do something or no we can't do something. Or if the company has consistently given them broken or not in the same condition item that they purchased and the customer is agitated already. Or if they have issues in delivery and have people angry on social media and elsewhere about it because they failed to live up to their promises that is not something we can help since we are not shipping.

When you go to check your numbers they quote it is consistently higher then they say it is and that makes for a very confusing time. I think there is a lot of disorganization from both the people running the platform as well as the clients. You cannot provide the best customer service experience without all the information available or policies that change and they do not consistently notify you of those changes but will write you a slightly nasty letter or message about what they feel you did wrong. Or agree with the customer and don't have a good explanation as to why they feel that way that other people with an objective opinion do not quite understand either."
130,SimplrFlex,Amazing,2019-06-27,5.0,Expert,"I love the flexibility to work whenever I want with my son next to me! This is such a good company, and I am forever grateful for this opportunity! Keep up the good work!","No cons, maybe more traffic :)"

135,SimplrFlex,GREAT!,2021-06-20,5.0,Expert,"Everything. Being a military spouse and our moves, this job has taken away so much stress of finding work. Money is always coming in and I know I can work as much or as little as I want. Always have support from everyone here! I have worked a lot harder for a lot less at previous jobs.",Bad reviews make you nervous for a while. Now that I am a few months in I don't stress about a bad one that shows up. You can't please everyone and the score does bounce back. The thought of losing this job over upset customers is probably the worst part of it.

This job allows me to be able to work whenever if convenient for me while allowing my wife and mom duties to be first, waiting in line at a vet or doctor's appointment I can work as long as I have internet and my computer, at the park because the kids want to play? no problem. I can work after the kids go to sleep, I can work during the day when they are going crazy because it is all email and chate-based customer service. I am in *near* complete control of how much money I make and I never have to deal with phone calls, interviews, or checking in with anyone.","Sometimes it is very slow, that is why in my pros potion I wrote *near* complete control. There have been days where I felt like I was on for hours waiting for work to come in. With that being said, this is not a job you want to replace with a full-time job. This is more of an ""extra money"" type of job. Though this company does give you a lot of help and advice and I do think it's with good intentions, with specialists reaching out to you quite often, sometimes it can feel like you are always doing something wrong, and could be one foot out the door without you knowing. You do need to maintain customer service score and accuracy score (there is absolutely nothing wrong with that) but when specialists are reaching out to ""help"" you every week, or asking if we are doing ok because ""they have been noticing you have been using x,y, and z tool a lot more than the average expert"" it can begin to make you feel as if you aren't supposed to use all the tools at your disposal, and insecure. Unfortunately, with this platform, you can get kicked off at any given moment if your score drops under a certain amount, with very minimal if any warning (which is fair and all, but it would be nice if there was a 3 strike warning system). So it sometimes can feel like you are on edge, and always on the verge of getting fired."
