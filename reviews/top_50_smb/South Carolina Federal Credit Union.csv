0,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,Enjoy my job here.,2022-04-02,5.0,Sales and Service Manager,Wonderful pay and benefits. Senior leaders show employees they are appreciated and valued. Extra perks such as mobile doctors visits on site and reimbursement for gym membership. Strong involvement in community activities.,Some long time employees think they run everything even if the title they hold doesn’t give them that authority
1,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,Outstanding benefits and that’s where it stops.,2022-02-09,2.0,Financial Service Representative,"401k match- 10% 
Super Generous PTO","Getting promoted is almost impossible unless you’ve put in years of work or are friends with hiring managers. It’s not based on merit or worthiness. 

Forced glass door reviews- they’ll respond nobody is forced… but they are heavily bribed. Management gets emails monthly reminding them to remind employees of the importance of us keeping reviews coming in monthly. If we win a ‘top company’ we get generous rewards. This year it was 24 hours of free PTO

Management is encouraged to number push to exceed goals. As a company we’ve met goals 10-20% higher than they’ve asked for consistently, yet they continue to push for more. This is a bank mindset, not a credit union mindset. 

They will respond to this review like they do any other review that is slightly negative. The reason people don’t get promoted is because we have great tenure. They NEVER force glass door reviews. We do have sales goals but they’re for the good of the member only and never to benefit the company. If I’m unhappy they wish me the best of luck for a new company and career. 

There’s a reason the retail area is always short staffed. Theres a reason turnover is so high in the branches. There’s a reason people pine for the back office positions. They just refuse to acknowledge that the company culture is a major attributing factor."
2,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,Best Place to Work,2022-03-11,5.0,,"Extremely pro-employee, senior leaders listen, internal dedicated career development specialist, great premiums on health insurance, free dental insurance option, excellent 401k match, leaders went above and beyond to take care of employees during pandemic to include premium member-facing pay and Fun Food Fridays, interest rates for employee loans, inclsusive work environment (has a very active Diversity Equity and Inclusion Council) and the list goes on and on.",Some systems are challenging to navigate which can sometimes cause unintentional errors.

5,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,Amazing Employer Who Cares,2022-02-14,5.0,Contact Center Team Lead,"Great benefits including competitive salary shouldn't be discounted, but the biggest pro for me is the degree to which Senior Leadership truly cares about individual employee wellbeing. From decisions that impact all employees (like how we approach safety during the pandemic), to case-by-case exceptions made when employees are in special circumstances, there is ZERO disconnect from Senior Leadership to the rest of the staff.",Growth of the company and membership sometimes feels like it is outpacing our ability to 'keep up'.
6,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,Amazing Place to Work,2022-03-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,South Carolina Federal really cares about its employees.

I made the best decision when I decided to join the credit union. The senior leadership truly values their employees and their happiness. The benefits are so amazing, especially the 401k match.  You will never be made to feel like you’re just a number, no matter what role you’re in. Everyone is very professional, and the kindness employees experience on day one lasts for the duration of your employment.",Financial centers hours. I would love for us to close at 5pm vs. 530pm.
8,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,Best Decision Ever,2022-02-10,5.0,Mortgage Loan Processor,"I made the decision 2 years ago to leave my comfort zone at my old employer and take a leap at the credit union. Let me just say that this is the best move I could have made.

Between the more than generous PTO, paid holidays and an amazing 401k match, the way the credit union has handled the entire COVID situation has been more than any employee could ask for. I look forward to many more years here with the credit union.",I have nothing bad to say working here.

12,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,Lip Service? No Way… Not at South Carolina Federal!,2021-10-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I was embraced with open arms when I came to work here. Everyone is genuinely kind, caring, authentic, giving, and personable. They poured into me to ensure I was properly trained, gave me the autonomy yet appropriate guidance to set me up for success in my role, and have been open to listen to and explore new ideas and opportunities. 

The benefits are amazing, the employee culture is fun, authentic, welcoming, and warm, the care and concern for members is top notch, and the leaders from the top down care for and invest in the employees. 

I have also seen firsthand how much attention has been put into keeping our employees/members safe during the pandemic. If making a tough decision was necessary but the right thing to do, leadership made it - ever keeping the safety of our staff and staff at the forefront. 

I love it when people walk the walk and South Carolina Federal does just that!","That we are not all back together yet because of Covid. I thrive off of being around people and collaborating with them on the fly. But, that will come in time."

14,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,Under appreciated employee,2022-02-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Benefits are decent. Co-workers are great.,"For a company that claims it prides itself on caring about it's employees it does very little to show it. If you're a service employee be prepared to do majority of the work with the least amount of pay. As a service representative you will be forced to have a sales goal while simultaneously being told you're not a salesman. There's no logic in having a closed referral goal as a service rep. Marketing does nothing to help you reach these goals there's no marketing or promotion in financial centers. You're forced to try and oversell people on products they do not want you're incentivsed to actually help people financially. Mental health and physical health is supposed to be something the credit union takes very serious. But service employees are forced to constantly be over managed and over worked for very little pay. Employees are forced to be perfect creatures that are never allowed to make mistakes. Service reps are the only employees that supposed to know everything about the credit union. You call different departments for assistance they say they don't know and ask did you read the process flow or direct you to someone else. The process flows that we keep getting directed to are either out dated or don't do a very good job of directing employees on what you do. Employees are shown very little appreciation. You help the credit union make hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions of dollars, and in return you get a congratulations email and brand wear free month. That is a huge slap in the face. The pay rate for service reps. is just disappointing I don't know how this company could have pride with there pay rate. Upward growth in this company is only based on one thing your closed referrals. No matter how great of an employee you are no matter how much banking knowledge or experience you have without those closed referrals it will be very difficult for you to move up which is sad. I know my comment well fall on deaf ears and will not be taken seriously. I will get the standard corporate response. But if this company truly cares for it's employees like it says it does maybe it should stop with the corporate response and take some of these negative comments seriously. Stop directing people to talk to upper management sit down listen to the negative comments and actually make some changes to make the company better."

34,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,Good Benefit doesn’t outweigh Toxic Environment,2022-01-04,2.0,Financial Sales Representative,"10% 401k match After the first year
Discount on Home and Car loan rates.","Sometimes people use ""respect"" to
mean ""treating someone like a person"". 

Sometimes they use ""respect"" to mean ""treating someone like an authority Figure""

And sometimes people who are used to being treated like an authority say ""if you won't respect me I won't
respect you"" and they mean ""if you won't treat me like an authority I won't treat you like a person, like a human.” This epitomizes the treatment received from many in the Sales Managers.

-Dress code enforced on a person to person basis. Have a tattoo they like it’s fine, one they don’t in the same location and you have to cover up. For example: You can be targeted and forced to wear a tie or different clothes  just because you have excess body hair or are larger in weight. 

-Leadership Staff promise support for growth opportunities, but often don’t pan out.

-High Deductible HSA which requires a minimum of $4500 out of pocket before healthcare coverage is completely covered. 20-30% discount on health services until that $4500 out of pocket max is met.

-Employee promotions can, and will be declined based upon whether or not you volunteer in their charity events on weekends. 

-Package selling  Life/Disability, Mechanical Breakdown, GAP is taught at a institutional level and is encouraged on all loan products. This is an illegal practice they force on employees who don’t know better and involves positioning a monthly payment to members without disclosing what portion of that payment is made up of add on’s vs principle and interest. Employees taught to position everything is included in the payment positioned and decrease products of their are objections. Many members don’t understand these products are not free but add to the monthly payment. 

-Human Resources is not there to protect the employees, but the company itself. Reprisal is taken against those who complain about treatment and you are labeled as “difficult” for trying to give specific feedback. 

-Slow to act on NCUA violations committed due to lack of training and puts the blame on the “employee mistakes” to escape penalties meant for them for lack of follow through of updating account creation/Editing tasks.

-This company is always reacting to changes in banking culture instead of making well thought out business policies.

-All members of retail pine to work at the headquarters in back office jobs and no longer in Sales. This is because their treatment is night and day. During COVID Retail employees have been subject to strict policy in regard to calling out and protecting employees in the event of an outbreak. This also causes employees to come to work after exposure as they are asked to determine if they’re too sick to return, which is impossible to conceive without quarantine. Backoffice employees have been working remotely for two years and have made servicing members much more difficult. The companies policies make very clear which employees are more important to keep safe.

-This Financial Institution has a policy of no rehire. If you leave to pursue career opportunities that they continue to decline you for you are never allowed to be re-hired in the future. This shows they are not concerned with helping you succeed in your career or life, but with what you can provide for them while you are employed in the position they hire you for"

As a tenured employee, I can’t see myself ever working anywhere else-and not just because I’d have to “start over” in my career. The inclusive culture, endless development opportunities, outstanding benefits-both traditional and non-traditional, and the family I have built within the departments and people I work with all contribute to my loyalty as both a member and an employee. 

Being afforded the opportunity in my role to help our employees increase their knowledge and develop their skill sets to make a positive impact in our members’ financial lives is equally rewarding. The leaders of the organization invest in, support and encourage that continuous growth and provide the tools and training necessary for us and to deliver world class service to our members and excel in our careers.

The opportunity to lead the mortgage division of South Carolina Federal Credit Union In Charleston SC presented itself after an extremely successful career in Atlanta Ga. I had heard really great things about SCFCU including a supportive culture, unbelievable employee benefits and a “real” emphasis on serving their communities and employees from a financial, environmental and socially responsible aspect. Everything lined up and I accepted the position and moved my family from Atlanta to Charleston and began my position as VP of Mortgage Lending on March 3 2020. I did my due diligence and felt like I had made a great decision. And after 9 months here I can confidently say the experience has “EXCEEDED” my lofty expectations.

At SCFCU you are a person with a name and not a number. Everyone is so encouraging and willing to help you reach the next level of your career aspirations. There are mentor programs in place putting highly skilled experienced managers with those who wish to enhance their careers. There are many programs you can join within the Credit Union to help people in our communities and projects to help protect and maintain our environment.

What I like most about working at the credit union is the focus on people. Everyone is so darn friendly and that suits be just fine. I appreciate that my supervisor cares about me as a person first and truly takes an interest in my personal and professional development for success. I am a contributor and it's important for my voice to be heard. And, I have always felt as though what I said mattered. It wasn't about choosing my idea, it was listening to my views and opinions.

The 401(k) match and the mortgage program are two of the best benefits out there. Of course, I cannot leave out the fitness program or the opportunities to be involved in my community.

Finally, I love our commitment and use of technology. Having computers to work from home and the continuous feedback program through 15Five.

All in all, I made a fantastic choice coming here and do not regret one single minute.","My only con is that as we have grown, it is hard to keep up with all the new names and faces.

It shows in their actions every day, and never more so than during this pandemic when they have done everything possible to take care of the employees. The 10% match on the employees’ 401k plan is a huge benefit and should be taken advantage of at the highest level. The Health Savings Account makes family insurance premiums and out of pocket medical spending much more affordable and less painful on the wallet.

The organization has prioritized career growth and development for employees. They offer in-house career coaching and lots of opportunities for cross-training, job shadowing, and mentoring. 

The benefits are fantastic... 10% match on 401k, zero premium health insurance option, tuition reimbursement, etc. The work/life balance from generous paid time off is amazing. On top of the PTO and paid holidays, we also get time off for our birthday, our work anniversary, for getting an annual physical, for volunteerism, etc. 

They also offer many opportunities to get involved with the community... There are so many ways to volunteer and give back to worthy causes. 

My favorite thing is that I am now treated as a person, not as a number. Senior leaders and other members of management know me by name, and they take the time to engage with me. They care about me and my coworkers, and they treat us with empathy. The organization also treats its members well, too.

Months ago, our CEO promised that there would be no lay offs as a result of the pandemic, which, I'm sure I speak for many, have us all a sense of comfort and relief. Our senior leaders have provided ample personal protective equipment in order to stay as safe as we can while performing in our essential, member-facing roles. For jobs that can be done remotely, our IT Department has worked miracles to make sure the technology is functional and still secure. Additionally, the credit union provided us with a Member Engagement Premium pay for member-facing employees and has supplied us with lunch on Fridays, affectionately called ""Fun Food Fridays,"" which have been great benefits. During the seemingly never ending times of social injustices, our senior leaders, especially Leslie Norris, has made concerted efforts to ensure employees feel valued, respected, protected, welcomed and appreciated for cultural, racial, religious, etc., differences and beliefs (most notably, recently highlighting Juneteenth and LGBTQ+ Pride Month). During times of inclement weather, the leaders believe in ""people helping people"" and the work-life balance, ensuring we have enough time to get to our children before daycares close and to get hunkered down at home or in a safe space before bad weather strikes. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the world-class benefits that certainly enhance quality of life, now and for the future. I'm so fortunate to have been selected to work here and I look forward to many many more years with this great credit union.","The pros certainly outweigh the cons.

In my position the hours are not traditional and recently changed, however management tried to find scheduling to fit everyone’s preference and hose that couldn’t be accommodated were quickly moved into their preference once it became available. 

Management wants to make sure employees are heard and changes are made as quickly as possible to demonstrate that the feedback is being acted upon and not falling on deaf ears. 

The benefits are amazing, including wellness perks, opportunities to earn additional paid time off above what you automatically earn based on tenure, and traditional benefits like 401(k) matching. 

The environment I am in is fast paced and always changing, but it keeps the job interesting and the organization strives to make each day fun and engaging for employees. The coaching and mentoring that is provided on a consistent basis demonstrates that they want to see employees succeed and grow in the organization. Truly this is one of the best places to work in SC!","Depending on your location, scheduling can be non-traditional which can be difficult for some.

Growth opportunities in back office areas are more limited than in member facing areas.

Other than that, I truly can’t think of anything else. Pay is competitive, benefits fantastic, and leadership strives to be as transparent as possible regarding the Why behind operations."
216,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,One of the Best Places to Work in SC,2012-12-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"South Carolina Federal Credit Union has been voted one of the best places to work in South Carolina. An employer of choice organization, South Carolina Federal is a wonderful place to work.

The people here are professional, hard working, compassionate individuals who value a work / life balance. Compensation is above average and is fair across the board. The benefits are outstanding. We pay very little out of pocket for employee insurance coverage. The company offers a 401(k) with a fantastic match. There are lots of non-traditional benefits, too, including a wellness program, an onsite gym, free flu shots, onsite lunch vendors for employees, and additional opportunities throughout the year to earn or win additional time off. 

Employees here are given the tools and management coaching they need to succeed. South Carolina Federal also has a top-notch learning center that provides numerous opportunities for traning and development throughout the year. The company encourages promotion from within and takes every opportunity to do so when appropriate. The culture here is one of teamwork and helpfulness. The company also is very involved in the community and gives back to several local charities. Coming to work at South Carolina Federal is by far the best career move I've ever made!",None that I can think of!
217,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,Best Place to Work,2018-12-03,5.0,Manager,"I absolutely love working at the Credit Union for so many reasons.  I’m coming up on a big anniversary next year and am so blessed to be where I am in my career.  Not only does South Carolina Federal offer amazing traditional benefits like an unheard of 401k match, a generous paid time off plan, work-life balance, tuition reimbursement, adoption assistance, and much more, they also offer discounts to local businesses and really care about your health, wellness, and development.  All that being said, it’s important to me that I connect with my manager and have growth opportunities in my career but also spend as much quality time with my family as possible.  At South Carolina Federal, all of that is possible (and more)!",I have no cons to talk about!
218,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,Neutral - some experiences were very positive while others were not.,2011-04-05,3.0,,"Incredible benefits. Flexible time off - several days given each year, can be used as vacation, sick time, etc. Unheard of 10% match on 401-K. Outstanding in-house training opportunities. Nice, new facilities. Very well known in the area and growing rapidly - a prestigious place to work. 

There are a good many women in management positions there, which is true of many credit unions. Women who hit the ""glass ceiling"" at banks often leave to work for credit unions. 

Pay is pretty good, but not as good as banks, but banks can usually afford to pay more because they are for-profit while credit unions are nonprofit. 

Generally, the people who work there are very friendly and there is a positive team spirit and a firm commitment to providing the best level of member (customer) service.","Some managers are excellent while others are not. With the poor managers, people are often hired or promoted based on personal reasons (i.e. social connections outside of work, etc.) rather than their job skills or interpersonal skills, and there is considerable favoritism which takes a huge toll on employee morale.  

Also, the credit union is often named ""employer of choice"" for providing good ""work/life balance"" through reduced full-time shifts, leaves of absence, etc. -- but, in reality few employees get to take advantage of these programs, because they are solely at the discretion of the manager, and most managers simply refuse."
219,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,Wonderful Place to Work,2017-03-07,5.0,Relationship Specialist,"I have worked at SCFCU for almost three months now.  My first three months have been more than wonderful.  Just a quick list of my top pros:
1. Everyone is striving to succeed together.  There truly is a feeling of teamwork and cooperation that makes work feel more like a family venture.

2. Benefits are very good.  Plenty of paid time off each year and medical and 401(k) are great.  Medical can be a bit pricy if you are seeking to cover an entire family, though, but nothing more than many similar companies.

3.  Most of the staff have started at the bottom and worked up, which means that most everyone is on the same page.

4.  Very good work life balance.

5. Very friendly management","No obvious cons that I have noticed.  If you do your work and remember that you are working to serve the members, you will be successful here."
220,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,A positive attitude makes all the difference,2013-04-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This company has been very flexible with me as I have been in school.  As my school schedule changes, they adjust my schedule as needed and they do not make me feel like I am contributing any less than the next guy.  They have bent over backwards to accommodate me.  Co-workers that have been in financial crisis because of a house fire or a medical illness have been compassionately taken care of financially by management and co-workers.  I have worked at four financial institutions, and this is by far the best I have worked for.","There can be some drama between co-workers, but you will get that anywhere you work.  You just need to learn quickly who creates the drama and avoid that person and do not get involved."
221,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,Great place to work!,2018-03-30,5.0,Executive Administrator,"Great 401k plan that matches $1 for $1 up to 10%! Allows employees to contribute towards non-profit organizations and in turn receive jeans weeks! We receive PTO on our anniversary date each year and PTO in lieu of having certain days off, like the day after Thanksgiving. We also receive PTO to go shopping during the holidays! When we want to participate in charity events, the credit union pays our entry fee! The credit union allows employees to contribute to a Foundation (with charities of each employee’s choice), one of which is an Employee Relief Fund that helps fellow employees who encounter devastating or life-changing situations. I could go on and on but would spend all day raving about our credit union!",Managing the many priority tasks to be done any given day.

South Carolina Federal Credit Union always looks for ways to give back to our community. Whether it's through partnering with local non-profits or participating in scholarships, the Credit Union management and employees eagerly jump in to volunteer their time and talents. 
2. Many companies say that they have an ""open-door policy,"" but in reality, they don't. South Carolina Federal is completely different from anything I have ever experienced because the Senior Management team is approachable, encouraging, and involved in helping their team members and the company develop and thrive!
3. Their competitive wages and benefits are great!

224,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,Truly A Great Place to Work,2018-10-01,5.0,Information Technology,"Been here a little over a year now and it has been great.  When I was interviewing I wondered what it would be like to work at a place that year after year wins ""Best Place to Work"" awards.  I figured how much better could it be then some of my favorite past jobs that never won.   After my time here, it is clear to me why SCFCU wins, it truly is a great place to work.  Management is very supportive and invest in their employees.  The benefits are by far the best I have ever had with a generous 401K match, generous PTO, and they even put money into your HSA account just for signing up for the insurance.",None that come to mind.
225,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,"Great Benefits, NOT the best place to work for life",2016-03-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Awesome benefits package.  Short term disability paid by the company at 100% base salary.  Paid time off (PTO) can be rolled over from year to year.  100% 401k matching up to 10%-dollar for dollar.,Even though they state they will promote from within the company-they only promote the employees who suck up to the managers.  If you suggest something new and they don't like your opinion-you are black listed.   They state they value honesty but they just want employees who do what they say and how they tell you to do it.  They require college degrees for positions that don't need degrees.

Our Career Development Leaders are amazing at drilling down to what your interest are and fitting you into a roll that will help you thrive. The training here is way beyond what some of my friends and family have available at their own jobs. My favorite perk right now is the Educational reimbursement provided for those interested in continued education. Life got in the way of me finishing my degree but with this program and the support and guidance I have here I am on my way to getting my bachelors!!,I don’t have any concerns at this time.

No work/life balance. Hours seem great, but easily can end up working more hours without overtime pay allowed. Advancement from within is based on who you know and how quick/high you jump when told to.  Bury all opinions deep, deep inside, never to share them, if you want to remain employed there."

279,South Carolina Federal Credit Union,"Fun, Positive and a great career",2016-09-29,4.0,Relationship Specialist,"-It's a Monday - Friday job which gives you stability when it comes to making a schedule
- The people that work there truly are nice and friendly. Most people are willing to help if you have questions. I could open with my direct manager about anything and she would do everything in her power to help if there was a problem
- Once you get good at the job, you find new ways to help members in need. It's an amazing feeling when you can change somebody's life.
- The benefits are good for You as an employee. (More on that in the cons section). 
- Holidays off! Paid...
- There are many opportunities to earn extra paid time off like donating to a charity for $20 in exchange for an entire paid day off. 
- If you work in the Rivers Ave location, there is a free gym to use, as well as every Friday, they have very good sushi for purchase.
- The trainers are an awesome team. They made learning the material fun 
- Once you get going, you have the potential of making a lot of money from selling the services. It takes a few months to really build up a huge commission regularly, but I knew some people who made well over $1000 a month in commission. You have to hustle!
- Everybody in the company is very approachable. The CEO met us in training and he really is down to Earth. 


It is very career based! I met more people that have worked for the company for over 10 years than those that were new.  They say the average worker has been there 10 years... some have been there for 20-30 years! 

If you enjoy selling, helping people, and regular hours, SCFCU is awesome.","The training program is very good but there is still room for improvement. The instructors were great! In our situation, there were a few things we ""looked at"" in training and was basically told it's rare we would ever encounter that... And I think all of those situations hit me in a 2 week period.

The company says never be afraid to ask people for help, and I learned to have certain people on speed dial when I was in a pickle. But on more than one occasion, when my lifelines were unavailable, it was surprising how many people didn't know much about how to navigate those situations and would brush me off.

Also during our ""On-the-job"" training, we had a very slow week, so a lot of the practice we were supposed to get with the trainer didn't happen.    (The trainers are always willing to help, but they always have new classes they are training, so once their allotted time with you is up, you're on your own out there).

The benefits are great for you, but super expensive if you want to add your family to it. 

If you're hired as a ""Hire ahead"", be prepared to drive EVERYWHERE. In someways, this gave me a better idea of how each financial center worked. Each had different managers and each operated a little differently.  But when it came to selling, hopping from location to another on a daily basis could really get in the way of finishing a deal. I.E. You start a 2 or 3 car loans at location A. Next day you're at Location B and you're busy all day with the members and can't get to your loans in a timely manner, it creates a bad experience for both you and the members. (Some people can manage these moments better than others. Some excell fine with driving around).

Another con to having to jump around is Traffic... They try to keep you as close to where you live as possible, but I found myself driving to the opposite side of the Greater Charleston area a lot... Even with 3 locations within 15 minutes of me. So my 15 minute commute turned into an hour+ each way some days (since you're working the rush hour shifts).

While it is career based, because so many people have been there for so long, you will have to wait a while before you can move up... Some people stay in their job for YEARS... and sometimes there's only 1 or 2 of those jobs available. Some employees who have been there for 5 or 6 years get kinda ""dark"" when they don't get the positions they seek... I've over heard many conversations of seasoned employees not bothering to suck up for a job because they keep getting promised positions and passed over... That didn't happen in my experience... but some people felt that way.

Business accounts are a crap to do... if you make a mistake while setting them up... (They aren't as cut and dry as some other accounts you set up). Expect to hear about it.

Some members can be jerks. But that's with any customer service/sales role."
