0,Sprout Social,Great Company!,2022-03-14,5.0,Business Development Representative,Amazing culture and great leadership team,I really don't have a con
1,Sprout Social,Supportive and Challenging,2022-03-09,5.0,Senior Manager,"There is an incredibly low tolerance for 'bad apples' - big egos and bad attitudes are not rewarded at Sprout and rarely stay long. The foundation of our culture is that we treat one another with kindness, consideration, and positive intent even when we disagree on business decisions. The average leader at Sprout is sincerely invested in the well-being of the people they support and cares deeply about doing right by the business.

Opportunity is everywhere; our business is growing quickly and so there are always new business needs. We are constantly developing new roles to meet those needs, which creates fantastic career growth opportunities.

Sprout as an organization is incredibly generous. We do right when it comes to our people; examples include surprise spot bonuses for individuals who go above and beyond, generous sales incentives, commission downside protection during ramping and leave, and realistic and achieveable quotas.","Sprout is a very concensus-oriented organization; which can be both inefficient and frustrating, at time. 

As a high growth organization, we are constantly struggling to be adequately staffed."
2,Sprout Social,Almost too good to be true...but it isn't!,2022-01-28,5.0,Principal Customer Success Manager,"I've never worked anywhere more invested in my personal success than Sprout. Leadership is transparently communicative, available, and approachable which is so atypical for lots of high growth tech companies. Customers are HAPPY- like really happy, and churn is low because of that. They product is fantastic, ever-evolving and only getting better because the product team LISTENS to customers. Benefits are comprehensive and management encourages work-life balance and taking time for oneself. People who work hard and do well are recognized for doing so. Oh and finally- the focus on DE&I is real, not a pitch point in interviews.","Much of the compensation is slightly below market (although for a good culture and work-life balance, i'll take it)
Things move super fast, and you need to be a motivated and eager learner to do well here- which isn't for everyone
Benefits are strong, but could be more holistic:
would like to see longer parental leave offered (currently 4 months- which is great but not when other big companies are providing 6), health insurance that covers alternative modalities of healing (like acupuncture)"
3,Sprout Social,"Incredible people, culture & product!",2022-03-09,5.0,Business Operations,Sprout truly is a community. A community of some of the brightest minds I've seen. A community of caring co-workers who truly care about your wellbeing. A community of teams collaborating on building innovations with our product. I truly am privileged to work along such an incredible team.,"Getting into the weeds here, but would be awesome to have all benefits consolidated under one financial institution for 401K, FSA, HSA, RSUs, & ESPP. Would streamline the process come tax season. That really is the only con I can think of."
4,Sprout Social,"Great culture, stress-free",2022-03-19,4.0,Software Engineer,"This has to be the least toxic company I have worked for in the decades I've been a software engineer. No company politics, ""disagreeable"" people are weeded out fairly easily, etc. Everybody wants to work together to solve hard problems. Middle management has a fairly light touch, they have taken the servant leadership style path and teams are fairly autonomous on how they want to organize work, meetings, etc. 

I've worked at a lot of companies when sitting in meetings, I was fairly convinced I was the smartest person in the room. Not so at Sprout, there are a lot of smart, capable people. It is a breath of fresh air from companies that basically hire warm bodies to fill a rec with the hope that they'll be net positive contributors.","The biggest thing is no cost of living raises, no merit raises. The only way to get a raise is moving in the career bands. This is fairly easy when you are more junior, not so much when you are later in your career. So you could go years without a raise even with glowing reviews and constant praise about how good of a job you are doing. There was a ""market adjustment"" last year that occurred but that seemed more reactionary rather than proactive due to the Great Resignation and the inability to recruit candidates. 

Along these lines, there is a little bit of a disconnect between Sprout's ""Best Employer"" marketing and image and the fact that this is still a public company that is going to figure out a way to get the most out of their employees by spending a little as they have to. Or, as HR likes to put it ""the needs of the business"". It's okay to give 4 months of paid maternity and paternity leave but taking more than 2 weeks off for bereavement, military service, etc. you won't be paid AND you'll lose your health insurance because that was decided that that was best for the business. The new ESPP they rolled out is a another example: under the guise of ""fostering employee ownership"", they're restricting you from selling the shares for two years. The real reason is they're protecting leadership and the major shareholders from dilution. 

Over the last couple of years, there has been a distinct lack of candor in internal communications. They took away the 4 year anniversary Hawaii trip under the guise of ""evolving our company traditions"". In reality, they just didn't want to pay for it anymore. All-hands meetings used to be more townhall style where questions could be asked. Now, questions have to be submitted in advance and probably won't be answered anyway if they don't fit the narrative they're trying to communicate. Everything is scripted to the point of being inauthentic. The only authentic moment that happened in the last annual meeting is somebody actually asked of our president ""What would you have done differently?"" and he actually admitted to mistakes. Sprout's leadership doesn't seem to do that anymore and it's disappointing.

We used to get weekly or monthly emails from leadership about their thoughts on what is going on with the company. We don't get that anymore."
5,Sprout Social,Fantastic Place to Work,2022-02-15,5.0,Software Engineer II,"Too many to list. Since I've left Sprout I always look back at is as the premier workplace, and my job searches since then have always used Sprout as the measuring stick. Pros include:

- Great physical (and emotional) work environment
- Free snacks, eats, drinks
- Unlimited PTO (which is actually honored and not just used to guilt folks)
- Lots of great interactions with the community, whether through service days or other events
- Lots of industry-leading work in the social realm
- DEI is at the core of Sprout, everyone is included
- Lots of opportunities for growth
- Very transparent

If Sprout offered a position in my current area of expertise I would seriously consider applying to join the team again, it's a great place to grow.",No real cons to speak of
6,Sprout Social,Amazing Company with Dynamic Culture,2021-08-25,5.0,Senior Customer Success Manager,"Ever since I joined the company, I have felt nothing but support. They truly do give you the tools to be your best self and continue to grow both personally and professionally.

The culture is unbelievably dynamic with the ability to work remote if you choose, have unlimited PTO, and being conscious of our well being during these times.

The role itself allows you to speak to an ever growing industry and help customers become more efficient and effective with their jobs. While there are some issues that pop up here and there, I have never endured an experience where a customer was so mad they yelled at me (unlike my last role)","The biggest issue I have with Customer Success here is we are held to a monthly NDR quota that is over 100%. Having a quota isn't a big deal but the fact that we don't actually negotiate any of that growth is frustrating. We need to rely on our growth partners and if there is a month where they have other deals taking their time, we are left by the wayside

The benefits are pretty good but could be better. I know a lot of other companies in the area that offer full coverage of health benefits. Also would be nice if they provide some sort of stipend for remote employees since they don't get the amazing office benefits"
7,Sprout Social,Solid place to work with the best DEI in the industry,2022-01-07,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Great people who care about their work and each other
- Benefits are solid, parental leave is especially good
- Stock is doing well
- DEI is the best in the industry
- Work-life balance is above average","- Your mileage will vary by team, your experience at Sprout is dependent on your manager. Some are world-class, others are not.
- Lack of transparency into your career growth / path. A closed-door meeting with unknown people who don't know you or your work, decide your fate for promotion and raises with very little of your own input.
- Unlimited PTO is not really unlimited, even though you are encouraged to use it. If you take “too much” you will get in trouble, you have to guess what number that is. 
- Lots of talk about DEI but the select middle-management that work against these values are kept on.
- Opportunities to move up within Sprout are almost non-existent. 9-times-out-of-10 Sprout will do everything it can to hire management positions externally rather than promoting within. Sprout continues to lose a lot of good people as a result.
- Compensation is below industry
- The great office perks that once made Sprout so desirable have not been replaced with equivalent WFH perks or increased salaries. Remote friendly is not a replacement.
- Lots of focus on making more and more money since IPO’d from upper-management, which comes across very cringe."
8,Sprout Social,Sprout Truly Is an Amazing Place to Work and Grow Your Career,2022-01-12,5.0,Account Executive,"Sprout has built something very special. Not only is the product absolutely amazing, but the people are truly inspiring. All Sprout employees align very closely with the company values...not only professionally, but also personally. Sprout's values are to care deeply, embrace accountability, celebrate change, champion diversity, equity and inclusion, seek simplicity, solve hard problems, and promote open, authentic communication.

Beyond the people and the values, Sprout's product is industry-leading and customers enjoy their experience working and partnering with Sprout. The benefits are fantastic and leadership truly cares about the success of everyone on the team. I can't recommend Sprout highly enough!","Since Sprout is growing so quickly/rapidly, it is an extremely fast-paced environment with a few growing pains every now and then. Exciting for most people, but can get a bit overwhelming if you're not prepared."

- Competitive Salaries & Equity 
- Work/Life Balance

• Sprout works hard to maintain a culture during the pandemic as well for all its workers (1 mental health day off per month, virtual randomized chats -super fun!, Sprout-indoor experiences, random swag mailings, etc.)","• We move real quick. Ambitious, flexible, motivated, and passionate idea professionals are welcomed, but be aware that you might always feel slightly behind."
12,Sprout Social,Culture & Customer Focus is a huge competitive differentiator,2021-09-27,5.0,Sales Manager,"Joining Sprout Social has been a blessing in so many ways. The values & standards of our organization aren't just words on a page that you hear in your first week - you see them practiced daily. In terms of values specifically, the focus on customers & it's own employees is evident. We consistently hear from clients that our dedication to customer success is a reason they'll continue to invest in Sprout. 

That level of commitment goes beyond customers, as the care that each employee brings to work for their colleagues everyday is unlike anything I've seen in the workplace - constantly focused on treating people with respect, providing feedback, and caring personally about each other. This is also clear throughout our leadership team and there are countless examples of senior leaders consistently showing appreciation, gratitude, & constantly listening.

From a sales perspective, Sprout is a wonderful place to work. It's rare to find an organization that has cracked the code on all 3 ""P's"" - people, product, and process and Sprout has absolutely accomplished that. There is a tremendous amount of growth opportunity, & our teams have the opportunity to meet & exceed their goals on a quarterly basis.",None to share - growth mindset is necessary to constantly improve & evolve!

18,Sprout Social,Once in a lifetime company,2021-10-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Sprout Social deserves all positive reviews and I couldn't agree more with each an every one of them. If you are lucky enough to get the chance to work here, jump on it! The leadership of this company truly cares about its employees and it's easy to feel that everyday, from dedicated R&R days and structured review cycles, to top-notch benefits (including remote status) and manager trainings. A lot of company's talk a big game when it comes to culture and flexibility, but Sprout Social lives it. The CEO, and other executives, even take the time to welcome each class of new employees.

19,Sprout Social,Unbelievably Amazing Company To Work For,2021-10-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I continue to pinch myself often that I get to work at such an amazing place like Sprout Social. First and foremost, how leadership prioritizes its employees is a quality about Sprout that has gone unchanged since I started here. It's a people-first organization and the culture is unparalleled. Take care of yourself and your family, so you can be your best self at work. Aside from that, we have great benefits, amazing leaders, a product that can't be beat, difficult but achievable metrics, smart people who love to solve hard problems, and coworkers that care deeply about each other both in and out of work. 

Despite going remote during the pandemic, Sprout has found ways to adapt and support its people. This is a company that works through change in a respectful and thoughtful way.

I've been working at Sprout for four years and have had the opportunity of a lifetime to grow my career and work alongside some of the smartest people in tech. The people at Sprout have cracked the code when it comes to company culture. From day one, you see first-hand how everyone on the team lives out our values. They're embedded in practically everything we do, from 1:1 conversations with your manager, to business meetings, or even proposing a new project idea, everything at Sprout starts and ends with people. No company is perfect, but Sprout doesn't pretend to be. In fact, they embrace their imperfection and strive to do better. Most importantly, they're vocal about that where it matters most. Sprout's leadership team leans into hard conversations, especially around mental health, and went as far as to make a pilot ""summer hours"" program permanent based on the feedback from our team in how helpful those days off were. 

Your ideas are truly valued here and they carry weight, even if you're not on the leadership level. The most rewarding part of a job is being able to see your impact, and I'm lucky to say that's something I get to see every single day.","This is a high-functioning and innovative team that moves incredibly fast.

Justyn and the exec team demonstrate integrity, humility and an unwavering people-first mentality. These qualities have come through in the evolution of our benefits in the past five years, focus on DEI, investment in training and development programs and approach to thoughtful internal dialogue when facing challenging issues. 

The company's response to COVID-19 is a great example of this: frequent, clear updates from department and company leaders, a generous WFH tech stipend and rapidly adapting internal gatherings, events and processes to support the team. Sprout has also invested a lot in training managers and creating more pathways to promotion for both senior individual contributors and people managers over the past two years in particular.

Culture comes from the top but I also want to highlight how incredible the teams that create the Sprout ""experience"" for everyone are: Office Ops (whether we're remote or actually in the offices), People Team, IT Team, Communication, Events and more.

-Strong leadership team. All four founders are still at Sprout.","-As it has grown, more and more red tape has appeared.
-Cross-department collaboration still feels a bit strained.
-Work/life balance is pretty good until you start getting higher up, then it feels a little tougher to manage."
53,Sprout Social,N/A,2021-10-27,4.0,Account Executive,great company culture and they really care,pay less than market is offering
54,Sprout Social,Truly the Best Place to Work,2020-09-15,5.0,Manager,"Sprout is so incredibly thoughtful about every decision they make and the impact on their employees. This has especially shown through during their responses to global COVID-19 pandemic. I have felt incredibly supported and cared for during this time, and Sprout has done everything within their power to equip our team with what they need to successfully work remotely. There has also been a strong effort to make our culture just as special in a remote world. Sprout continues to surprise and delight our employees with the thought and care put into re-shaping traditions that were formerly focused on in-person interaction, like All-Hands meetings, social hours, and team member value awards.

Sprout's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is unparalleled among tech companies. While many companies have just started focusing on DEI as a response to the recent incidents of police brutality and Black Lives Matter movement, Sprout has long been committed to putting in the work to make progress against racism, inequality and injustice, and it shows through our culture, policies, and commitments to our communities. Sprout is truly a model in this area for other companies of how to champion DEI.",Can't really think of any. This is really a special company.
55,Sprout Social,Good. Not great. There's definitely a small undercurrent of toxicity.,2021-03-29,3.0,Site Reliability Engineer,"The business resource groups (BRGs) are amazing. They're run by some incredibly compassionate people and have an impact. Not as large of one as they should, but they do make the largest mark they can given the constraints they run under.

If you're lucky enough to find a manager that's dedicated, there are a lot of opportunities for growth. 

The engineering team is filled with a lot of very talented people, and a lot of them are incredibly happy to sit down and help you learn things. 

There are some really, really, REALLY amazing people here.

For SRE in particular: We've done a lot of work to drive page volume down to a trickle, often less than 1 a week. The rotation is wide, and is currently about once every six weeks.","THE BASICS:

Compensation is below market. No bonus schedule.

ESPP is non-existent, even a year post-IPO.

When onsite: Open office layouts are incredibly difficult to work in, distractions are high, desks are small.

THE MORE DIFFICULT STUFF:

Many people in Engineering management try tirelessly to quantify every single problem. That works great for technical issues in a lot of cases! For people issues, it's a non-starter, and puts the onus on victims of discrimination or harassment to collect a ton of receipts, even when the incident occurs out in the open, in Zoom calls, Slack conversations, or even in code reviews.

This is very much a company that kinda got dragged into remote work and hasn't really taken a step back to look at the impact it has on everyone. There's still a lot of expectation to respond quickly to questions, a lot of demand to spend time on zoom meetings, and a great amount of expectation around synchronously working. We get messages often telling us to not respond to messages immediately, to realize that we're all people, but no one from management on down seems to actually demonstrate it.

There are just a few people in Engineering who run against the organization's focus on diversity, and Engineering's focus on avoiding burnout and 10x engineers. They are unfortunately very visible, try tirelessly to make themselves indispensable, and are also impossible to avoid working with if you want to continue to grow in your role.

Manager retention is abysmal. In my six year tenure I had five different managers, which makes it really difficult to work on advancement when each one of them had different goals in mind."
56,Sprout Social,Great place to work,2021-07-06,5.0,Account Executive,"Sprout is a great product that customers love, management listens & follows through on changes, fair compensation, fun work environment, promotion path clear & attainable",Quota can be high but it fluctuates and never stays that way for long

In a crazy year like 2020, Sprout has shown that they listen and make decisions with employees at the center!",There are no negatives that come to mind.

62,Sprout Social,Easily one of the best places I've ever worked,2021-02-16,5.0,Director of Engineering,"Sprout's culture is one of its greatest assets - the focus on essentialism and only building what is strictly necessary for success is one of the reasons that it stays so agile at such a decent scale. Engineering practices are disciplined and as objective as possible, technical debt is obviously present but kept thoughtfully to a minimum, on-call demand is very light comparatively, and contributions are recognized quickly and meaningfully.","Compensation could be better, benefits are quite average, no ongoing stock-based compensation as part of annual review cycle."
63,Sprout Social,Amazing job and people,2020-07-16,5.0,Account Executive,"There are really too many pros to list here. I came to Sprout looking for fulfilling work, opportunities for career advancement, constant learning, a high-performing team, collaboration, fun, and of course, a good income. At most companies, I think you'd be really fortunate to get a few of those boxes checked. I'm happy to say that after a year at Sprout, and amidst a global pandemic, I've never been more confident that I made the right choice coming here. This position, my team, and the broader company afforded me every one of those opportunities. 

Sprout is unlike any organization I've worked for; I truly believe it is one of the best, if not the best, place to work.

I remember reading reviews on Glassdoor prior to interviewing at Sprout and thinking to myself ""this is too good to be true."" It's not. The hype is real, and I enjoy almost every work day. I genuinely look forward to my job... I didn't know that was possible.","Everyone knows that a lack of diversity is endemic in SaaS, and Sprout isn't an exception in that regard, unfortunately. However, Sprout is one of the few companies championing diversity (it's a prominent position/initiative here) and I'm confident we'll keep making strides toward a more diverse workforce."
64,Sprout Social,I have never been more excited about working for Sprout Social,2020-01-25,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- I love our customer support team even more than our customers do
- Parental leave benefits have been improved to 16 weeks regardless of primary or secondary caregiver designation
- Incredibly talented and passionate coworkers
- Very bright future
- Great work life balance
- Well-supported Diversity Equity and Inclusion initiatives
- Improving workplace empathy, generosity, feedback, growth and camaraderie
- Lots of opportunity for career growth or specialization for those who thrive with more singular focus
- Core values are admirable and ambitious
- Savvy PMs who have strong product knowledge, help triage issues, and can even provide insight and guidance for feature work","- Projects across teams are sometimes painful, but this an understood area for improvement within the company.
- The wide variety of ways that our customers use our application can cause some projects to have a long tail of feature refinement and revision which can feel less rewarding than net new work.
- Balancing the demands of technical debt and feature work has been difficult.
- Some teams feel understaffed in relation to the outsized usage and visibility of the features that they develop and maintain. This is especially true when it comes to the support rotation.
- Relationships between teams could be better. Years of specialized product focus has caused us to grow further apart than the crazy days when there was 1 team for everything."
65,Sprout Social,Values-based culture transcends the office,2021-02-03,5.0,Product Manager,"Sprout has a culture that's been intentionally built upon shared values. These are plastered all over the office space and ingrained in everything the company does. With the pandemic and the transition to full-remote work across the company, we've found that the values-based culture holds up, even when the ""perks"" of the office aren't accessible for now. The company is serious about diversity, equity, and inclusion, and that's apparent in just about every meeting, process, policy, and interaction. This is a company that cares about PEOPLE because they're valuable, not simply because they're productive. That shows itself in a compassionate and considerate community, supportive business resource groups, and flexible time off and other policies that support good work-life balance. Beyond that, everyone goes above and beyond to make sure that each person's experience is excellent and that their needs are met, whether that's accommodating schedules for family commitments, making benefits accommodations for non-traditional families, or just celebrating important moments in our work and personal lives, I've felt like a part of a family at Sprout since the day I joined.","As the company continues to grow, there are constant challenges to overcome with org structure, staffing, and scaling teams in effective ways. Generally, these challenges are addressed thoughtfully in ways that support healthy teams and healthy future growth, but the growing pains can be awkward. Additionally, Sprout has such a supportive and engaging office environment that it's been somewhat disappointing to lose that with the pandemic. There have been so many creative ways to replicate that in our current fully-remote setting, but we're missing some of the sense of community that comes from physical proximity. There's much to look forward to in the return to the office post-covid."
66,Sprout Social,Best company I've worked for.,2021-03-01,5.0,Senior Enablement Specialist,Sprout Social is the best career move I've made. The people make the company and they continue to add amazing team members that continue to grow and add to the unique culture that many growing companies would not be able to continue.

I truly feel like Sprout, my manger, and my team is committed to my growth and I have learned so much both professionally and personally because of that. 

Sprout's set of values is apparent in every part of the team and the culture, and being surrounded by people who love what they do is really inspiring. Especially during COVID, Sprout has done an incredible job adapting our culture into our WFH lives with things that bring us together as a team and company, such as online Happy Hours, crafting/cooking events, etc. Leadership has also been transparent with WFH updates and have been flexible and understanding when it comes to transitioning into a remote work life.

What stuck out to me even in the interview process and has continued to be a bright spot is the culture of feedback, creativity and inclusion.","Sprout is on the move. Which means lots is changing, which is not for everyone. If you're able to ""celebrate change"" and ""solve hard problems"" (Sprout values) you'll fit in great, but the constant growing pains/changes can bring some levels of ambiguity, necessity for flexibility and the need for patience while we build the plane while flying."

The culture is truly special. It's not just a bunch of words or values written on walls. It's allowing each of us to be our true selves and bring our best selves into work everyday. That is what makes the culture special. And again we practice what we preach. The values we have are the behaviors we exhibit every day. 
I love the people I work with and the challenges we get to solve. The challenges are hard, no doubt there, and not every conversation is easy. But we do it collectively, respectfully of each other, and with our customer's needs in mind. That makes it a very special place to work. 
I truly look forward to Monday's and going into the office!","Sprout is fast paced and we are growing quickly. With that comes a lot of change and change management.

Sprout is deeply committed to empowering employees with the tools and resources to really excel at their career, and I have learned more in the last 5 years than I have my entire career. They truly live their values, starting from executive leadership down to the contributor level, I am motivated to do my best work because of how much the company has invested in me and my growth.","If there isn't a clear expectation set with your role or manager, it can be difficult to be successful in your position. This isn't specific to Sprout, but some of the best employees who no longer are with the company left primarily because they didn't have an invested manager that provided room to grow."

I've had a few jobs before Sprout and I can confidently say all three of these are top-notch at Sprout.",There's always growing pains but Sprout continues to work through them and be as transparent as possible.

100,Sprout Social,Sprout supports bringing your whole self to work,2020-02-12,5.0,Senior Manager,"The most impressive and admirable part of Sprout's culture is its emphasis on creating an open and inviting workspace for all individuals. Lots of companies preach the important of DEI, but few invest in it as actively as Sprout does. It is clear that Sprout believes that individuals will perform their best work if they are able to truly be themselves in a work environment without fear of judgment or repercussions. 

The company invests in its people through various types of trainings, access to external resources, a focus on business resource groups and emphasizing the importance of taking care of your mental/physical health first and foremost. 

I fully believe that Sprout's success as a business is in large part due to how deeply it cares about its employees.","There are growing pains, which is to be expected for a company at this stage. Cross-department communication remains a challenge, and it is becoming more challenging each day to have insight into how large decisions are made. It isn't that the company is trying to be less transparent; rather, it is that as teams get larger, they become more siloed. This creates issues with more complex projects."
101,Sprout Social,Good Company (For the Right Person and Role/Position),2020-12-10,3.0,Sales,"A collaborative culture, strong communication from the executives. Nice office perks (when offices are open), i.e. free lunches, free gym, snacks, beer and drinks, etc...good product/technology.

**Other general observations below (neither good nor bad), just observations:

Sprout is a very progressive company and is largely what I would describe as a very democratic culture. With being headquartered in downtown Chicago this is an almost 'obvious' observation, however, if you are a. more conservative-minded person, you might have a few challenges connecting with co-workers at Sprout. 

Also, Sprout has a very strong DEI program, so if DEI initiatives and focus are important to you, you will feel right at home!","Sprout Social is a very prideful organization. In my opinion, as a company, it is starting to lose some of its humble 'roots' little by little. 

Sprout is also often regarded as a 'best places to work', which for the most part is true for almost every position at the company except for those people in sales (in my opinion). Now that Sprout is a publicly-traded company, the urgency around sales performance and closing sales deals is stronger than ever. This creates a high 'burn-out' rate for people in a quota-carrying role since sales targets and quotas are measured monthly. Working in sales at Sprout quickly turned into a major 'grind'. While sales are never easy, the urgency has only intensified. 

The sales org is becoming much more 'cut-throat'. Many of the sales leaders came from Salesforce (which is has a reputation for grinding their sales reps through the sales floor so-to-speak) so if you thrive in a very demanding and cut-throat, fast-paced sales environment or culture you will feel right at home at Sprout, if you are not used to this, you can and might burn out quickly. 

Additionally, if you are a parent and are considering a sales role at Sprout, proceed with caution. Sprout has recently named a 'best place to work for parents'. Again this is largely true for people outside of sales. If you work in sales this is not the case what-so-ever. Sprout has a tendency to higher younger(ish) and single people, as they tend to have fewer distractions at home. This is a personal belief, nothing more, but I spend enough time here to see the correlation of this."
102,Sprout Social,"Amazing Company, Amazing People",2020-06-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I wanted to write this review, particularly around Sprout's reaction to recent events. This company has always been a cut above, but within the last few months, this team has proved how unique and heart-forward they are.

First, the pandemic. Each company has handled the remote work and team support in a different way, but I believe no one does it better than Sprout. We receive updates from our CEO and CPO often; communication is massively important when we are all isolated. The in-office environment is a huge part of Sprout's culture. In some way or another, they've been able to translate the personality and culture of the company into our homes. Even apart, Sprout still feels like Sprout. We were provided a very generous stipend to become comfortable in our homes to work. A company-wide survey went out so the leadership could hear directly from the people while they make decisions about a possible return to the office. I feel very cared for and in a time of certainty, it means everything to me and my family. 

Second, I want to address Sprout's reaction to the recent murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement. Following the initial set of national protests, Sprout provided us with a Day of Action to reflect, learn, donate, and volunteer. They provided numerous resources for us to learn, grow, and lean in to topics that may initially feel uncomfortable. There is a massive donation in place to a few organizations and each of us were able to select the cause closest to our hearts. In the middle of writing this review, we just learned that starting in 2021, Juneteenth will be a company holiday! Sprout is active in creating initiatives that combat systemic racism and champion the value of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. DEI is embedded in this company so deeply, specifically how we communicate and how decisions are made.

I am incredibly proud to work for an organization that listens, that has a moral compass, and that puts its people first. Sprout changed my life for the better when I started, and continues to change my life for the better.",No cons as of right now.

Not even for the ""look"" of being progressive, but genuinely supporting all groups throughout various efforts and work within the company.","Although we are a public company, there are still start up processes / ideas so there isn't one specific way to do things here and one of our values is adapting for that reason.

111,Sprout Social,A company that truly cares,2020-04-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"""Care Deeply"" is one of Sprout's values and the phrase truly encapsulates the company, culture and team. We've gone through a ton of change over the years - by nature of being a fast-growing company rooted in social media - but the things that make the company great have never wavered. 

The company's commitment to its employees is clear. There are the tangible things:  a generous parental leave, free lunches/snacks, fun events, high quality tech etc. But what makes Sprout special are the things that can't be captured in a bulleted list or stock photos. People are treated with respect, feedback is acted upon and the impact on employees is considered in every decision Sprout makes. While Sprout isn't perfect, working here feels like a collaborative, fun and human experience. 

I'm proud and energized to work at Sprout.",The team is very thoughtful and that can sometimes lead to over-thinking or over-complicating process or initiatives.

114,Sprout Social,Fantastic Place to Work,2020-07-16,5.0,Growth Manager,I have been lucky enough to work at some great companies over my career and I put Sprout at the top of the list for sure. It starts from the top down. Justyn Howard is thinking two and three steps ahead of the industry. As he leads by example he does it in a very humble way. The companies focus on work-life balance and DEI is second to none.,I have been here for three years now and I can not really think of any Cons.

I've only been working here for a few months but already feel like Sprout is part of my DNA. Everyone is kind, driven, supportive and empathetic. Sprout really embraces diversity and I've learned a lot from our monthly Diversity, Equity & Inclusion guild meetings! Leadership is really connected to the rest of the company, offers a lot of transparency into the business and leads with empathy. During the COVID-19 crisis, when other companies have been forced to pull back on resources, Sprout offered even more support, including a stipend for home office supplies. That never would have happened at my last company. Blessed to be a part of Team Sprout!","Not really a con, but standards and expectations are high.

122,Sprout Social,Couldn't be luckier,2020-04-21,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"From day one of the interview process to now (8 months later) I could not feel more grateful to work at this company. Sprout is the golden standard. Management sticks to open and authentic communication and your opinion is valued from day one. Being in a junior role on the sales side, I have never felt devalued and have always felt heard and appreciated. You are equipped with a new mac laptop and all the tools necessary to complete your job. Hitting your quota is challenging but fair and doable if you put in the work. You have access to outreach, zoom, salesforce, Vidyard and more to help you get there.

The culture is everything. Every person at this company has a great heart and is so hard working. It is great to work alongside smart people that I am able to learn from every day but that I also enjoy being around. The culture goes past the work space and includes going out to eat after work, joining volleyball/softball leagues together or hanging out on the weekends. 

Now the benefits.. FOOD. The kitchen is stacked with non-alcoholic beverages, beers, and every snack you could think of. Beer and Kombucha are on tap, too. Past that, you are able to order your lunch from local restaurants every day off of an app. You won't go thirsty or hungry and will save a ton of $$$ on groceries. Past the amazing food choices you have unlimited PTO (and they mean it), great health insurance, online counselors, free gym/classes in the building, 401K, transportation, and parental leave and more.",Truly can't think of anything.

The growth I've experienced in my time here has been tremendous thanks to the internal focus on finding ways to grow our team's skills. This company cares about its employees and their careers.",Not many that I can think of that the company isn't already aware of  and working on.

They do an amazing job of keeping the feel of the office professional and casual at the same time. With things like snacks and drinks around the office, and plenty of ""away from desk"" work space, there are plenty of ways to feel comfortable. The people are generally caring and open. Sprout has initiatives around DEI, and really show that they want their employees to feel valued. Overall, the culture lives up to the hype. It really helps that they actually have a great product as well","Not too many here, but a bit of a slow around Sales Growth. Where there are plenty of opportunities to better your craft here, and internal growth resources, promotions happen slowly. Sometimes it is because there are not openings where you want to go, but I feel like it is mostly because of their metric requirements. I have seen a few reps who were above average over a quarter or a year not get promoted because of a couple of bad months, and end up leaving because they feel a bit stuck, even as a top performer."

130,Sprout Social,A great place to work for most,2020-07-23,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Sprout is full of wonderful people who are smart, empathetic, and care deeply about each other and the communities they live in. Our project work is interesting and challenging, and there is much better career growth & progression here compared to many other tech companies. Engineering teams have clearly defined career bands, and while this can be improved, there is a true emphasis on both ""hard skills"" (technical progression) as well as ""soft skills"" (impact / size of project, ability to lead / mentor, communication) that are often left out of or viewed as less important in Engineering career paths.

Our executive team is incredibly accessible, and truly cares about teams and their wellbeing. They take to heart issues Business Resource Groups (BRGs) and Individual Contributors raise, and are always striving to put employees and our wellbeing first. There's strong work/life balance, and our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives go much deeper into difficult topics such as systemic racism, than most other companies. Our willingness to tackle and discuss challenging topics monthly in our DEI guild meetings, and continuing the conversation / learning outside of the guild meetings, is one of my favorite parts of Sprout.","Pay in technical roles is a bit lower compared to other major Chicago companies, though overall benefits are quite good. Your experience here is highly dependent on your manager, which of course, is not unique to Sprout. If you're on a team with strong leadership, you will likely thrive at Sprout. However, there are definitely instances of folks who left or were let go from Sprout, in part because of poor leadership on their team. That is always difficult to see, especially when it disproportionately happens to folks who are LGBTQ, people of color, or other marginalized identities."

Lastly, you're encouraged to grow your career and you're supported every step of the way, even if that means leaving the company.","There aren't many but I'd say the fact that Sprout is not a start-up anymore, it's more of a scale-up and is growing quickly, there are some growing pains along the way.

This is the perfect recipe for massive success and incredible opportunities, both individually and as a company.","At times, things feel broken because everyone & everything moves so fast. This is to be expected at companies growing as quickly as Sprout, so you need to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. Leadership is keenly aware and they go above and beyond to alleviate the impact, but you need to be prepared to move quickly if you're going to succeed at Sprout."
139,Sprout Social,"Before Sprout, I didn't know companies like this existed",2019-10-11,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"Sprout does what Sprout says it's going to do. Sprout stands behind their product, their promise to build beautiful and affordable software, and most importantly, behind their people. 

It's hard to even know where to start on all of the positive aspects of working at Sprout, but some of the things that stand out are from areas I've had negative experiences in at other companies. For starters, when you work at Sprout, you'll never worry about being the smartest person in the room. Seriously. There are smart people everywhere at Sprout. It's wild. Regardless of your role/rank/responsibilities, if you have a great idea, you'll be met with the resources to act on it. 

Speaking of resources, Sprout is obsessed with arming their people with resources. Again, regardless of your role/rank/responsibilities, your first few weeks at Sprout will consist of a world-class onboarding program that includes product training, introductions from various department heads, and an overall welcome experience that feels like a warm hug on a cold Chicago winter day.

One area that has really stood out to me in my tenure at Sprout is the overwhelming commitment to do right by the customer. If you are looking for a company that nickels and dimes their customers for every new feature release, keep on truckin'.  The vast majority of features we build and release are delivered to our customers, free of charge. Sprout is all about overdelivering on value, and as a customer-facing employee, I AM HERE FOR IT. When I talk to our customers about the value they can expect from Sprout, I am speaking directly from my ethically honest heart. 

As a parent of young kids, Sprout has been very flexible and understanding from the moment I shared the news that I was expecting [yet] another [kid]. As my fellow parents know, being a parent touches all aspects of your life, including your job, and Sprout *gets* that. Leaders lead by example and take the full maternity/paternity leave (which is VERY generous, by the way), and encourage their employees to do the same. Managers understand when your kid is sick/has a dr appt/has a school concert, and don't make you feel guilty for things out of your control. I can't stress enough how much this support has meant to me and my family, and I feel very fortunate to work at Sprout.",Typical growing pains when you grow as quickly as we are.

145,Sprout Social,You'll flourish here,2019-08-12,5.0,Business Development Representative,"I first found out about Sprout Social from my friends. They kept raving about how amazing Sprout was but I took it with a large dose of salt because I couldn't imagine a workplace that could live up to the hype. I likely wouldn't have applied to Sprout but a recruiter reached out to me and I decided to interview. 

As I got to know the employees here during the interview process, I knew Sprout Social was the real deal. Not only do you get to work with amazingly talented yet humble people, you get to do so in a beautiful office with the latest technology and FREE food. Even better, work-life balance here is real. Around 5pm, the office is mostly empty and if you stay later, your co-workers and managers will encourage you to go home. 

Sprout is in the sweet spot where it's mature enough to be one of the top players in the social media management space and the Chicago tech scene, but young enough to have room to grow and innovate. Everywhere I turn, people are being promoted and more people are being hired. You get to work on new projects and new roles, while having structure in place. 

In terms of my own career, I was recently promoted to my current position after being here for a little under a year.  For the sales team, pay is truly competitive and you can earn a steady commission, unlike other sales jobs that move the target every time you hit quota. I feel very supported because not only have I had great managers here, but I can easily talk to other managers and directors in different parts of the company to get advice from them.","There is a lot of change in terms of constantly getting new tools, processes, and responsibilities but the company does a good job explaining why they're making changes and training us to handle these changes."
146,Sprout Social,Hands Down - Best Company in Chicago,2017-02-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been at Sprout Social for a while now and I have grown more and more proud of this team. Here are a few reasons:

1. Despite growth in company size, Sprout has always looked out for its employees - great benefits and events, solid career growth opportunities, incredible coworkers.  You are treated as an adult and trusted to do your work. 

2. Management - I can't say enough good things about the managers, directors, VPs, and C-level folks. They understand the importance of transparency in an organization and will keep their teams updated on road map items and any upcoming changes. They are approachable and care about you as an employee.

3. You have a voice here - your personality, skill set, and opinions are celebrated at Sprout. The team is encouraged to speak up. 

4. The product - Sprout Social is a product that is making a difference in how a business and their customers communicate. Feels good to know that we are building, marketing, and selling a tool that is HELPING people. 

5. The people - I have the good fortune of working with such smart and GOOD people that I genuinely enjoy. We get to know each other (and each other's families) very well. We are given the opportunity learn from one another.

6. The office - we have just moved in to a beautiful new space that is built to support collaboration. Plus, it's filled with personality.","-No major cons!

148,Sprout Social,Cares Deeply about its Employees,2018-10-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Sprout is a company that cares and invests so deeply in its employees' growth, happiness, and satisfaction. Feedback is really taken into account by our leadership, and acted upon - I've seen so many company improvements come about as a direct result of employee feedback. Our CEO (as well as the rest of senior leadership) always takes the time to respond to employee feedback (even when it's not favorable), and make himself available for employees to voice concerns.

Sprout is also a place where people are willing to tackle the hard problems and don't take the easy route - with everything from how we build our products to how we grow our team. I feel recognized for my hard work, and supported and challenged to grow in my career.  Plus, this company is just such a fun and pleasant place to be - with everything from our monthly all-hands and happy hours, to special perks like our canoe trip, spirit week, and breakfast bars. Sprout also more than any other company I've been a part of makes a huge effort to include not just employees, but their families in events - like both a Bring your kids AND Parents to Work day, and including families in our kickoff party and happy hours. This goes a long way in employees being able to bring their whole selves to work.

This is truly a special place and I feel lucky to be here.",I can't think of any. I truly challenge anyone to find a better place to work in Chicago tech.

150,Sprout Social,Sprout has truly made my life so much better,2019-04-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working at Sprout is a dream come true. Everyone here is not only extremely passionate about what they do, everyone here is extremely passionate about each other. I feel so incredibly lucky to work alongside such talented, caring, and creative people. Yes, we have all the food and drinks you can dream of, and awesome perks but what makes Sprout so amazing and stand out from any other job I have had in the past, is that I really feel like I am at home here. I feel free and encouraged to express my ideas, and be confident that they will be listened to and acted upon. In addition, I know that my time at Sprout will be for a while as there are so many possibilities to take your career into any direction. We have so many opportunities to not only grow in our careers as a professional, but also to grow as people. 

It is not fun to be at a job that makes you miserable because you spend so much of your life working, which is where I was before Sprout. I am so insanely happy and grateful to be here, and I can finally say that I am so excited to go to work every single day,  and Sprout entirely is the reason I get out of bed every morning.","Like others mentioned, growing pains. However, it depends on the person as this is a very exciting time to be involved if you are willing to push yourself and take initiative. Otherwise, I cannot think of any single con."
151,Sprout Social,"Well-run, maturing, and focused on its people",2016-07-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Sprout continues to be a fantastic place to work, even over three years. In my time here, I've made lasting friendships, felt challenged to provide my best work on a daily basis, and have seen measurable personal and professional growth.

That the company continues to grow and stay true to its values is a testament to leadership's keen awareness of what makes Sprout, Sprout. It's full of some of the hardest working, passionate, and focused people I've ever worked with. It's an honor to be counted among them.

I love that Sprout is also focused on finding people from within its ranks and using their unique skills and perspectives to push forward on new projects or initiatives. It's a unique atmosphere, to be counted on for things outside of your job in a way that helps you grow. This is something that has gotten better and better during my time here.","Internal communication is getting much better, but still needs some work. There's no set standard for ensuring information is distributed to the proper people. Those systems seem to be put together mainly by their own departments, with very little unity for the entire organization. We're getting there.

Some roles have a great deal of ambiguity, and a little more structure could be helpful to ensure consistent work output."

155,Sprout Social,Jump on the bandwagon!,2019-09-10,4.0,Customer Success Manager,Sprout has done an incredible job at building not only a product that people love but also a community.  They treat all employees (regardless of tenure or title) with respect and push them to to be the best in their day to day.  The executive team lives and breaths for the culture and sets an amazing example.  The typical tech perks are just a bonus on top of the culture and product.,Communication and certain teams can feel siloed at times making working cross-office challenging.
156,Sprout Social,"Well managed company, sustainable growth, hot industry",2017-03-29,5.0,Designer,"I have been at Sprout for a year and am very happy I am here. Best run company I've been at. (Prior: ~8 startups, three acquired. 15 years in web products.). 

People are happy here. 

They have a number of things I really appreciate. Managers are primarily focused on people and their success. We have peer structures for things like deadlines and priorities (the ""squad"" model, which works). This lets the senior folks focus on making people the priority. 

There's been a lot of work at senior levels on what structures this team will need as we rocket upwards in headcount. Feedback flows. Communication channels, performance expectations, career bands are all being formalized. This is really positive. 

There is a real HR team, and professional standards are upheld at all times. Diversity and inclusion are core values. Problems are resolved, and people are respected. It's very refreshing. Benefits are top notch. 

I like building tools for professionals. There's no attention-economy user engagement treadmill, no farming for clicks, no wack figure-it-out-later VC business model. We build something people use every day, that their team pays decent money for. They have high expectations, and we get to meet them. That feels good.","Odd to say, but there isn't any employee turnover, and that can be a little weird sometimes.  

Almost all the outside perspective comes from new hires, not replacement, which sometimes results in lack of awareness of new developments in industry, a overconfidence in our solutions vs competitors. They've made some senior hires lately which are pushing back on this, helpfully."
157,Sprout Social,Getting it right!,2018-06-12,5.0,Quality Assurance Manager,"One of Sprout's values is ""Open Communication Creates Progress,"" and I've found that to be something that is fully embraced during my time here the past year. This is the first place I've worked where communication is encouraged across all levels of the organization and across all topics - concerns, initiatives, ideas, or any suggestions at all. Beyond simply encouraging employees to communicate, the company actively creates spaces for employees to do so. Whether this is the diversity, equity, and inclusion monthly guild meetings and Slack channel, the leadership training initiatives for up-and-coming managers, or the self-led growth sessions, there's always a place to speak your mind.

Additionally, I find the squad/tribe model, which is modeled after the Spotify model, to be a great organizational model to help the company scale. This model allows each team to operate independently, while still providing a mechanism to knowledge share across all of engineering. 

Overall, I think this is the most enjoyable place I've worked. I feel highly valued, and I never doubt the quality of work or the ethics of those around me.","As with any organization that is quickly growing, sometimes there are a few ""growing pains"" associated with the adaptation. This can sometimes take the form of getting the review process ""just right"" or communication hiccups. Compared to other companies I've worked at, though, Sprout seems to be handling this exceedingly well. Their approach toward iteration and open communication really helps smooth these growing pains out."
158,Sprout Social,Very Proud and Lucky to Work at Sprout Social,2018-07-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This company has it all:  focus, drive, ambition and humility. As someone that has been at the organization for a few years, I am continually impressed how we have grown and changed, but kept this incredibly company culture - one that is people first, both in terms of our employee base and our customers. We are happy to be at work because we care about what we do and we understand the value of our product. This team does not shy away from solving hard problems and working through change. They celebrate wins and the accomplishments of employees, but remain honest about processes and systems that can be improved.

Our CEO and leadership team is incredible. They are transparent and look out for what is best for the people at the company. The acquisition of Simply Measured in Seattle came with a lot of questions and change - our leadership team has prioritized their needs and listened to their pain points to work toward a smooth transition into fully integrating.  

Sprout Social is more than just a company and more than just a 9-5. This is a company that grows our employees and sets teams up for success. To put it simply, my coworkers are the best. I'm very proud to work here.","As we grow, let's continue to educate the entire org on process, systems, and communication methods."
159,Sprout Social,The Hype is Real,2018-02-12,5.0,Software Engineer,"I'll admit, you look at the Glassdoor reviews of Sprout and think, ""Whaaaat? There's no way it's that great of a place to work."" The cynicism would be understandable. It would also quickly disappear if you walked through these doors.

You feel it the moment you enter the office. The investments the company has made in brand and design. The care given to every detail by the office ops group. The inspiring names of Sprout Heroes painted on every meeting room door. The positive buzz of colleagues who choose optimism over cynicism, who genuinely believe they play an important role in Sprout's success.

It's a combination of many things. Sprout customers love the product as much as the employees do. Sales genuinely wants to see their customers be successful. Product engineers and designers focus on fixing their users' pain points and giving them super powers. Leadership invests in the long-term, celebrates successes, and learns from failure. Diversity and inclusion aren't just buzz-words, they are investments in our success.

Yeah, it sounds like a lot of hype. But surprisingly, it's the real deal.","Sprout compensation is good, not great. Many people take pay cuts to come work for Sprout, and they're happy with their decisions. You can always make more money by being miserable at Giant Corp. There also may not be as many opportunities for advancement compared to large corporations given Sprout's smaller size."
160,Sprout Social,"Great product, company, and people.  Proud to work here.",2014-06-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"People - smart, talented, and passionate.  You get to work with great people.

Product - look at any product review, and you see that Sprout is well respected across the market.  Customer support, functionality, reliability, design - all of it gets celebrated.  It is comforting to work for such a beloved product.

Ambitions - Sprout has seen great success already, but they aren't slowing down.  Leadership inspires us to work hard every day and really contribute to bringing Sprout to the next level.

Ownership - you can see your individual impact on the company/product/etc.  It is an incredible feeling to know that your work makes a difference.

Perks - Sprout takes great care of us.  Food, drinks, events, machinery - all of it is great.","Ambiguity - as comes with growth, there are times when things can feel unclear or ambiguous.  I personally choose to see this as a challenge to do better every day, but others can definitely feel challenged/frustrated by this.

Support - employees are trusted to do our jobs and do them well.  You won't have someone necessarily checking in on you every hour (no time for that).  Don't be afraid to ask for help from peers and leadership."
161,Sprout Social,The best job I've had in my 15 year career.,2016-10-05,5.0,,"Sprout is unlike any tech company I have ever worked at in my entire career. There are many reasons for this, but the big ones are:

- Highly skilled leadership. Our leaders are experts, most of which have been with the company for many years and have a deep understanding of how to build great software and great teams.

- A company culture that places a high value on employee growth, success and happiness.

- A collegial engineering culture that prioritizes mentorship, quality over quantity and reasonableness over idealism.

- A ""no jerks, no exceptions"" hiring policy.

- Career paths that harness your strengths and challenge your weaknesses.

- Coworkers who are happy to help, take pride in their work and are fun to hang out with at baseball games, happy hours, and other periodic social outings.","I've worked at Sprout for 2 years, I have very few things to say in this box. I can think of two maybe cons:

Working with social networks is a challenge. These challenges can be fun but they can also be frustrating. This is not unique to Sprout, but it is something that some people find surprising when they start.

Sprout provides its employees with expensive Apple hardware. For 99.5% of people this is pro, not a con. For the remaining 0.5%, we cope as best we can. This is not a serious criticism."
162,Sprout Social,Humbling & Exciting Place to Work!,2019-04-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working at Sprout is like being given the opportunity to work with the smartest, hardest working and most fun individuals in tech. 

In addition to the surface level benefits like lunches, happy hours, etc. the culture of Sprout is built around hard work towards a common goal sent down by the Executive Team and put into practice by everyone at the company. 

Great benefits, people & a top-rated platform for marketing teams around the world make every day exciting and gives people across all teams opportunities for personal & professional growth.","Sprout is extremely established for the size & age of the company but does still run into roadblocks and bumps in the road from time-to-time. Just your typical 'start-up' moments of moving too quickly on occasion and having to act fast on alternative solutions that can be perceived as short-minded in some instances. 

Telling friends and family that I work at Sprout almost always turns into a, 'Do you think there's a position there that I'd be a good fit for? I've heard such great things!' conversation, and as fun as that is, it sure does take up a lot of time in my conversations with them!"
163,Sprout Social,Proud to work here,2019-05-10,5.0,Account Executive,"Sprout is truly an incredible company and I feel so proud to work here. The product is the best in class dominating its competition with 27,000 Sprout fanatics. I was blown away by the kindness and humanity I was shown during the hiring process (something most companies lack surprisingly) and onboarding is so thorough! They have fostered a welcoming and inclusive culture that comes from the top down. I've never seen a nicer office in Chicago and the fact that they give their employees so much (unlimited PTO, free lunches, snacks, no micromanaging) motivates me to give 110% every day. This is a company that practices what they preach and instills strong values that reflect in its people and product. Lastly, I have the upmost respect for our CEO, Justyn Howard. He treats every person at the company, regardless of position, like they really matter and his gratitude, vision, and passion is infectious.","Sprout has had very thoughtful growth over the years. However, they are at the point where they need to start creating career growth opportunities or people will start leaving regardless of how great the company is. The Enterprise Sales team is a bit siloed and closed off from hiring internally even for top performers."
164,Sprout Social,Good place for growth,2019-04-10,5.0,Content Specialist,"The people at Sprout make it easy to jump right into the work and whenever questions arise my teammates are more than willing to help me find the answer. It is a fairly fast-paced environment (not as fast as, say, an agency) but in a ways I like that there is always something to do. 

In terms of work-load, Sprout does a good job of explaining why the work you're doing matters and how it fits into the larger scheme of things. I also enjoy the culture of feedback embedded in Sprout; people aren't afraid to give their honest opinion and it's all meant to improve upon your original work. Overall, the people at Sprout are open to new ideas and welcome feedback when processes are broken.","Transparency between teams could be improved upon. Sometimes it feels like you're working on a project that could impact multiple teams, but the right people aren't alerted to it until halfway through the project scope. 

If you're coming from an agency setting, be aware that the work-life balance may take time to get accustomed to. Some approval processes may take longer than expected and that can be frustrating when things have to move slower than you want them to."
165,Sprout Social,Sales Development Representative,2018-01-08,2.0,Sales Development,"There are always a lot of leads so your opportunity to hit quota is always high. Unlimited PTO is a bonus, free lunch, and a nice office is great too. 
The Enablement team is great and truly cares about your success at the company.","Leadership on the sales Development team should be evaluated. The team is ever changing which is fine but it usually changes to help management look better. They only care about their numbers. There’s bullying and picked favorites by one particular manager, who is also sneaky and is not transparent with leadership. More people will continue to leave this team if things do not change with management.  
Sprout is turning into the next Groupon. Hiring top many people at once and numbers are the only thing that matters. They also listen to our calls and provide real time fees back while still one the phone, it’s very distracting and unprofessional. 
There’s not a clear roadmap to promotion regardless of what they told you. They hire a lot of outside employees rather than from the inside, it’s really frustrating."
166,Sprout Social,Dream Company,2019-02-06,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"I've worked in tech for 15 years, and at Sprout I found my dream company.  The culture at Sprout is built around people who care deeply about their teammates and the customers we serve through our solution.  We celebrate diversity and encourage people to be themselves, which I believe has led to a culture of innovation, humility, and collegiality.  

Regardless of one's role on the team, everyone feels valued and looks forward to coming to work every day.   Sprout invests significantly in tools and training to help our team grow both individually and collectively, and many of the net new roles are filled through internal promotions.","Sprout has made diversity and inclusion a focus in recruiting, which has helped foster our amazing culture, but one demographic that remains fairly homogeneous is age: Most employees are in their mid 20's to early 30's, and I believe Sprout would benefit from a broader age distribution among team members.

The free in-office lunch and snacks have helped contribute to my 10-pound weight gain.  Fortunately, the in-office cold brew is calorie-free."
167,Sprout Social,Exciting and challenging workplace with great company culture,2014-06-23,4.0,Product Specialist,"The culture at Sprout Social is great. It's evident that Senior Management cares about the product and the team; that enthusiasm carries throughout the company. The work atmosphere is pretty laid back, but that isn't to say that people aren't competitive (in a good way). Co-workers are great to work with as they are friendly, smart and willing to help when needed.
Perks: ""unlimited"" vacation days, a free catered lunch every day, new office in downtown Chicago, very understanding when personal matters come up, monthly company happy hours along with other various team outings.
Management doesn't micromanage (at least not in my situation). They offer help and suggestions when needed, but otherwise, trust you to get your work done.","The lack of 401k matching (or any input into it). Doesn't really offer assistance in continued education. While I feel there is room to grow professionally at Sprout, it's not clear on what opportunities are/will be a viable option on the sales side.

For certain processes, something that shouldn't be difficult has to go through 3 or 4 people to be done."
168,Sprout Social,Strong sense of values.,2018-02-12,5.0,Software Engineer,"Strong values, one of Sprouts core values is ""open communication creates progress"" something I very much identify with and appreciate seeing is core to Sprout's mission. With any company not everything is going to be perfect, but having a strong sense values really shows how Sprout has a clear vision of the company they aspire to be and it shows through their actions.

Work / life balance, in my experience, it doesn't get any better than at Sprout, I can work from home, take time off when I need to, and call in sick without any fear of judgement. 

The company is open to change and continues to improve. I think this part is very important, even as the company grows, you can see continued re-evaluation of the company and its processes, accompanied by tweaks and improvements.","A lot of challenges with the increase in size of the company, but I like seeing all the changes that have been made to accommodate the recent growth."
169,Sprout Social,A place I'm proud to be a part of,2019-04-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The team strikes the rare balance of compassion and competency. Sprout is full of people who are kind, thoughtful and inclusive while still being incredibly smart, hard-working and resourceful. Finding all those qualities in a single person is hard - finding them in an entire team is amazing.

Thoughtfulness and intentionality are at the core of Sprout and are showcased in nearly every project and interaction I've had over my career here. I've worked at various organizations over the past decade but the executive leadership at Sprout is unmatched. They have the ability to inspire not just through their words, but the way they live their lives and manage their teams.

Simply put, I'm proud to work at Sprout and I can't wait to see what the future holds for this company.","Not a ton of cons. As we've grown quickly, implementing process has been a challenge. We need to continue to search for a way to implement smart process/structure while still leaving room for creative freedom. It is a work in progress but I have faith we'll figure it out."
