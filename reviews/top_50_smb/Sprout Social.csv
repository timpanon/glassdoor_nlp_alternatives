0,Sprout Social,Best career move I've made in a while,2022-04-01,5.0,Director,"When I interviewed at Sprout, I was coming from another company that was considered a ""Glassdoor Best Place to Work"" and didn't take much credence on Sprout being selected for it. I was wrong though - Sprout is the REAL deal. Phenomenal culture, thoughtful colleagues, a fast-paced environment, and a management team that's highly supportive. The two big reasons I stay both relate to people - I trust the leadership here, and I trust the team I get to work with every day.","* We're a fast-growing company and there are pains around building support functions fast enough that support a company our size
* Ditto for process - you have to be comfortable with ambiguity and constant change to like working here"
1,Sprout Social,Supportive and Challenging,2022-03-09,5.0,Senior Manager,"There is an incredibly low tolerance for 'bad apples' - big egos and bad attitudes are not rewarded at Sprout and rarely stay long. The foundation of our culture is that we treat one another with kindness, consideration, and positive intent even when we disagree on business decisions. The average leader at Sprout is sincerely invested in the well-being of the people they support and cares deeply about doing right by the business.

Opportunity is everywhere; our business is growing quickly and so there are always new business needs. We are constantly developing new roles to meet those needs, which creates fantastic career growth opportunities.

Sprout as an organization is incredibly generous. We do right when it comes to our people; examples include surprise spot bonuses for individuals who go above and beyond, generous sales incentives, commission downside protection during ramping and leave, and realistic and achieveable quotas.","Sprout is a very concensus-oriented organization; which can be both inefficient and frustrating, at time. 

As a high growth organization, we are constantly struggling to be adequately staffed."
2,Sprout Social,Almost too good to be true...but it isn't!,2022-01-28,5.0,Principal Customer Success Manager,"I've never worked anywhere more invested in my personal success than Sprout. Leadership is transparently communicative, available, and approachable which is so atypical for lots of high growth tech companies. Customers are HAPPY- like really happy, and churn is low because of that. They product is fantastic, ever-evolving and only getting better because the product team LISTENS to customers. Benefits are comprehensive and management encourages work-life balance and taking time for oneself. People who work hard and do well are recognized for doing so. Oh and finally- the focus on DE&I is real, not a pitch point in interviews.","Much of the compensation is slightly below market (although for a good culture and work-life balance, i'll take it)
Things move super fast, and you need to be a motivated and eager learner to do well here- which isn't for everyone
Benefits are strong, but could be more holistic:
would like to see longer parental leave offered (currently 4 months- which is great but not when other big companies are providing 6), health insurance that covers alternative modalities of healing (like acupuncture)"
3,Sprout Social,"Incredible people, culture & product!",2022-03-09,5.0,Business Operations,Sprout truly is a community. A community of some of the brightest minds I've seen. A community of caring co-workers who truly care about your wellbeing. A community of teams collaborating on building innovations with our product. I truly am privileged to work along such an incredible team.,"Getting into the weeds here, but would be awesome to have all benefits consolidated under one financial institution for 401K, FSA, HSA, RSUs, & ESPP. Would streamline the process come tax season. That really is the only con I can think of."
4,Sprout Social,"Great culture, stress-free",2022-03-19,4.0,Software Engineer,"This has to be the least toxic company I have worked for in the decades I've been a software engineer. No company politics, ""disagreeable"" people are weeded out fairly easily, etc. Everybody wants to work together to solve hard problems. Middle management has a fairly light touch, they have taken the servant leadership style path and teams are fairly autonomous on how they want to organize work, meetings, etc. 

I've worked at a lot of companies when sitting in meetings, I was fairly convinced I was the smartest person in the room. Not so at Sprout, there are a lot of smart, capable people. It is a breath of fresh air from companies that basically hire warm bodies to fill a rec with the hope that they'll be net positive contributors.","The biggest thing is no cost of living raises, no merit raises. The only way to get a raise is moving in the career bands. This is fairly easy when you are more junior, not so much when you are later in your career. So you could go years without a raise even with glowing reviews and constant praise about how good of a job you are doing. There was a ""market adjustment"" last year that occurred but that seemed more reactionary rather than proactive due to the Great Resignation and the inability to recruit candidates. 

Along these lines, there is a little bit of a disconnect between Sprout's ""Best Employer"" marketing and image and the fact that this is still a public company that is going to figure out a way to get the most out of their employees by spending a little as they have to. Or, as HR likes to put it ""the needs of the business"". It's okay to give 4 months of paid maternity and paternity leave but taking more than 2 weeks off for bereavement, military service, etc. you won't be paid AND you'll lose your health insurance because that was decided that that was best for the business. The new ESPP they rolled out is a another example: under the guise of ""fostering employee ownership"", they're restricting you from selling the shares for two years. The real reason is they're protecting leadership and the major shareholders from dilution. 

Over the last couple of years, there has been a distinct lack of candor in internal communications. They took away the 4 year anniversary Hawaii trip under the guise of ""evolving our company traditions"". In reality, they just didn't want to pay for it anymore. All-hands meetings used to be more townhall style where questions could be asked. Now, questions have to be submitted in advance and probably won't be answered anyway if they don't fit the narrative they're trying to communicate. Everything is scripted to the point of being inauthentic. The only authentic moment that happened in the last annual meeting is somebody actually asked of our president ""What would you have done differently?"" and he actually admitted to mistakes. Sprout's leadership doesn't seem to do that anymore and it's disappointing.

We used to get weekly or monthly emails from leadership about their thoughts on what is going on with the company. We don't get that anymore."
5,Sprout Social,Fantastic Place to Work,2022-02-15,5.0,Software Engineer II,"Too many to list. Since I've left Sprout I always look back at is as the premier workplace, and my job searches since then have always used Sprout as the measuring stick. Pros include:

- Great physical (and emotional) work environment
- Free snacks, eats, drinks
- Unlimited PTO (which is actually honored and not just used to guilt folks)
- Lots of great interactions with the community, whether through service days or other events
- Lots of industry-leading work in the social realm
- DEI is at the core of Sprout, everyone is included
- Lots of opportunities for growth
- Very transparent

If Sprout offered a position in my current area of expertise I would seriously consider applying to join the team again, it's a great place to grow.",No real cons to speak of
6,Sprout Social,Amazing Company with Dynamic Culture,2021-08-25,5.0,Senior Customer Success Manager,"Ever since I joined the company, I have felt nothing but support. They truly do give you the tools to be your best self and continue to grow both personally and professionally.

The culture is unbelievably dynamic with the ability to work remote if you choose, have unlimited PTO, and being conscious of our well being during these times.

The role itself allows you to speak to an ever growing industry and help customers become more efficient and effective with their jobs. While there are some issues that pop up here and there, I have never endured an experience where a customer was so mad they yelled at me (unlike my last role)","The biggest issue I have with Customer Success here is we are held to a monthly NDR quota that is over 100%. Having a quota isn't a big deal but the fact that we don't actually negotiate any of that growth is frustrating. We need to rely on our growth partners and if there is a month where they have other deals taking their time, we are left by the wayside

The benefits are pretty good but could be better. I know a lot of other companies in the area that offer full coverage of health benefits. Also would be nice if they provide some sort of stipend for remote employees since they don't get the amazing office benefits"
7,Sprout Social,Solid place to work with the best DEI in the industry,2022-01-07,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Great people who care about their work and each other
- Benefits are solid, parental leave is especially good
- Stock is doing well
- DEI is the best in the industry
- Work-life balance is above average","- Your mileage will vary by team, your experience at Sprout is dependent on your manager. Some are world-class, others are not.
- Lack of transparency into your career growth / path. A closed-door meeting with unknown people who don't know you or your work, decide your fate for promotion and raises with very little of your own input.
- Unlimited PTO is not really unlimited, even though you are encouraged to use it. If you take “too much” you will get in trouble, you have to guess what number that is. 
- Lots of talk about DEI but the select middle-management that work against these values are kept on.
- Opportunities to move up within Sprout are almost non-existent. 9-times-out-of-10 Sprout will do everything it can to hire management positions externally rather than promoting within. Sprout continues to lose a lot of good people as a result.
- Compensation is below industry
- The great office perks that once made Sprout so desirable have not been replaced with equivalent WFH perks or increased salaries. Remote friendly is not a replacement.
- Lots of focus on making more and more money since IPO’d from upper-management, which comes across very cringe."
8,Sprout Social,Sprout Truly Is an Amazing Place to Work and Grow Your Career,2022-01-12,5.0,Account Executive,"Sprout has built something very special. Not only is the product absolutely amazing, but the people are truly inspiring. All Sprout employees align very closely with the company values...not only professionally, but also personally. Sprout's values are to care deeply, embrace accountability, celebrate change, champion diversity, equity and inclusion, seek simplicity, solve hard problems, and promote open, authentic communication.

Beyond the people and the values, Sprout's product is industry-leading and customers enjoy their experience working and partnering with Sprout. The benefits are fantastic and leadership truly cares about the success of everyone on the team. I can't recommend Sprout highly enough!","Since Sprout is growing so quickly/rapidly, it is an extremely fast-paced environment with a few growing pains every now and then. Exciting for most people, but can get a bit overwhelming if you're not prepared."

Ambitious, flexible, motivated, and passionate idea professionals are welcomed, but be aware that you might always feel slightly behind."
13,Sprout Social,Culture & Customer Focus is a huge competitive differentiator,2021-09-27,5.0,Sales Manager,"Joining Sprout Social has been a blessing in so many ways. The values & standards of our organization aren't just words on a page that you hear in your first week - you see them practiced daily. In terms of values specifically, the focus on customers & it's own employees is evident. We consistently hear from clients that our dedication to customer success is a reason they'll continue to invest in Sprout. 

That level of commitment goes beyond customers, as the care that each employee brings to work for their colleagues everyday is unlike anything I've seen in the workplace - constantly focused on treating people with respect, providing feedback, and caring personally about each other. This is also clear throughout our leadership team and there are countless examples of senior leaders consistently showing appreciation, gratitude, & constantly listening.

From a sales perspective, Sprout is a wonderful place to work. It's rare to find an organization that has cracked the code on all 3 ""P's"" - people, product, and process and Sprout has absolutely accomplished that. There is a tremendous amount of growth opportunity, & our teams have the opportunity to meet & exceed their goals on a quarterly basis.",None to share - growth mindset is necessary to constantly improve & evolve!

If you are lucky enough to get the chance to work here, jump on it! The leadership of this company truly cares about its employees and it's easy to feel that everyday, from dedicated R&R days and structured review cycles, to top-notch benefits (including remote status) and manager trainings. A lot of company's talk a big game when it comes to culture and flexibility, but Sprout Social lives it. The CEO, and other executives, even take the time to welcome each class of new employees.

20,Sprout Social,Unbelievably Amazing Company To Work For,2021-10-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I continue to pinch myself often that I get to work at such an amazing place like Sprout Social. First and foremost, how leadership prioritizes its employees is a quality about Sprout that has gone unchanged since I started here. It's a people-first organization and the culture is unparalleled. Take care of yourself and your family, so you can be your best self at work. Aside from that, we have great benefits, amazing leaders, a product that can't be beat, difficult but achievable metrics, smart people who love to solve hard problems, and coworkers that care deeply about each other both in and out of work. 

Despite going remote during the pandemic, Sprout has found ways to adapt and support its people. This is a company that works through change in a respectful and thoughtful way.

I've been working at Sprout for four years and have had the opportunity of a lifetime to grow my career and work alongside some of the smartest people in tech. The people at Sprout have cracked the code when it comes to company culture. From day one, you see first-hand how everyone on the team lives out our values. They're embedded in practically everything we do, from 1:1 conversations with your manager, to business meetings, or even proposing a new project idea, everything at Sprout starts and ends with people. No company is perfect, but Sprout doesn't pretend to be. In fact, they embrace their imperfection and strive to do better. Most importantly, they're vocal about that where it matters most. Sprout's leadership team leans into hard conversations, especially around mental health, and went as far as to make a pilot ""summer hours"" program permanent based on the feedback from our team in how helpful those days off were. 

Your ideas are truly valued here and they carry weight, even if you're not on the leadership level.

Justyn and the exec team demonstrate integrity, humility and an unwavering people-first mentality. These qualities have come through in the evolution of our benefits in the past five years, focus on DEI, investment in training and development programs and approach to thoughtful internal dialogue when facing challenging issues. 

The company's response to COVID-19 is a great example of this: frequent, clear updates from department and company leaders, a generous WFH tech stipend and rapidly adapting internal gatherings, events and processes to support the team. Sprout has also invested a lot in training managers and creating more pathways to promotion for both senior individual contributors and people managers over the past two years in particular.

Culture comes from the top but I also want to highlight how incredible the teams that create the Sprout ""experience"" for everyone are: Office Ops (whether we're remote or actually in the offices), People Team, IT Team, Communication, Events and more.

53,Sprout Social,"Strong business, strong culture, continues heading in the right direction",2021-04-19,5.0,Senior Manager,"-Intense commitment to our values as a company. Not just hollow words.
-Shifted remarkably well to remote work and maintained the in-office culture feel.
-Company continues heading in the right direction with the business. A market leader.
-Unlimited vacation (that people actually use).
-Strong leadership team. All four founders are still at Sprout.","-As it has grown, more and more red tape has appeared.
-Cross-department collaboration still feels a bit strained.
-Work/life balance is pretty good until you start getting higher up, then it feels a little tougher to manage."
54,Sprout Social,N/A,2021-10-27,4.0,Account Executive,great company culture and they really care,pay less than market is offering
55,Sprout Social,Truly the Best Place to Work,2020-09-15,5.0,Manager,"Sprout is so incredibly thoughtful about every decision they make and the impact on their employees. This has especially shown through during their responses to global COVID-19 pandemic. I have felt incredibly supported and cared for during this time, and Sprout has done everything within their power to equip our team with what they need to successfully work remotely. There has also been a strong effort to make our culture just as special in a remote world. Sprout continues to surprise and delight our employees with the thought and care put into re-shaping traditions that were formerly focused on in-person interaction, like All-Hands meetings, social hours, and team member value awards.

Sprout's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is unparalleled among tech companies. While many companies have just started focusing on DEI as a response to the recent incidents of police brutality and Black Lives Matter movement, Sprout has long been committed to putting in the work to make progress against racism, inequality and injustice, and it shows through our culture, policies, and commitments to our communities. Sprout is truly a model in this area for other companies of how to champion DEI.",Can't really think of any. This is really a special company.
56,Sprout Social,Good. Not great. There's definitely a small undercurrent of toxicity.,2021-03-29,3.0,Site Reliability Engineer,"The business resource groups (BRGs) are amazing. They're run by some incredibly compassionate people and have an impact. Not as large of one as they should, but they do make the largest mark they can given the constraints they run under.

If you're lucky enough to find a manager that's dedicated, there are a lot of opportunities for growth. 

The engineering team is filled with a lot of very talented people, and a lot of them are incredibly happy to sit down and help you learn things. 

There are some really, really, REALLY amazing people here.

For SRE in particular: We've done a lot of work to drive page volume down to a trickle, often less than 1 a week. The rotation is wide, and is currently about once every six weeks.","THE BASICS:

Compensation is below market. No bonus schedule.

ESPP is non-existent, even a year post-IPO.

When onsite: Open office layouts are incredibly difficult to work in, distractions are high, desks are small.

THE MORE DIFFICULT STUFF:

Many people in Engineering management try tirelessly to quantify every single problem. That works great for technical issues in a lot of cases! For people issues, it's a non-starter, and puts the onus on victims of discrimination or harassment to collect a ton of receipts, even when the incident occurs out in the open, in Zoom calls, Slack conversations, or even in code reviews.

This is very much a company that kinda got dragged into remote work and hasn't really taken a step back to look at the impact it has on everyone. There's still a lot of expectation to respond quickly to questions, a lot of demand to spend time on zoom meetings, and a great amount of expectation around synchronously working. We get messages often telling us to not respond to messages immediately, to realize that we're all people, but no one from management on down seems to actually demonstrate it.

There are just a few people in Engineering who run against the organization's focus on diversity, and Engineering's focus on avoiding burnout and 10x engineers. They are unfortunately very visible, try tirelessly to make themselves indispensable, and are also impossible to avoid working with if you want to continue to grow in your role.

Manager retention is abysmal. In my six year tenure I had five different managers, which makes it really difficult to work on advancement when each one of them had different goals in mind."
57,Sprout Social,Great place to work,2021-07-06,5.0,Account Executive,"Sprout is a great product that customers love, management listens & follows through on changes, fair compensation, fun work environment, promotion path clear & attainable",Quota can be high but it fluctuates and never stays that way for long

Daily lunch stipend
Fully stocked kitchen","Pay is OK, but could be a bit more competitive. Some companies in Chicago pay a bit better but there are trade offs. Sprout probably takes care of you better in other ways than other companies."
63,Sprout Social,Easily one of the best places I've ever worked,2021-02-16,5.0,Director of Engineering,"Sprout's culture is one of its greatest assets - the focus on essentialism and only building what is strictly necessary for success is one of the reasons that it stays so agile at such a decent scale. Engineering practices are disciplined and as objective as possible, technical debt is obviously present but kept thoughtfully to a minimum, on-call demand is very light comparatively, and contributions are recognized quickly and meaningfully.","Compensation could be better, benefits are quite average, no ongoing stock-based compensation as part of annual review cycle."
64,Sprout Social,Amazing job and people,2020-07-16,5.0,Account Executive,"There are really too many pros to list here. I came to Sprout looking for fulfilling work, opportunities for career advancement, constant learning, a high-performing team, collaboration, fun, and of course, a good income. At most companies, I think you'd be really fortunate to get a few of those boxes checked. I'm happy to say that after a year at Sprout, and amidst a global pandemic, I've never been more confident that I made the right choice coming here. This position, my team, and the broader company afforded me every one of those opportunities. 

Sprout is unlike any organization I've worked for; I truly believe it is one of the best, if not the best, place to work.

I remember reading reviews on Glassdoor prior to interviewing at Sprout and thinking to myself ""this is too good to be true."" It's not. The hype is real, and I enjoy almost every work day. I genuinely look forward to my job... I didn't know that was possible.","Everyone knows that a lack of diversity is endemic in SaaS, and Sprout isn't an exception in that regard, unfortunately. However, Sprout is one of the few companies championing diversity (it's a prominent position/initiative here) and I'm confident we'll keep making strides toward a more diverse workforce."
65,Sprout Social,I have never been more excited about working for Sprout Social,2020-01-25,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- I love our customer support team even more than our customers do
- Parental leave benefits have been improved to 16 weeks regardless of primary or secondary caregiver designation
- Incredibly talented and passionate coworkers
- Very bright future
- Great work life balance
- Well-supported Diversity Equity and Inclusion initiatives
- Improving workplace empathy, generosity, feedback, growth and camaraderie
- Lots of opportunity for career growth or specialization for those who thrive with more singular focus
- Core values are admirable and ambitious
- Savvy PMs who have strong product knowledge, help triage issues, and can even provide insight and guidance for feature work","- Projects across teams are sometimes painful, but this an understood area for improvement within the company.
- The wide variety of ways that our customers use our application can cause some projects to have a long tail of feature refinement and revision which can feel less rewarding than net new work.
- Balancing the demands of technical debt and feature work has been difficult.
- Some teams feel understaffed in relation to the outsized usage and visibility of the features that they develop and maintain. This is especially true when it comes to the support rotation.
- Relationships between teams could be better. Years of specialized product focus has caused us to grow further apart than the crazy days when there was 1 team for everything."
66,Sprout Social,Values-based culture transcends the office,2021-02-03,5.0,Product Manager,"Sprout has a culture that's been intentionally built upon shared values. These are plastered all over the office space and ingrained in everything the company does. With the pandemic and the transition to full-remote work across the company, we've found that the values-based culture holds up, even when the ""perks"" of the office aren't accessible for now. The company is serious about diversity, equity, and inclusion, and that's apparent in just about every meeting, process, policy, and interaction. This is a company that cares about PEOPLE because they're valuable, not simply because they're productive. That shows itself in a compassionate and considerate community, supportive business resource groups, and flexible time off and other policies that support good work-life balance. Beyond that, everyone goes above and beyond to make sure that each person's experience is excellent and that their needs are met, whether that's accommodating schedules for family commitments, making benefits accommodations for non-traditional families, or just celebrating important moments in our work and personal lives, I've felt like a part of a family at Sprout since the day I joined.","As the company continues to grow, there are constant challenges to overcome with org structure, staffing, and scaling teams in effective ways. Generally, these challenges are addressed thoughtfully in ways that support healthy teams and healthy future growth, but the growing pains can be awkward. Additionally, Sprout has such a supportive and engaging office environment that it's been somewhat disappointing to lose that with the pandemic. There have been so many creative ways to replicate that in our current fully-remote setting, but we're missing some of the sense of community that comes from physical proximity. There's much to look forward to in the return to the office post-covid."
67,Sprout Social,Best company I've worked for.,2021-03-01,5.0,Senior Enablement Specialist,Sprout Social is the best career move I've made. The people make the company and they continue to add amazing team members that continue to grow and add to the unique culture that many growing companies would not be able to continue.

I truly feel like Sprout, my manger, and my team is committed to my growth and I have learned so much both professionally and personally because of that. 

Sprout's set of values is apparent in every part of the team and the culture, and being surrounded by people who love what they do is really inspiring. Especially during COVID, Sprout has done an incredible job adapting our culture into our WFH lives with things that bring us together as a team and company, such as online Happy Hours, crafting/cooking events, etc. Leadership has also been transparent with WFH updates and have been flexible and understanding when it comes to transitioning into a remote work life.

What stuck out to me even in the interview process and has continued to be a bright spot is the culture of feedback, creativity and inclusion.","Sprout is on the move. Which means lots is changing, which is not for everyone. If you're able to ""celebrate change"" and ""solve hard problems"" (Sprout values) you'll fit in great, but the constant growing pains/changes can bring some levels of ambiguity, necessity for flexibility and the need for patience while we build the plane while flying."

The culture is truly special. It's not just a bunch of words or values written on walls. It's allowing each of us to be our true selves and bring our best selves into work everyday. That is what makes the culture special. And again we practice what we preach. The values we have are the behaviors we exhibit every day. 
I love the people I work with and the challenges we get to solve. The challenges are hard, no doubt there, and not every conversation is easy. But we do it collectively, respectfully of each other, and with our customer's needs in mind. That makes it a very special place to work. 
I truly look forward to Monday's and going into the office!","Sprout is fast paced and we are growing quickly. With that comes a lot of change and change management.

Sprout is deeply committed to empowering employees with the tools and resources to really excel at their career, and I have learned more in the last 5 years than I have my entire career. They truly live their values, starting from executive leadership down to the contributor level, I am motivated to do my best work because of how much the company has invested in me and my growth.","If there isn't a clear expectation set with your role or manager, it can be difficult to be successful in your position.

101,Sprout Social,Sprout supports bringing your whole self to work,2020-02-12,5.0,Senior Manager,"The most impressive and admirable part of Sprout's culture is its emphasis on creating an open and inviting workspace for all individuals. Lots of companies preach the important of DEI, but few invest in it as actively as Sprout does. It is clear that Sprout believes that individuals will perform their best work if they are able to truly be themselves in a work environment without fear of judgment or repercussions. 

The company invests in its people through various types of trainings, access to external resources, a focus on business resource groups and emphasizing the importance of taking care of your mental/physical health first and foremost. 

I fully believe that Sprout's success as a business is in large part due to how deeply it cares about its employees.","There are growing pains, which is to be expected for a company at this stage. Cross-department communication remains a challenge, and it is becoming more challenging each day to have insight into how large decisions are made. It isn't that the company is trying to be less transparent; rather, it is that as teams get larger, they become more siloed. This creates issues with more complex projects."
102,Sprout Social,Good Company (For the Right Person and Role/Position),2020-12-10,3.0,Sales,"A collaborative culture, strong communication from the executives. Nice office perks (when offices are open), i.e. free lunches, free gym, snacks, beer and drinks, etc...good product/technology.

**Other general observations below (neither good nor bad), just observations:

Sprout is a very progressive company and is largely what I would describe as a very democratic culture. With being headquartered in downtown Chicago this is an almost 'obvious' observation, however, if you are a. more conservative-minded person, you might have a few challenges connecting with co-workers at Sprout. 

Also, Sprout has a very strong DEI program, so if DEI initiatives and focus are important to you, you will feel right at home!","Sprout Social is a very prideful organization. In my opinion, as a company, it is starting to lose some of its humble 'roots' little by little. 

Sprout is also often regarded as a 'best places to work', which for the most part is true for almost every position at the company except for those people in sales (in my opinion). Now that Sprout is a publicly-traded company, the urgency around sales performance and closing sales deals is stronger than ever. This creates a high 'burn-out' rate for people in a quota-carrying role since sales targets and quotas are measured monthly. Working in sales at Sprout quickly turned into a major 'grind'. While sales are never easy, the urgency has only intensified. 

The sales org is becoming much more 'cut-throat'. Many of the sales leaders came from Salesforce (which is has a reputation for grinding their sales reps through the sales floor so-to-speak) so if you thrive in a very demanding and cut-throat, fast-paced sales environment or culture you will feel right at home at Sprout, if you are not used to this, you can and might burn out quickly. 

Additionally, if you are a parent and are considering a sales role at Sprout, proceed with caution. Sprout has recently named a 'best place to work for parents'. Again this is largely true for people outside of sales. If you work in sales this is not the case what-so-ever. Sprout has a tendency to higher younger(ish) and single people, as they tend to have fewer distractions at home. This is a personal belief, nothing more, but I spend enough time here to see the correlation of this."
103,Sprout Social,"Amazing Company, Amazing People",2020-06-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I wanted to write this review, particularly around Sprout's reaction to recent events. This company has always been a cut above, but within the last few months, this team has proved how unique and heart-forward they are.

First, the pandemic. Each company has handled the remote work and team support in a different way, but I believe no one does it better than Sprout. We receive updates from our CEO and CPO often; communication is massively important when we are all isolated. The in-office environment is a huge part of Sprout's culture. In some way or another, they've been able to translate the personality and culture of the company into our homes. Even apart, Sprout still feels like Sprout. We were provided a very generous stipend to become comfortable in our homes to work. A company-wide survey went out so the leadership could hear directly from the people while they make decisions about a possible return to the office. I feel very cared for and in a time of certainty, it means everything to me and my family. 

Second, I want to address Sprout's reaction to the recent murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement. Following the initial set of national protests, Sprout provided us with a Day of Action to reflect, learn, donate, and volunteer. They provided numerous resources for us to learn, grow, and lean in to topics that may initially feel uncomfortable. There is a massive donation in place to a few organizations and each of us were able to select the cause closest to our hearts. In the middle of writing this review, we just learned that starting in 2021, Juneteenth will be a company holiday! Sprout is active in creating initiatives that combat systemic racism and champion the value of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. DEI is embedded in this company so deeply, specifically how we communicate and how decisions are made.

I am incredibly proud to work for an organization that listens, that has a moral compass, and that puts its people first. Sprout changed my life for the better when I started, and continues to change my life for the better.",No cons as of right now.

108,Sprout Social,Giving Sprout their flowers,2020-08-19,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"The emphasis on DEI is industry standard at Sprout. How many companies do you know that hold monthly DEI meetings that are well-planned, well-informed, and much needed? The culture is unmatched; I've never felt more ""at home"" at a company. The leaders are transparent and upstanding, they truly care about the team. The Sprout Value awards bring a tear to my eye every time!","Unclear on have to navigate to different roles across the company, but I know that's actively being addressed. The salary is not competitive."
109,Sprout Social,"Best Company, People, and Culture",2020-08-10,5.0,Business Development Representative,"Work life balance is great here, they truly value their employees, best leaders I've had within a company, and firm DEI values which is very refreshing during this time. Not even for the ""look"" of being progressive, but genuinely supporting all groups throughout various efforts and work within the company.","Although we are a public company, there are still start up processes / ideas so there isn't one specific way to do things here and one of our values is adapting for that reason. Things are always changing, but not necessarily a negative thing."
110,Sprout Social,Great Place To Work,2020-11-17,4.0,Current Employee,"Sprout has a transparent, inclusive and engaging culture. The leadership team is approachable, supportive and truly values DEI work. I've also been particularly impressed with how they have handled COVID and our transition to a remote environment. I feel fortunate to be at a company that truly values their employees.","Compensation is not always competitive compared to other tech companies and it is unclear how compensation decisions are made and what one can expect throughout their career at Sprout. There are no bonuses and a yearly increase is not guaranteed, yet cost of benefits to employees continues to increase."
111,Sprout Social,A company that truly cares,2020-04-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"""Care Deeply"" is one of Sprout's values and the phrase truly encapsulates the company, culture and team. We've gone through a ton of change over the years - by nature of being a fast-growing company rooted in social media - but the things that make the company great have never wavered. 

The company's commitment to its employees is clear. There are the tangible things:  a generous parental leave, free lunches/snacks, fun events, high quality tech etc. But what makes Sprout special are the things that can't be captured in a bulleted list or stock photos. People are treated with respect, feedback is acted upon and the impact on employees is considered in every decision Sprout makes. While Sprout isn't perfect, working here feels like a collaborative, fun and human experience. 

I'm proud and energized to work at Sprout.",The team is very thoughtful and that can sometimes lead to over-thinking or over-complicating process or initiatives.

115,Sprout Social,Fantastic Place to Work,2020-07-16,5.0,Growth Manager,I have been lucky enough to work at some great companies over my career and I put Sprout at the top of the list for sure. It starts from the top down. Justyn Howard is thinking two and three steps ahead of the industry. As he leads by example he does it in a very humble way. The companies focus on work-life balance and DEI is second to none.,I have been here for three years now and I can not really think of any Cons.

I've only been working here for a few months but already feel like Sprout is part of my DNA. Everyone is kind, driven, supportive and empathetic. Sprout really embraces diversity and I've learned a lot from our monthly Diversity, Equity & Inclusion guild meetings! Leadership is really connected to the rest of the company, offers a lot of transparency into the business and leads with empathy. During the COVID-19 crisis, when other companies have been forced to pull back on resources, Sprout offered even more support, including a stipend for home office supplies. That never would have happened at my last company. Blessed to be a part of Team Sprout!","Not really a con, but standards and expectations are high.

122,Sprout Social,Couldn't be luckier,2020-04-21,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"From day one of the interview process to now (8 months later) I could not feel more grateful to work at this company. Sprout is the golden standard. Management sticks to open and authentic communication and your opinion is valued from day one. Being in a junior role on the sales side, I have never felt devalued and have always felt heard and appreciated. You are equipped with a new mac laptop and all the tools necessary to complete your job. Hitting your quota is challenging but fair and doable if you put in the work. You have access to outreach, zoom, salesforce, Vidyard and more to help you get there.

The culture is everything. Every person at this company has a great heart and is so hard working. It is great to work alongside smart people that I am able to learn from every day but that I also enjoy being around. The culture goes past the work space and includes going out to eat after work, joining volleyball/softball leagues together or hanging out on the weekends. 

Now the benefits.. FOOD. The kitchen is stacked with non-alcoholic beverages, beers, and every snack you could think of. Beer and Kombucha are on tap, too. Past that, you are able to order your lunch from local restaurants every day off of an app. You won't go thirsty or hungry and will save a ton of $$$ on groceries. Past the amazing food choices you have unlimited PTO (and they mean it), great health insurance, online counselors, free gym/classes in the building, 401K, transportation, and parental leave and more.",Truly can't think of anything.

They do an amazing job of keeping the feel of the office professional and casual at the same time. With things like snacks and drinks around the office, and plenty of ""away from desk"" work space, there are plenty of ways to feel comfortable. The people are generally caring and open. Sprout has initiatives around DEI, and really show that they want their employees to feel valued. Overall, the culture lives up to the hype. It really helps that they actually have a great product as well","Not too many here, but a bit of a slow around Sales Growth. Where there are plenty of opportunities to better your craft here, and internal growth resources, promotions happen slowly. Sometimes it is because there are not openings where you want to go, but I feel like it is mostly because of their metric requirements. I have seen a few reps who were above average over a quarter or a year not get promoted because of a couple of bad months, and end up leaving because they feel a bit stuck, even as a top performer."

131,Sprout Social,A great place to work for most,2020-07-23,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Sprout is full of wonderful people who are smart, empathetic, and care deeply about each other and the communities they live in. Our project work is interesting and challenging, and there is much better career growth & progression here compared to many other tech companies. Engineering teams have clearly defined career bands, and while this can be improved, there is a true emphasis on both ""hard skills"" (technical progression) as well as ""soft skills"" (impact / size of project, ability to lead / mentor, communication) that are often left out of or viewed as less important in Engineering career paths.

Our executive team is incredibly accessible, and truly cares about teams and their wellbeing. They take to heart issues Business Resource Groups (BRGs) and Individual Contributors raise, and are always striving to put employees and our wellbeing first. There's strong work/life balance, and our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives go much deeper into difficult topics such as systemic racism, than most other companies. Our willingness to tackle and discuss challenging topics monthly in our DEI guild meetings, and continuing the conversation / learning outside of the guild meetings, is one of my favorite parts of Sprout.","Pay in technical roles is a bit lower compared to other major Chicago companies, though overall benefits are quite good. Your experience here is highly dependent on your manager, which of course, is not unique to Sprout. If you're on a team with strong leadership, you will likely thrive at Sprout. However, there are definitely instances of folks who left or were let go from Sprout, in part because of poor leadership on their team. That is always difficult to see, especially when it disproportionately happens to folks who are LGBTQ, people of color, or other marginalized identities."

Lastly, you're encouraged to grow your career and you're supported every step of the way, even if that means leaving the company.","There aren't many but I'd say the fact that Sprout is not a start-up anymore, it's more of a scale-up and is growing quickly, there are some growing pains along the way.

This is the perfect recipe for massive success and incredible opportunities, both individually and as a company.","At times, things feel broken because everyone & everything moves so fast. This is to be expected at companies growing as quickly as Sprout, so you need to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. Leadership is keenly aware and they go above and beyond to alleviate the impact, but you need to be prepared to move quickly if you're going to succeed at Sprout."
140,Sprout Social,"Before Sprout, I didn't know companies like this existed",2019-10-11,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"Sprout does what Sprout says it's going to do. Sprout stands behind their product, their promise to build beautiful and affordable software, and most importantly, behind their people. 

It's hard to even know where to start on all of the positive aspects of working at Sprout, but some of the things that stand out are from areas I've had negative experiences in at other companies. For starters, when you work at Sprout, you'll never worry about being the smartest person in the room. Seriously. There are smart people everywhere at Sprout. It's wild. Regardless of your role/rank/responsibilities, if you have a great idea, you'll be met with the resources to act on it. 

Speaking of resources, Sprout is obsessed with arming their people with resources. Again, regardless of your role/rank/responsibilities, your first few weeks at Sprout will consist of a world-class onboarding program that includes product training, introductions from various department heads, and an overall welcome experience that feels like a warm hug on a cold Chicago winter day.

One area that has really stood out to me in my tenure at Sprout is the overwhelming commitment to do right by the customer. If you are looking for a company that nickels and dimes their customers for every new feature release, keep on truckin'.  The vast majority of features we build and release are delivered to our customers, free of charge. Sprout is all about overdelivering on value, and as a customer-facing employee, I AM HERE FOR IT. When I talk to our customers about the value they can expect from Sprout, I am speaking directly from my ethically honest heart. 

As a parent of young kids, Sprout has been very flexible and understanding from the moment I shared the news that I was expecting [yet] another [kid]. As my fellow parents know, being a parent touches all aspects of your life, including your job, and Sprout *gets* that. Leaders lead by example and take the full maternity/paternity leave (which is VERY generous, by the way), and encourage their employees to do the same. Managers understand when your kid is sick/has a dr appt/has a school concert, and don't make you feel guilty for things out of your control. I can't stress enough how much this support has meant to me and my family, and I feel very fortunate to work at Sprout.",Typical growing pains when you grow as quickly as we are.

146,Sprout Social,You'll flourish here,2019-08-12,5.0,Business Development Representative,"I first found out about Sprout Social from my friends. They kept raving about how amazing Sprout was but I took it with a large dose of salt because I couldn't imagine a workplace that could live up to the hype. I likely wouldn't have applied to Sprout but a recruiter reached out to me and I decided to interview. 

As I got to know the employees here during the interview process, I knew Sprout Social was the real deal. Not only do you get to work with amazingly talented yet humble people, you get to do so in a beautiful office with the latest technology and FREE food. Even better, work-life balance here is real. Around 5pm, the office is mostly empty and if you stay later, your co-workers and managers will encourage you to go home. 

Sprout is in the sweet spot where it's mature enough to be one of the top players in the social media management space and the Chicago tech scene, but young enough to have room to grow and innovate. Everywhere I turn, people are being promoted and more people are being hired. You get to work on new projects and new roles, while having structure in place. 

In terms of my own career, I was recently promoted to my current position after being here for a little under a year.  For the sales team, pay is truly competitive and you can earn a steady commission, unlike other sales jobs that move the target every time you hit quota. I feel very supported because not only have I had great managers here, but I can easily talk to other managers and directors in different parts of the company to get advice from them.","There is a lot of change in terms of constantly getting new tools, processes, and responsibilities but the company does a good job explaining why they're making changes and training us to handle these changes."
147,Sprout Social,Hands Down - Best Company in Chicago,2017-02-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been at Sprout Social for a while now and I have grown more and more proud of this team. Here are a few reasons:

1. Despite growth in company size, Sprout has always looked out for its employees - great benefits and events, solid career growth opportunities, incredible coworkers.  You are treated as an adult and trusted to do your work. 

2. Management - I can't say enough good things about the managers, directors, VPs, and C-level folks. They understand the importance of transparency in an organization and will keep their teams updated on road map items and any upcoming changes. They are approachable and care about you as an employee.

149,Sprout Social,Cares Deeply about its Employees,2018-10-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Sprout is a company that cares and invests so deeply in its employees' growth, happiness, and satisfaction. Feedback is really taken into account by our leadership, and acted upon - I've seen so many company improvements come about as a direct result of employee feedback. Our CEO (as well as the rest of senior leadership) always takes the time to respond to employee feedback (even when it's not favorable), and make himself available for employees to voice concerns.

Sprout is also a place where people are willing to tackle the hard problems and don't take the easy route - with everything from how we build our products to how we grow our team. I feel recognized for my hard work, and supported and challenged to grow in my career.  Plus, this company is just such a fun and pleasant place to be - with everything from our monthly all-hands and happy hours, to special perks like our canoe trip, spirit week, and breakfast bars. Sprout also more than any other company I've been a part of makes a huge effort to include not just employees, but their families in events - like both a Bring your kids AND Parents to Work day, and including families in our kickoff party and happy hours. This goes a long way in employees being able to bring their whole selves to work.

Everyone here is not only extremely passionate about what they do, everyone here is extremely passionate about each other. I feel so incredibly lucky to work alongside such talented, caring, and creative people. Yes, we have all the food and drinks you can dream of, and awesome perks but what makes Sprout so amazing and stand out from any other job I have had in the past, is that I really feel like I am at home here. I feel free and encouraged to express my ideas, and be confident that they will be listened to and acted upon. In addition, I know that my time at Sprout will be for a while as there are so many possibilities to take your career into any direction. We have so many opportunities to not only grow in our careers as a professional, but also to grow as people. 

It is not fun to be at a job that makes you miserable because you spend so much of your life working, which is where I was before Sprout. I am so insanely happy and grateful to be here, and I can finally say that I am so excited to go to work every single day,  and Sprout entirely is the reason I get out of bed every morning.","Like others mentioned, growing pains.

In my time here, I've made lasting friendships, felt challenged to provide my best work on a daily basis, and have seen measurable personal and professional growth.

That the company continues to grow and stay true to its values is a testament to leadership's keen awareness of what makes Sprout, Sprout. It's full of some of the hardest working, passionate, and focused people I've ever worked with. It's an honor to be counted among them.

I love that Sprout is also focused on finding people from within its ranks and using their unique skills and perspectives to push forward on new projects or initiatives. It's a unique atmosphere, to be counted on for things outside of your job in a way that helps you grow. This is something that has gotten better and better during my time here.","Internal communication is getting much better, but still needs some work. There's no set standard for ensuring information is distributed to the proper people. Those systems seem to be put together mainly by their own departments, with very little unity for the entire organization. We're getting there.

Some roles have a great deal of ambiguity, and a little more structure could be helpful to ensure consistent work output."

156,Sprout Social,Jump on the bandwagon!,2019-09-10,4.0,Customer Success Manager,Sprout has done an incredible job at building not only a product that people love but also a community.  They treat all employees (regardless of tenure or title) with respect and push them to to be the best in their day to day.  The executive team lives and breaths for the culture and sets an amazing example.  The typical tech perks are just a bonus on top of the culture and product.,Communication and certain teams can feel siloed at times making working cross-office challenging.
157,Sprout Social,"Well managed company, sustainable growth, hot industry",2017-03-29,5.0,Designer,"I have been at Sprout for a year and am very happy I am here. Best run company I've been at. (Prior: ~8 startups, three acquired. 15 years in web products.). 

People are happy here. 

They have a number of things I really appreciate. Managers are primarily focused on people and their success. We have peer structures for things like deadlines and priorities (the ""squad"" model, which works). This lets the senior folks focus on making people the priority. 

There's been a lot of work at senior levels on what structures this team will need as we rocket upwards in headcount. Feedback flows. Communication channels, performance expectations, career bands are all being formalized. This is really positive. 

There is a real HR team, and professional standards are upheld at all times. Diversity and inclusion are core values. Problems are resolved, and people are respected. It's very refreshing. Benefits are top notch. 

I like building tools for professionals. There's no attention-economy user engagement treadmill, no farming for clicks, no wack figure-it-out-later VC business model. We build something people use every day, that their team pays decent money for. They have high expectations, and we get to meet them. That feels good.","Odd to say, but there isn't any employee turnover, and that can be a little weird sometimes.  

Almost all the outside perspective comes from new hires, not replacement, which sometimes results in lack of awareness of new developments in industry, a overconfidence in our solutions vs competitors. They've made some senior hires lately which are pushing back on this, helpfully."
158,Sprout Social,Getting it right!,2018-06-12,5.0,Quality Assurance Manager,"One of Sprout's values is ""Open Communication Creates Progress,"" and I've found that to be something that is fully embraced during my time here the past year. This is the first place I've worked where communication is encouraged across all levels of the organization and across all topics - concerns, initiatives, ideas, or any suggestions at all. Beyond simply encouraging employees to communicate, the company actively creates spaces for employees to do so. Whether this is the diversity, equity, and inclusion monthly guild meetings and Slack channel, the leadership training initiatives for up-and-coming managers, or the self-led growth sessions, there's always a place to speak your mind.

Additionally, I find the squad/tribe model, which is modeled after the Spotify model, to be a great organizational model to help the company scale. This model allows each team to operate independently, while still providing a mechanism to knowledge share across all of engineering. 

Overall, I think this is the most enjoyable place I've worked. I feel highly valued, and I never doubt the quality of work or the ethics of those around me.","As with any organization that is quickly growing, sometimes there are a few ""growing pains"" associated with the adaptation. This can sometimes take the form of getting the review process ""just right"" or communication hiccups. Compared to other companies I've worked at, though, Sprout seems to be handling this exceedingly well. Their approach toward iteration and open communication really helps smooth these growing pains out."
159,Sprout Social,Very Proud and Lucky to Work at Sprout Social,2018-07-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This company has it all:  focus, drive, ambition and humility. As someone that has been at the organization for a few years, I am continually impressed how we have grown and changed, but kept this incredibly company culture - one that is people first, both in terms of our employee base and our customers. We are happy to be at work because we care about what we do and we understand the value of our product. This team does not shy away from solving hard problems and working through change. They celebrate wins and the accomplishments of employees, but remain honest about processes and systems that can be improved.

Our CEO and leadership team is incredible. They are transparent and look out for what is best for the people at the company. The acquisition of Simply Measured in Seattle came with a lot of questions and change - our leadership team has prioritized their needs and listened to their pain points to work toward a smooth transition into fully integrating.  

Sprout Social is more than just a company and more than just a 9-5. This is a company that grows our employees and sets teams up for success. To put it simply, my coworkers are the best. I'm very proud to work here.","As we grow, let's continue to educate the entire org on process, systems, and communication methods."
160,Sprout Social,The Hype is Real,2018-02-12,5.0,Software Engineer,"I'll admit, you look at the Glassdoor reviews of Sprout and think, ""Whaaaat? There's no way it's that great of a place to work."" The cynicism would be understandable. It would also quickly disappear if you walked through these doors.

You feel it the moment you enter the office. The investments the company has made in brand and design. The care given to every detail by the office ops group. The inspiring names of Sprout Heroes painted on every meeting room door. The positive buzz of colleagues who choose optimism over cynicism, who genuinely believe they play an important role in Sprout's success.

It's a combination of many things. Sprout customers love the product as much as the employees do. Sales genuinely wants to see their customers be successful. Product engineers and designers focus on fixing their users' pain points and giving them super powers. Leadership invests in the long-term, celebrates successes, and learns from failure. Diversity and inclusion aren't just buzz-words, they are investments in our success.

Yeah, it sounds like a lot of hype. But surprisingly, it's the real deal.","Sprout compensation is good, not great. Many people take pay cuts to come work for Sprout, and they're happy with their decisions. You can always make more money by being miserable at Giant Corp. There also may not be as many opportunities for advancement compared to large corporations given Sprout's smaller size."
161,Sprout Social,"Great product, company, and people.  Proud to work here.",2014-06-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"People - smart, talented, and passionate.  You get to work with great people.

Product - look at any product review, and you see that Sprout is well respected across the market.  Customer support, functionality, reliability, design - all of it gets celebrated.  It is comforting to work for such a beloved product.

Ambitions - Sprout has seen great success already, but they aren't slowing down.  Leadership inspires us to work hard every day and really contribute to bringing Sprout to the next level.

Ownership - you can see your individual impact on the company/product/etc.  It is an incredible feeling to know that your work makes a difference.

Perks - Sprout takes great care of us.  Food, drinks, events, machinery - all of it is great.","Ambiguity - as comes with growth, there are times when things can feel unclear or ambiguous.  I personally choose to see this as a challenge to do better every day, but others can definitely feel challenged/frustrated by this.

Support - employees are trusted to do our jobs and do them well.  You won't have someone necessarily checking in on you every hour (no time for that).  Don't be afraid to ask for help from peers and leadership."
162,Sprout Social,The best job I've had in my 15 year career.,2016-10-05,5.0,,"Sprout is unlike any tech company I have ever worked at in my entire career. There are many reasons for this, but the big ones are:

- Highly skilled leadership. Our leaders are experts, most of which have been with the company for many years and have a deep understanding of how to build great software and great teams.

- A company culture that places a high value on employee growth, success and happiness.

- A collegial engineering culture that prioritizes mentorship, quality over quantity and reasonableness over idealism.

- A ""no jerks, no exceptions"" hiring policy.

- Career paths that harness your strengths and challenge your weaknesses.

- Coworkers who are happy to help, take pride in their work and are fun to hang out with at baseball games, happy hours, and other periodic social outings.","I've worked at Sprout for 2 years, I have very few things to say in this box. I can think of two maybe cons:

Working with social networks is a challenge. These challenges can be fun but they can also be frustrating. This is not unique to Sprout, but it is something that some people find surprising when they start.

Sprout provides its employees with expensive Apple hardware. For 99.5% of people this is pro, not a con. For the remaining 0.5%, we cope as best we can. This is not a serious criticism."
163,Sprout Social,Humbling & Exciting Place to Work!,2019-04-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working at Sprout is like being given the opportunity to work with the smartest, hardest working and most fun individuals in tech. 

In addition to the surface level benefits like lunches, happy hours, etc. the culture of Sprout is built around hard work towards a common goal sent down by the Executive Team and put into practice by everyone at the company. 

Great benefits, people & a top-rated platform for marketing teams around the world make every day exciting and gives people across all teams opportunities for personal & professional growth.","Sprout is extremely established for the size & age of the company but does still run into roadblocks and bumps in the road from time-to-time. Just your typical 'start-up' moments of moving too quickly on occasion and having to act fast on alternative solutions that can be perceived as short-minded in some instances. 

Telling friends and family that I work at Sprout almost always turns into a, 'Do you think there's a position there that I'd be a good fit for? I've heard such great things!' conversation, and as fun as that is, it sure does take up a lot of time in my conversations with them!"
164,Sprout Social,Proud to work here,2019-05-10,5.0,Account Executive,"Sprout is truly an incredible company and I feel so proud to work here. The product is the best in class dominating its competition with 27,000 Sprout fanatics. I was blown away by the kindness and humanity I was shown during the hiring process (something most companies lack surprisingly) and onboarding is so thorough! They have fostered a welcoming and inclusive culture that comes from the top down. I've never seen a nicer office in Chicago and the fact that they give their employees so much (unlimited PTO, free lunches, snacks, no micromanaging) motivates me to give 110% every day. This is a company that practices what they preach and instills strong values that reflect in its people and product. Lastly, I have the upmost respect for our CEO, Justyn Howard. He treats every person at the company, regardless of position, like they really matter and his gratitude, vision, and passion is infectious.","Sprout has had very thoughtful growth over the years. However, they are at the point where they need to start creating career growth opportunities or people will start leaving regardless of how great the company is. The Enterprise Sales team is a bit siloed and closed off from hiring internally even for top performers."
165,Sprout Social,Good place for growth,2019-04-10,5.0,Content Specialist,"The people at Sprout make it easy to jump right into the work and whenever questions arise my teammates are more than willing to help me find the answer. It is a fairly fast-paced environment (not as fast as, say, an agency) but in a ways I like that there is always something to do. 

In terms of work-load, Sprout does a good job of explaining why the work you're doing matters and how it fits into the larger scheme of things. I also enjoy the culture of feedback embedded in Sprout; people aren't afraid to give their honest opinion and it's all meant to improve upon your original work. Overall, the people at Sprout are open to new ideas and welcome feedback when processes are broken.","Transparency between teams could be improved upon. Sometimes it feels like you're working on a project that could impact multiple teams, but the right people aren't alerted to it until halfway through the project scope. 

If you're coming from an agency setting, be aware that the work-life balance may take time to get accustomed to. Some approval processes may take longer than expected and that can be frustrating when things have to move slower than you want them to."
166,Sprout Social,Sales Development Representative,2018-01-08,2.0,Sales Development,"There are always a lot of leads so your opportunity to hit quota is always high. Unlimited PTO is a bonus, free lunch, and a nice office is great too. 
The Enablement team is great and truly cares about your success at the company.","Leadership on the sales Development team should be evaluated. The team is ever changing which is fine but it usually changes to help management look better. They only care about their numbers. There’s bullying and picked favorites by one particular manager, who is also sneaky and is not transparent with leadership. More people will continue to leave this team if things do not change with management.  
Sprout is turning into the next Groupon. Hiring top many people at once and numbers are the only thing that matters. They also listen to our calls and provide real time fees back while still one the phone, it’s very distracting and unprofessional. 
There’s not a clear roadmap to promotion regardless of what they told you. They hire a lot of outside employees rather than from the inside, it’s really frustrating."
167,Sprout Social,Dream Company,2019-02-06,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"I've worked in tech for 15 years, and at Sprout I found my dream company.  The culture at Sprout is built around people who care deeply about their teammates and the customers we serve through our solution.  We celebrate diversity and encourage people to be themselves, which I believe has led to a culture of innovation, humility, and collegiality.  

Regardless of one's role on the team, everyone feels valued and looks forward to coming to work every day.   Sprout invests significantly in tools and training to help our team grow both individually and collectively, and many of the net new roles are filled through internal promotions.","Sprout has made diversity and inclusion a focus in recruiting, which has helped foster our amazing culture, but one demographic that remains fairly homogeneous is age: Most employees are in their mid 20's to early 30's, and I believe Sprout would benefit from a broader age distribution among team members.

The free in-office lunch and snacks have helped contribute to my 10-pound weight gain.  Fortunately, the in-office cold brew is calorie-free."
168,Sprout Social,Exciting and challenging workplace with great company culture,2014-06-23,4.0,Product Specialist,"The culture at Sprout Social is great. It's evident that Senior Management cares about the product and the team; that enthusiasm carries throughout the company. The work atmosphere is pretty laid back, but that isn't to say that people aren't competitive (in a good way). Co-workers are great to work with as they are friendly, smart and willing to help when needed.
Perks: ""unlimited"" vacation days, a free catered lunch every day, new office in downtown Chicago, very understanding when personal matters come up, monthly company happy hours along with other various team outings.
Management doesn't micromanage (at least not in my situation). They offer help and suggestions when needed, but otherwise, trust you to get your work done.","The lack of 401k matching (or any input into it). Doesn't really offer assistance in continued education. While I feel there is room to grow professionally at Sprout, it's not clear on what opportunities are/will be a viable option on the sales side.

For certain processes, something that shouldn't be difficult has to go through 3 or 4 people to be done."
169,Sprout Social,Strong sense of values.,2018-02-12,5.0,Software Engineer,"Strong values, one of Sprouts core values is ""open communication creates progress"" something I very much identify with and appreciate seeing is core to Sprout's mission. With any company not everything is going to be perfect, but having a strong sense values really shows how Sprout has a clear vision of the company they aspire to be and it shows through their actions.

Work / life balance, in my experience, it doesn't get any better than at Sprout, I can work from home, take time off when I need to, and call in sick without any fear of judgement. 

The company is open to change and continues to improve. I think this part is very important, even as the company grows, you can see continued re-evaluation of the company and its processes, accompanied by tweaks and improvements.","A lot of challenges with the increase in size of the company, but I like seeing all the changes that have been made to accommodate the recent growth."
170,Sprout Social,A place I'm proud to be a part of,2019-04-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The team strikes the rare balance of compassion and competency. Sprout is full of people who are kind, thoughtful and inclusive while still being incredibly smart, hard-working and resourceful. Finding all those qualities in a single person is hard - finding them in an entire team is amazing.

Thoughtfulness and intentionality are at the core of Sprout and are showcased in nearly every project and interaction I've had over my career here. I've worked at various organizations over the past decade but the executive leadership at Sprout is unmatched. They have the ability to inspire not just through their words, but the way they live their lives and manage their teams.

Simply put, I'm proud to work at Sprout and I can't wait to see what the future holds for this company.","Not a ton of cons. As we've grown quickly, implementing process has been a challenge. We need to continue to search for a way to implement smart process/structure while still leaving room for creative freedom. It is a work in progress but I have faith we'll figure it out."
171,Sprout Social,Fast-paced environment full of all stars,2017-04-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working at Sprout has changed a lot even in the past year and a half. As a company, we're experiencing a ton of growth, but it's not coming at the cost of slowed productivity or general confusion among Sprout employees. There's an open culture of collaboration and well-being - it sounds cliche but every employee at Sprout is valued and I think the company does a great job of demonstrating this (not just talking about it twice a year.) Additionally, there continues to be paths for career development. If you take your work seriously and perform at a high level, you will be recognized.

Plus, the fancy new office, free lunch choices, and stocked cafe don't hurt :)","The only 'con' that I feel important to list that Sprout is a place for people that are agile and willing to make changes on the fly.

Depending on your department, you will have a vastly different experience in regards to workload.

If you are like most people at Sprout, and willing to spend much of your time at events, eating together, working together, and troubleshooting after hours together, you will be fine.  If you just like to get your work done and go home, this likely isn't the place for you.

The training is superb, environment energizing, and the benefits and perks reign supreme!  Lots of growth opportunity, too, especially with their new ""Grow at Sprout"" program.

First and foremost, Sprout understands that to have a truly successful business, having happy employees is key. Yes, Sprout offers great benefits which is great and appreciated, but beyond that, Sprout has a lot of structures in place to ensure that its employees feel valued and fulfilled in their day-to-day work life. When a company shows that it cares for its employees, the employees are more motivated to do a great job and know that they are part of something great, and Sprout very much embodies this idea.

For new employees, there are numerous check-ins to make sure that new hires are onboarded successfully; there is a whole new hire training program to make sure employees know the product well and get a thorough introduction to the culture of the company. 

Sprout has a People team, and one of their jobs is to make sure that employees have the resources they need to do their job and to do it well. Every Sprout employee is tasked with responsibilities and then provided the resources to complete that job, which sounds simple and like common sense but is not a reality at all companies, and Sprout makes that a priority.  

Sprout cares about everyone having the resources they need to work well together, and it is an awesome feeling to work for a company that cares not just about getting things done, but about getting things done well. 

Culturally, Sprout understands the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion and has events and groups that work towards educating and promoting both of these topics. 

The office itself in Chicago is designed thoughtfully with comfortable areas where employees can go when they need a break from their desk and ways to decompress with other coworkers, like a game room. 

I feel extremely fortunate to enjoy going to work every day and knowing that I am making an impact and growing professionally and helping the company be the best that it can be.",I can't think of any cons.
180,Sprout Social,"A company built on real values with a solid product, great hold on the market and inspiring leadership.",2014-06-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Sprout clearly takes care of their people. Not only through their every day perks, but once you are in the door you are part of the family and they are committed to your success and keeping you as part of their business. They bend over backwards for their employees. Not to mention the fact that you get to work with a group of the most intelligent and diversely fun people. You are challenged every day in more ways than you could expect. If you are open to learning about how to survive in a fast growing tech environment, this is the place to be and these are the people to learn from.","When any employee shows a lack of appreciation for the company. Rarely happens, but when it does, it sticks out like a sore thumb."
181,Sprout Social,Great people. Amazing culture. Awesome office. Growing company.,2019-07-02,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"If you’re not sold on what you’ve read about Sprout Social thus far, I hope this review does.

Sprout is absolutely, hands down, a company that eats and breathes its values. However, it’s not just the values that’s making Sprout so wonderful, it’s leadership’s ability to take care of its people. Their methods are deliberately surgical and scientific and everyone is devoted to getting better from an OKR standpoint, DEI standpoint, and personal standpoint.

Yes, expectations are high and the goals encourage you to be at your best, but the 2 are sufficiently challenging, aimed at career and professional growth.

Trust me on this. Sprout is a blue-chip company to work for. Nothing compares to its level of excellence.","I wasn’t particularly happy with my base salary. However, I have no regrets whatsoever."
182,Sprout Social,Best job I've ever had,2014-06-12,5.0,Customer Support Manager,"This company really cares about each and every one of its employees. Despite a lot of growth, they still provide lunches for each of its employees every day, they have once/month all hands meetings to discuss progress and dinner/drinks are always provided. There is a strong sense of community across all departments and we often arrange our own get togethers outside of work time because there is real camaraderie among all coworkers. Young, dynamic, leading the industry. You always feel like you're contributing to the success of the company, no matter what role you're in. Lots of room for growth and adding to personal responsibilities.","Due to the rapid growth of the company, communication can sometimes get lost and changes are made without real plans in place. But lines remain open so everyone usually recovers from any minor setbacks that may occur."
183,Sprout Social,Best job I've ever had,2018-02-13,5.0,Designer,"I've worked at many companies, small and large, and Sprout Social has easily been the best job I've ever had. The culture is great, the people are great, the work is challenging, and the job is rewarding. It doesn't get much better than here. Sprout Social genuinely cares about the employees, and goes above and beyond to assure they are happy. They are continually setting up new employee programs, and focusing on career growth for everyone who works here. Sprout is very flexible for your work/life balance, as well.","While transparency is a large value at Sprout Social, I think they could continue to improve on it. It's always hard with larger companies, but it's something that Sprout could continue to work on."

-Values: people live them out. They aren't lip service.

-Systems, processes that could use slight refinement. 
-Sprout does not live by the 'move fast and break sh**' mentality.  People can be very methodical and thoughtful about important decisions, which is healthy, but at times it can slow things down, or so it seems."
185,Sprout Social,A Place to Grow,2016-02-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"You will be surrounded by very smart and motivated people. The products that you are supporting are best in class and easy to be proud of. You'll quickly realize why people here look forward to coming to work everyday. Great perks such as free lunch, yoga twice a week, a stocked snack room, and team outings. I came from a traditional corporate environment and feel more supported here through a thorough on-boarding process, and cohesive Senior Management. You'll feel like you're contributing by your second day. With hard work, everyone is empowered to make their mark here; it's an exciting time to be a part of Sprout! There is a strong culture of collaboration, hustle, and having fun in the process.",No real cons here. Perks (and potential equity) are substituted for other traditional benefits like 401-K matching which might be important to some.
186,Sprout Social,A great place for the highly ambitious,2019-04-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Sprout truly cares about its people. We have an incredible leader in Justyn and he is backed by a leadership team who truly strive to make us all better. We have a ton of perks but I truly believe the biggest differentiator is that you’ll see the value of your work from day one. Ambitious people, when supported properly, excel here.","As many have mentioned, things change often. However, if you want to help solve problems the right way, change is inevitable. If you have a positive attitude and are willing to roll up your sleeves and get things done, this might not even be a con for you. But like many companies our size, change is definitely part of our work."
187,Sprout Social,Solving Problems Together,2018-09-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Sprout really does like solving hard problems and seeking simplicity. It may seem like a small thing, but having breakfast and lunch provided everyday lightens my load of things to think about so that I can focus on solving harder problems and seeking simplicity. 
I've found the people both willing to work but also caring about each other in addition to the customers. We care deeply.
Sprout is ever-changing, which means I have literally never been bored there a day in my career. There is always something to do or learn.","It's still a business. It can be easy for employees to get caught up in the culture of care and forget that at the end of the day, we are still a business. I don't really know how to put that any other way."
188,Sprout Social,Product team @ Sprout,2016-07-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I love the open and collaborative environment at Sprout. You get to work around individuals that are driven and ""in it to win it"". 

Sprout has a ""design first"" approach to product development, which means working closely with designers and understanding UX/UI. 

Sprout is without a doubt, a team atmosphere. Engineering, Sales, and Product have a close relationship. Everyone works together on delivering the right value and product to our customers.",No cons that impact day to day work responsibilities. The office is getting too small for our size (we are growing so fast). Which means sometimes when you are getting your lunch or trying to reserve a conference room it can be a bit crowded. Everyone can't wait to move to the new office which is currently under construction.
189,Sprout Social,Dream Job,2018-09-10,5.0,Account Executive,"-Culture- I love the people I work with and the environment I work in. Sprout Social is very forward thinking and I feel at home here. 
-Direction- I feel confident in the direction of this company. I believe in the product and the customer centric approach Sprout Social takes.
Perks- I would never choose a job because it came with a stocked kitchen, fun employee outings, and a game room, but it certainly doesn't hurt.","- Things change fast. That is a plus for me. It gives me a lot of opportunity to use my problem solving skills to come up with creative solutions and I know that if something is not working today, it will change. However, the constantly evolving environment and the need to be adaptable is not for everyone."
190,Sprout Social,"Best team in the world: kind, smart, thoughtful & creative",2019-04-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people at Sprout are second to none. Our first value is ""care deeply"" and you can feel that in all aspects of the employee experience, from events to communication to day-to-day interactions with anyone on the team. Managers seek and accept honest feedback and make changes (maybe not always as fast as you'd like, but the wheels are turning). As Sprout has grown, the culture has only gotten better.","Growth is tricky and even though management/leadership is clearly very thoughtful, there are some process and communication hiccups along the way. Not unexpected when growing this quickly but, if you are joining the team, know that change is a constant."
191,Sprout Social,Great company to work for that is solving difficult problems,2015-04-04,5.0,Software Engineer,"The people and culture at Sprout Social are amazing. There's a great sense of camaraderie and respect among team members, which creates open dialogs throughout the organization. 

On the engineering team, we are challenged to solve difficult problems and are given the time to build things the right way, which is highly valuable. I like that we continually improve our day-to-day process as we see problems/inefficiencies; it's a very agile way of becoming a better group of engineers. 

Lunches, snacks and drinks are provided by the company. Monthly happy hours allow us to meet new team members and catch up with other employees over a beer.",Nothing that is specific to the company... perhaps the fact that Chicago is cold in the winter.
192,Sprout Social,"Great, smart co-workers and awesome company culture",2016-09-21,5.0,Marketing Specialist,"There's too many pros to list here, but this is a great spot for those who are a bit seasoned in their field and want to make the next step in their career. There are plenty of opportunities with growth, and they've even adjusted pretty well as a young company. Your voice is heard and it's a great spot to work across departments. You don't see that much.","Nothing really to complain about here. If you have an issue or a problem, it's addressed. People listen here, which is super nice. You could've said the 401k match, but now they are, so yeehaw!"
193,Sprout Social,Found a Perfect Fit,2019-07-05,5.0,Solutions Engineer,"I was initially very nervous to make the move; however, going through the interview process it became clearer and clearer that it would be the right one.  A few months in, I have no regrets. Sprout lives up to its values so much. And since those values are identical to mine, I feel like I've found a perfect fit for a workplace.

Pros include working with incredibly talented and smart people, having a supportive team and manager, and an environment that focuses on inclusivity. I genuinely enjoy going to work each day and doing what I do. Oh, and there's free food and such.",Sprout Seventeen is a real thing - don't go crazy on all the peanut butter m&ms.
194,Sprout Social,Product Specialist,2016-01-15,5.0,Product Specialist,"A company that genuinely cares about their employees well being and happiness... And also genuinely cares about their customers! They provide a work environment that people want to be in and a product that people want to sell, buy and use! It's kind of a dream.","Biggest downside is knowing most other companies aren't like Sprout. When/if the time comes to leave here it will be really hard. Also, I'm giving 4 stars to the career opportunities category only because there isn't (yet) a lot of upward mobility. You have the opportunity to take on more responsibility or move into a different role which better suits you- which is great. But they are extremely picky about any real promotions (which is actually a very good thing for the company)."
195,Sprout Social,"Amazing Job, Fun Company, Great Balance",2016-09-02,5.0,Software Engineer,"Strikes a perfect balance between the collaborative and supportive feel of a startup, and the stability and structure of a large company. A lot of really bright people committed to the company, but also to helping each other and growing talent in young developers. Great work-life balance, takes a ""work in whatever way is most productive for you"" approach and it pays off for both the employees and the company.","Working through the transition into a bigger company, both from a tech and an organizational perspective; possibly not ideal for some, but also can be great for someone interested in having their voice heard and shaping growth. Still a little light on benefits like 401k compared to large companies, but moving the right direction quickly."
196,Sprout Social,There's a reason the retention rate is so high!,2013-07-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been in jobs I liked and jobs I very much didn't like. Dealt with micro-managers and been thrown to the wolves. This is the first point in my career where I can honestly say I love what I do, where I do it and who I do it with.

Management - At Sprout, the senior management team has a knack for hiring bright and dedicated personalities, and they have that perfect balance of guiding you while also trusting your opinion and your ability to figure things out. Their brilliance in what they do keeps you completely confident in where the company is headed.

The Actual Work - Solving tough problems and working with smart people is so much more stimulating than I could ever explain. The ownership you're able to take on with any task you do, even when working in a team, keeps you inspired because you feel like you're making a difference in something valuable. And it doesn't go unnoticed.

Teammates - If it's not obvious from me, everyone here totally drinks the Kool-Aid and is all in. The sense of camaraderie that comes from that is incredible to be a part of. Happy hours, barbecues, and spontaneous fun events (or puppy visits) are always popping up.

Culture - In terms of culture, I can't say enough. It's great to see the mix of people walking around in shorts and tees or shirts and ties, brainstorming in beanbag chairs or sketching out ideas on a whiteboard. Catered lunches, snacks, drinks, and all the espresso and coffee you need to get started make it hard to leave at the end of the day. And ping-pong and arcade games give you the quick break you need to recharge or clear your head.","Well, sometimes it's cold, but I just keep a jacket at my desk."
197,Sprout Social,The people are amazing.,2016-02-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The thing that stands out the most about Sprout is the people. People here take pride in their work, and it shows in terms of dedication to creating great product and a strong team. I have a lot of respect for my coworkers and feel like we're constantly learning and improving. The culture and work-life balance are better than anywhere else I've worked. Family friendly, supportive and all that good stuff.","Not a lot to report here, a 401k match would be great. Because Sprout is growing so quickly, my day-to-day is always changing, which I love, but I could see that being a downside for some people."

Fair compensation. Never satisfied and always hungry mentality/culture. Everyone's ideas are welcome. Sense of trust and respect amongst colleagues.","Company is in a rapid growth stage, which comes with alot of change; if you are looking for established processes and day-to-day or are unable to adapt with change, it may be difficult to keep up.

Not alot of cons ATM."

The people and the culture they/ we create is truly awesome.  The office itself (snacks, drinks, free lunch) is pretty inspiring.  It's a very 'humble' group as well, something you don't see often in tech, especially within a company as successful as Sprout is, and will continue to be.","With opportunity, brings work. Busy times at Sprout."

202,Sprout Social,A great place to work,2018-02-12,5.0,Engineering Manager,This is the first place I've worked where I've felt that the best practices of how to run a tech company are fully embraced at all levels of the organization. The squad model of organizing teams enables the cross-functional teams to fully own their section of the product and determine how they will execute on their projects. They have monthly all hands to give company wide updates and allow employees to ask the CEO questions about the state of the business. I love that this company considers itself a business first and actually cares about its employees.,I can't think of any cons. I really enjoy working here.

I have honestly not seen this many talented and hardworking people together prior to working here. Both individual and team initiatives are highlighted and praised often, communication is very transparent and you feel like your voice is heard. 
On top of this amazing atmosphere, our office space is conveniently located downtown Chicago, walking distance to various CTA lines (Blue, Red, Brown) and buses. Not convinced of how awesome we are yet? Let's talk about the amazing benefits package, including vision, dental, health, and others. As if that wasn't enough, we also get lunch delivered to the office daily. Speaking of food, we are kept well-fed and happy here! Snacks, coffee, tea, cold brew, you name it - we probably have it! 
All Hands happen every month, and these meetings are a great opportunity for us to learn more about what other teams are working on across the organization.

The open lines of communication
1) I have a great relationship with my boss - I feel comfortable going to my manager for questions, as well as receiving/asking for candid feedback and advice. 
2) Our leadership has created an accessible work environment. If we have questions or need approval, everyone is just one email, chat, or office drop by away. 
3) We are aware of new product updates, and what's coming down the pipe. We have monthly all hands meetings where these things are explained, as well as a Q & A. In between all hands meetings, we are kept aware of all things new and exciting, via email, or through our Sprout intranet.

The company pride is incredible 
1) we all believe in the product
2) we all believe in the work we are doing
3) we all believe in each other
4) Accomplishments are celebrated company-wide

The ownership I have of my work
1) I truly feel like I make a difference here, and that what I do matters
2) I am not micromanaged, but rather trusted to do my work

Bragging Rights - #2 Best Place to work in Chicago for Millennials, according to Crain's Business Magazine
The best staff in the city","Sprout encourages talent development for its employees, but a more verbalized growth trajectory would be nice for those who intend to advance their careers."
220,Sprout Social,A job that makes me excited to come to work in the morning,2014-06-24,5.0,Dev/Design,"There is a running joke in the office that whenever the head of our HR department is asked what his favorite part of working at Sprout is, he answers: the people. And as cliche as that sounds, it couldn't be more true. The individuals on my team (and throughout the company) are interesting, motivated, understanding and very talented people that I'm lucky enough to work with on a daily basis. The management team is especially supportive and understanding of the fact  that we are people with lives that extend beyond the office. At my previous job, there was a lot of pressure not to take time off and to work ridiculous hours to show our commitment. Not so at Sprout. And as a result I feel far more committed and invested in my the company and my role. It also doesn't hurt that we have awesome perks like: monthly happy hours, daily lunch and a fully stocked snack room.

Another unique feature of Sprout is the amount of agency and trust placed in employees. I started at Sprout in a relatively junior position, but as I proved my capability, I was given progressively more challenging and interesting projects to work on. There is no strict hierarchy and people who prove that they are capable and motivated are rewarded and given additional opportunities regardless of their seniority. I feel very rewarded by the breadth of projects that I'm allowed to work on, and I'm never bored.","As with many start-ups, there are not always clear processes in place when embarking on new projects. And while it can be exciting for forge new ground, it can also be a bit chaotic. That being said, I have very few things to complain about."
221,Sprout Social,"Great Culture, Amazing Growth plus Ping-Pong!",2014-06-24,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great people, great culture. Team regularly gets together for happy hours and team outings. There is a young enthusiasm in the office and very little corporate red-tape. Decision-making is agile and employees have opportunity to make decisions and have an impact without supervisors micro-managing your every move. People genuinely care about the success of the company as a whole and are committed to helping each other achieve great things.","Little opportunity for career advancement, but this is mostly due to the size of the company at the moment. There could be more formal planning and strategic development for current employees to help prepare them for expanding roles in the company as it grows as well as in their respective fields/careers."
222,Sprout Social,It All Comes Down to Sprout Social's Work Culture,2016-10-05,4.0,Customer Success Manager,"Sprout Social is an amazing place to work because of its people. Everyone at the company is nice and supportive of each other with one goal in mind. This is in no small part thanks to our CEO and wonderful executive team. They understand what it takes to motivate, but also keep things fun and light so work is somewhere you want to be each day.

It also helps that Sprout fosters a very open work environment through inter-department activities like Hack Week and after-hour company events / volunteering.","If there's anything I'd say needs improvement, it would be the company's focus on career development. The company very recently began bi-annual performance reviews, so things are trending in the right direction. 

Sprout continues to be a free flowing, start up type of business with all hands on deck. I'm sure it will get to a place where roles are better defined and employee growth becomes a priority."
223,Sprout Social,IT,2016-10-05,5.0,IT,"Sprout Social DOES what other companies only say.
* Sprout Social DOES have an open door policy with leadership.
* Sprout Social DOES support employee growth.
* Sprout Social DOES give you the tools you need for professional success. 
* Sprout Social DOES champion healthy activities, regard family time, and institute community outreach programs.","Sprout Social takes on the challenge of doing things that have never been done before.
That culture requires agile employees who have a high tolerance to change.
A Con for some, a Pro for others."
224,Sprout Social,Great place to work!,2017-03-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Sprout has been a fantastic place to learn and grow in my career.
- opportunities to do/build new things
- great benefits package (that keeps growing as the company and team grow)
- smart, fun, driven colleagues
- the office is SO NICE",There aren't many to point to.  Something the team continues to think about is how to scale communication as we grow - a natural challenge in growth that it is clear they continue to tackle.  Keep on going!
225,Sprout Social,Business Development Representative,2017-04-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I love the team I work on,  both managers are the best I have ever worked with. 
The opportunity to grow within the team and at Sprout is definitely there
This a sales person dream job, in my opinion","We are a growing team, which is great but with growth comes changes. Almost every month we go through a change, but it's not necessarily for the bad... things are just not always consistent.... you have to be okay with change!!!"
226,Sprout Social,Awesome people. Awesome opportunities.,2017-10-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Sprout Social has an amazing culture that promotes inclusiveness, opportunities, challenging experiences and a ton of fabulous perks. I've been at Sprout for a little over 6 months and have already experienced a ton of professional growth. The immediate group of people I work with are all incredibly smart and motivated, but beyond that every person that I've come in contact with is always looking to support in finding the right solution and pitching in. It has been an incredible experience so far to contribute to the work at Sprout Social!",I don't have any cons!
227,Sprout Social,Literally the best place to work,2019-05-10,5.0,Solutions Engineer,"Working alongside extremely smart and creative people who are genuinely kind hearted and fun. 

Steady growth in the product and company with typical speed bumps but handled with care 

Flexible work/life balance 

Ability to work with people across departments and explore areas of interest","With the growth of the company we (sales) have experienced changes in process, pay structure and product merger. All need to happen and can be challenging at first, but need to happen for betterment of the bottom line."
228,Sprout Social,The best place I've ever worked.,2017-11-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"You can get ahead. You're going to have to work your tail off, but you can advance your career.

Management is absolutely capable, thoughtful, and intelligent in their decision making. Changes are not made just for change's sake.

The teamwork here is otherworldly.

Managers are willing to talk things through.

You're expected to of course do your job, but you're also given autonomy and reign to work on other projects to build skills, relationships, and career bridges to other teams.

The transparency from management is like nothing I've ever seen. They say they'll be transparent, but you can actually see the decisions being made and the why behind it.

This is a plus/minus as addressed below, but Sprout is cautious. They will not play with your life and let you dangle on a project or team that isn't working. They'll work tirelessly to help make the project work or help you move to the next thing internally.

I really could go on and on, but Sprout is a place for you to grow yourself personally while also carving out a career path that works for you.","There are politics hidden within the fabric of the organization. They say it's not there, but you have to play the game (which is true anywhere).

Things move slllllllllllllloooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. If you're trying to run through your career progression, try your hand at a smaller company. Sprout has things figured out and will take their time before just running forward. It's a good thing because they're going to help you make the right moves at the right times with the right data, but you're going to have to wait. Patience is more than a virtue."
229,Sprout Social,Pretty Close to Perfect,2019-02-12,5.0,Anonymous,"- The whole tech start up vibe (snacks, cool office, fun activities outside the office, etc.)
 - I've found upper management to be surprisingly open to hearing from new employees
 - They really care about their employees. If you're willing to spend the time to work on yourself, and to voice any concerns, they are happy to work with you.","No company is perfect. Scaling is hard for all companies. Sprout is definitely growing quickly, which can lead to some of those common issues. But the team is aware and working hard on mitigating those issues."
230,Sprout Social,One of the Best,2019-03-14,5.0,Staff Software Engineer,"Sprout offers all of the nice perks that you would expect from any modern tech company. They also offer a few nicer ones like free lunch and truly flexible hours. They also offer the standard benefits package: 401k matching, parental leave, good insurance, etc.

When it comes to culture, Sprout is one of the best. Many people like to complain that we have culture issues but I wholeheartedly disagree. Sprout's people and ethos is one of the best I've seen – these are good people with good values. I do believe that we have some implementation issues and – like every company – we can always do better, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a place where you are more welcome and accepted.

Sprout also gives you room to explore and to go above and beyond your responsibilities. Those who do are rewarded with everything from raises and promotions to trips around the world (if you happen to win a Sprout Value Award).

Finally, and most importantly, Sprout cares about YOU. They want you to do well not only at Sprout right now, but they care about you in the future as well, even if you're elsewhere. Life sometimes gets in the way and nobody understands that more than the people of Sprout.

I could go on forever but the bottom line is that while Sprout isn't perfect, they're one of the best out there, and they're getting better every day.","Sprout is improving in this regard, but we often have a hard time handling employees who aren't meeting expectations, and sometimes they can affect good teams.

While Sprout does offer an extreme amount of flexibility in your work, you have to choose to go after it likely won't be offered to you. If you're self-motivated you'll do extremely well. If not, you will find that it's difficult to get what you want.

Sprout is no longer a small startup. We have offices in multiple cities and remote employees across the world.  There's nothing inherently wrong with growth but along with growth comes process and loss of agility."
231,Sprout Social,"Laid-back, fun atmosphere with lots of little things to keep you happy",2015-04-08,4.0,Software Engineer,"- Great product, easy to get behind the company mission
- Regular all-hands meetings where you get to see/hear from the C-level folks
- Not a lot of bureaucratic red tape
- Provided lunch is pretty good, as is the snack room
- All the caffeine you could want
- The office location is great, very convenient to CTA bus/L lines
- Great benefits package and the marginal cost of adding family onto dental/vision is incredibly low","Personally, these all carry less weight than the pros (hence the overall positive rating):
- Quiet atmosphere doesn't encourage socialization or communication
- Company organization leads to silos
- Hiring proces is a little disorganized
- Internal IT seems a little lacking for a tech company"
232,Sprout Social,Best decision ever!,2016-03-31,5.0,Product Specialist-LatAm,"I've been working here for about 6 months now and continue to be impressed by the support and culture of the company. I am part of a team that is just getting started and there are a lot of unknowns. That being said, we have received support from the top down the entire way. Could not be more grateful for this job!",No cons. Theres been a huge learning curve in our market but I think we continue refining our sales process and have the support from our manager to strategize to figure out what works.
233,Sprout Social,Superb Workplace,2017-03-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Sprout has an excellent culture that helps cultivate an environment of collaboration and work-life balance while doing excellent work.,"The company does a great job at addressing weaknesses, so I don't have any cons to list!"
234,Sprout Social,Highlight of my professional career.,2014-06-19,5.0,Product Specialist,"A startup culture with a mature foundation. Things tend to run like a well-oiled machine, but there's still enough change and growth to keep it exciting. Free snacks and lunch, fun games, company outings/parties are genuinely fun. It's a great blend between the wild startup and organized corporation.

Everyone is friendly and helpful (I can't recall a single negative interaction with anyone), and we are all treated as equal parts of a very large family by our peers and upper management. The familial aspect is really great. I've never been a part of such a close-knit team who like each other so much.

Our customers love us and we have a stellar product. It makes it delightful to speak to most new customers. The work is challenging, but not overbearing. It's awesome to be a part of such a rapidly growing company that is building something people love to use.

Work-life balance is hugely respected, and vacation/time-off policy is very flexible as long as you're performing.

Opinions are respected. Questions are encouraged. Upper management is transparent and makes changes quickly if something isn't working out.","Things can be a little slow to start when first joining the team, and there tends to be a lot of sitting around until things ramp up. Once you're up to speed, though, you stay busy.

The work in sales isn't always exciting (writing emails all day), and some variation would be nice to make sure we don't fall into lulls.

Communication between teams could improve to make sure everyone's always on the same page. Very important for the Sales team to stay consistent in their message.

A clearer path for growth would be welcome."
235,Sprout Social,Truly a Life-Changing Opportunity,2016-06-08,5.0,,"Signing my contract at Sprout will go down as one of the best decisions I've ever made. During my tenure at the company I've been able to work on some incredibly rewarding projects, learn from some truly smart individuals and make some of my closest friends. Sprout actually cares about personal growth and has helped me grow both personally and professionally.",No cons that I can think of.
236,Sprout Social,Ideal Workplace,2019-04-22,5.0,Account Executive,"The company focused on hiring good people and it shows. 

Been here for over 3 years and the company has nearly tripled in size. The culture that made this place attractive when I first started has been retained and even elevated. 

This place cares about its employees just as much as it cares about its customers. 

Positive working environment, a team that enables individuals to be successful, to learn, to grow, to develop, and to do good work — all while fostering and encouraging everyone to just be themselves.  

The benefits, which at many companies seem superficial, make a huge difference (generous PTO policy and parental leave, premium insurance options, 401k match, free lunch/snacks/drinks)

If you are looking for a working environment where one can grow and where one is not confined by norms of what a cookie cutter employee does for their organization, this is the place for you. Sprout lets you make your experience what you want. 

In the three years I have been here, I have been able to learn new skills that I previously had zero experience in, mastered those skills, and was given the comfortability/encouragement to identify an area for improvement within the organization and created an entire new role/team. 

Great place to work","Because it is still a relatively young company and because it works in an industry that literally changes every day, there is constant change and a sense of unpredictability — things that are not for everyone. 

Because of this fact, there often aren't fully flushed our processes for every single initiative and things are often rolled out that might not be 100% thought out. If you are looking for a process or answer to every detail, this may not be the best working environment for you, because you will be left looking for answers that do not always exist and frustrated that initiatives that impact your role are not 100% perfect. 

It's and ever evolving and ever changing work environment and the only constant is change. This can be fun and exciting for some; confusing and frustrating for others. 

Only other con is that career opportunities are not as prevalent as one might see in a more traditional company. Despite coming a long way from where we used to be in terms of career growth and opportunity, there can often seem to be a ceiling of where you career can go as an individual contributor if you are not interested in management. But if you have an open mind, you can create your own career path here. Definitely an area the company is improving upon though."
237,Sprout Social,Working @ Sprout Social > Working @ an Advertising Agency,2019-05-13,5.0,Enterprise Customer Success Manager,"I have spent the past 10 years of my career in the trenches working tireless hours in account management at an advertising agency. The last 2 of those years was constant contemplation about leaving advertising and going elsewhere...but during that time, continuously wondered how my skills would translate to a completely new industry and IF I found something, would I have to work my way from the bottom up?

While searching for a new job, I came across an open position within Sprout's Enterprise Customer Success Team and noticed skills in a customer success role are parallel to that of  account management. I applied, interviewed, got the job and WILL NEVER LOOK BACK!

I have been at Sprout for a little over a year and it has been the best decision I have ever made...Here are my top 5: 

1) Sprout Cares Deeply
- Whether it's being completely available for Q&A during the interview process, to sending a care package after you've been hired w/ hand written notes from your new teammates, to making sure you're fully on-boarded and prepared to start your new role w/ a 2 week bootcamp training course, to ensuring you're fully comfortable in your new role before being introduced to your customers, to having all the resources at your fingertips to ensure success!! I can go on and on, but the point is Sprout cares deeply and is invested in YOU and YOUR individual success!

2) Work/Life Balance
- While work/life balance is always hard to find, Sprout is fully dedicated to ensuring everyone is able to leave the office  by 5PM...No one is to schedule an internal meeting past 4PM to leave the 4 - 5PM hour time for you to wrap up for the day!

3) Peers/Management/Leadership
- The people at Sprout are awesome (literally EVERYONE)...I guess being in a happy environment make for happy people!

4) Career Growth/Opportunities 
- Sprout allows you opportunity for growth by setting clear expectations/goals to get you to the next level; bi-annual reviews are a requirement to track success and a continuous feedback loop with your manager is encouraged prior to those more formal reviews. 

5) Benefits  
- Unlimited PTO...YES you actually take it...the team is SOO flexible with taking time off whenever you need it
- The office is incredible...snacks everywhere, movie theater, game room, cold brew, beer and kombucha on tap (oh and free lunch...everyday! the Sprout 15 is a real thing)
- Parental leave @ 4 months 100% pay (coming from an agency that provided 1 week of maternity leave, this was a HUGE plus for me)",Honestly there is not much I can say as a con about Sprout...I challenge anyone to try to find a better place to work!!
238,Sprout Social,"Brilliant, well-led company",2018-04-07,5.0,Senior Account Executive,This company is product forward. Everything we update or change has the customer in mind. Leadership is humble but aggressive. This is the best company I’ve worked for.,"Getting a little too process heavy on the sales side. Little too many hoops to jump through to really get the job done. That said, this is a minor thing. And I think it’s part of the growing pains — we are growing at a pretty great clip."
239,Sprout Social,Sprout Social is a dream job for those that haven't had a good one before.,2014-07-11,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Sprout has a great vibe. A great location in the City. It has some very hard working employees. You get company laptops in just about any position (Macs usually) that you're free to use at home. There is tons of growth, and you are more or less free to push your own opinions into any process. 

Engineering can be wild-west at times (meaning you have freedom to create). Extremely flat culture with little management intervention. The hiring process is very strict and the code is typically without much baggage (since most of it is so new). There are many exciting new products and avenues for learning (including a fully stocked library of tech books). You are free to setup your 'station' however you like it with just about as much hardware as you want. Most engineers are running MacBookPros with 16GB ram and Core-i7 hardware so there is little to complain about that.

Free lunches.","If you have a family, consider another company. There is no Dental or Vision company pay for family healthcare, leading to hundreds a month for that coverage on top of the hundreds you're already paying for the healthcare. While many employees have families and there is a lot that are expecting, many in charge do not have children yet; so don't expect any family catering (there is no discrimination; but late meetings and non-family events are common). You have 1 option for 401k and there is 0 contribution. Don't expect bonuses, they are rare and pay-raises are extremely unlikely as the company tries to incur grow. Pay on that note is very low compared to competitors in the same space as well as companies with comparable jobs; as much as 15% below market from others on GlassDoor.

Leadership really likes to be very secretive. Expect to be annoyed by decisions that will affect you without ever being told a reason for them. It's much easier to get ahead if you hang out with the management teams; because when they like you, you're work matters less (hence favoritism)."
240,Sprout Social,GREAT place to be!,2015-04-08,5.0,Relationship Manager,"Sprout is a GREAT place to work. I love everything about this place. The culture and the people are a huge reason that keeps me coming back! (Have I mentioned free lunch?)

Additionally, the leadership is amazing. I'm grateful for my experience and the opportunity to work with managers who care so much about their team members. It's rare that a CEO will pull you into his/her office to make sure you're happy and get your input on organizational changes, but it illustrates Sprout's focus on culture (and that starts at the top).

253,Sprout Social,Not the company it used to be,2018-09-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Provided food and snacks
- Nice coworkers - although many of them are leaving
- Unlimited PTO and flexible work hours","- Lip service to Diversity and Inclusion while numbers are stagnating or dropping

- Professional development, learning, mobility and career opportunities are all drying up within the company. Upper management often says within engineering that you can rotate to different teams just by making a request. However, from what I observed people who desperately wanted to move for interpersonal, morale, and career reasons were denied transfers, and people who offered feedback or asked for help were transferred off of teams they liked. It increasingly feels like honest feedback and good faith attempts to ask for help are punished by upper management. Career opportunities at Sprout exist, but they are not accessible to everyone.

- Sprout grew too fast in 2017 and then acquired another company. They had no scaling plan in place. Staffing decisions for which roles were hired for and when made little sense. There are not enough engineering managers to go around.

- Extreme extraversion bias and an open office where people are packed in small zones next to wide open areas with no people. It creates an artificially dense atmosphere that's very loud and distracting, which is simply unnecessary given the square footage of the office.

- Intense micromanagement

- Adherence to the party line and placating upper management seems to be more important than actually getting work done

- Constant career band ""recalibration"" makes it feel like the goalposts for doing an adequate job are always shifting"

349,Sprout Social,Promoting based on who knows who and tenure,2020-09-15,3.0,Support,It used to be good until there was a change in (middle) management .,"Promoting someone who has no tested people management experience to be a Team Lead, then a Team Manager very shortly afterwards is a complete disservice to the values the company should live by.

This specific person has very evident favoritism to their off work friends. One of their friends even got hired on their third try to apply to Sprout, guess when? When the friend became a Team Lead who by the way, referred that person, too.

This person takes out personal vendetta to people who don't always agree with their point of view. In the shroud of ""wanting people to grow"", they go out of their way to find loop holes to target the person they don't like. QC reviews? Yes, they're not even random!

Meanwhile, their friends go on about doing ""new"" projects and gets praises when those projects were just rehashed from other team members' previous projects. Just changed some charts and colors and stuff and voila! Her friends get more kudos from the top.

People are afraid to speak up because they might lose their jobs as some already did. This person is very connected (even knows Justyn) and has been with the company for a very long time. (""They act as if they're superior"" - a feedback from someone outside the team who was just asking them politely via Slack.) It would be their word against this person's word. And we've seen it happen. There's not much of a fighting chance for anyone who goes against them."

352,Sprout Social,Customer Development Account Executive,2019-07-26,4.0,Customer Development Account Executive,"I was lucky enough to transition from the Chicago team to the Dublin/EMEA team 

I've been able to travel all around Europe the past couple of months and the work-life balance is incredible for that.",There are definitely growing pains but everything has been getting solved fairly quickly and we've been able to ramp from a 5 person EMEA team in Nov 2018 to 40+ May 2019
353,Sprout Social,New Rocket Ship,2019-01-18,5.0,Account Executive,"I recently joined Sprout as a member of their first European Team being established here in Dublin. 

Sprout has six core values that it applies to all the decisions that are made and these hang proudly in our offices:-

Care Deeply
Embrace Accountability 
Champion Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
Promote Open, Authentic Communication
Seek Simplicity
Solve Hard Problems
Celebrate Change

As a startup within a startup, we are a group of strangers from different tech companies and experiences that have organically grown together to create a very special environment here in Europe.

The platform is beautifully designed with the highest G2Crowd reviews within our space. Customers can trial for 30 days, which means most of my time is spent demonstrating to inbound interest with some outbound to compliment the day to day.

Local management sits beside Us and is available to support whenever required, meet customers, talk through deal strategy, plan my career development at Sprout and also beyond.","This is a start-up environment and as such you need to be able to operate as such with a growth mindset. As a company it Sprout is amazing, we are just from our company kick off in Chicago after a week together and the HQ Team made us feel so welcome!"
354,Sprout Social,"Great career move, great mentors, great opportunities",2019-05-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"From the ground up the company is full of good, intelligent and caring people on top of a world class product. The training and career progression is an amazing opportunity as is the chance to work with so many influential mentors. They are also very invested in developing current employees be it to promotion, or cross departmental career changes etc. Entire experience from first interview to ongoing employment has been a pleasure to go through, and I've had facetime with all 4 founders when in head office for onboarding, they also visit EMEA for face to face time.","EMEA office is in a start up mindset as it's the new flagship outside of USA, so if you are happy to work in that environment it is perfect, but it does mean we are changing and adding things as we go, and there is some difficulties in having to rely on USA for everything with time and culture differences."
355,Sprout Social,Great team to work with. Sprout Social does an amazing job at making their employees feel valued!,2016-10-05,5.0,,"- The entire team is great to work with. They're comprised of very smart and funny individuals who really care about their jobs. They're all very dedicated, motivated and helpful; they help you improve in your job. The overall company culture is great and everyone is recognized for their accomplishments.
- Flexible PTO policy. There's no specified maximum number of PTOs you can file. 
- Competitive salary
- Each employee gets their own Apple computer
- Streamlined processes on how to address work issues. In my department, there's a dedicated time for each employee to do a one on one meeting with their manager, discussing any concerns and any areas of improvement (both are two-way). This is especially helpful in developing as a team and as an individual
- The founders of the company have long-term plans and are dedicated to continually making the product evolve along with the industry. The founders are also very approachable and don't feel like traditional ""bosses"" at all","Due to understandable reasons, benefits are not the same for remote employees compared to on-site employees"
356,Sprout Social,When companies get it right...,2019-06-23,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"Where do I begin?
- The PEOPLE. They managed to find all of the best kinds of people and bring them to Sprout Social. The culture is amazing. I am happy going in to this office everyday because the people I am surrounded by are positive and give me energy!
- The Management Team. It really doesn't seem to matter your age, seniority level or experience. Everyone is equal here. I've had 1-1 conversations with the CEO and I am very new to the company.
- The company is continuously investing in our training, education and professional development.
- Sprout Social constantly re-invests into the product and into customer support. The result? Happy customers and great reviews. Sprout Social has a reputation for this in particular and it makes working for the company so much better.",Honestly I can't think of any cons. The company is at a really great stage of growth at the moment. It is fast paced and every day brings new challenges but I love it.
357,Sprout Social,Best Place to Work with the Best Bunch of People,2016-07-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Joining Sprout has been my best decision ever. It was a budding start-up back then on 2012, but it had all the attributes of making it bigger and grand. Sprout not only has grown into one of the fastest technology companies, but has also cared for its employees during this aggressive journey. I can strongly vouch that the senior management along with our CEO is personally vested in the growth and development of the team and the company. I am truly indebted to all the support through these years for both my personal and professional journey with Sprout.",The only thing I can think here is about having more presence in the International market and opening up more offices worldwide. Then our employees can have a chance of working overseas and participate in employee exchange programs globally.
358,Sprout Social,#HomeSproutHome,2019-05-01,5.0,Customer Advocate,"For context, I came from a 1k+ operation where everyone was a number to a connected family that looks after each other. Even with my past experience prior to the operation I was working with, Sprout Social's standard is incomparable. It's one big happy family, all pulling on the same rocket ship to deliver an outstanding software to people who are looking to bridge an authentic line of communication between their company and their fans.

Work wise, everything is manageable as long as you are true, dedicated and passionate about what you do. The company goes above and beyond to support your work/life balance and provides you with flexible options for work time and workplace. Also, there is no learning curve. Due to how the start-up nature of the company, you are consistently learning and it is always the case that you find yourself adding more and more experience to both the product and your core work.  That's why everyone in Sprout is ""Always be growing"".

In a nutshell, you are given all the resources needed to do your job: hardware, software, coaching, peer support, communication, documentation. All it takes from your end is to be involved and to look forward to pull in the same direction. Given the nature of this company, that shouldn't be a problem.

Perks wise, training is done in Chicago for 3 weeks, flight and accommodation provided, then back at the office in Dublin. The office is great! Lunch provided through Deliveroo, so you you'd be able to order what you want. Snacks also available in the office and we occasionally have the traditional beer o'clock throughout the week.

Improvement is easy to suggest, you have a direct link to engineers via internal tools and it really feels that your work is truly building this software over and over again. 

All in all, work here is meaningful and fun!","Ramp up may depend on personal ability to assimilate a large volume of information. Sometimes, some processes may be vague, but luckily you have other team members you can rely on for support."
359,Sprout Social,Best employer ever,2016-04-20,5.0,Customer Advocate,"- I'm working remote for Sprout Social, but I don't feel isolated AT ALL as my colleagues and bosses make it a point to touch base with me on a personal level and gets me involved in regular meetings and trainings! 

- Management is proactive in their new employees' learning process. Experienced this firsthand!",Can't think of any as there are none!
