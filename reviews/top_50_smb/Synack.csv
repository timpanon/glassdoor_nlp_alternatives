0,Synack,Great company,2022-03-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great vision and direction. They really do hire the best people.,There are no cons that I can think of.
1,Synack,Changing for the worse,2022-03-26,1.0,Sales,"Some good people in IC roles. Solution is better than that of its competitors. Company does have good focus on DEI. Decent benefits.

I believe in its ultimate mission of its security solution. I really want things to work out for me here because of that.","- Culture is changing. I felt a much better vibe when I started. Management makes reactionary decisions rather than keeping their eye on the ball.

-Good people have left or are leaving. This happens at every company, but it's happening for the wrong reasons within the last year. 

-The human part of HR is lost on that team. 

-Superficial leaders. They'll tell you what you want to hear but operate in a way that does not reflect what they say."
2,Synack,"Good place to Grow, success determined by region",2022-03-24,4.0,Account Executive,"Decent location when office was open, awesome co-workers, decent pay",your territory 100% defines your success here. Some reps haven't sent a cold email in years and hit their numbers while others have to scrap and scrape to get meetings.
3,Synack,Don't waste your time,2022-03-15,1.0,Senior Program Manager,Nothing that I can think of!!,"The leadership has lost its vision. The product is really a service not a Saas as they are trying to portray. The new HR team is destroying this company. The first time I have ever seen the HR team really only working for the higher management's benefits. 
High turn over, low morale, low transparency. The pay is lower than market standard. Just don't waste your time."
4,Synack,Awesome Company to work for !!,2022-02-14,5.0,Solutions Architect,They value their employees and treat them with dignity and respect,Still small but growing rapidly :)
5,Synack,Burning cash,2022-03-16,1.0,Product Manager,"Startup perks like food, snacks, etc","Unrealistic shifting goals

7,Synack,Great Environment,2021-11-08,5.0,Software Engineer,"The people, culture, environment, and future.",Nothing to report. Great place.
8,Synack,"2 years later, still the best decision I made",2021-01-07,5.0,Technical Operations Manager,"* Really cares about people (seriously)
* Flexible in finding ways to utilize employees unique talents, rather than putting them in a ""box"" for the hired role
* Very open and transparent company- accepts input and recommendation from anyone, regardless of seniority, and open to making changes to improve
* The sense of purpose here is phenomenal. Everyone I work with legitimately believes in the mission and takes pride in the work they do. It's incredibly rewarding to be so exposed to the front lines of cybersecurity and watch clients strengthen and become more resilient to cyberattack.
* Can be fully remote! Which was very effective during the pandemic and allowed us to grow during that time rather than downsize.","* Been a startup for a while, so some small growing pains as the company expands"
9,Synack,Couldn't ask for a better place to work,2021-01-05,5.0,Security Program Manager,"- great co-workers
- get to work from home 
- feedback is heard from leadership and noticeable changes are made in a timely manner
- company transparency
- great company promo items and monthly care boxes from HR and marketing","- on rare occasions, the job is required to work outside of business hours ( its the nature of the business)
- as the company expands the org structure is constantly shifting too (so if you are not flexible these can be frustrating)"
10,Synack,"Great company, great people",2021-09-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Everyone is excited about what their work, and overall people are exceptionally nice to work with","Benefits could be better, but they are getting better over time"
11,Synack,Great momentum - A Place Where You Want To Work,2021-01-07,5.0,Inside Sales Executive,"Solid pay, very pleased with leadership both in the field and inside sales orgs, Amazing and relevant product and service which is fun to sell and provides clear value to customers who also love it and continue to purchase. Even as a growing company with constant change, customer attainment and retention is a priority and leadership/org doesn't let process prevent a sale from happening. Work/Life balance is in the forefront, Perks are great and for a company of our size, still has a start-up vibe.","Constant hiring and high growth targets, but the leadership and process is in place to help with hitting those - product innovation and enhancements, good people, direction for the future as well."
12,Synack,"Great People, Rough edges internally",2021-10-11,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Everyone is super helpful at synack, truly friendly people",They have not appropriately scaled for their growth in any department. Sales team is great and the infrastructure is falling behind their selling.
13,Synack,"Smooth Hiring Process, Strong Mission, Committed Individuals, Great Company Culture",2021-04-05,5.0,Senior Recruiter,"I am so thrilled and grateful to have joined Synack. The decision was an easy one for me once I met several interviewers during my hiring process. Synack's mission is strong, committed, engaged team members, all with strong values!! I am so happy to be a part of a diverse group of talented individuals. I look forward to growing with Synack this year and the years to come!

Pro's

* As an engineer, the work is not boring and we can see impact of our work with the customers. Learning is very important to me and I have been able to move around to gain more experience across engineering teams.
* Working with golang/google cloud platform, and learning some of the latest ways to prevent security vulns in software.
* I've been at other companies where engineering leadership is not very technical and they don't know what's going on. At Synack, our engineering managers and even our CTO is involved in architecture working groups.
* Remote work culture is very collaborative","* Fast paced environment where priorities do change often
* Some teams hold too many meetings"
15,Synack,"Finally! A company ""that walks the walk and talks the talk"".",2021-03-09,5.0,Solutions Architect,"If you are looking to join a team/company full of impact and mission driven people that want to accomplish great things for their customers, all while improving their skills, Synack is the place for you!","If you struggle with ambiguity, this company may not be the best fit for you. As Synack is experiencing growth, you may often have to wear multiple hats and assume additional job duties than those outline in your specific job role. This can be great for some, not for others."
16,Synack,A level of talent and excellence matched by few.,2020-09-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"-You will work with people who are smarter than you and learn something new each day
-The mission of the company is clear and work is directly tied to making it happen
-Career paths are well defined and individual goals/interests are supported
-Culture, even while remote, is strong","-Like any mature startup, sometimes processes or resources are lacking (but they are always being worked on and improving)"
17,Synack,Caring to Do the Right Thing ... Matters,2021-01-21,5.0,Director of Community,"- Passionate colleagues who care about making a difference, being inclusive and inspiring greatness within and outside the organization.
- Infinite opportunity to influence company / product direction from any role
- Direct applicability and relevance in exploding cybersecurity space (always exciting) from from any role","- With numerous opinions/passions, comes competing ideas ... this can be difficult to navigate and balance at times to realize progress
- Middle-management layer is relatively new and needs time to grow into responsibilities/role ubiquitously across all teams in the organization.
- Cybersecurity space is non-stop rollercoaster ... and can lead to intense spikes of urgency not always able to be managed effectively."
18,Synack,An Honest Review: I will change this if I ever feel otherwise,2021-01-07,5.0,Technical Operations Engineer,"At one point just like you, I was reading all the negative reviews on this site and stressing out before accepting my job offer. I was nervous about management not listening to the employees and shooting down feedback left and right. I was scared the company was failing because of refusal to learn & accept feedback.

They must have caught wind of those bad reviews or something because there are company-wide open-discussions weekly where we can ask our execs whatever's on our minds in front of the whole company, or anonymously. I've found that everyone I've worked with is receptive to feedback. I haven't met one dismissive person yet, and this is probably the first company I've ever worked for that I actively want to stay with after working here a year.

- Excellent benefits
- Salary is as expected for job role/experience, & definitely above average when considering other compensation that may be available
- Sense of purpose. I directly see my role translate to the company succeeding
- Highly-technical & awesome-personality co-workers 
- People here know how to learn and change quickly in order to see success
- Work from home whenever you want/need to
- Growing company; exciting times. Everyone is amped-up
- Cares about employees 
- Actually working to improve diversity & inclusion. A lot of companies just have one meeting and that's it. Synack has a committee bringing in top-tier knowledgable people in an open-forum almost monthly.","Okay, I'm really grasping at straws here, but I came up with some:

- Being a growing company is a double-edged sword. Plenty of growing pains. Not a huge deal though when you work with people who learn to adapt quickly.
- As with any company that sells anything, customers can be difficult at times
- Funding for professional development classes/courses/conferences doesn't really exist yet. (Yet. Keep in mind this is a relatively-young private company.)
- No office currently due to COVID reasons. We used to get lunches paid for, but I expect that may come back whenever we decide to get an office. Also I can't be around my awesome co-workers in person which is a big bummer at the moment.
- Highly-specialized position. A lot of the work my role does is only applicable experience for working in a crowdsourced penetration testing company. This con will vary from role-to-role."
19,Synack,Banner Year,2020-12-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"2020 has arguably been one of the toughest years on record for most companies, but for Synack, it felt like our year to shine. Weâ€™ve navigated the headwinds and made tremendous progress on product development, hired a ton of talented people, and we continue to knock down impressive customer wins. The team seems to be more aligned than ever, and the management team has done a great job keeping the culture intact in a remote world. Iâ€™m truly proud to be part of this company.",Keep up the momentum - feels like our trajectory is clearer than ever.
20,Synack,"Amazing Company, Great Leadership, and Tons of Upside!!",2021-04-20,5.0,Sales Director,Amazing company with extremely strong leadership. Everyone is a team player with intent to help customers with the #1 Crowdsourced Offering on the market.,"Growing Pains, within operations, but expected challenges as they continue to scale upwards."
21,Synack,Terrific Organization from Top to Bottom,2020-12-21,5.0,Sales,"You learn a lot about leadership during challenging times. The exec team is adaptive, compassionate, disciplined and focused and they have managed through the toughest year in a lifetime like a role model to be admired. Caring for the individuals, making proper strategic investments and doing so with a smile, I cannot think of a better place to be than right here. Comp, benefits, culture, relevancy and social awareness in a package.","If you can't take the excitement, there is always a career in accounting."
22,Synack,Greatest company ever worked for with unique offering,2021-01-05,5.0,Solutions Architect,"Great culture, great management and unique services.

23,Synack,Couldn't be a better experience,2021-05-20,5.0,Sales Director,They are doing the right things early in the company by building the pillars needed to make this a very profitable enterprise.,Growing pains would be the biggest thing but that is expected
24,Synack,Great culture with lots of upside,2021-01-07,5.0,Product Designer,"Working at Synack offers lots of upside. The cybersecurity space is increasingly relevant and the company's outlook is great. From a product org perspective, it's a relatively flat structure with solid leadership that values input equally from from product management, design and engineering. Outside of the product org, the company is filled with amazing employees and leaders that are eager to help and provide feedback. Above all, it's refreshing to be contributing towards a company that is making a positive impact in the world.",None to call out at this time.
25,Synack,Fun company with great culture!,2021-01-05,5.0,Sales,"Great work from home support, Good company for those coming from the military, Very supportive of diversity in the workplace and actively working on social injustice issues.",None.

All the good a startup can offer.",Lots of changes to the product team. The vast majority of the product team is from one common company (same company as the head of engineering and product) in the past with no prior security experience. This can make life very tough for some engineers
38,Synack,A place where initiative is rewarded,2021-01-07,5.0,Security Program Manager,"Everyone of your peers is highly motivated, experienced, and driven. Overall the work culture is great, the job is rewarding, and you are certainly never bored. Feedback is not only heard, it is acted upon.",I can't think of any cons.

46,Synack,Best Learning experience and some of the best people to work with!,2020-08-08,4.0,Anonymous Employee,I have worked at Synack for a little more than 4 years on the Engineering side. I have had the opportunity to grow here in terms of responsibilities as well as the new learnings. Synack has some of the best people I have worked with and are always helpful. Here you are free to explore more and also make any improvements as required which helps not only in self-learning but also taking the team along with you. There is a real good work-life balance and people are amazing.,"As a typical start-up, there are cons like work pressure (at times) and some of the processes are ignored while trying to achieve something bigger, which in later stages haunt back."

49,Synack,A Fulfilling and Entrepreneurial  Place to Work,2020-09-08,5.0,Solutions Architect,"Management team is excellent, company values its employees, you are empowered to do your job, fair compensation including good incentive pay.

- ability to be a self starter
- diversity and equity is top of mind","- career progression has limitations
- pay/rsu packages could be improved"
51,Synack,"The most promising, and fulfilling startup of my career",2020-03-13,5.0,Senior Software Engineer II,"My time at Synack has seen its ups and downs. Things have been easy at times, and they've been hard at others, but what remains consistent is a culture of hard work, dedication, and a drive to press forward. Synack is a fast moving startup environment with real customers, real challenges, and real revenue.

Once integrated, Synack often feels less like a job, and more like a community. People are incredibly dedicated to their goals, and always willing to assist you with yours. The camaraderie here cannot be overstated. As the company has grown, it has become more difficult to put a name with every face, and yet the implicit trust is palpable. I feel a deep sense of mutual trust and respect with every person I've worked with.

With regard to compensation, Synack is flexible and generous. The company works with each person on an individual basis to ensure that their needs are met or exceeded. Compensation and benefits packages are competitive in the industry, and adjusted yearly based on individual performance reviews. If you are willing to put in the work and advocate for your needs, you will get it.

Overall, I really love working here. At the time of writing this, I've been with the company for 4 years, and I'm enthusiastic about staying with the company for the foreseeable future. I am grateful for every day that I've been blessed with the opportunity to work in this community, and I have an honest and deep sense of appreciation for everyone I work with - from the floor all the way up to the CEO.","We're a startup environment. We move fast, we break things. Product direction can be a challenge, and our management structure has seen many adjustments. I don't see this as a ""bad"" thing, but it does present its challenges. Change is hard. If you are flexible and can work with in a changing environment, you will succeed."
52,Synack,You can only be as good as your leader,2019-10-04,1.0,Engineer,"Very smart coworkers
Catered food
Work is relatively engaging","There are major issues with new engineering management: incompetence being first and foremost, indiscretion being another. There's virtually no thought about the long term health of the company from an engineering standpoint, as far as new management is concerned. ""Agile"" is assumed to be a silver bullet for fixing processes but there is neither vision nor technical experience coming from new leadership.

In terms of environment, ""toxic"" is actually the exact appropriate word, unfortunately. I was shocked at some of the things I heard, on one occasion it was in front of my manager and others but nothing came of it. One on ones with leadership left me between surprised at candor (""who says things like that?"" went through my head) and dismayed. ""Toxic"" describes the politics, and the management style on my team sadly (poor communication, poor guidelines, chaotic, awful delegation practices, awful soft skills, generally incompetent).

You can be confident a lot of these high rating reviews are pushed/disingenuous.

If you're a good engineer worth you're salt, it's best to just look elsewhere unless you enjoy daily frustration. If you're just looking for a job that pays and don't care so much, just be aware of what you're walking into politics wise. 

The work still is engaging and my direct coworkers are great, unfortunately we do not live in a meritocracy and sometimes people are hired to positions they really don't deserve. That's pretty typical though, and in that way Synack is pretty standard stereotypical Silicone Valley."
53,Synack,The worst of the worst.,2020-06-21,1.0,Senior Web Engineer,"I don't work there anymore.
Quitting was the best thing I did at this rathole.","I worked as a developer on the Engineering team, so this is for that.
I'm not sure how the rest of the company is.

None of the leads here have any real, practical experience at any company that's done anything of merit and it shows.
They're unnecessarily critical to the point of being outright bullies and don't even understand the basics of software development.
I've seen people meekly speak up in Engineering meetings only to be viciously shot down for little to no reason.
It's never real feedback either, it's just them basically loving the sound of tearing down another human being in front of others for sheer pleasure.
The leads are so out of their element that their only recourse in any conversation is plugging their ears and fighting with you because they don't have the experience to do any real problem solving.
They just want to be right and if it sinks the company, so be it.
Toxic with a capital T.

They're trying to run ""Agile"", which they're so terrible at doing that they've devolved back into Waterfall.
The punchline is they think they're somehow experts of this methodology and they'll over-explain it to the point of it being insulting, all while misunderstanding even the most basic of concepts of it.
They want so badly to be experts at anything that they're more than willing to embarrass themselves loudly and then deny that they've completely misunderstood whatever topic they're railing on.
Kind of reminds me of a certain POTUS.

When I was leaving they started some new process, but I don't know if it helped.
If they kept the same Engineering leads I'm sure it hasn't done any good.
I wasn't there long, but in my time there, the whole team never delivered anything of real value.
That team couldn't make a puddle with three buckets of water."

56,Synack,Best place I've ever worked (and I promise I wasn't bribed by mgmt. to say so),2016-01-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"After first learning of Synack, I was intrigued by the company's vision, mission, and the impressive traction they had gained for a relatively young company. Upon my first visit to Synack HQ down in Redwood City, I was sold. The people, the passion, the culture, the workplace, the cohesiveness, and the challenge of both a new role and industry focus, made the switch from the corporate world to the early-stage, high-growth environment of Synack a no-brainer. 

Pros
- Never a dull day at Synack, challenging environment allowing you to contribute from day one
- Top-tier TALENT- daily collaboration with the brilliant, diverse individuals you're surrounded by 
- Exciting, dynamically changing industry and a product that everyone here at Synack believes in
- Fast-paced, high-growth environment
- Friendly, enjoyable, entertaining office culture
- Phenomenal benefits/perks

First time I can honestly say that I ENJOY going to work each day.","Commuting from SF to Redwood City (partly my fault). Rush hour on US 101 is a battle that you just can't win. Take advantage of the free gym membership, events, rec leagues, etc. to avoid the worst  traffic times. 

The opportunity is well worth the commute; I would never let a commute keep me from doing what I love, and we did just open an office in SF..."

58,Synack,Phenomenal Place to Work,2015-07-17,5.0,N/A,"This is my third company since I left college, and it is my second startup. My first startup was on a rocket ship trajectory (I was the 40th employee and I left at 300) and I left do it again at Synack but this time better. 

Pros: 
1. The space Industrially and physically - Security/CrowdSourcing two of the most interesting trends at the moment with a weight to each of them that consists of more substance than a fad. Crowdsourcing being an incredible way to maximize scale/growth and Security being an amazing field to bring some repairable guidance to the internet that severely needs it. The physical space the company has is a nice addition as well! 
2. Very unique perspective derived from employees. The people who work here aren't your typical startup people. They thrive to put themselves in new situations and have a hacking mentality to everything they do whether it be growth, business, web or recreational activities that may involve a kick of adrenaline. 
3. There aren't limitations to the groundwork you can contribute as a team member as long as your vision is furthering the company. 
4. Management hires smart","1. If you live in the city, you will put up with a commute but if you know the value in the time you're investing you get over that very quickly."

60,Synack,Software Engineer,2015-08-18,5.0,,"Synack showed me how fun and rewarding it is to work in security, and I count this internship as the most valuable professional experience I've ever had. I had a fantastic group of mentors who fostered a great sense of camaraderie on our team, and I had a very high level of ownership over the work I did. Everyone I worked with was very patient, knowledgeable, and gave me tons of constructive feedback on my code. I felt like I always had real, meaningful work to do as an intern, and the code I shipped had a measurable impact on the core codebase. Synack is doing really great work and I think the company's leadership is doing a very good job directing the company's mission and goals.

For physical perks, Synack's office is well-furnished and nicely designed, and we had free catered lunches every day, as well as a gamut of snacks and drinks in constant supply. The company also paid for my membership to the gym in the office complex, and we frequently had employees' dogs in the office, a more-than-welcome addition.","Not exactly company-specific, but moving to the Bay Area and finding short-term summer housing was difficult and pretty expensive. Having housing assistance, i.e. help finding a place to live, would have been much appreciated."
61,Synack,"Great Company, Great Mission",2016-08-08,5.0,Program Manager,"I have been with Synack for a little over a month now and have truly enjoyed coming into work everyday. The people I work with are the best at what they do, are extremely motivated, and insanely intelligent. At the same time, though, they all know how to let loose and have a good time (especially during our weekly happy hours over some ping pong, foosball, and board games).

We also have a very open working space which helps foster collaboration between various teams and everyone is extremely approachable and willing to lend a helping hand or explain a complex concept until you fully understand what's going on, including management and leadership.

Some of the extra perks like catered meals, a stocked snack bar, and an onsite gym with basketball court and swimming pool are just the cherries on top of it all.","Thus far, the only downside of working at Synack for me has been the commute, but with the flexibility and understanding nature of our leadership, and my manager in particular, it hasn't even been an issue."
62,Synack,Hidden Gem !,2016-03-12,5.0,Business,"Cybersecurity is HOT that presents a huge opportunity for disruption. Synack has found the right pulse in the space with a truly innovative product that customers love.  

In terms of culture, people are super nice, driven and smart. It feels like a family with shared vision to deliver the best. The company also has hired an experienced leadership team with good chemistry which helps the company navigate through the growth phase thoughtfully. Company's co-founders and leadership team is  very open to feedback and always tuned in when it comes to improving and doing things better. 

In terms of perks, typical startup stuff. Office is tucked away in redwood city with a tiny SF office. As a shareholder can't complain since we don't have to pay outrageous rent in city.

Cherry on top..top tier investors and a board that is highly respected externally and internally.

Overall Synack has been a fulfilling experience and consider myself fortunate to be part of the company",Typical growing pains with startups but no deal breakers as such. As the company grows connectivity across teams can be light.
63,Synack,Specializing in delivering on promises,2018-01-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I've been in the security industry my entire career and I have never experienced anything like Synack. The culture and accessibility to executives is unthinkable. The ability for individual contributors to drive the company roadmap and the easily approachable and talented individuals in every division is incredible.  If I wouldn't have been afforded the opportunity to experience it myself I doubt I would have believed it. It simply is the best company to work for.  It's a wonderful feeling not being the smartest person in the room while the smartest people in the room are humble enough to share their knowledge openly regardless of the company division you work for. Throw in the consistently amazing talent the Synack community brings to each engagement and it's obvious that Synack will continue being the place to work in 2018.,There aren't any as of 2018.
64,Synack,Smoke and mirrors,2016-05-18,2.0,,"Cool office, mostly nice people, free lunch, happy hours, decent work-life balance.","If you expect this to be a typical startup with a flat organizational structure and inspiring leadership where transparency is the norm and honest feedback is encouraged, prepare to be disappointed. At Synack the management ranges from mediocre to awful, there's no unity between or within teams and zero support for employees. Feedback only flows from the top down and leadership by example doesn't exist here. Management doesn't set clear expectations and takes no interest in developing people. Trust, transparency and culture are all empty words at Synack, they are thrown around a lot but they don't mean anything. Founders don't have a startup background and don't seem to realize that culture isn't about foosball or ping pong tables and happy hours. It's about a group of people working towards a common purpose, feeling trusted, empowered and supported by their teams, managers and executives. This isn't something that is felt at Synack and it needs to be fixed at the core."
65,Synack,Disruptive and Cool --(don't take my word),2017-05-16,5.0,RVP,"The mindset from top down and bottoms up is let's get it done. The environment is collaborative and supportive. The people are smart and well credentialed
The workplace and notion of HR are vastly superior to what I have experienced elsewhere - they enable the business. Open doors? No need, it's an open floor plan where everyone is accessible. We fight the bad guys and we do it well, our solution is simple and effective and leveraged by the US department of defense and world's largest, most prestigious financial service companies, retail, healthcare and tech companies.  We are disruptive and ranked accordingly.
Gartner says there are 5 cool companies in 2017 and we are one of them.","We are not bleeding edge, but we deliver a service in a way that is non traditional and perceivably more expensive. We have some educating to do. In reality, we provide tremendous value and low cost of ownership because our offerings are fixed and comprehensive."
66,Synack,All things SALES!,2019-02-15,5.0,Sales,"First off... The culture is 2nd to none!   Nice people, friendly and willing to invest time ensuring your success.

Great Compensation - Great perks - happy hour, catered food.  

Flexible schedule - ""do what helps you be the most productive"" type of attitude is what you'll see and hear. 

Work Culture- Hard work and commitment is highly appreciated and rewarded.  

Management- Great leaders who not only focus on the company and it's customers, but value their employees most!  Something not typically found at companies in Silicon Valley.

Peers- No politics, fair people, always ready to help.",Not a huge fan of the location and commute.
67,Synack,Love this place!,2015-07-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Iâ€™ve been with Synack for over a year and continue to praise my decision to leave a large enterprise for a fast paced startup. Several things stand out: The work we do everyday has a direct impact to our customersâ€™ success; Synack is a fertile ground for growing a career; team collaboration is strong -- we move fast and smart, learning as a team through success and failure; a management team that cares deeply about each team member; and the perks are great too, from catered food and weekly happy hours to gym membership and offsite team events.",With snacks ever present I've gained a few pounds - which is why I find the free gym membership handy.
68,Synack,Small company that leaves a lasting impression,2016-06-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I came to Synack because I was looking to make a change and I definitely got that. This is the first time in my career that the management really takes the time to engage you in career development and listen to what you have to say. I see the impact of everything I work on nearly immediately, that's the perk of a small company!",We need to hire more amazing people! There's a lot of work to be done and we need the manpower to do it!
69,Synack,Fantastic Place to Work-Love it!,2016-08-01,5.0,,"This by far the best company I have worked at in a long time. The company treats employees very well, and really cares about growth and development of its employees. The culture is fun, and very laid back, yet everyone is motivated to work hard and learn from each other.  I'd say it's the epitome of the true small company environment! I have been constantly asked how I would like to further develop skill set. While some push hard to perform at a higher level, this is a GREAT thing because it is all done from a positive, team building environment.",Really cant think of any!
70,Synack,Dream Job!,2016-06-06,5.0,General and Administrative,I get to work on interesting and cutting edge issues with smart and dedicated people. We've doubled in size since I've been here and I still feel like I know everyone pretty well due to our weekly happy hours and fun company outings. Being able to bring my dog to the office is actually a dream of mine (and now it's come true) and I think she adds a lot to the company culture :),"Headquarters is a bit far. But, once you make it out there catered lunches, snacks, great gym, beautiful walking paths and athletic fields are all available."
71,Synack,Sales,2018-01-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I joined Synack over a year ago and have found it to be a fantastic company. Not only is the the solution without a doubt the best industry offering, the culture is excellent. Leadership works hard to recognize everyones accomplishments as well as the company milestones. In addition, leadership listens to what the customers want. The cyber security space is very crowded but I have found that Synack stands out front as a industry thought leader. I am proud to work for Synack and would recommend exploring the opportunities with Synack in your next job search.",No negative situations to report
72,Synack,Sales,2018-11-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Awesome team with great core values.  There is a lot of opportunity both individually and for the company as crowdsourcing is becoming more mainstream in the security space.  There's awesome perks like snacks, lunches, team events, flexibility, etc.  Most importantly the management has strong vision and doesn't micromanage.","Synack is very results driven, this isn't the type of job where you can ""coast."" It is hard work and as with most startups there are a lot of competing priorities."
73,Synack,"On balance, Synack is advancing crowdsourced cybersecurity intelligence to the next level.",2017-10-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. Forward-looking and enterprising founders and management.
2. Intelligent, and conscientious colleagues.
3. Efficient company-wide and cross-functional business processes.
4. Fun and agile work environment.
5. Motivated and earnest support staff.
6. Competitive benefits for employee well-being.
7. Convenient location for quick access to ambient utilities.","Rapid business growth may interfere with employee focus and cause variable productivity, while adding scale-induced inertia to processes and product vision."
74,Synack,Flexible and Understanding!,2018-11-28,5.0,Operations,"If you are looking for a company that is flexible with your schedule and provides you opportunities to help better yourself in and outside of work, look no further than Synack.  I live in the city, so being able to avoid commuting every day has saved me the peace of mind needed to excel at my day-to-day duties.","As with any startup, resources can sometimes be scarce.  If you are lucky enough to be hired on, prepare to take on several roles."
75,Synack,Great company. Amazing team!,2015-05-21,5.0,,One of the best! Everything from the interview to the onboarding process were seamless and I was constantly updated on next steps. They move fast and offered a very competitive package (salary and benefits). I have several offers on the table but knew this is the company I want to work for 5 minutes into my interview.  The team are filled with extremely intelligent people who are passionate about what they do. Everyone work hard but the company is really gracious at making sure there's work/life balance. Weekly happy hours/ off-sites lunches/ fun activities are planned often to help the team de-stressed.,"Nothing, wouldn't want to be anywhere else but here!"
76,Synack,Fun place to work,2016-06-07,5.0,,"Synack has been a great experience for me since I started a year ago. Not only are the people great, but I really believe in our company vision. Great work/life balance, supportive teams, and a fun/relaxed office culture. Not to mention the catered lunches are awesome. At the end of the day, everyone is contributing towards the same goal which is to help the company grow.",I gained 10 pounds from all the food. haha
77,Synack,Not a great experience,2016-08-01,1.0,,"Typical SV perks like free lunch, happy hours and dog friendly office. Some of the people are really nice.","Coming from a startup with a great culture this was a shock to my system. Synack offers no leadership, transparency or support to its employees. This is one of those places where there's constantly whispers in hallways and you'll never know whose head is going to roll next. I found this to be a very unsettling and anxiety inducing environment. If you have offers from Facebook/Google/Twitter or any other legit tech company and you think this startup might be more fun, think again. Synack likes to pretend they're a startup but they really act like a big company with many restrictions, lack of transparency and a leadership structure that is far from flat. I joined based on the glowing Glassdoor reviews and within a couple of weeks knew I'd made a mistake."
78,Synack,Great place to be,2019-02-15,5.0,Sales,"People are friendly and everyone knows everyone.
There seems to be a genuine belief in the company/product across the company.
Flexibility with hours and work from home. 
Executive team is open to having conversations. 
Free lunch everyday.",As with any startup resources are limited. People wear many hats and budgets are limited.
79,Synack,Mirror Mirror on the wall...,2017-05-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"A great company with tons of potential to become a leader within the security infosec space. You have your common SV perks: Organic snacks, LaCroix sparkling water, Hint water, Kombucha, daily lunches and weekly in-office Happy Hours. Nothing too special but a way to keep you longer in the office.","40 hour work weeks are easily 50 - 60 hour work weeks. It's an environment where you can easily burn out. ""Unlimited PTO"" aren't really unlimited but frowned upon because there's always work that ""needs"" to get done. The extra hours and time you dedicate is not appreciated but ""part of the job"". An ""excellent"" end-of-the year review will earn you a disrespectful raise, don't dare to ask for more because false promises will be made. Promotions are only given to those who are favorited. Majority of the time, it's not even clear what people do to get promoted all the time. Most importantly, Synack is the definition of ""office politics"". The young executive team tends to isolate themselves from the rest of the company, point fingers at others instead of being accountable, make excuses for goals not being met, pick and choose favorites within the company, and hold many hallways and conference room gossip sessions. This might as well be the next reality TV show. Suggestion/questionnaires during All-Hands is only a gimmick to show that the management team is open to listen but it gets overlooked and brushed under the rug left to be forgotten. A work/life balance is non-existence so if you're looking for a fun cultured environment to work in, this is not the place."
80,Synack,Amazing Place! Full of Passionate People.,2017-06-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Synack is an excellent company! I was in search of great culture and passionate people that would challenge me. They have fulfilled these expectations and opened doors to new opportunities within the company. The Synack community is amazing as well. From knowledge-share events with executives, to company outings, youâ€™re constantly surrounded by employees with great personalities and extreme motivation. Itâ€™s pretty inspiring!",There really aren't any.
