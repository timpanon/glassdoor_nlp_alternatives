19,TekSynap,The Most Fulfilling Year,2021-02-08,5.0,Principal Data Manager,"TekSynap's success starts at the top; it is a company run by people who embrace , understand and promote technology. Though this sounds obvious, it's vital for technology employees to work for people who have been in the ""trenches"" IT-wise and who understand how to deal with current and future issues in the field. Everyone I've encountered at TekSynap has been helpful, encouraging , and eager to make it easier for us to make the client satisfied. The benefits are outstanding, communication with the corporate office is seamless and the atmosphere is very upbeat; we know that if we not only meet but exceed the client's needs, the company will flourish, and so will we.

The benefits are amazing especially the Employee Learning Program and Health Insurance. Management is not afraid at all to try out new technology and implement it as soon as its proven. Every member of the executive team is easy to communicate with and enjoy sharing their knowledge and experience. Also the culture is such that employees share knowledge and pick each others brains constantly to help each other improve even across departments. They do an amazing job of making the company feel like a giant family.,I can honestly say it wouldn't even make sense for me personally to put anything here.

63,TekSynap,Amazing Opportunities - time to ride the wave,2015-02-19,5.0,Wireless Engineer,"Synaptek Corporation has achieved an Advanced Enterprise Networks Architecture technology partner specialization and was invited to become a Cisco Advanced Professional Partner subcontractor.   For a small company this is an excellent opportunity to grow as an employee but also opens to door for accelerating my IT career.   I've noticed that the owners are promoting training free of charge which is again a great opportunity.  The team I work with is awesome.  We all help each other get the job done.  My prior experience in the IT field of 20 years has provided me the knowledge that a great team environment is critical to success but more importantly enjoying my job.

The National WiFi program is the largest deployment of Cisco wireless technologies in the world and for under 100 employees, I find that an excellent opportunity.  Not sure why others don't see that a fast growing company always has concerns to work through.  It's just a matter of patience and time.",It can be hard work and sometime long hours but in the end it is rewarding.
64,TekSynap,"Great Company, Great Leadership",2015-02-25,5.0,,"Synaptek is a small but fast growing company.  Were there learning curves? You betcha! Just like any other small company. The leadership within the organization are the hardest working and most caring bosses you'll ever have. We have a ""Cadillac"" health care plan, Matching 401K and tuition reimbursement for all employees. If you want to get on board with a solid company that actually cares about their employees, then Synaptek is the one. It appears by the comments that one or two former employees are continually posting negative comments about the company. Please do not feed into the lies.  These are, as I stated, just a couple of people who didn't get their way, so they are acting like spoiled children and using this site to try to make the company look bad.  Just ask the 100+ employees and they will tell you the truth. Synaptek is run by very knowledgeable and CARING people. 
To the person that has nothing better to do than post anonymous negative comments, get a life.",I have no cons to list
65,TekSynap,"13th Grade, Kids",2015-01-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Nice for Jr. employees, fresh out of college. Not good for senior people who've been around the block a few times.","This company seems to have a hard time trying to appreciate their employees.  Salary is so-so and benefits are horrible.  The company seems cheap for their employees and expensive for their customer.  The medical insurance plans they offer have a very high deductible and very limited coverage.  They used to offer free medial insurance for ""employee only"" plan, now with the new plans there is a cost.  In addition the coverage levels have significantly lowered.  I can no longer obtain my medical treatments from my current doctor since the insurance changed.  You have to pay a deductible for everything now.  

When you complain to management the answer is ""we are a small company"" (LOL).  The environment is very political, you are only noticed by management when you ""play the game"".  Management act like children, joking around and laughing about any little thing.  Employees are promoted if they buddy buddy with certain individuals.  If you don't, then it's best to leave (like I'm trying to do).  And yes, all upper management are ex General Dynamics Exec who's husbands, wives, sisters, brothers, in-laws, cousins, pet dogs and gold fish are employee through Synaptek."
66,TekSynap,It's all about who you know...,2016-01-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you are looking to get your feet wet in the IT field (with little to no IT exp), Synaptek is the place for you.   If you are looking for experience in a fast paced, poorly managed IT company, Synaptek is also the place for you! If you're looking for a place that will promote their culture all day long, look no further! But please don't let the Synaptek branded coffee mugs and USB thumb drives fool you. And as the title says, it's all about who you know at Synaptek. If you are friends with the right people you might even see 2-3 promotions in the span of a year!","It's all smoke and mirrors with Synaptek. They boast and brag the small contracts they were awarded as well as their awards for top 50 this and that.  The middle management are mainly hired to just look good and have about zero experience in Government Contracting. Makes it pretty tough to work with the client facing group when they don't even understand their client's needs.  There also isn't a QA department within the development team. Developers are left to QA their own work.  And let's close this all out with what I stated in the title, it is all about who you know at Synaptek. If you're looking to make it to the top with Synaptek, get with the right people and you'll go far even if you have zero qualification for the work/job you are being promoted for. If you want to be rewarded for hard work and actually doing your job, look elsewhere and find another company."
67,TekSynap,A respectable and caring company,2015-01-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Being part of a moderately small and new company gives you a rare opportunity to help create and alter procedures used to handle certain processes and tasks.  Although this can at times be difficult, it is extremely rewarding, and can also result in helping to streamline your own job.  The management is extremely caring.  Every time i presented a question or problem i was answered in a timely manner and with the utmost respect.  When my son was born almost everyone in my program sent me a congratulatory email, including the CEO (and this was around 1am).  Synaptek also sent my wife an edible arrangement and a high-quality blanket with my son's name and birth date stitched on.  Companies with this level of compassion are few and far between.","Occasionally procedure will change resulting in work needing to be updated to the new directives, but as i mentioned above, in areas where the procedure is still being created/implemented this is to be expected."
68,TekSynap,Great smaller company growing with great strides.,2015-01-13,5.0,,"I have worked with Synaptek Corp for a couple of years now and have seen great strides with the company.  The company strives to grow and grow its employees along with it.  I have seen management step up and pay the salaries of the employees instead of furloughing during government shutdown. The company has grown exponentially since i started, and along with that there have been some growing pains but that is to be expected.  I have worked for other government contractors and was just a number for them to bill too.  That is not the case here, I totally disagree with the statement that i have read of Synaptek being just a Body Shop.",work long hours but are paid well for it.
69,TekSynap,Wireless Engineer,2015-08-28,5.0,Wireless Engineer,"I love this company -- some of these reviews are non-sense.  In my 15+ in the contracting world, having worked for 3 other ""big"" gov contractors, this company is by far better.  Better tools, better culture and better opportunities.  This company offers flex time, work from home, pays for you to continue your education and certifications.  They know your name and give recognition when deserved.",There is always the 10% -- the non-performers who want equal opportunities and don't hold themselves accountable. They seem to blame the organization and management instead.  This is a small company you can't hide here and collect a paycheck.  Don't like it? leave please!
70,TekSynap,DO NOT WORK HERE,2015-01-16,1.0,,Small company with management who've been managers within another large company.  If you like that kind of thing then this is for you.,"This company has no desire to stay in business long.  Their goal is to become large enough to be bought out by someone else.  In the end the little guys never benefit from this.  Management targets certain employees as having value (which doesn't mean they are skilled) and they get better benefits/raises etc...  If you are not in their target, then you should probably leave.  Also the comment made about Work From Home is FALSE, if you are on contract with the federal gov and it offers work from home, then you can, but most don't.  Synaptek is a federal contractor as most of it's employees are working federal contracts.  In addition the comment made about being paid during Gov Shutdowns IS  also FALSE.  The federal government pays the contracting company well in advance and a shutdown usually doesn't harm the contracting company or it's employees in any way.  During the last Gov shutdown most federal contractors all across different contracting companies were still employed.

Also the President's responses have mostly been false as well.  Synaptek does have relatives supervising each other within the organization."
71,TekSynap,Temp,2015-11-01,2.0,Wireless Engineer,"Small company. support further education,","Poor communication to and  from upper and middle management.
 Because they work off of contracts they sometimes have little work and do not need a large staff.  So your better off being a contractor to them.
There is no real career path unless one of the seniors leave.
They are very particular on how things are done and not open to change. 

Wireless networking: Very strict on their methods and the results have a poor design. I can see their customers bringing someone else in to fix issues in the near future.

Business decisions: Many times they choose the more costly solution to favor the ""founders"" and not the business. ex. sending people on site that have to fly when they have a local person available.  Use 4 people for a one man job."
72,TekSynap,Growing small company that takes care of employees,2015-02-19,5.0,,"Synaptek is a small IT consulting company.  The management team is busy, but visible and they listen to employee feedback.  The benefits are standard to slightly above average and the pay is competitive. Where they shine is in growth and development.  They invest in their employees and value feedback from them.  If small company culture is what you like, this is one of the best!","I do not have any cons for working at Synaptek.  There are some hectic periods, but as an IT contractor, occasional long hours are part of my job."
73,TekSynap,Great Opportunities,2016-05-02,5.0,Systems Administrator,"Working for Synaptek has provided me fantastic benefits, competitive salary, and great opportunities to learn new skills to further my own development.",None.  There are a lot of not great reviews here which I don't get.  Communication and Organization are pain points in any organization.  If you think they are promoting there friends its probably because they are promoting the person who they have had the opportunity to work with the most.  If you weren't so worried about salaried exempt or comp time maybe you would've put in the extra hours and gotten the same opportunity as the guy who got the promotion.  Seems like a lot of people blaming others.
74,TekSynap,Best Job Ever,2015-02-19,5.0,Employee,"Friendly employees. Good pay for good work. If you have the initiative and willingness to push yourself farther, these people will see it and provide you every opportunity to attain your goals. The staff are there 24/7 with anything you might need--family emergency, financial troubles, career or educational goals. It's fun coming to work. I'll probably be here until they kick me out.",Occasionally contracts will require a late night or a couple hours on the weekend.
75,TekSynap,Good Company with room to grow,2015-04-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Synaptek is a growing Small Company full of potential.  The work atmosphere is great and teamwork abounds.  The company truly grows there employees and invest in their development.  The work is constant and everyone is willing to help each other.  The CEO is willing to get his hands in on any of the work and doesn't talk down to anyone.  He is very approachable and concerned for each employee.,"Lots of work hours, but you can say that comes with a growing company."
76,TekSynap,enjoyable employment with growing potential,2015-01-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The management is fair and I've never had a problem with any other employees. Benefits and pay are good. I know what is expected of me - tasks are given clear deadlines. Working from home is a great convenience. I mainly have nothing to complain about, which in and of itself is certainly something worth commending.","Working from home, a convenience I've come to really enjoy, can make forming relationships with coworkers take longer."
77,TekSynap,Great company that recognizes talent,2018-03-13,5.0,Systems Administrator,Upper management is always listening to feedback and trying to improve the company and environment. Talent is certainly recognized and rewarded especially if you end up going above and beyond it does get noticed.,The only con I can even think of would be its a fast paced environment at times but the whole team is always working hard so I never mind but if you're looking to just come to work clock 8 hours of mediocre work and go home this company is probably not  the right fit.
78,TekSynap,The best place I have ever worked!!,2015-03-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Office culture, was a huge plus for me. They made me feel like my opinions and ideas mattered to the success of the company. You get to work with a company that has the experience and expertise in technologies that very few companies can provide. They have great benefits (choice of 3 plans) and tuition reimbursement!!",The job itself can be challenging (yet rewarding) at times but that is not a con in my opinion.
79,TekSynap,Helpdesk,2018-03-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Very friendly work environment,  best healthcare program I have ever had,  they have a functional education reimbursement program to constantly grow your certification and work experience. Great entry level position to start in to see multiple fields in the workplace and figure out what you want to narrow in on and specialize in.",Small business problems that we currently have could become compounded if the same practices continue to be implemented as we expand into a bigger company. It does seem that management is aware of some of these issues and is working toward fixing/resolving some in the future.
80,TekSynap,No sense of professional boundaries,2015-07-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The hiring process is very fast, they try to get you in the door pretty quick.  They have some challenging contracts and some complex problems to solve.  This is a good company if you are just starting out, but it's not good long term or for the established!","Both management and employees seem to lack any professional boundaries.  This behavior emanates from the top down.  As a result you're job and face-time has to occur 24/7.  Going to employee homes/cars/families/parties etc...  seems to be the norm.  You have to be around everyone to make an impact.  Simply doing a good job at your work and making a difference is not enough.  You will not be seen this way and it will not get you raise, promotion etc....  Didn't realize companies worked like this anymore and overall it seems very unprofessional.  

Synaptek tries to portray themselves as the ""Next Big Thing"", a disruptor or game changer.  But they lack any expertise to do this, they have no product, no service, no idea that would cause this."
81,TekSynap,Great growing company with advancement opportunities.,2015-03-22,5.0,Wireless Engineer,I love the culture and the values. This company invests in their people. They encourage and reward their engineers to stay current with the latest technology. All certifications are paid for by the company.,"If you don't like working in fast paced collaborative environment then this is not for you.  No hand holding here.  If you are self motivated and ambitious, you will excel."
82,TekSynap,Great Company. Employee Focused.,2016-12-02,5.0,Wireless Engineer,Synaptek's education and benefit programs are the best I've seen. This company really values their employees future and well-being. Working in many different programs for Synaptek for the past 5+ years has been an amazing experience and very satisfied with the quality of work our teams put in which led to incentives. Environment is very friendly and management is very approachable to questions and concerns.,I have no complaints during my tenure with Synaptek.
83,TekSynap,"Corporate without being ""corporate""",2016-04-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,managers seem to actually care about you as a person vs. just someone that is there to get the job done,Sometimes lack of direction and communication on what is needed or wanted/how it is wanted is frustrating.
84,TekSynap,"Limited/Unfair Promotion Ability, No Annual review, No Annual performance",2014-12-17,1.0,,If you like a hands off organization that doesn't really pay attention to you or existence.  I guess this would be good for someone who likes to lay low and doesn't really care for their career (just a job).,"Moving up in the company is not about your technical ability or expertise, but about how much ""buddy buddy"" you are with management.  If your good at brown nosing you will advance within the company ranks and it will determine what projects they assign you on.  There are a lot of politics and people in low positions seem to hold undocumented power.  Unless you are the ""used car salesman"" type, you should head out the door. Personally in my many years doing IT this is by-far the worst company I've worked for.  Resulting in the lowest point in my career. 

In order to get pay increase, you have to ask.  There is no performance review etc..."
85,TekSynap,Get treated like garbage then thrown away with no moments notice,2015-07-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Worked there for a few years.  Only thing positive was they offered tuition reimbursement.  For the first few years of working there they offered free medical insurance for employee only.  That was probably the only good times.  They did transition the people over from the old team and provided salary increases!,The management started to suffer shortly.  Most of the managers they bought in were crackerbox managers who had very little exp.  It seemed the company became less technical and more less talk!  They pay the DC game and play politics to get ahead.  Those that do well are those that brown nose with the boss.  You need to play that game to get ahead in this company.  Otherwise you find yourself out of a job.  They try to work you overtime (w/o) pay.  Then they say it's expected of you since you are a salary employee!!!!
86,TekSynap,Nepotismtek,2014-12-07,1.0,,There really isn't much to say positive.  If you are in the IT field and in the DC area you have a smorgasbord of companies to work for.  This is a small company that I feel wasn't started in the best of intentions.,"Many of the current employees are family members.  Wives, brothers, sisters etc....  Then you have a level of friends for those family members.  So it's kind of like the Verizon friends and family plan of business (LOL).  This makes it real hard to advance because your not going to replace someone's sister/brother/wife.  They will always get preferential treatment over you in every way.  It's just one big joke.  

The company gives everyone the ""impression"" that they care about employees (parties etc...) and are generous to employees, but in actuality they spend money on the things that ""look large"" and very little money on the things that matter (wages, benefits)."
87,TekSynap,VP operations,2015-02-27,5.0,,Very progressive company with strong leadership.  Great culture and values.  This company offers a great benefit package with reasonable rates for premium coverage with low deductibles.  Dental and vision premium is nominal for families.,It's a growing company offering the latest technologies.  You need to be able to adapt and keep up with the latest technology.
88,TekSynap,Great Company with Great People,2015-02-19,5.0,,Synaptek is a growing company with lots of opportunities.  It is a great company to work for with experienced staffs.  Synaptek Management invests a lot of their time on providing employees' great benefits and compensation along with flexible working environment.  They listen to employees' feedback and improve on areas that they need to be strengthened,Synaptek is a fabulous company to work for.
89,TekSynap,Synaptek Corp,2016-07-07,4.0,Regional Program Manager,"Great Team assembled. All worked remotly and made it work well. CEO/Owner Kam Jinnah was always available for comments, suggestions, questions or just to catch up. Employee benefits and pay were great.","There was no dedicated sales team, the result of this was that when the major project (The National Veterans Affairs WiFi Deployment) concluded most if not all of the Wireless Team was let go. I attempted to use my private sector contacts with ATT to secure more work however that is a timely process and didn't happen fast enough to get more projects."
90,TekSynap,Growing company with broad horizons,2015-06-11,5.0,Engineer Technician,Management is not afraid to get hands on and assist when asked. The work environment is filled with friendly and helpful coworkers that make the workplace enjoyable. Response time is relatively quick on any questions or concerns you may have.,Relatively new which can cause growing pains.
91,TekSynap,Great place to work,2016-09-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Company puts the employee first - feel appreciated from day 1.
Growing company - great opportunities for growth, learn quickly  from experts in the field.
Well-rounded benefits to include strong 401k match, wellness program - gym membership perk, $5k tuition reimbursement.","As with all growing companies, there are definitely some days with long hours."
92,TekSynap,Great Company!!!,2015-02-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Synaptek is a fast growing small Federal IT Services Company. I have been extremely happy working here. I previously work for a large company and felt like I was treated as just a number. Synaptek feels more like family. They recognize that their employees are the key to their success.,None. I am very happy working at Synaptek.
93,TekSynap,Forward-thinking Government Contractor,2018-07-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,There are many opportunities for growth and the company really knows how to focus on employee's strengths. The benefits are great.,"A lot of employees are spread throughout the country; however, I think the company is actively searching for ways to make employees feel more connected as a whole."
94,TekSynap,Growing small IT government contractor,2018-03-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Many opportunities within the company for growth - Tuition reimbursement toward  new certifications, college courses and existing certifications,  promotions or knowledge increase available on many programs/contracts.  Company cares about their employees and encourages suggestions",Nothing to report at this time
95,TekSynap,"Great benefits, even better people!",2019-02-12,5.0,Business Coordinator,Highly competitive salaries and industry leading opportunities.  I've been both challenged and empowered daily since day one.,I enjoy my job so much I may have to relocate closer to the HQ.
96,TekSynap,The Good and The Bad,2015-12-19,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"I worked on a contract with upper management supervising me, which was a positive experience. There were numerous difficult customer issues to overcome, which made it a challenging environment with learning and leading opportunities. It was hard, but hard work was appreciated. The executive gave me space to do my job and successfully support the customer’s mission needs. He even sent my wife and kids a fruit basket for my absence (due to traveling for work). Upper management has intelligent businessmen and former engineers, who genuinely seem to care about their company and people, when you get the opportunity to interact and work with them. In this situation, the customer was happy and employees were recognized and rewarded for their hard work.","I also worked on a contract and was micromanaged by a PM, who expected people to work on the weekends – with no overtime due to exempt/salaried status. Overtime was expected, rather than appreciated. Microsoft Lync was used to babysit and micromanage employees. Management often checked it to make sure we were working at our laptops, and finishing tasks ahead of time was rewarded with more work.
It was difficult to get time off, due to the crushing schedule, and employees used to not be able to get any compensatory time, regardless of the number of hours put in. The PM also questioned every travel expense, even for baggage fees. How do you cram your work laptop and change of clothes into something small enough to fit into the small overhead bins?
Furthermore, the PM liked to terminate people early. If you gave your resignation notice, the PM would often set your termination date earlier. It is unprofessional, childish, and not something you expect from a leader. This contract was a nightmare, and working from home was like being a prisoner in your own house. The saving grace is that upper management genuinely seems to care about their company and people, so they try to do damage control, but are not always aware or successful."
97,TekSynap,Great People = Great Company,2015-02-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Synaptek is a great company to work for. Great benefits, flexibility, and family oriented. Management is fair and responsive to any issues brought to their attention. Lots of room for growth.","Great company, nothing to complain about."
98,TekSynap,Where do these managers come from?,2016-04-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are usually a whole bunch of startups like this in DC.  You really take a chance to see if things work out.  You will either like it or not.  When this company was small the initial management were the principals that seemed to really care about the employees.  The middle management that was placed there really act like a narcissistic buffer.,"Out of my 15 years of working for IT, this seems to be the one company that will really take advantage of the term ""salary exempt employee"".  It's best to try to find ways to avoid doing work they will want you to do.  In all honestly you won't gain any special benefit from doing this work because they will promote their friends and relatives before you.  Expect to work overtime."
99,TekSynap,Fantastic,2015-01-31,5.0,Information Security Analyst,"Small company that takes care of its people.
Great benefits.
Fair wages.","It is a contracting company, so any cons would have more to do with the client site you may be working at, not the company."
100,TekSynap,Best job I ever had!,2015-02-27,5.0,Analyst,A great team of highly motivated people! You are given lots of responsibility and get to work on lots of exciting projects.,I had to leave job due to a relocation of my family.
101,TekSynap,Go Elsewhere,2015-01-14,1.0,,"More of an IT management company.  They are best in areas of IT Project Management, Modernization and general Management.","A bunch of nicely dressed management that care more about ""showing face"" then anything else.  They hire people mostly to ""butter up"" the government.  This company doesn't really value technical people.  You pretty much have to be in the clique to be seen in this company.  Not a good place for the highly technical or ambitious.  Feels like a ""Mad Men"" environment where the rules apply different depending on who you are.  This is supposed to be a small young company and you can see how many negative reviews we see here!!!!"

They do offer work from home positions as well as flexible schedules.  They have contracts all over the DC/MD/VA area for large names.,"This company has a culture that is difficult to work with.  A lot of cronyism and nepotism is practiced on a daily basis.  Politics is the game to get you ahead, if you don't play then you don't get ahead period.  That is the basis for you salary, pay increases etc...  They certainly know how to play the PR game and value those that play that game for them.  They try to take advantage of you and NOTHING is ever in writing."

Burnout is high, my belief is there is simply no incentive program within the organization.  There seems to be a lack of annual review and lack of any ""pulse check"" for employees.  Management is cheap, they don't offer annual increases or do much for employees.  If you ask the answer is always NO.  What boils my blood is at the same time, management buys each of them a new Tesla.  Then you ask for a increase and receive a big NO."
108,TekSynap,AWESOME,2015-07-24,5.0,,Awesome company. They care for their employees. And try to do company events for us.,There are no cons at all.

That is fine, however their form of management is not the best form of management!!!  It's a lot of finding loopholes and hiring ""hand picked"" people from the government on contracts they were awarded!!!!  When you see how they get ahead much of it is from playing DC games and politics.  While they make money off the backs of their small employees and pay a cheap wage."
