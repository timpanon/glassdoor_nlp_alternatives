0,The Lifetime Value Co.,"Great place, great people!",2022-02-07,5.0,"Director, Business Intelligence",Amazing company that strives to maintain a great culture and work life balance. You can see coming to work every day that people are very happy to be here and enjoy working together. Also tons of cool perks as well!,Nothing I can think of as of now!
1,The Lifetime Value Co.,"Honest Review: Amazing people, great benefits, interesting work, normal business growing pains",2021-12-08,5.0,Product Manager,"-Remote first: LTV has a great remote culture where employees can work from where they are at. We are also given a home office benefit to furnish our home office!
-High-caliber people: Everyone here is incredibly helpful and is willing to teach different aspects about the work we do. People are incredibly understanding of the dynamic of WFH and are flexible if your kid is sick or the dog is barking in the background of a meeting. Executives are super nice and regularly hold town hall meetings 
-Great benefits: 401k match, free doordash twice a week, great health insurance, etc.","- (Not necessarily a con but something that could be improved) LTV has a very thorough onboarding which is great for exposure and learning but can feel a bit like drinking from a fire hose. Honestly, it wasn't bad just alot of information at once
-normal growing pains of a business: With multiple brands all working hard to grow and optimize, there can be a bit of a resource scarcity with shared resources (legal, email, data preparation, etc.) LTV is very conscious of this and is working to continue to scale its resources. Not something to be concerned about, really it just means you might have to ""wait in line"" for somethings to get done sometimes."
2,The Lifetime Value Co.,"Great Employer, Amazing Team",2022-01-05,5.0,Affiliate Manager,"The team here really does live up to the company values. Everyone is welcoming, helpful, and works hard. 

Remote culture can be challenging for organizations, but here the team works to create events and times where as a team people can come together so you do not miss out on the relationships with co-workers. Everyone on the team is quickly and easily accessible, always ready to help or give you the information you need to keep working on your project. 

The company shows continually that they truly care about the employees.",I cannot think of a con for working here. It really is a spectacular organization.
3,The Lifetime Value Co.,Innovative tech company with room for growth,2021-10-13,5.0,Public Relations Manager,"LTV is a company that truly cares about its employees. I've never worked with an employer that took such good care to give its employees meaningful benefits. Two free lunches per week (delivered), healthcare, mental health support, class pass memberships, tax help, bonuses, swag and so much more. 

If the perks of working at LTV weren't enough, the company itself is established with a twelve-year history but is still growing quickly. This mean you'll get the tech company vibes without the lack of infrastructure that you would see in startups. Because the company continues to add brands to it's portfolio, the growth opportunities are endless. In just seven months, I've grown from an individual to now managing a team of three, which is important to me and where I want to go in my career.

LTV creates opportunities for those interested in management and those who are not equally, providing paths for each person to take depending on what they want.",I can't think of any!
4,The Lifetime Value Co.,Great Place To Work,2022-01-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The culture and people here make this an awesome place to work. The work is challenging, yet there is very good work/life balance. People are eager to help and are happy working here. They have a lot of perks and management values their employees. Remote atmosphere works well.",I have only positive things...really have no cons!
5,The Lifetime Value Co.,There's a reason people stay here,2021-05-20,5.0,Associate Director of Engineering,"- LTV does a superb job supporting their people. Whether it's training, tools, one-on-one time with subject matter experts, I've always felt supported if I needed something that could help me in the course of getting work done.
- We've grown over the years, but have done it largely in a sustainable and sensible way. It's been the main reason that while the company has grown 4x its size since I've been here, the underlying spirit of competency and collaboration has only strengthened even though the company is very different than when I started.
- Leadership's response to the pandemic was outstanding. They took cautious steps to keep everyone safe, and the cofounders held regular AMAs to answer questions and keep the lines of communication open. We adjusted to a remote-first culture with very few bumps, in no large part to the remote-friendly culture that has already been here for years.
- When the company does well, they share it with employees. Really appreciated last year's bonuses - it's more than just talk when everyone actually shares in the company's success.","Not much, really. The only thing I'd say is that we encourage a baseline level of autonomy regardless of job title, so people who aren't self-starters may not be the best fit."
6,The Lifetime Value Co.,It really is a great place to work!,2021-10-18,5.0,Talent Acquisition Manager,"The company is growing very rapidly which allows room for growth within the organization. Company grows, we grow with it! Everyone is extremely collaborative. Suggestions for improvement from employees are always more than welcome at LTV and actually very encouraged. 

HR does an AMAZING job at making sure employees feel appreciated, valued and motivated. The perks and benefits we get are great! This is a company in which you feel that employees come first.",Not any that I can think of.
7,The Lifetime Value Co.,Awesome company with an employees-first attitude,2021-07-30,5.0,Vice President of Engineering,"The company is profitable and as the company smashes through record after record of growth metrics, the founders and the executive team are always trying to ensure employee happiness by celebrating the wins with the employees. The founders are transparent and honest with the folks they work with, holding frequent AMAs where they dont shy from answering tough questions. The core values of the company are adhered to by the founders all the way to the individual contributors; these core values are great pillars on which LTV is run.","The company is in a rapid growth phase and has its growing pains that are being worked out. Not a big con, but something that one should be aware of."
8,The Lifetime Value Co.,"Start-up Mentality, Corporate Resources",2021-05-07,5.0,Search Engine Marketing,"LTV is super responsive to both its' employees needs/wants, as well as external factors such as the covid pandemic. They were able to quickly transition to get everyone set up to WFH and provide everything you might need, including items like monitors and peripherals. 
The company really emphasizes employees' well-being and understands what a healthy work-life balance means (i.e. no one will hold it against you if you take a random PTO day). LTV also constantly asks what they can do to improve, both in the business sense and to meet employees needs.
Everyone is given the opportunity to excel and the resources to grow. Management holds public forums often and really gives detailed answers. My background prior to LTV is with a large finance company, and now being in an environment where upper management has an active role and is very approachable is still a wonder to me.","Not many to speak of, but it's difficult to say since we're all remote now. My biggest gripe pre-pandemic was the office location in mid-town Manhattan, but that's just because my commute was terrible."
9,The Lifetime Value Co.,Best Company I've Ever Worked,2021-10-25,5.0,Data Engineer,"Amazing collaborative culture
Flexibility and work from home 
Great benefits

Opportunities for career development.","I honestly don't have any cons to share, it is a great company."
10,The Lifetime Value Co.,Great company to work for,2021-07-26,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,I work with competent people and they're willing to help when you do actually need help with something. Work Life Balance is great. Management's response to the pandemic was quick; we were one of the few that started working remotely before everything was shut down. There are some nice perks and compensation is fair. They try to help set you up for promotions and advance your career.,"Sometimes there is a lot of work thrown at me at once, but this is due to the nature of my team. Things are generally well balanced and handled well."
11,The Lifetime Value Co.,You want to Work Here,2021-10-07,5.0,Customer Support,"LTV nurtures and cares for its employees

13,The Lifetime Value Co.,Great opportunity for remote workers,2021-06-29,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"This is the first time I didn't feel isolated while being a remote worker. Culture of the company is great, I love the people I work with, there is a clear career path for me and the updates to the company seem very down to earth and clear.","Given the complexity of the systems and how big they are, simple changes could take longer to be done."
14,The Lifetime Value Co.,Great culture and a huge focus on employee happiness and retention.,2021-04-23,5.0,Programmatic Strategist,"Great communication and transparency between leadership and employees. Huge focus on employee happiness. Constant check ins to inquire about how you are feelings as an employee and if you feel ok with the workload, leadership, your team, etc. The company really gives off a great vibe and shows genuine interest in their employees lives.",Currently cannot think of any. I have been in a few toxic work environments and can confidently say this is not one of them. I am very happy!
15,The Lifetime Value Co.,"The whole process has been great, from the onboarding process till getting the Job",2021-07-16,5.0,Software Engineer,All the benefits are really good and the environment of work is great.,The competitive to get a job actually is hard in whichever company. But it does not mean that process is bad. In the contrary the process is good but the competitive is high.
16,The Lifetime Value Co.,The Best Company To Work For!,2021-05-20,5.0,Customer Support Quality Assurance Manager,"LTV prouds themselves on showing employee appreciation. They offer great benefits with Remote Working options. Always open to your ideas, the owners have a open door policy you can ask them anything literally! No wonder we are ranked in the top 100 best place to work!",The company is great no cons to list
17,The Lifetime Value Co.,LTV Sets a Gold Standard for Work Experiences,2021-06-21,5.0,Senior Full Stack Software Engineer,"- Fully supports remote work
- Excellent health, PTO, and other hard and soft benefits
- Top compensation
- A culture of trusting employees to be smart, creative, capable, and dependable; providing the tools needed, and as much or as little guidance as desired","- As a remote employee, I can't enjoy the perks of our main office kitchen (although they do still buy me lunch)"
18,The Lifetime Value Co.,Fosters Growth and New Ideas,2021-03-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Career path for each department allows employees to be aware of the development opportunities within the company. Since the company has several quickly growing brands, it allows junior to mid-level employees to grow in their career. 
- Senior management is always encouraging new ideas and creative ways to grow our brands. You really feel like you are part of a team and not just a chess pawn.
- Great benefits, from 401k match to free lunch through Uber Eats. LTV really cares about taking care of its employees. 
- Awesome colleagues. I've never worked with a better group of people. Everyone checks their ego at the door and shows up everyday to work as a team to accomplish our goals.",I seriously have no cons.
19,The Lifetime Value Co.,"Balanced workplace, well resourced",2021-07-09,5.0,Senior Product Manager,"- Culture of lifting everyone up + making sure everyone has what they need to be successful
- Well oiled quarterly goal process to keep things moving efficiently and in an agreed upon direction
- Robust HR and people teams",- Not un-common for some conversations to be siloed
20,The Lifetime Value Co.,great company to work,2021-08-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great team and colleague, Work from home with good benefit","none of that I can think of for now, 1A 2B 3C 4D"
21,The Lifetime Value Co.,Best Place I've Ever Worked,2021-03-22,5.0,Marketing,"I've never been someone who's had a ""career passion"" or enjoyed working at all really. Coming here has made me realize that attitude is likely the result of working for one lousy employer after another. I almost feel bad for people who start their careers here, because I believe it would be impossible to find as good of a group elsewhere. More distinct pros include:

- Fair compensation
- Benefits that are actually useful
- Feeling like your work actually accomplishes something
- A performance review system that actually works
- Smart, diverse colleagues
- A week off between Christmas and New Year's (separate from PTO)
- Responsive, accessible management
- An excellent, ahead-of-the-curve pandemic response from day one","""Con"" isn't really the right word because it implies things that, when weighed against the pros, could convince you not to work here. But there's nothing remotely like that, just some things that could maybe be improved:

- Since it's still a small (but growing) company, corporate ""departments"" you might find at larger companies may only be staffed by a handful of people. Everyone is lovely and responsive, and I trust the company to build out that infrastructure as they grow.
- Career progression can be difficult depending on the role. Again, as a small company there's often just no place for you to go until new layers of management get created. You'll still enjoy raises and bonuses and whatnot, but if you're a title chaser you might get impatient.
- The core hours of 10-5 might be a little off-putting for people who prefer an earlier or later schedule. However, I've never heard of an instance where flexibility wasn't granted when needed.
- 3 weeks of PTO looks, on paper, a little low for the technology sector. However, factoring in the extra week around the holidays (when most people use PTO anyway) and all 10 federal holidays, most people would probably say the total vacation package is fine as is."
22,The Lifetime Value Co.,Great Company To Work For,2021-04-30,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- The executive team really worries about employees wellbeing
- Very smart people working as a team

 - Great perks and competitive compensation",No real cons of working here.
25,The Lifetime Value Co.,"Data-driven, collaborative, no BS",2021-02-22,5.0,Business Intelligence,"The company heavily values data: we do hundreds of tests a year and base most if not all of our decisions on what we see from results, not personal feelings. No big egos. Leaders roll up their sleeves and get in the weeds when needed. Everyone helps each other out, and we are given a lot of freedom to make our career what we want. From what I can tell, people also owe up to their mistakes and we try, fail, learn, and repeat","Culture is tech and data-heavy, which isn't for everyone."

37,The Lifetime Value Co.,First Time Working in a Company That Feels More Like a Family,2021-09-14,5.0,Senior Quality Analyst,"I started at LTV Costa Rica +5 years ago and definitely it was one of the best professional decisions I've ever made.


1- Growth Opportunity: There is a career path for all the positions, it helps you to find out your next steps in your professional career, set goals and seek for a promotion, if that's what you want. Also LTV offers sessions in which you can learn from Managers and PMs about new topics and the business in general. 
2- Environment: Regardless of your position, you are always free to share new ideas/suggestions, and more than only that, you are heard. 
One more thing that makes this company different from others it's a shared feeling that makes you do what you do with love and passion. Also, everyone trusts in your work and there is always room for continuous feedback.

39,The Lifetime Value Co.,It is the best company to work,2021-12-13,5.0,Front End Developer,All the benefits are great,there are not cons in this plave haha
40,The Lifetime Value Co.,Software Engineer,2021-08-23,1.0,Software Engineer,Bonus at the end of the year,"Many juniors with or without experience get hired, and you can't really learn much from seniors.

It's known (internally) that some women with more experience make less money than men in the company. 

If you're not happy with your salary, the technology you're working on, or you struggle to learn something, they find it easier to ""let you go"" so they can keep saying they're the best company to work for.

They have the most humiliating process of laying off people. Usually, managers or leads meet and they're told that a person is going to be fired on a particular day (or same day) and they should communicate it to their teams. You don't even get a reason when you ask why. And they say ""we have to let you go"". Each year at least one person is laid off, and the process sometimes seems to be random but it never affects the sacred circle of leads, managers, or people who have been working at the company for more than 4 years."
41,The Lifetime Value Co.,An awesome company for personal and professional growth,2021-03-22,5.0,Data Engineer,"LTV Co. offers a competitive pay with great benefits and a healthy work environment. I recently started working on the company and the amount of help and support I get from my coworkers is astounding, they are always willing to help others and this a common behavior in the company. I consider that the benefits here are awesome and more impressive than in other companies based on my personal experience. E.g. LTV offers a good private healthcare, flexible work schedule and a personal budget for education, health and food, which in my opinion, is very rare among companies. Also, because I am an engineer, things like the technologies the company uses, the infrastructure of the projects and the way they handle standards and source control are very important to me, and I can say the company handles all those things very well. Finally they have a career path defined for each person which is also something I am always looking for in a company.","To be honest, I don't have a single complaint about the company. I consider it to be a good company overall."
42,The Lifetime Value Co.,Best place to work if you don't mess with the wrong people,2021-08-29,4.0,Software Engineer,"* Good work environment: friendly team mates and a very good organization which help you to make clear your duties.
* Your effort is rewared with opportunities to grown and recognition.
* Best working gear, most of the time is new from the box.
* End of year bonuses.
* Growing company.
* Flexible as far you do your job.","Only thing which I can say is the way of how the soft skills are seen over the technical or more relevant skills, that causes some people be seen as more valuable than they really are because are more sociable or the time they have in the company.. as result get positions like ""Associate Director"" even if they don't deserve it."
43,The Lifetime Value Co.,LTV: The best place to work.,2021-06-21,5.0,Mid QA,"I have been working on LTV for three years and a half. Is my first job in my entire life.
