Our trainer’s hands on style created an assured mindset within all of his students and his verbal skills dissipated any feelings of tension or anxiety within his students.,"Personally, a bit of an extended training period would have been comforting.

I plan to buy all my own within a few months so I don't have to pay on it for a year but still wish the entry price wasn't so high"

50,Titan Protection and Consulting,Amazing Training,2021-06-08,5.0,Unarmed Security Officer,The training is incredible and really informative on the do's and dont's of enforcement officers. With so many ex Law enforcement you get to really learn what it's like even though we don't hold as much authority.,The only real cons to consider are the fact we need more workers.
51,Titan Protection and Consulting,Titan,2021-07-13,5.0,Armed Guard,Great company to work for,None so far that I’ve experienced
52,Titan Protection and Consulting,Titan is the Best!,2021-05-26,5.0,Security Officer,Detailed training with some of the best instructors who are also former or retired police officers.

58,Titan Protection and Consulting,Great Place to grow,2021-05-26,5.0,Field Manager,"Advancement is easier then other places.
Pay is decent","Lots of hours, but it is worth it"
59,Titan Protection and Consulting,Great if interested in Law Enforcement,2021-04-09,3.0,Armed Security Officer,"Plenty of Hours, get to use a gun and other equipment. Company is Local to the Kansas City Area.",Pay is low for the risks that come with being an armed officer. Moving up into management positions can be tough because there are over 300 Guards and limited opportunities for advancement. The scheduling could be alot better as well as communication from management. You won't receive any raises or PTO until your first year is up.
60,Titan Protection and Consulting,Great people and training,2021-05-04,5.0,Security Officer,Great people to be around and the training is very thorough and engaging.,So far no complaints at all.
61,Titan Protection and Consulting,Great job,2021-05-04,5.0,Armed Security Officer,Really great environment and nice people,There is nothing bad at this company they are really great
62,Titan Protection and Consulting,"Great people, terrific supervisors",2020-12-27,5.0,Unarmed Private Security Officer,All supervisors are incredibly friendly people that you can see care about us. Our scheduler Josh Coupe also really looks out for our well being and helps get us the shifts that best fit our situations,"Some posts can be a slight annoyance to work at, but those are largely due to the companies that hired security and the type of people in the area"
63,Titan Protection and Consulting,Great Start,2020-12-16,5.0,Security Officer,"The training offered is very in depth and professionally executed. Although I have literally no experience and limited expertise in the area, I was immediately made to feel a valuable part of the team. The recruiter as well as the instructors have been extremely patient and have made the first days of my employment very enjoyable.",Nothing to add at this time.
64,Titan Protection and Consulting,Great place to start your career,2021-03-03,5.0,Field Operations Manager,"If you are lookin at getting into the security world Titan has wonderful training, competitive pay, and a wonderful staff that cares about their employees.","Must be willing to work hard, though it pays off"

67,Titan Protection and Consulting,So far so good,2020-08-05,5.0,SSO Armed,"So far so good, been with them a week and the training is great, couldn't do a lot of hands on stuff because of COVID-19 but there was still a lot of verbal instruction. 
I appreciate the amount of effort they put into us and I appreciate the gear rental!","The only con I have is my first post is crazy far and I don't have a lot of money right now because I have a family of 4 to support through covid and I can't afford all the ammunition. I was told $10 a box in my interview but it's 16.50 and I also was told I would only have to provide range ammo, eyes and ears but that's only part of it. Which is fine I will figure it out! Small con"
68,Titan Protection and Consulting,Run,2020-09-12,1.0,Dispatch Supervisor,I loved the job itself. The pay wasn't bad and neither were the hours ONLY IN DISPATCH AND ONLY IF NOT A SUPERVISOR.,The reason this company has five stars is they ask the new employers who haven't been burned yet to rate five stars for a button or whatever. This company runs you into the ground unless your a favorite then they let you run others into the ground for them. They don't follow their own rules unless it's for their benefit and I am shocked they haven't been sued. I worked here for two years and thought I could survive longer. It's like the toxic gaslighting relationship you don't realize how bad until you leave. If you are thinking about applying for this position please don't. It's 24/7 and they don't care about your health and wellbeing until you put in your two weeks and they realize they'll have to work.
69,Titan Protection and Consulting,Excellent Companu,2021-02-14,5.0,Senior Security Officer,"The training, the salary, the locations","The locations. The uniforms, and the long shift hours."

73,Titan Protection and Consulting,Lots of lies,2020-12-29,2.0,Senior Security Officer,"Overtime if you want it, pay is decent, promotional programs","The interview is full of lies, dont give you posts you want, call on days off, get mad if you call in sick, swap schedule last minute, management, quick training, hire anyone with a pulse, throw you out on your own and never train other officers are responsible for training, reward for positive review, get into promotional program and never go up"
74,Titan Protection and Consulting,Great place,2020-12-04,5.0,Armed Security Officer,Overtime whenever you want to take it,None that I can think of

91,Titan Protection and Consulting,Pretty Average,2020-04-13,3.0,Senior Security Officer,It's a pretty average security company. They do their post to train you and most employees seem cool. Pay is decent for the skills required.,"The biggest problem is scheduling, unless you are hired for a specific assignment you will be moved all over the Kansas City metro area and all different times. Not unusual to get off work at 2330 and then have to be back at work 0600. Make sure when you get hired you are very clear with dates and times that you can work. Because if you are ""available"", you will get scheduled for something. These are problems with all security companies, but it is worse here than most. Do yourself a favor and really try to get hired for a specific assignment."

147,Titan Protection and Consulting,There are other options out there- choose one of them!,2018-05-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have met some nice people working alongside me. Sadly, these people are treated poorly as reflected below.","Mandatory overtime not explained in orientation
Little to no training on job sites and procedures
Unprofessional management and staff
Inexperienced management
Poor wages
Lack of concern for employee safety-no vest
Favoritism towards employees
Unprofessional work behavior
Unable to accrue PTO and vacation 
Unable to move up on company
No policy for illness, emergency, etc. 

This company advertises as being innovative and “fast-growing.” The reason Titan is always adding new employees is because they cannot retain staff due to the reasons listed below. This company lacks concern for employee safety, sending officers into the field in high-crime areas without appropriate safety devices such as a bullet-proof vest. The management which consists of false titles such as corporal and lieutenant promote unprofessionalism in the workplace-reprimanding some employees for certain behavior yet condoning the same behavior for another. Titan is full of fine print, shady antics and is a poor excuse for a high-end security company. There are many other choices for private security companies out there and I hope that prospective employees reading this review and choose accordingly. 

-Mandatory overtime not explained in orientation
-Little to no training on job sites and procedures
-Unprofessional management and staff
-Inexperienced management
-Poor wages
-Lack of concern for employee safety-no vest
-Favoritism towards employees
-Unprofessional work behavior
-Unable to accrue PTO and vacation 
-Unable to move up on company
-Punishment for illness, emergency, etc"

150,Titan Protection and Consulting,"Sub-Par Security, Amateur Hour",2015-09-16,2.0,Armed Security Officer,"- Supervisors generally respond in a timely manner and communication with them is usually excellent.
- Uniform shirts (while of poor quality) are provided for you
- Benefits package is available
- Will work with you if you are in school
- Helpful employer of veterans","- Upper management has extreme disconnect from what actually occurs on protected sites employees work.
- Management doesn't care about their employees' safety or health. 
- Policies do not allow actual security work to occur. I was told quote, ""You will not intervene if there is a violent encounter. You will just call the police and observe"". 
- Observe and Report posts often have armed guards with entire duty belts, unable to do anything because prevented by policy.
- Company defer extra expenses for gear to employees
- Company will drop you to minimum wage for the remainder of your term if you give less than two weeks notice before leaving (even 13 days notice)."
