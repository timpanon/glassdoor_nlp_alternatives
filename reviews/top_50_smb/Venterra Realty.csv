0,Venterra Realty,BEST COMPANY EVER!,2021-04-14,5.0,Better Living Consultant,"I have worked for Venterra Realty for 1 Year and this is my first time working in property management and let me tell you this has been the best year of my working life. I am excited to wake up and come to work everyday. I love that Venterra sticks to their core values, helps each employee reach their goals, and that they make sure that every employee feels appreciated. Venterra Realty is hands down the best company I have ever worked for.",There is no cons in my opinion.
1,Venterra Realty,Awesome Culture! Opportunity for growth,2022-03-26,5.0,Better Living Consultant,"I absolutely love my time working for Venterra so far. I have been a leasing consultant here for about 6 months and my entire time here has blown me away. I was shocked by how much the company genuinely seems to care about the employees and set them up for success. The culture is set up to favor team work, cooperation, and genuine care. I have been with companies before that say that they value their employees and they value genuine care, but the way they show it is empty. This is not the case with Venterra. From what I have seen so far, they prove day in and day out that they actually place importance on their values. I haven't met a coworker or manager yet that hasn't been a pleasure to work with or for, and this is thanks to everyone being set up with the tools they need to be successful and to foster team work and comradery. There is also a lot of room for growth, Venterra always tries their best to hire from within and provide opportunities for current employees. Also, Venterra pays a portion of college tuition if you are a student, and has initiatives set up to assist anyone that is interested in learning and growth.","It honestly is hard to think of cons. Of course, nowhere you work will be completely perfect, but Venterra is pretty darn close. I guess one con is that it doesn't always feel like there is enough staff for coverage if there is an unexpected outage. I always feel like I can take scheduled time off if I need to, but if I ever have an emergency on a day where someone else is off it leaves the office understaffed."
2,Venterra Realty,"Love, Love, Love",2022-03-26,5.0,Better Living Consultant,"Amazing work environment, appreciates employees feedback, recognition and praise no matter your position level. Great communication. Great pay, so many different opportunities to make more money. Promotes within.",There is not much I could say here.
3,Venterra Realty,Great Recruiting Experience,2022-03-25,5.0,SR Manager Human Resources,Very friendly employees throughout the recruitment process,Covid impacted timing between steps
4,Venterra Realty,You Live & Learn At Venterra,2022-03-14,3.0,Better Living Manager,"At Venterra, it is better living for residents, it’s appreciated. Residents become family and even with the good and the bad, our hard work is appreciated and residents do love us for it. Celebrations are big with Venterra - birthdays, anniversaries, appreciation days, you’ll never go hungry at a Venterra community. I love that you get a day off for your birthday, reduced rent as an employee that lives on site, great bonuses. My manager was amazing. She cared for her staff and went above and beyond to get all that she could for us as her team. Loved it!","Residents and prospect safety comes before staff unfortunately. We pretty much have to lay down for whatever they ask for or need. Venterra is all about numbers and getting guest cards done. Those come first and the system comes off as pushy, aggressive and bothersome. Venterra tries to Murrow Chick Fil A’s purpose and mission and that is a fail unfortunately. In the case of my office staff, where our community is in the process of being sold, immediately you’re treated less than. Venterra’s actions towards you completely change. You’re treated like a stepchild before you even depart from the company. It’s so sad. Communication with recruiting is very bad, even when you express your passion to move forward with the company and possibly stay with them. Very fake."
5,Venterra Realty,LOVE coming to work EVERYDAY!,2022-02-25,5.0,Community Manager,"Venterra keeps things simple, and fun!!! I truly enjoy coming to work every single day. The culture is amazing, and the people are even better!",I can't think of any cons worthy of posting.
6,Venterra Realty,Amazing workplace backed by a great company culture and endless opportunities for growth!,2022-02-22,5.0,Communications Manager,"From the start, Venterra was one of the most welcoming workplaces that I have entered. Each and every colleague that I have interacted with is kind and wants to help whether it be giving you the resources you need or walking you through a new process. 

Collaboration is something that sets the company apart from others, making it truly feel like a family - and with 65+ properties in different locations that can be a hard thing to accomplish! As a remote employee, I am thankful to have opportunities to work with various colleagues throughout the company on a daily basis.

Leadership encourages employee input for improvements, with no ideas too small or large. The company emphasizes personal growth through compensation reviews, management surveys, education stipends, and more. Your career is really what you make of it here.",None that I can think of!
7,Venterra Realty,"Times, they are a changing...",2022-03-03,2.0,Community Manager,"The employees are amazing. All of our properties, in my area, work as a team and help each other out. 
I have had opportunities with Venterra that I never had with other companies. I have had the privilege to work in other departments, like the acquisition team, so broaden my knowledge and understanding of the process.","The employee experience use to be Venterra's number 1 priority, but recently, employee experience has taken a backseat to the bottom line. Decisions are made at the corporate level that deeply impact the onsite team, with no insight from the team members it will be affecting. There has become a disconnect from off-site (corporate) and onsite. The numbers are beginning to mean more than the people. This is in direct contradiction to the company that I have known for years."
8,Venterra Realty,Unhealthy management,2022-02-24,3.0,Better Living Consultant,"- Industry standard pay
- Benefits
- Work life balance","Venterra has some of the worst management I have ever worked for. They are toxic. Employees are frequently belittled by management, forced to do things outside of the scope of their job descriptions, and often take on some of the workload from management. Management is hardly present on the property during the workday.

The cost of living adjustments are atrocious and you are capped on pay, despite not making enough at that pay rate to comfortably lease an apartment from Venterra.

Commission structure for leasing units is well below the market rate. Even if you make Venterra a million dollars, you are barely compensated."

Which is to say- BETTER than anyone else! My only regret is not getting here sooner! The company culture motivates all their employees to be their best, give 101%, go the extra mile, and every other positive cliché ever!","Not a con at all, but this is no place for slackers! If you're not ready to give 101% everyday... this may not be the place for you."
12,Venterra Realty,Accept No Substitute,2022-01-18,5.0,Regional Director of Property Management,"Forward thinking, receptive to employee feedback, reviews are actual reviews and not just words on a piece of paper, every employee receives money to put towards life long learning, team celebrations for milestones and birthdays, work anniversaries, no one is stuffy-everyone is on the same team.","fast paced and always changing. If you don't do well with change, Venterra is not the place for you. 

May be time to revisit vacation time in general."
13,Venterra Realty,Certified Make Ready,2022-01-18,5.0,Certified Make Ready,Venterra is an awesome company to work for. Very family oriented company. Takes care of their employees always.,"Sometimes the work load can be overwhelming, but we contract out as needed to ensure that the work completes."
14,Venterra Realty,No way,2022-02-23,1.0,Assistant Maintenance Manager,None to mention. Not worth it.,Micromanaging is a thing. They are very judgmental of new employees. They provided almost no training. They do not care about their employees unless you are in tight with the regionals or area managers. One of the worst companies I have ever worked for. Don't fall for their false promises and lies.
15,Venterra Realty,True to core values,2022-01-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company is true to its core values. They don't just preach it, they live it.",Some things can be too decentralized at times.

26,Venterra Realty,Venterra is the place to go to grow!,2021-12-02,5.0,Area Manager,"You make a difference. Your voice is heard regardless of your title within the organization. Culture and employee benefits are incredible. We make time to have fun! Venterra is innovative and forward-thinking while not losing sight of the most important thing, their employees who work daily to serve others. I started 5.5 years ago with zero experience and have had the opportunity to serve as a Leasing Consultant, Senior Leasing Consultant, Community Manager, Senior Community Manager, and now newly created position Area Manager. If you are ready to grow, Venterra is the place to go!","I love Venterra, I do not have any cons."
27,Venterra Realty,"15 years later,,,",2021-12-16,4.0,Director of Maintenance Operations,Values based company that says what they mean and means what they say! Executives all genuinely want what is best for their employees and have thus created an exceptionally welcoming and kind work culture.,Still a bit slow to implement profit sharing and investment tools for employees. Would like to see an effort made to allow employees to invest in the organization.
28,Venterra Realty,"It's like white-water rafting. The question is, do you like white-water rafting?",2021-12-01,4.0,"Vice President, Innovation","When I started with Venterra, what caught my attention was that they were a young startup with tons of growth potential. The first interview I had was by phone with an executive in Canada. My second, another phone interview with a different executive in Canada. By the end of the second call, my curiosity was piqued, as both interviewers were very passionate about the company they were building. At the time, I was in Austin, but to meet with a third person, I needed to drive to a property they had just acquired in Arlington, TX. 

I circled that property three times before deciding that driving off was not an option! Let’s just say the curb appeal wasn’t the best. But I committed to the interview, someone was waiting inside, and I needed to at least see it through, but my head was already back in Austin. Or so I thought. Once again, I was met with passion, and real talk about real problems that Venterra wanted to solve. Venterra's values were impressed on me now for a third time: Honesty and Integrity, Humility, Never-ending Pursuit of Excellence, Candor and Openness, Team First, Unparalleled Service Excellence, and Prudent Cost Management. Now, every company has corporate values, but trust me, few truly live and run their company by them. I knew this first-hand, and Venterra's values aligned with my own. Specifically, I prefer to be honest and candid with people,over playing politics, and I pursue the best in everything I do; both traits which I’ve been known to sometimes exhibit to a fault. 

In the end (of the beginning), what got me to say yes (when I was a hard ""no"") was the people and their passion for what they were building. I wanted in and was hungry to make an impact, but I had no intention of being here still, 17 years later. 

As I reflect on my tenure, I am very much aware of why I have stayed and continue to believe in Venterra: Synergy. Aligned values. Excellent leadership. And the autonomy, tools, and trust to try to make the world a better place every day. It’s more like a long-term, solid friendship than a job. We discuss problems that need to be solved, we get real, we have fun together. We understand that while there will always be challenging times, we are in it together, for the long haul. We are in it to support one another and ensure that everyone is living up to our highest potential. 

I am grateful to have spent the last 17 years with Venterra. I have been exposed to and learned so much from great and smart people, and I am so grateful for the growth, both internally and externally, that we’ve all experienced.","Working for Venterra isn't for everyone, though. It has the heart of a start-up and the mind of the tenured 20-year company that it is. I often say my job is a lot like white-water rafting but in the nude. It's fun and exciting, scary as hell, stressful, and leaves me feeling vulnerable sometimes, but, we get through it, together. If you aren't afraid of hard work, are looking to make an impact, if you’re looking for the real deal, if you're looking for opportunities, and most importantly - this one is a must - if you share our values, come on board!"
29,Venterra Realty,Not a fulfilling workplace,2021-12-21,1.0,Better Living Consultant,They give you good time off but good luck trying to get time off because the managers have ulterior motives. They don't give you time off easily especially when you work hard.,"There are a lot of politics. It's like poison. The regional manager and managers all play politics. The regional manager may not be aware of property managers assigning leases to the assistant manager when she hasn't even worked for it. Plus property managers give time off to assistant managers in the form of sick days despite them not being sick. The company lacks ethics. For example, they claimed they sprayed apartments for covid when they weren't even fully cleaned. You're ultimately a number to get the job done for the investors. You will not have any wealth for retirement. It's for people who like a paycheck and comfort. Zero growth or fulfilment."
30,Venterra Realty,awesome,2021-11-16,5.0,Leasing Consultant,great company and benefits to work for.,no cons were at this company.

I have met and talked to so many people in different areas and always walk away impressed and better off after meeting them. I never have those ""I wish I had that 30 minutes of my life back"" meetings.

The attitude this company seeks and cultivates runs deep. The Core Values truly drive everything and it really pays off.",None. Four more words required.
34,Venterra Realty,Awesome Company that truly cares,2021-11-01,5.0,Better Living Consultant,"Great benefits, great starting pay if you are starting out in the industry, TONS OF OPPORTUNITY AND SUPPORT FOR GROWTH, the company truly cares about having a work life balance, and truly caters to their employees. Venterra understands the benefit of working and having fun. overall. The company always tries to find a better way of doing things and they listen to all recommendations. 10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND!","Literally, there are no cons."
35,Venterra Realty,My 4 Year Mark,2021-10-22,5.0,Assistant Maintenance Manager,"I have worked for many management companies and private owners over my 10 years in maintenance. This has been the only management company that has treated me with the respect and care that I deserve. They value my opinion. They allow you to make mistakes and grow from them. Every staff member and corporate personnel is down to earth and knowledgeable in their field. I can't say that about too many others. Where people lack in experience, they make up for it by asking questions. It has been great working for Venterra.","This is regionally specific, but it can be hard to move up once you hit certain positions. It isn't so much that they are only looking for people from the outside to lead, but the opportunities for advancement hit a wall if the company hasn't focused as much in acquiring other properties in the region. Sometimes it's the market; sometimes it's a lack of future venture in the region.

If you are a Mentor, you go to different properties to train new people and help them become ""Venterrized"". There aren't many people in each region to do this job, so we may use Microsoft Teams to train them. Teams, while useful in some settings, is not well suited for maintenance personnel training. It also doesn't come with a raise. If the Mentor and Mentee both fill out a survey, the mentor gets a small bonus. But, for a multitude of reasons, the Mentee does not fill out a survey and the Mentor does not receive the bonus. It may be wise to include a raise ($.25, $.50 etc.) for those people that want to go above and beyond the job they originally were hired to do. It isn't much of a con to me, but it does get annoying."
36,Venterra Realty,"Culture, Stability, Proffesionalist",2021-10-19,5.0,Community Manager,"I can honestly say Venterra is an amazing company to work for!

 They truly care about their employees and set the bar high for the apartment industry as a whole. They tend to keep their assets for the long term and do not have quick turn around sales after acquiring properties. Whenever they sell a property they are selling an asset that is 1000x better than when they purchased it. 
Should your property ever be put up for sale you truly do not fear the unknown. They are honest and transparent through these processes and make you feel safe through them. There will always be a place for you at Venterra if you are dedicated and you can rest assured that there is a role for everyone. 
We have plenty of employees that have been at one property during a sale and within a short amount of time they are back with us at a different asset!

If you are looking for a great company that does not see you as just a number and cares about your work, life and family balance look no further than Venterra!",No cons! Great company to establish a life long career with.

Prior to joining Venterra, every place I worked was just ""a job"", but from my first day with Venterra, I knew this place was different. Many places say they are like a family- but with Venterra- it has been true! I am consistently pushed to be the best version of myself by my peers and leaders. I am invited to show up every day to work and leave with a sense of accomplishing something special. You know it is a special company when lifelong friends outside of the business can tell me how proud they are of my growth since joining Venterra.

-The pay is fantastic. The benefits are fantastic. Education, Health, Dental, Vision, 3rd party packages, etc. 
-20% off rent at any Venterra property is very nice and makes it all the more a profitable career to pursue. Venterra properties are extremely nice compared to other competitors, so you're living in good quality housing.","-On Call shifts can become hectic. I speak for those around me who've confided their feelings about being on call, I am very passionate and loving of my job and will take the calls all day and night happily. But summer time, and extreme weather events tend to rake in the hours at unusual times making your week on call a very exhausting and stretched out week. (The OT makes up for this once you see your paycheck, but sometimes everyone would rather the sleep than $20-$30 for a quick repair.)"

My direct manager makes me feel valued, gives constant feedback so I always know what is expected of me, and she values my input. One of the things I love most about working here is the lack of cattiness, I know it seems crazy, but if you have ever worked in a negative environment, you really appreciate it when you no longer deal with that. Venterra values their people and when they say ""Team First"" they mean it. The benefits are wonderful, I was recently out on FMLA while having bilateral knee replacement, and my supervisor was super supportive, she never made me fear for my job and often checked in on me asking me to rest and take time to recover. My coworkers, supported me by helping out with my community and my team, I never feared for my job, I knew they had it in hand! I get 3 weeks of paid vacation, life insurance, medical, dental, 401K, vision, discount program through several vendors and retailers, and have 2 vacation sites available to me for free through the company! This is truly a great place to work!","We are a small property management company, and employees are happy and don't leave, this makes it hard to get a promotion.

Venterra it self is not a over all bad company to work for it’s really not. It’s always and always have been the person that is placed in a certain position, Micromanaging, very very bad energy, it’s very toxic. I love the company it self and the people are great there, but I refuse for a company with toxic vibes and being divided based on positions of titles.

62,Venterra Realty,"A company with a genuine culture, that's in growth mode, and offers many opportunities to have an impact",2021-02-11,5.0,Customer Experience Manager,"* Genuine Culture - The values are not just writings on the wall. Everyone here genuinely represents the company's values and the leadership team regularly use the values as a North-star for the decisions they're making.
* The service we offer is a home, it's where people live. Every decision made can have a profound effect in someone's life.
* The industry is outdated and going through a critical phase where everyone is trying to catch-up to modern tools, standards, and processes. This provides many opportunities for each employee to have a big impact in the company's success.
* It's just as common to encounter employees that have been with the company since near its inception as it is to encounter new employees. There is strong tenure, people are happy here so they stay.","* Leadership team has embraced change a bit too much and is trying to become the first to adopt unproven technology. The pace at which things are implemented or change can sometimes be overwhelming.
* The expected pace of progress makes it difficult to make objective and empirically-sound decisions. Analytical minds that are not comfortable making decisions based primarily on intuition and experience may feel frustrated at times."

In the few years I have been here, Venterra has only gotten more collaborative, more caring, and more inclusive, which is pretty impressive given the fact that the company hit its 20 years very recently.","Venterra is always ready for technological adaptation but struggles with adapting to unforeseen (especially personnel) changes. The last few staffing changes in our office were unexpected and created pretty massive waves in the work-life balance and workload of many others in the group, lasting many months after the event. This likely could have been avoided with redundancy planning. This can make their goal setting structure quite difficult to adhere to."

Consistent positive and constructive feedback from management","Vacation could be better. It starts at 10 days and you don't get anymore until you've been with the company for a few years. I'm fine taking vacation without pay, but it's not easy to get that time off.
Workstation isn't ergonomic. It's literally painful to sit at my desk daily because of my chair. 
Quarterly Bonuses for BLCs look more like a rounding error than a bonus.
The first week of the month I don't get any days off. It'll switch between working 7 days in a row or 8 days depending on the month. Because of how the pay period works, you don't get any over time. So you're basically working 60 hours in one week but with no overtime to make it worth it."

85,Venterra Realty,The worst decision I’ve ever made,2020-11-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Sometimes they paid for food,"This is a company that has no idea of the direction they intend to go. This company wants to run in 20 different directions all at once. Not a great place for someone who is a thinker and tends to have innovative and creative ideas. Ideas were constantly shut down by management. You would think they would embrace new ideas given that their whole ppc catalogue was severely flawed. For example, most of the portfolio had keywords and ads that said houses for sale when they ONLY rent out apartments. 
This is not a place you would want to work if you prefer to have some kind of structure. The department is disorganized and chaotic. They do not have a centralized location to manage tasks and communication. Instead they have a ton of excel spreadsheets, Voxer (which wasn’t bad), they have like 40 or more teams channels (when I asked my manager which ones I need to keep up with I was told all of them), they use trello (something I suggested to centralize tasks and communication. I did not expect for it to just be one more thing to keep up with), they used Dropbox, of course they used emails, phone conversations and more. Due to this chaotic system it was easy for management to say they assigned work that was never actually assigned. They can easily say it was discussed on a phone conversation that never took place. It covers them but throws the employee under the bus. 
There’s been times I would need to do my work 2 or 3 times because everyone had edit access to excel and someone would erase my work. This job offers NO training. They expect you to just come in and easily adapt to their disorganized chaos. 
Let’s also talk about meetings! It is not uncommon for the director to announce a mandatory meeting at 4pm to be held at 5pm the same day and last up to 2-3 hours. In a lot of those meetings I had no idea what was even being discussed (hence the lack of any training). When I said I don’t know about any of this stuff, the response would be you’ll get it eventually. Eventually never came. 
This company is the definition of micromanagement. It got to a point where I decided to show them how ridiculous they were being by providing them with a progress report daily. I thought they would have looked at it and realized that I was working hard and that they were being unreasonable in constantly checking on me. I was wrong. Instead it just became a requirement that I provide this report daily. 
The sheer volume of work is ridiculous. I held a job that could have easily been split into 3-4 jobs. I was a ppc specialist, a seo specialist, social media specialist, data analyst, a strategist (all though none of my suggestions were ever appreciated), etc... This may not seem like a lot until you consider that they have over 60 locations and counting. To break this down, their PPC portfolio alone would contain about 50-60 campaigns. Each campaign had at least 3 ads per ad group. Some campaigns had more than one ad group. At any given moment they can say we want to run a new promo and need to change all the ads. That’s 150 - 200 ads that need to be changed right away. Updating that many ads by yourself can easily take a whole work day or 2. Sure they will say they will help. The times that help was offered, they bailed after doing just a few campaigns due to having other work to do. There was a time that I ended up working late to change the ads and even got up at 4am to complete the remaining ads. This extra work and dedication was overlooked and not appreciated at all. 
I worked hard and at one point I was told regularly how good of a job I was doing. I was told “I don’t know what we would do with our you”. Of course all of that was just empty words because not even a month later I was fired and I was told how horrible of an employee I was. I was fired in the middle of a pandemic with a 7 month pregnant wife who was on my insurance along with my kids. I was thrown away like garbage and all the work I did for them didn’t matter anymore. They made it clear that I was nothing to them. No job should make their employees feel that way."

Usually maintenance doesn't get treated well or even like a person. Venterra has given me hope that there are companies out there that have some decency and morality when it comes to their employees.",I havent found one yet worth mentioning.
120,Venterra Realty,Very awesome!,2019-09-04,5.0,Maintenance Technician,Your chances for growth are amazing. I never been around a company that actually pushes you for growth and want to see you succeed within that company. Don't get me wrong it is just different when you see people that pushy for growth and see your growth as they were wrong this is a very great company and I wouldn't change a word I'm saying.,The challenges are not that great because you always have someone to Mentor you as well as walk you through the things that you don't understand it's amazing how you have people willing to take the time not only to see you grow that help you was well through your growth..
121,Venterra Realty,Finally A Company That Loves Their Employees,2019-08-10,5.0,Better Living Manager,"Benefits, schedule, Life long learning, training, pay and so much more!",Nothing that I can think of.
122,Venterra Realty,7 years and counting,2019-07-17,5.0,Community Manager,I have been working for the company for 7 years and didn't even notice how fast time went by. I enjoy coming to work for many reasons and the one and most important is my company. The culture is unique and makes you feel and know that you're an important piece of this organization and play and a huge role in its development and growth. Your opinion matters and your suggestions are being taken seriously. This not only makes your job meaningful but also makes you feel appreciated and valued.,Can't think of any major flaws.
123,Venterra Realty,Another year makes seven!!,2019-07-15,5.0,Regional Manager,"I have been working for Venterra Realty for 7 years now.  Very happy to call this company my family.  Pro's: We give our employees the autonomy to do their job.  We give them the freedom to make decisions and learn from mistakes.  We don't judge.  We assist and support.  We take good care of our employees with excellent benefits including an amazing insurance plan,  paid days off for volunteering, birthdays, holiday pay and special perks specific only to Venterra.  We don't always agree but we respect our difference of opinions.  We all have a voice and are heard.  People in this company will go the extra mile to help and give others the resources they need to succeed.  Venterra has such a positive atmosphere.  The vibe is extremely motivating.  I couldn't see myself working anywhere else.","Cons:  Honestly...I can't think of any.  There are so many different property management companies out there that claim they are a ""great place to work"" but honestly.....it takes a lot of work to be ""great"".  Venterra works very hard to achieve this status."
124,Venterra Realty,"Live Better, Care More",2019-07-02,5.0,Corporate Employee,"One thing that really sets Venterra apart from most other companies is our culture and living by our values. We are always encouraging each other to live better, care more, and celebrate our successes. My favorite value that Venterra holds is ""humility."" We are always learning, even in our failures, and continuing to grow. Being apart of the Venterra family has been a huge blessing in my life and I look forward to many more opportunities (because there is always an opportunity for growth) and experiences to come in the years ahead. Oh, and I can't deny that I'm excited about those 5 extra days of vaca time now that I've reached my 7th year! Cheers to 7 years!",I'm struggling to think of anything at the moment...

They truly treat every employee with the upmost respect and love and have the greatest understanding that every person is different in their own way, and they use that to make the workplace unique and fun! They take care of their customers extremely well which make everyone's job easier and lovable.","Because they invest so much in new technology, it can sometimes be a little chaotic/confusing  when implementing new technology and/or many different people can be using different technologies across the organization so there is no specific standard. But this is the only item that comes to mind, which is honestly not too crazy, so that tells you how amazing the organization is!"

131,Venterra Realty,Outstanding Employer,2019-05-08,5.0,Vice President,During my recruitment Venterra made a point of selling their commitment to employee development and happiness in a dynamic and highly focused work environment. Since my arrival if anything my experience has been that the company undersold how serious they were about their 7 core values and leaderships' commitment to the business but as importantly their employees.,Through my first 5 months I really have no complaints regarding Venterra.
132,Venterra Realty,LOVE THIS COMPANY,2019-05-08,5.0,Regional Manager,There's so much room for growth with this company! I was promoted within 9 months with two raises!,I haven't experienced any so far
133,Venterra Realty,My Venterra Experience in Atlanta,2019-05-08,5.0,Make Ready Tech,From my experience working for Venterra I think they are a company that is built to fit a diversity work force.,Sometimes you can lose site that at the end of the day its still a business. Meaning they make it fun for their employees and residents that you start to become more like family.
134,Venterra Realty,Extreme Favoritism,2019-05-21,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Co-workers, nice properties, company's core values",Favoritism played by managers just as they play they games with regionals
135,Venterra Realty,A place to grow!,2019-05-06,5.0,Community Manager,"-The company culture is one that makes you feel a part of something bigger and better. 
-The opportunities to do more and do better are there if you want to put in the work.  
-We actually care for our residents and the support that you receive from your regional support team makes the job easy. 
-It's always a fun and friendly atmosphere.
-Competitive salary and bonus structure.
-Our executive team has a clear vision of where they see Venterra; making goals clear and attainable.
-You are not bogged down with red tape trying to get anything done.","Not really a con, but if your hearts not in the work or if you are ok with doing the bare minimum, you will not advance far with our company."
136,Venterra Realty,Changing for the Worst!!,2019-05-13,2.0,Leasing,"Competitive salaries, training, benefits and culture.","There is a growing disconnect between corporate and their existing properties. Company is continuously cutting the budget for things that made Venterra the great company it used to be. They cut down on small things such as welcome gifts, upgrades, hospitality items for prospects, event budget, employee compensation, etc. It may not seem like a big problem from corporate’s point of view but the residents/prospects/employees are noticing and they are turning their eye elsewhere. 

The competitors around are investing into their properties. Meanwhile, we are cutting corners on small things and expecting consultants to step in and produce sells based on personalities alone. The thing is, the new leasing process is a step by step routine that leaves little room for personality. It’s all about the sale. You’re also getting tested on how well you follow the steps. See the issue? 

Lower management is pressured to make due with the budget that they have. It is becoming unrealistic. All of this happens while Venterra buys new property after new property.  It is still a good place to work but I am afraid Venterra is heading down a bad path. This company is losing its core values along with some great people."
137,Venterra Realty,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS COMPANY,2019-04-16,5.0,Assistant Property Manager,Venterra is easily the BEST company I have ever worked for. The management is amazing and I will am so grateful to work for such a wonderful company.

When I started with this company it was such a shock as too just how much they invest in their staff compared to working for a bad company prior my initial reaction was that I will never leave this company.

141,Venterra Realty,Not everything they say,2019-02-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Everyone is nice and it is a good company culture.,My experience I think had more to do with my manager. When my annual review came up he had stuff he had held against me from almost a year prior and never mentioned and was not job related. If someone in the office had an issue with something I had said or done in passing it was brought up during the review not when it occurred which I thought was strange. I also felt like I was set up to fail in some of my job duties. Both my boss and his boss had failed at something so the task was given to me and when others involved had anger over the changes it was deemed to be my fault.
142,Venterra Realty,Best Place to Work EVER!,2019-01-21,5.0,Assistant Manager,Venterra really cares about their employees. I am so blessed and thankful to have worked here for 5 years and counting!

151,Venterra Realty,Better Living Consultant,2018-10-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Honestly everything has been great so far. I have been working part time jobs and more recently full time jobs since I was 15. This is legitimately the first place I have ever worked where everyone is kind.  My manger actually treats me like a human and is very patient and kind while I am learning everything. When I make a mistake, I am taught how to do better instead of getting yelled at. One of my previous jobs got mad at me for needing to drink water more frequently than normal and restricted when going to the bathroom was ok. Here I feel like a valued member of the team and like what I do matters. Corporate actually cares how the employees feel which is something else I am not used to. With such a great staff, even the bad days aren't bad.",So far I have not seen any!

Their systems that are in place is what has made them successful.","This company was great many years ago. Now it is unraveling at the seams. The company is promoting individuals with poor ethical track records / performance records and does so openly by making excuses to mask their history. The great people in this organization have left, or are leaving, or are planning to leave. Still some great people here but sadly many are in departments that do not impact my day to day view of the organization. I wish this wasn’t the case as it was such a wonderful place to work, now I dread coming in everyday. Leadership has progressively gotten lazier and lazier to help or assist, they choose the easy route even if it’s not the best."

I'm a full time college student and yesterday my school schedule changed abruptly. I was afraid of getting fired because it would disrupt the entire office schedule. My amazing manager adjusted the schedule and told me that they know that I care about my education, so they will work with me. I was so touched. I've never had a workplace inconvenience themselves to help an employee. Venterra is special because they take the time to care and invest into their employees.. I'll never forget this!
Awesome work culture
You get paid for going above and beyond to do a great job, hard work is rewarded
Able to see constant promotions within the company after only a month of being employed here.
They openly take advice from employees on how to do things better whether they are hourly or salaried employees.",None! It has been great!

I have an abundance of support, resources, and educational opportunities to perform to the best of my ability! Not only does the company stay progressive with modern innovations, but Venterra really “Cares” about their employees and work hard to maintain a culture of like-minded individuals with a strong work ethic and morals. One of the biggest differences that comes to mind, compared to my previous property management companies, is the contact with corporate superiors, including the CEO and COO. They are easily accessible, personable, get to know you as individuals, (despite the hundreds of employees across different regions) they value your opinions, and provide you with exceptional resources and training to run a property to its fullest potential to create a community where residents feel respected and cared for. I attribute this to the employees feeling respected and cared for, which reflects strongly in everyday operations. I had the option of transferring to another company because my property is selling, but made the easy choice to remain loyal to Venterra! The Dallas Regional Manager is the best I have ever worked with, the  properties in the region function as a team, constantly helping and supporting other locations, lending staff members to aid in heavy work load situations, sharing tips, experiences, etc. - ultimately contributing even more to a GREAT PLACE TO WORK!",Orange is my least favorite color... ;)

Venterra employees are given the opportunity and encouraged to do what we feel is necessary to provide great customer service.  Yes we do work hard but the praise given by residents  and upper Management makes the hard work that much more rewarding.  Before I joined Venterra I thought I was pretty good at being a Maintenance Manager but now after five years with Venterra and the Mentor-ship shown to me by my RMM I have learned so much more about the apartment industry and myself  which has now  instilled a daily desire for me to be a better Manager than I was the day before. The Venterra culture is work hard and do better than you think can while having fun at the same time.,"There are no cons for me to list, Venterra has accommodated any request I have had over my past five years."

Next week is our Family Fun Day where all employees get to bring their families to the venue we chose to have lunch, ride rides and have blast at the Adventure Park. We also enjoy a paid day off for our birthday every year.

There is very little company politics, (almost non-existent), everyone has a voice, the leaders are of high character, pay is good, policies are fair and there is an incredible amount of focus on employees, ensuring they are happy.   The people I work with are amazing.  I'm blessed to have found such an amazing company some many years ago.",The cons are normal...it's work.  Keep playing Lotto.

176,Venterra Realty,Pretty Awful,2018-07-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Lots of holiday time off,Leaders who have the emotional quotient of a junior high student. Regional Maintenance Supervisors who abuse their power. If you’ll be Lead around by the nose and partake this company’s for you.
177,Venterra Realty,Unfortunate,2018-06-19,3.0,Manager,"Decent company. Offers health benefits,401k.",I agree with another review about Venterra losing alot of good employees. Venterra rather let a long term employee go instead of giving them a raise. The cost of training a new employee and hoping it works out is worth giving a long term employee  a raise alone. Venterra feels that if you ask for a raise it's only a temporary fix and your not happy and your going to leave so they rather let you go. That's not the case most 90 percent of the time. If a employee invest years in a company especially  a company that does not offer stock options like venterra  all we want is to make sure we our compensated well enough and don't have to leave  and look for a new job.
178,Venterra Realty,Another Reason to Love Venterra,2018-06-04,5.0,Community Manager,"This year is number 11 for me! I love working for a company that truly cares about their employees. This company is so awesome. They recognize the need for a healthy family/work life balance.  This balance is so important that Venterra offers a vacation suite to their employees to help make this happen. My family and I just enjoyed a 6 night stay in Orlando thanks to Venterra. Our benefits package is great. We receive quarterly bonus incentives, several vacation hours, 401K, insurance plans including vision and dental.  Venterra works hard to be the best in the industry not only for their residents but also for their employees.",It's hard to decompress when you are constantly striving for excellence.  Thoughts of work tend to mix with down time.

If you are looking for a company deep-rooted in their Core Values who values YOU on a professional and personal level, look no further! I have been with Venterra for 2 years and the opportunities that I have been given in my short tenure are unbelievable! I do not feel that I am an employee working for a company, I feel that I am part of a family, the Venterra family! We work very hard but ALWAYS make time to have fun! I feel supported on a daily basis and am given the autonomy to make decisions. Venterra has made me a better person. We have education assistance to allow us to continue our journey in our growth and development. We are given the day off to volunteer through Venterra Cares, by helping others and enriching our own lives simultaneously. We have Fun Fridays allowing us to dress up in specified themes and have a blast at work with our team! Birthdays are celebrated with a paid day off, company anniversaries are celebrated, all milestones are celebrated! We have bring your dog to work day! The list goes on and on....

If that's all you care about this is the company for you.","The hiring standard has gone down hill. They are not doing as much ""Promoting from within"" as they claim. People are not being trained. Regional Managers will promise a new position to someone and then change their mind and hire from outside the company or give it to someone else without even an interview. Property Managers hired from outside the company often do not have the same values as people who have been with Venterra for a while. The new people are not being trained properly."
194,Venterra Realty,Extremely disappointing and unhealthy environment,2018-06-11,1.0,Entry Level Sales Representative,Pay checks cleared successfully on time,"I’m not sure if the Core Values are intended to be in practice or just in theory to promote the company. Perhaps they are growing at too fast a pace for oversight that allows the intended culture to filter down and have no idea what is really going on in their different locations. Maybe the unhealthy management practices come from the top and it is believed to be best practice. I can’t imagine, but maybe. 

I left as bewildered as I arrived. Some of my experiences were disturbing at best."

It's really hard to get fired.","90% of the properties are understaffed. Venterra definitely gets their work out of you and will underpay you without batting an eye.

207,Venterra Realty,My thoughts on Venterra Realty,2017-12-22,5.0,Leasing Consultant,"I love the benefits of working with this company.  I personally do not have any experience as a leasing consultant, and the starting pay they offer is above what I expected.  They also offer many employee perks/discounts, and care about their employee's family and well being.",I haven't really been with the company long enough to experience any cons.
208,Venterra Realty,Venterra has that “IT” Factor!,2017-12-06,5.0,Better Living Manager,"I would have to say that Venterra is the absolute best company to work for. They provide a warm atmosphere and outstanding customer service. Every person matters at Venterra, no matter what position. Growth is not only possible but achievable and they PRAISE their employees. The Corporate team is amazing, even the CEO himself, Mr. Foresi. I brag about Venterra to all of my friends and family. It’s not just a place of work, it’s a life long career and passion. I wake up knowing that there is no better place I would rather be.",No Cons at this time

210,Venterra Realty,The best place to work in the industry.,2017-12-05,5.0,Assistant Maintenance Manager,I've only worked for this company for 7 months and already moving up the ladder. At my last place I worked for 2.5 long years and was never appreciated as a hard worker. This place really notices all the work you do and awards work. As a maintenance tech that's huge.,Compared to my last place i cant think of one.
211,Venterra Realty,Better Living Consultant,2017-11-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great benefits and nice competitive bonus structure, great company values and clear statement of said values, involved and extensive training with experienced professionals. They very easy to communicate with, and are genuine about  help with continued growth. The property is gorgeous, well maintained by a diligent and competent staff.",The interview process is thorough but very intensive.
212,Venterra Realty,No values,2017-12-30,1.0,Community Manager,The company has a lot of great employees. The benefits are good and thet take time out to have fun.,They focus on a new employee experience. They dont focus on employees who have been with the company long term. If you are on a new acquisition you will get about two days of support and then will probably continue to remain short staffed. The company has lost touch with what truly happens on site and doesnt care to listen to your challenges.  There is no support system. I didnt feel valued as an employee or a Manager.
213,Venterra Realty,Great Place to Work!,2017-11-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Fun place with great leaders!  Really care about the employees and the residents.,Not any major cons to the company!

I could tell just from the interview process that I had found something special, and I was proven right as soon as I started work.","The wages are competitive, but not the highest in the market. I believe its a fair sacrifice for the comfort and opportunity Venterra provides."
215,Venterra Realty,Corporate Office,2017-11-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Venterra has so many perks! Birthday off, Family Days (allow for more time off with family on the Holidays), referral rewards, so many growth opportunities and resources to expand professional growth. Venterra is open to employee suggestions and quick to create the best employee experience possible.",A little over five years with Venterra and I think they have came along way in this small amount of time. They are constantly striving to make the employee and customer experience better.
216,Venterra Realty,Simply the best!,2017-11-03,5.0,Senior Regional Manager,"Open to a better way of doing things. Room for advancement if you are a consistent performer, Quarterly review process so information is relevant and of assistance. Candid feedback both welcomed and appreciated. Transparent leadership at every level. Amazing culture! We make time to have fun and celebrate both our residents and our employees.","We are not a 9 to 5 company. That can be perceived as a down side if you are a clock watcher or a nickel and dime type person. 

Have a limited set of vendors we utilize which can lead to slower turnaround."

218,Venterra Realty,Love this company!,2017-10-25,5.0,Community Manager,"I have worked for several companies within this industry, and I can honestly say that Venterra is hands down the best. They keep you informed, which is rare, and the opportunities to advance are there. I also agree with the other reviews... you will not thrive unless you are willing to give it everything you've got. What this means though, it in most cases, you are working alongside others who are willing to go the extra mile with you. The added perks that Venterra offers more than make up for the extra work. I was able to take my family on vacation to Disney for the 1st time, all because of Venterra's generosity.","Honestly, there just aren't many. Pay could always be more, but the added bonuses and perks certainly help."
219,Venterra Realty,9 yrs strong!,2017-10-20,5.0,Marketing,"I have worked with Venterra for 9 years and I truly love everything about the company.

220,Venterra Realty,Great Place to Work,2017-10-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Venterra strives to promote a culture that is fun, engaging, and makes you want to come to work. Everyone is really great at cheering each other on and supporting each other in times of need. Just seeing what Venterra did for its Houston employees impacted by Hurricane Harvey was moving. They raised $47,000 to give back to employees in need. I don't know of many companies that would make the effort to do this.","While Venterra thrives on its culture and has many great benefits in place, I feel that salaries are still below market value."
221,Venterra Realty,World Class Company,2017-10-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Venterra makes it a FUN place to work.  We are always having a contest of some sort and I feel that it keeps it fun.  Venterra also trains you to succeed and gives you the tools you need to do your job.  We also promote from within and I feel that is something people look for.,"A downside in our area is that we as a region have only 6 communities vs. 12+ we had at one point, but on a positive note, we are all close just like a family."

They put people in roles who will perform optimally and give you every tool to succeed.  I truly felt like I was never just a ""number"" but apart of something much larger.  From corporate employees like Teri, Candi, Diane, Eastin and Jessica, to onsite team members Tammie, Kristy, Bennett, Lauren, Erin, Diane, Kim, Dustin, Lili, Alex, Dustin, Gabby, Tonya, Megan, Anne, and Cassi, everyone has been a true pleasure to work alongside.","Absolutely nothing! I can't think of any cons.  I'm only leaving for simply financial and promotion related reasons.   So if the fact that I struggled with my decision to ultimately leave is a con,  that's a great con to have!"
224,Venterra Realty,Company that cares about their residents and employees,2017-10-11,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"High Customer Service level, excellent employee experience",It was a challenge working in a region that didn't have any sister communities around

If that isn't enough to be excited about ask about the WOW program!",I am so satisfied about my job there are no cons
226,Venterra Realty,My experience,2017-10-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"During the beginning of the first year being employed with Venterra, I knew nothing  really about maintenance, my first maintenance manager and his assistant took a lot of time teaching me a lot about maintenance. Including the roving manager and roving techs as well. So to them, I say thank you.","My second year was pretty much difficult. Though I  learned a lot, and was sharpening my craft,  I still felt like my second direct supervisor was thw lid on my progress. It was always, good but not good enough or bad. And as far as training, if it didn't come from Regional there was no real training. Nothing to really to prepare you for a promotion or anything to move you forward. I had to create my own way to get out of the hole that I was in by applying for a different position in a different location. In the interview I realized that it could be  a strong possibility that I was heading to the same situation that I was trying to leave but just in a different location. So after the interview and putting some great thought to my decision,  I decided to leave. So in all this, I will say that I was not perfect by no means. But what I can say is the environment that was made for me was  not great as well."
227,Venterra Realty,Better Living Consultant,2017-09-16,5.0,Better Living Consultant,This company is amazing! They truly desire for you to grow and be successful! They try to make an environment that their employees enjoy working.,It would be nice to get paid bi weekly instead of bi monthly.

Also, the annual kickoff party is really fun!",Corporate was disorganized. Information was not always relayed in a timely manner to the onsite teams.
235,Venterra Realty,Great Atmosphere!,2017-08-08,5.0,Community Manager,"Venterra creates such a great atmosphere! I love that we can be open and honest and not be ostracized for it. They also promote further education, having fun, creativity, development suggestions and growth. They always look at promoting from within before hiring new staff.  The benefits are great too. Vacation time is the best I've seen offered. Where else can you get your Birthday and a day off to volunteer?","It's a little more difficult to get hired on, but it's well worth the process."
236,Venterra Realty,"Corporate Good, Local Not So Good",2017-09-04,1.0,Leasing Consultant,"As other reviewers have noted, Venterra and the majority of its properties seem to be great places to work. Unfortunately I can't attest to this. Everyone else seems to have fun and love their jobs. There seems to be great communication and camaraderie.","Corporate and other properties seem great, but I happen to work at a property that is not so great. I was hired before the management of the local complex in Dallas came on board so I was not able to meet and evaluate if the management style would be a fit for me, as well as I for them. It turns out it's not. Management is extremely antisocial, but does turn on the social smile for upper management or important people when they come into the office. Intimidation tactics with the staff, especially maintenance staff, are used and lacks a general friendly atmosphere. Mistakes are a big no-no. If you make a mistake, like I have being new to the industry, there are no conversations with me to correct me, instead corporate meetings with regionals are call (as if it's a repeat offense) and instead of ""coaching"" there is blame and reprimand. 

Overall, the morale is low, to the point where every other person who was working at the Dallas property resigned because of leadership and management style."

Everyone has a desire to do their job well and take pride in what they do.,"As with anywhere, the company's values and culture is dependent on the leader you have. I came to this company because I heard all the great things this company does for the employees. I have seen and witnessed great things done for employees and residents. Unfortunately in my case, my manager is not quite up to par with the company's beliefs. The good treatment that I have received come from other managers in my department. I admire the fact that the managers that I don't directly report to go out of the way to make sure I feel valued. My employee experience would go from ""good' to ""great"" if my manager would treat us as valued members of the team and not make us feel ""small"" every time an evaluation comes around."
239,Venterra Realty,Most Amazing Company,2017-07-20,5.0,Community Manager,Venterra cares about the well being of their employees and properties.,No cons at this time with Venterra.
240,Venterra Realty,Regional Manager,2017-07-17,5.0,Regional Manager,"I just hit my 5 year mark and I can tell you the biggest PRO of working for Venterra Realty is the people.  I work for the most amazing, talented, genuine folks in the industry.  There are no hidden agenda's or political games.  It is what it is.   The next Pro is everyone else loves working for Venterra as well.  It's so great to work with other people that love coming to work each day.  There is great energy and an unbelievable work environment.  The leaders have incredible work ethics, (never expecting more out of you than what they would give themselves) and impeccable character.   They manage people the right way.  I've worked for companies that just didn't get it and can honestly say they, we and I....get it.  This company has the ""IT"" of ""they get it""  
Another PRO is we are growing because we are stable.  There is so much opportunity for those that want it.  If you are hungry to grow you can get on a path and move in that direction.  
Lastly, we care about the customer.  We are not just talk.  Venterra has programs in place that reward employees for going out of their way to give back to the customer.  We also have a program to give back to each other.  We have incentives in place to make sure we are treating our customers and fellow employees with the best appreciation/service/ and gratitude on the planet. It just doesn't get better than Venterra Realty.",Any cons I would have are just normal industry cons...not related to Venterra.

The core values and the culture of this company is like no other, and I am happy to be apart of this great team of individuals!","I wouldn't really say there are downsides to working for Venterra, but if I had to pick one thing, working on Sundays would be my least favorite part of the job."

I took away life-long friends after Venterra.,"What does Venterra care about? Their image. I mean, look at these reviews. They send emails to pressure you into writing a review on Glassdoor after a promotion or a work anniversary, it's even a part of the interview process! It's a joke. I loved the company when I first started years ago. Now, it's all corporate and you're all just a number. I've seen some of the best managers at this company, we'll see if they're there in 2018."
244,Venterra Realty,A Breath of Fresh Air,2017-06-21,5.0,Community Manager,"The company CARES! They welcome new ideas and push everyone to be better. There is always someone to help if I need it, or answer questions. It is all about teamwork and bringing all you've got to the table.

Venterra truly cares about their employees and residents.",I have no cons at this time to share.
248,Venterra Realty,Best Compay I Have Every Worked For !,2017-06-01,5.0,Better Living Manager,"Unlike many other property management companies, Venterra really does CARE about their employees! When I first started here, I was blown away from the amount of support and love I was getting from my co-workers. They closed down the office a few times for lunch just to help me get used to my environment and get to know everyone.. this was extremely important to me to me coming from a company that was just about business. Corporate employees are personable and get to know you on a personal level which lets face it... never happens in most other companies! The company is constantly growing and I am so excited for the opportunity to continue to grow.",I seriously can't think of a single thing!!
249,Venterra Realty,Love this Company!,2017-05-25,5.0,Community Manager,Competitive pay. Fun work environment. I always receive candid feedback. Love that the company values my feedback as well.,Sometimes there can be a lack of balance between work and home life.
250,Venterra Realty,Defintely the BEST PLACE TO WORK!,2017-05-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Benefits are good. I love the culture and the communication that we get from upper level management when changes are rolled out. Venterra does a lot of things that I have never heard of like Wowing resident and employee for just being you or if you need help. It's truly amazing! They work really hard to keep everyone engaged in what's happening with the company. Upper level management meet EVERY staff member and their all nice and open to conversation or feedback. Upper management does consider all feedback as well.,"This isn't completely a con, but compensation could be a little higher and closer to what competition pays. More in-person employee interaction as a region would also be a huge plus."
251,Venterra Realty,Best place to work EVER,2017-05-23,5.0,Senior Leasing Consultant,"Venterra is the best place to work, EVER. As an employee, you are always a valuable part of the team and your voice matters. You have the opportunity to provide a “customer experience” rather than simply customer service and truly make a difference in people’s lives. Venterra is not just another company to work for, they have a culture, core values and know how to treat their employees. Bring your dog to work day? YES! Birthday off? YESSS! Fun Fridays? YES! Venterra Cares paid time off to volunteer? YESS! Free accommodations while you vacation at Disney? YES!! Constant personal and professional growth and development in a team oriented environment? YESSSS!!",NO CONS!! BEST. PLACE. TO. WORK. EVER.

Some companies talk the talk but so far Venterra walks to the walk. Genuine, compassionate and thorough best describes it for me so far.",I do not have any cons at this time.

255,Venterra Realty,Wonderful organization,2017-04-11,5.0,Community,Working with people who care.,None to speak of today.
256,Venterra Realty,Best company ever!,2017-04-10,5.0,Community Manager,This company really does care about its employees. They hire people to make sure the employees as well as residents have a great experience. Venterra also has a Fun Committee to make sure employees also have fun while they work. Regional Managers have great relationships with their managers and are very encouraging. The company also has a very good training program and stays advanced in the market.,I wish the company would be purchasing more properties in our region. When this doesn't happen it limits the opportunities for advancement.
257,Venterra Realty,Great opportunities for advancement,2017-04-05,5.0,Community Manager,"Venterra has a great family type, start up feel but is an established company with over 500 employees. There are constant opportunities to advance if you work hard and bring value to the team. I have built some great friendships and really enjoy the feeling of accomplishment when my hard work is recognized.",I wish hours were a little more flexible and allowed Community Managers to arrive earlier and leave earlier but I understand the need to set an example for the rest of the staff.
258,Venterra Realty,Instant fit!,2017-03-15,5.0,Community Manager,"Culture, Culture, Culture!  I pride myself on being transparent in my professional and my personal life, it's nice to work with a company with the same goal in mind!  I just started with Venterra back in November of 2016, but thus far the experience has been a positive one.  Their on boarding process was easy and warm; my regional stayed in touch with me throughout my 2 week wait from offer letter to start.  I was given a mentor who stayed with me for training for a solid week even though I have 16 years experience in the industry, every company has different policies and procedures, it was nice to have someone so dedicated to seeing me be successful.  Teams throughout our region really work together, offering support and help to each other when needed.  All in all my experience thus far has been a positive one.","So far I don't see any.  That may change and if it does I will update, remember what I said about transparency."
259,Venterra Realty,Best place to work!,2017-03-15,5.0,Community Manager,"Today marks my 7 years with Venterra and I honestly could not see myself with any other company. The family feel that you have each day when you go to work and the fact that each person on your team is passionate about their career, teammates and residents makes going to work each day fun. They promote within the organization and in 7 years, I have been promoted 4 times. The customer service expectation that they set raises the bar higher than any other companies. They do annual kick-off party to celebrate the success of the employees and the properties. When looking for a place to work, you will replace the word “work” with the word “career”. We actually have a person that job title is “Employee Experience Manager"" that comes up with creative things to do to make work fun each day.",I honestly have no cons- Anytime you need anything you have someone accessible to answer any questions.
260,Venterra Realty,"Great Company, Unbelievable Benefits",2017-03-14,5.0,Better Living Manager,"You are very informed about everything. Very open company which you do not see often. Amazing programs such as our WOW and WOW-ee. They do things that no other company I have ever worked for does. They even opened up a corporate unit at one of our Florida communities to allow any employee to stay for 6 nights completely free, and it is right next to Disney. I honestly feel valued as an employee. I highly recommend.","I am sure everyone feels as though pay could be more, but when you look at everything else they do, I feel as though it does balance out."
261,Venterra Realty,This company is a gem!,2017-03-08,5.0,Community Manager,"Venterra really does have an awesome culture!

270,Venterra Realty,Better Living Consultant,2017-02-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The work life balance was great.,"Your experience working for Venterra can definitely vary based upon who your manager and assistant manager are. So, while this doesn't apply to every Venterra property it does apply to my experience. I felt harassed on a daily basis by my APM. It was a horrible environment. It was so bad that everybody at the entire property avoided her yet nothing was ever done. In fact I was punished for standing up for myself and not allowing this workplace bully who repeatedly spewed microagressions towards anyone whom was different from her make my life miserable. Ultimately moving on from this job turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me. This company hires people with no experience and promotes them because of who they know and who they like. However, they have plenty of people with experience and degrees who could proficiently perform the  job. I applied for a job in a different role while in my present role and was jokingly told by my manager that the regional didn't want a ""young cute girl working around the contractors,"" as they may not take me seriously. Just too many issues. This is an old boys club and if you are okay with that than this is the place for you. If you are looking for a real career with upward mobility and fair compensation RUN! A lot of these reviews aren't even from current employees. They ask you to complete the Glassdoor survey as a part of the interview process. The only positive thing I can say is that the work life balance was decent and the corporate office definitely made an effort to create a fun environment."
271,Venterra Realty,A Welcoming Family,2017-01-19,5.0,Better Living Consultant,"I have been at Venterra for a short amount of time, but I have loved every minute of it. Everyone makes sure you feel welcome and never hesitates to help when it is needed. I've learned more about the industry in the past couple weeks then I would have ever imagined.

The hiring process was pretty lengthy, BUT it just made me that much more excited when I was hired. They want the best, and you have to prove that you will be that for them. The interview process is just as thorough as the way they run their company and that speaks volumes in itself.",I have yet to experience on con since joining the team. I would recommend working for this company to anyone I know.

Venterra is truly a company that cares about the well-being, personal and professional growth of their employees. 
They make sure you work hard, but they also know how to make this business fun while making sure they're growing as a company!",The pay and bonus structure could use some improvement.

I have worked for other property management companies and this is definitely one of the best!,"It is not operated from a typical property management style.  It takes some adjustment time if you are coming from the ""traditional"" company that is more interested in the profit made by the property vs. the difference made in the lives that we touch."

Scorecards and surveys can be great, but they tend to be discouraging if you're not 100% perfect. Expect to submit a lot of ""better ways"" about things that should already be done. They have their own system, and it takes some getting used to if you've already been in the business."
304,Venterra Realty,Love my Job,2016-06-17,5.0,Community Manager,Employees are appreciated and have a voice,Open 7 days a week. More admin type work than I prefer. Can be stressful with all of the different score cards and ranking.

Everyone is treated with respect. Open lines of communication. Contests. Family Fun Day every year. Huge focus on customer service.,"If you are a clock watcher, may not be the company for you. Insurance benefits not the best but in all fairness, unless you work for a company with a huge number of employees, no benefits are great these days. 
We did add 401K a few years ago and I am very excited about that."
309,Venterra Realty,Greatest Company I have worked for!,2016-05-31,5.0,Community Manager,"I LOVE VENTERRA! I have only been with the company a short time, BUT I never thought a company could be so united! They treat their employees like individuals and not just a number. They value employee feedback and your voice is always heard, to the point where you are eligible for cash rewards for sharing bright ideas that can make the company better. Their core values are unheard of in this industry and really make them shine as a top rated company to work for, as well as makes their properties a joy to call home. Senior management is beyond experienced and have a vast amount of knowledge to share and assist those working under them.",They expect 150% from you and they are willing to help you in any way possible to get you there. All the tools are given to you to better yourself as a professional in the Multi Family Housing industry and Venterra's drive to give nothing but excellence to their customers reflects in the training of their employees.

Everyone works really hard to excel in all they do and to help you excel in your position as well.,"I really can't think of any cons to list, but what I can say is that this company is for people that truly enjoy helping others and really care about their customers.

312,Venterra Realty,Great place to work,2016-06-01,5.0,RMM,"I am going on 3 years with Venterra and it is by far the best company that I have been employed with. Waking up every day to work with highly dedicated people that share the same goals is truly a pleasure. Venterra dedicates an overwhelming amount of effort to ensure the comfort, safety, and convenience to our residents. I can truly say that the same effort is given to employees, with providing development and growth we are able to promote with-in, allowing us to maintain a great culture.","There are no Cons, Love Venterra."

Leasing for the past 6 months or so, no desire to go to a different company","Commissions/bonuses/hourly pay less than what most other companies pay. I guess their thinking is, they have so many other ways to ""win"" a small amount of extra money each month- you should work for it"
314,Venterra Realty,Awesome place to work; Great Work/Life Balance,2016-04-28,5.0,Corporate,"One of the greatest things about working for Venterra is the emphasis that the company puts towards its' employees' work-life balance. While things can certainly get hectic and deadlines need to be met, the company is understanding of  the need for employees to set aside personal time. The recent addition of allowing employees to take a day off for their birthday is a also a nice little perk. The corporate office tends to be a smaller group of employees, but all are great to work with and helpful when needed.","Company has continued to improve during my time here. No major complaints worth noting. Benefits were a bit below average, but are slowly making progress."
315,Venterra Realty,Excellent,2016-04-28,5.0,Better Living Consultant,"Everything is a pro! The culture, environment, upper management and incentives are amazing. Corporate really stays involved.

316,Venterra Realty,Venterra Cares,2016-04-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The BIGGEST pro to me is that my co-workers care for me....
Last month I was moving, and as a single mom I was very stressed out dealing with this alone. With the power of teamwork, secret service skills and true genuine care for me...my co-workers chipped in and hired a cleaning company to come clean my old apartment I was living in! All of this was done secretly and was such a complete surprise to me and nicest act of kindness. It was the nicest thing to do for me at this moment in time, as I was seriously dreading the thought of moving all day just to turn around and clean my old place all night. It was almost as if they tapped into my heart and soul and figured out how they could make my day better (Venterra reference). I was completely shocked by their compassion, concern, care and team effort with pulling it off. I feel so lucky to work with such a great group of people and company, and without a doubt I know they truly care about me. In my opinion, feeling appreciated, respected and loved is very rare to come across in the work field and sometimes let alone in life.",Would love better health care benefits and more competitive compensation.

Excellent organization that keeps getting better and better.","If you don't fit the company's values and vision, then Venterra is not a place for you.  It's not easy working for Venterra, but your efforts will be recognized and rewarded."

Venterra spends a lot more time on the hiring process than most companies which results in a better work experience with co-workers who are good at what they do.",I can't think of very many cons. If you are the type of person who doesn't like to work or have fun you may not thrive here.
319,Venterra Realty,Great place to work!,2016-04-28,5.0,Marketing Department,"I love working for a company that I feel cares about be as an employee and as a person.  Venterra does a great job of promoting from within, which I have been able to benefit from over the years.  I love when new initiatives are released, but also when improvements are made to already-existing initiatives.  This proves that Venterra is constantly trying to improve, which is important to me.  I also love when I am given the opportunity to explore new programs or ways of doing things that are not traditionally done in the apartment industry.  These trials, tests and pilots are a lot of fun, and I appreciate being given the opportunity to participate or even lead sometimes.","Venterra is a ""growing"" company so if you don't like adapting to changes, then this probably isn't a good fit for you.  I feel that changes are necessary for growth, and I love the challenges that result, however, this might not appeal to everyone."

321,Venterra Realty,Anonymous,2016-03-23,4.0,,Company culture. Paid Time off and benefits. Fun environment and people.,Low pay for amount and intensity of work. Recognition and room for growth limited to certain positions.
322,Venterra Realty,Former Assistant Community Manager,2016-02-13,5.0,Assistant Community Manager,"I started working for Venterra in 2007 when they acquired a property in Pasadena, TX.  I responded to a job posting and within days I had an interview at their corporate office in Houston.  Shortly after I was contacted by a property manager who also interviewed me but at the actual property in which I would be working.  I was hired and began at the property the day in which Venterra took over early January 2007.  The hiring process was easy and the training was even better.  I began with the company as a Leasing Consultant and was promoted to Assistant Community Manager within a year.  Venterra is always willing to promote from within the company and usually do.  Over the course of the 9 years I worked for Venterra I received several awards and bonuses for my hard work.  They have amazing incentives for just about anything and each year find amazing ways to make them better including referring a friend to work for the company, a High Achievers bonus you have a chance of getting every quarter that gets better and better when you win consecutively, a Better Way suggestion board where all suggestions are read and responded to and if your idea is selected you receive at least a $100 bonus and a possibly a yearly grand prize, a Mentor program you can apply for that not only allows you to meet and get to know your colleagues but also offers a bonus each time you help by training someone new, and awards at the annual Kick Off for each position based on their yearly performance.  As an employee you get several paid holidays off and even your birthday is included as one of those days.  I cannot say enough good about this company, and the ways in which they helped me grow, learn, and better myself as a person and employee.  They care deeply for their employees, their residents they love to ""WOW"" and even giving back with charity work such as raising thousands for breast cancer awareness through the Susan G. Komen Foundation.  I even obtained my Bachelors Degree while working full time for Venterra and opted to stay with them because I loved the company and people so much.  I would recommend anyone to work for Venterra, and had my property not been sold which is part of the business, I would still be working for them today.  Being a part of the Venterra family will change your life for the better.","If you are looking for a just a job, and lack passion and motivation, this will not be the company for you.  They are a company that pushes you to your full potential, is challenging and thorough because they only want the best for their prospects and residents, that puts customer service first and that will require you to work hard and do well.  After 9 years of working for them I assure you there is a reason for all they expect of you, and if and when you leave the company you will discover that working for them has molded you into an exceptional employee, and the skills and lessons learned will only benefit you.  I have always appreciated any feedback and constructive criticism given to me by my leaders, because it challenged and pushed me to do and be better, and in hindsight I know I have grown so much and I am incredibly thankful for the time I had with Venterra."
323,Venterra Realty,Awesome Company,2016-02-21,5.0,Manager,"I have been with Venterra for 9 years !  Awesome company with some of the best supervisors I have ever had the privilege to work with !

 never good bye ...just till we meet again !"
324,Venterra Realty,5 months in!,2016-02-15,5.0,Better Living Consultant,"First, top of the line company to work for. They treat their employees like family, while still maintaining outstanding professionalism. And I mean everyone, from corporate to coworkers. I have been in many different job fields from retail to food and gained a ton of experience but I have never been more proud to belong to a company where I can see the difference I make in people's day. Where, after 5 months, I'm still excited to come to work everyday. The work that I do is critiqued fairly and honestly during evaluation, I can see feedback from prospects and residents, and I'm consistently rewarded in some way for good work done. All these things make me want to dedicate myself to Venterra and look forward to furthering a career with them. Another thing that really impresses me is the transparency. I never feel like they are leaving employees out of the loop on anything. In any kind of relationship communication is key. Venterra does a wonderful job at keeping the lines of communication open and consistent with its employees. I never hesitate to say that this is a company I am a part of. Proud to be a Venterra employee.",After five months here I don't see a downside to working with this company.

326,Venterra Realty,Maintenance Manager,2016-02-10,5.0,Manager,Great company. I have to say I think this is one of the best companies to work for. Venterra provides a fun work place and they care about there employees. I would recommend this company to anyone.,I have nothing to say negative at this time
327,Venterra Realty,Love working for this company,2016-02-09,5.0,Leasing Consultant,Great company to work for. There is lots of room for advancement and they really do care about their employees.,Really no complaints to report
328,Venterra Realty,Property Manager,2016-01-24,5.0,Property Manager,"Great Core Values! Great Benefits! Employees have a voice! Great sense of family feel. Senior support.

331,Venterra Realty,Worth the Years!,2015-12-22,5.0,Property Manager,"I have spent several years with Venterra and they are home, family and my career!  Since 2007 I have worked hard and have even received a few promotions along the way. They have strived to make Venterra a better employer and have put in place a few initiatives this year to become an even better company! Just to name a few.. They have hosted several webinars on how to Live better, I participated in several of those (live stress free and 30 day clean eating challenge just to name a few). We were also able to gain quite a few extra holiday hours throughout the year as well! Venterra also looked at compensation and increased several salaries of employees who needed it, without them asking! I have made lifelong relationships and look forward to the years to come!","We are ever changing.. I would say that sometimes It can become too much at one time, and hard to keep up with it all. If you don't like change, this company is not for you. If you are okay with change for the better, apply today!"

333,Venterra Realty,Truly A Wonderful Company !,2015-12-09,5.0,Better Living Consultant,"A very thorough interview process with three different interviews with three different levels of management. It was a great way to learn what the job was all about from three different perspectives. As soon as I was offered the job, I was flown to Atlanta for training. The training is/was very clear and extensive which made me feel confident when I started. Everyone I've met is so kind and willing to help. There's so much of this company's culture that is for the people. You have so many opportunities to grow and learn and live better ! I love it !","If you're not a fan of travelling, prizes, and great management than I guess that would be a downside. If you don't like being rewarded for doing a good job or for completing your goals, then this isn't the place for you. BUT if you are, I definitely recommend Venterra !"
334,Venterra Realty,Venterra Realty,2015-11-29,2.0,Assistant Property Manager,"1) Venterra is extremely organized (if done correctly by all staff members) in their make ready process such as the agent walk, then the TQMR process. They want to make sure every single detail of the apartment is ready for the resident at move in.

2) The WOW program for residents was awesome!

3) Employee portal was fun and kept you up to date, I loved being able to submit 'Better Ways', posting WOW stories, being able to look up employees and birthdays, etc etc.. 

4) Annual Kick-off and award ceremonies

5) They were always doing fun contests for the employees and genuinely made work fun (so long as the manager was making it fun)

Venterra's expectations are extremely high and it made me want to work hard and accomplish the goals I had for myself. Met a lot of great people and had a blast at company events.","During my time at Venterra it became very apparent that my RM was very, no.. EXTREMELY pro-manager. Even when she noticed things weren't being done the correct way. Venterra always encouraged us to talk to our leaders if we felt like something wasn't being done correctly, and when I brought things to my CM and my RM, they would brush it off and the RM would take the managers side. Because of doing this, I felt like things quickly went downhill for me. They made it seem like I was a problem child or something. I noticed them acting differently towards me, and quickly noticed that my hard work and promotions I felt I deserved were quickly overlooked. As with any company, politics and extreme favoritism became very visible. 

Another reason I decided to leave Venterra was the low pay. I did research and quickly found that the compensation I was receiving for my position was very low compared to others, not only that, but be careful because if you make ONE tiny mistake or human error, you will soon hear about it on your review and it will cost you a raise even if you did a million other things right. Don't get me wrong, you do need to earn a raise, but some of the things on evaluations were kind of absurd."
335,Venterra Realty,Great Company,2015-11-17,5.0,Regional Property Manager,The company listens to and cares about it's employees.  It is constantly changing and evolving to become a better company.  It provides regular feedback on performance.

338,Venterra Realty,Better Living Consultant Experience Maker,2015-11-22,3.0,Leasing Consultant,"I have worked for Venterra for 1.5years and can honestly say this company loves their employees. From team building activities to monthly contests, corporate is always looking for a way to keep employees happy and involved. Benefits are lovely. The fitness program that is offered through insurance is very cost efficient and better than any other single gym membership I’ve ever had.","The deciding factor of why I have chosen to leave Venterra is the salary. Their super high expectation and extensive training just doesn’t match up to what salary they offer. Once Venterra hires these phenomenal leasing consultants and train them to be top notch leasers, other company’s see how well they lease and hire them with a higher starting salary. Other companies with less expectations and simple training techniques are stealing the best employees simply because they are a little more generous. Venterra will wait for you to say that you’re leaving before offering the correct compensation for your position and abilities. Venterra makes it extremely hard to reach perfection making you never feel “good enough.” Other companies see you as a diamond in the rut and show their appreciation from the start. The company itself has a great pro-employee mindset but for some reason they are lacking on the compensations side. Salary matters. In today’s day and age people have lives to live and bills to pay. Money isn’t everything but almost everything needs money.  

Also, very little growth opportunities. I have seen multiple scenarios where Venterra will hire an outside interviewee before promoting an internal employee who has shown and proven their dedication to the company."
339,Venterra Realty,Cheapest exploiters,2015-12-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Easy to get a job. Perhaps due to their incredibly high employee turn over rate,"They get you at what they are saying is a great company's culture. In reality expect to enslave yourself for below industry's average compensation, while dealing with unreasonable work load at distressed assets they purchase. Both CEO and COO are heavily promoting idea of innovative and open minded company, while remaining the most arrogant people I've met."
340,Venterra Realty,Excellent Place to Build a Career,2015-11-03,5.0,Property Manager,"I have been with the company for several years now and have received numerous promotions and raises based on accomplishments. I have had the opportunity to work with bright, hard working peers and enjoy great support from regional and executive teams.
I have recently passed on higher offers because of this company's culture and dedication to work life balance. Of course there are companies that will offer a higher salary to recruit good talent, but at what cost? I feel like the pay I receive is fair. I left my previous employer to take a job with Venterra making 1/3 of what I was accustomed to and I have not looked back.","I will echo other reviews I have seen - if you don't like to work hard and break new ground this is not the company for you. That said, we sure do play hard too!"

The career opportunities are vast with great chances of internal promotion .

The training you receive is invaluable and detailed.

No matter what property you work at you encounter a culture of friendly people willing to help and add to your knowledge.

The computer programs and apps that the company uses make life so much easier and efficient.

Rather than scold; leadership presents their suggestions in a way that communicated that they are there to help you and make you better.","If you're the kind of person who doesn't like extra events or ""fun days"" with your company than that could be a con, but if you are into participating and having a good time then you are good to go!"

I love the vacation time and sick time we get, as well as birthdays are a paid off day! What other company would appreciate them to give them their birthday off automatically and make it a paid day!",Pay rate is a little lower than what I think is fare. Also whenever you have questions and you go to senior management instead of sometimes owning up that they don't know the answer but they will find out for you they just make something up. Senior management will never admit when they drop the ball.

I've been with Venterra for many years and have continued to grow.,"While Venterra continues to look for the best benefits and plans for its employees it would be nice to have more health benefits available (i.e. gym memberships, higher vision plans, etc).

Part-time employees taken advantage of, and work almost full-time but not enough to be paid benefits. If you're a new employee, you better not have a social life, because your weekends are getting spent in the office. Your commission gets paid on the 15th of the month, after residents move in."

I enjoy the fact that we have a 30 Day Live It Love It Guarantee, as well as pride ourselves in customer service at No Risk by WoW-ing the residents every day! There is definitely a sense of home for not only the residents, but the employees. The fact that the CEO & COO's care so much on what the onsite staff are saying is very unique as well.

Success is definitely celebrated."
354,Venterra Realty,Venterra is by far the very best management company in the industry.,2015-03-03,5.0,Regional Maintenance Manager,"Venterra is one of very few companies dedicated to the success of its employees. Through their never ending pursuit of excellence and team first attitude, Venterra has become the very definition of setting the example for all businesses. I have grown to be a better employee and a better person working for Venterra and I am forever grateful for all they have taught me through the years. I have been promoted twice with the company and witnessed dozens of other promotions.","There aren't any cons to working for Venterra. If there ever are, they are the kind of company who listens and makes changes that benefit the employees."
355,Venterra Realty,My initial new hire experience has been very pleasant.  It has been a great experience so far working for Venterra.,2015-02-20,5.0,Leasing Consultant,Venterra is a great company to work for.  They have a great benefits package and time off policy.  They treat their employees very well and believe on promoting from within.,I have no complaints about Venterra so far.  The hiring and training process went smoothly and I work with a great team!
356,Venterra Realty,Venterra genuinely cares about their employees and that is one thing I noticed right away working for them!,2015-02-17,5.0,Assistant Property Manager,"I love working for Venterra because of all of the programs they do to keep everyone involved, like WOWs & Better Living, etc. They have annual events that bring all of the employees together and they also have programs that are there for their customers to receive the best customer service! My Managers are always very easy to come to with questions or concerns, I always feel like I have someone to go to if needed! Venterra is also very big on promoting within, so they give you endless open opportunities to work up to!",I do think as far as office hours go on the weekends that it's a little excessive. I feel like Sundays are family days and that the offices should be closed. Especially considering the office hours during the week days are fully accessible as we are open late two nights a week and are here 7 hours on Saturdays.
357,Venterra Realty,Great company,2015-02-22,5.0,,Very fun place to work!,Better pay for workers would be good
358,Venterra Realty,I am very fortunate to work for Venterra Realty!,2015-02-21,5.0,Leasing Consultant,"I am very fortunate to be a part of the Venterra team for many reasons.  The new employee training was very informative, exciting, and kept me wanting to know more about the company and my job.  The benefits and schedule flexibility are wonderful for me even as a part-time employee. I work in a positive work environment where there is great communication with management and your hard work and achievements are recognized!",There is a long interview process but that is what showed me what a great company this is.  I am glad the process is lengthy because I believe that is what assists in building a positive work environment where everyone grows as a team.
359,Venterra Realty,Great customer centric values and fun work environment.,2015-02-23,4.0,Leasing Consultant,"- They provide great training for new employees. 
- Fun work environment. 
- Manager is easy to communicate with and shows care in the employees. 
- You get to wear many different hats as a leasing agent so there is always something to do besides working with prospects. 
- Promotions from within.
- Big emphasis on great customer service and brand value.
- Great benefits for full time employees","- You may be required to commute to different properties to fill in the office duties. Some of those commute drives can take up to an hour.
- Those who used to work till 5pm might not like the fact that some properties stay open till 7pm on week days. 
- Since the business is all about dealing with people, you will occasionally be working with some mildly to very unpleasant prospects and residents so you have to be able to quickly regain attitude and shake off negativity."
360,Venterra Realty,New Employee Experience,2015-02-09,4.0,Office Coordinator,"The office culture and dynamics are exactly what I was looking for in my job search. There is a strong sense of community and support of one another, which is a very rare find. One of the biggest pros I've noted thus far is how much Venterra promotes and encourages a positive work environment. It is very apparent through different outlets and programs such as the WOW nominations, where you can post a story about an employee that did something that wowed you. Those stories can be voted on throughout the year and can sometimes produce a monetary reward for that employee at the end of the year. Recognizing the employees is the best way to keep them happy!","A couple of the negatives for me at this point are that the location of the corporate office is a bit remote and far from everything. The neighborhood is also a little scary at night.
Secondly, the balance between the salary and the work volume for my particular role is a bit skewed. There is a demand for a high volume of work but the compensation does not match the work."
361,Venterra Realty,Fantastic,2014-11-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Company is very focused on happy employees and engages us in many ways. We're strongly encouraged to use our voices to encourage positive change. There is also a lot of focus on fun with quarterly meetings and better living contests. Senior management and executive level is very approachable and seems genuinely interested in employee success and achievements.,"Not necessarily a con, but if you're going to be successful with Venterra, you have to be willing to work a little harder than you probably would with most companies. Work/Life balance can be challenging at times. Our employee's A-Player mentality is what makes us so successful and without that, you will not enjoy the company."
362,Venterra Realty,Wonderful Company,2014-11-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are many things I love about Venterra but a lot has to do with their values and the amazing people working for the company. They have many initiatives including the better way initiative. This is where anyone can share their ideas for improvement. This company truly values our thoughts and ideas and it is refreshing! One of their core values is to be open and candid with each other. I think that is something that helps a company thrive and promotes communication between all team members and upper management. I don't think I have ever worked for another company who encouraged these things! In addition, Venterra employs people who have values in themselves that match the companies core values. This means that I have also been blessed to work with some amazing people who are smart, talented, giving and encouraging. Venterra also thrives to promote from within, so they continue to promote people who may have started at the bottom but show they love their job and continue to grow.","While some of us may get paid less than what other companies would pay, the culture is worth it. Venterra provides many initiatives and gives us such a great atmosphere that you almost don't care what you get paid."
363,Venterra Realty,Great Life-Changing Experience and such an AWESOME company!,2014-11-17,5.0,Leasing Consultant,Venterra Realty believes in YOU and will help you grow in more ways than one. Amazing staff.,No cons available for Venterra Realty. I enjoyed everyone which of whom I interviewed with.
364,Venterra Realty,I loved the company and their values.,2014-11-28,3.0,Senior Leasing Consultant,Corporate Values and attention to detail was surpassed any mgmt. company,"Somerset is a sister property (AND nicer) across the street.  During my 3 years of employment, I ran the property alone  be mgmt. was always at Somerset gossiping"
365,Venterra Realty,Great Company to work for!,2014-10-14,5.0,Leasing,I have been with Venterra for over a year and it is by the far the best company I have ever worked for. You are valued and appreciated for your hard work. You are asked to express your opinions and they are heard. Venterra has great opportunities for growth in the company as well as providing tools to improve your life outside of work like the Better Living Initiative. Very positive experience for employees and for residents that live at a Venterra community.,I personally do not have any cons.
366,Venterra Realty,Happy Employee for 5 years,2014-10-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Venterra is a great company that promotes from within. They really are focused on how hard you work, and strive to promote from within. They have a great training program to help prepare you for the next step.",The benefits are great with Venterra. We are open more than any other Property Management Company out there for our customers. Most offices are open 9-7.
367,Venterra Realty,Venterra is a great company with great opportunities!,2014-10-07,5.0,Leasing Consultant,"Venterra has core values that are unlike any other company. They are extremely customer service focused, in tune with their employees and set themselves to a standard above the rest. The Venterra culture is unmatched and a wonderful culture to be a part of.  Venterra wants you to succeed, recognizes hard work and has a great track record of promoting from within.","As a Venterra employee, you are held to high standards as a representative of the high standards the company holds itself to. That means not everyone is the right fit for Venterra. In order to succeed, you may need to take extra steps to make sure the job is done right."
368,Venterra Realty,Great company that wants to make everyone's life better!,2014-10-07,5.0,Leasing Consultant,I am very fortunate to be with a company that understands how to invest in its people.  There are so many opportunities to learn and excel not just professionally but personally as well.  The people I work with are very friendly and team oriented.  I was accepted as part of the team from day 1!  Venterra really wants us to take care of our residents and it makes it so much easier and natural when you are a happy camper:),"So far, I don't have any cons to speak of"
369,Venterra Realty,Fun and great learning experience.,2014-10-07,5.0,Leasing Agent,"Working in the office keeps you busy and your days go by fast. The employees are very down to earth and fun to work with. Managers want to see you do well and are always available to talk with. Compensation and benefits are pretty decent.  Many residents and prospects love our company because we are simply the best when it comes to customer service. I never dread coming to work, everyday is different and it keeps work interesting.",Working Sundays is something I personally do not like at all. It can be hard to balance your work life and personal life when those times are on Sundays.
370,Venterra Realty,My Favorite Company So Far,2014-10-07,5.0,Leaisng Consultant,"I have been with Venterra for almost 2 years and have loved working for the company. I was new to property management when I started and fell in love with it. I love that we have an opportunity to WOW our residents. Each month, we have an allotted amount of money to do something special for a resident or residents that we see fit that particular month, whether it's someone who had an unfortunate situation come up or that we just wanted to surprise. That has been my favorite part of working for Venterra so far. I feel like an individual that the company cares about, and not just a number, as so many employers look at their employees. I base my life around integrity and would not be able to work for a company who didn't represent strong values and exemplify integrity in their policies. I think we have more than enough opportunities to extend our education and learn from others in the company. Richard, our COO is awesome and actually visits the communities enough so that employees actually get to know him. I think the long interview process shows that they really care about who they hire and about finding the right long term employees. Compensation is fair, although I do wish our raises were higher, but who doesn't want that? Overall, my experience has been very positive and I plan on staying with the company for a long time!",I work in one of the Nashville locations and I do wish there were more properties out here and room to grow with the company in Nashville.
371,Venterra Realty,Breath of fresh air,2014-10-07,5.0,Leasing Consultant,"This is a company that seems to truly care about employee well-being. They have many programs to encourage , being an ""active employee"". Their customer service focus is great! As a leasing consultant we are the front line of the company so it is nice to know we have the ability to ""make things right"". They openly ask for your opinion AND give you the feeling that they are actually listening. I love my job and know that with hard work and an open mind I have opportunities to grow with this company!  They have a lot of programs that give you opportunists to win/earn money, benefit package is excellent, as well as a discount on rent for any Venterra owned property.",Not many that I have ran into yet. Be prepared to work weekends all the time if you are a leasing consultant. Not a huge issue for myself just an FYI. But even the weekend shifts allow time to actually have a life.
372,Venterra Realty,Venterra is the type of company that makes you a better person while allowing you to earn a paycheck.,2014-10-06,5.0,Leasing Consultant,"I have been with Venterra for a short period of time; and its been long enough to know, that this is the type of company one would want to retire with. It pushes you out of your comfort zone and provides you with the right tools for success. Wide opportunity for growth and personal satisfaction. It allows you to expand your career while encouraging you to reach your personal goals. Everything Venterra stands for is unique and once you work for them you wont settle for less.",The benefit package could include a lot more.
373,Venterra Realty,A place of work where my talents are utilized and I feel appreciated everyday I come to work.,2014-10-06,5.0,Leasing Agent,"This company really makes you feel valued and appreciated which is something I've never experienced on the job before. Everyone I've met so far in management is friendly, helpful, positive, and motivational. They really invest in their employees and set them up for success. Even when you make mistakes they are corrected in a positive and upbeat manner. This company also has several initiatives to better the employees lives. For example the better living campaign: Where you post your goals (work related or not, mostly not) and fellow colleagues and management can post words of encouragement and really join in on the process. I find this so conducive to the positive attitude I bring to work. It's nice to know the company I work for is really interested in my happiness. What more could you ask for?","The only Con I have experienced since joining this company in July is the often rude, entitled and disgruntled TENANTS at the property I work at. I often find myself completely drained trying to help someone who is refusing to be helped. I'm learning not to take it so personally. This is not really a Venterra issue, more of a site specific issue for those of us on property. Also the starting pay is a little low, however I do appreciate that you are eligible for a raise every 3 months. <3"
374,Venterra Realty,Very grateful to be apart of this company!,2014-10-06,5.0,Leasing Agent,"Venterra is probably one of the best companies to work for, everyone I work with is always really helpful! From now and when I first started, I never feel that no one is here to answer my questions. It's so refreshing being apart of a company of whom cares so much about their employees and strives to help one another succeed and promote within the company! Venterra also has core values that they stand strongly by. A couple of my favorite core values are Honest and Integrity and the Never-Ending pursuit of Excellence.","If you are not experienced with customer service, then you should probably consider taking a different route. You deal with people day to day and work to meet their needs!"
375,Venterra Realty,The BEST company I have worked for!,2014-10-06,5.0,Regional Leasing Manager,I love working for Venterra as they make you feel as part of a company and not just as someone who works for them.  They hear your voice and make things happen.  They also give you the tools you need to become successful.  I love that they believe in you and promote from within.  I have had several promotions in my 7 years with the company.,I hear around that some companies pay you vacation time if you want to cash it out and Venterra does not.  They do encourage time off though to regroup.
376,Venterra Realty,The four years that I have been with Venterra have been great!,2014-10-06,5.0,Leasing Agent,Venterra is a very caring company whether it's their employees or residents. I have heard horror stories about other property management companies and I'm so glad I haven't had to experience that. I can say that one of my favorite things we have right now is something called Better Living. It gives employees the opportunity to be encouraged by others about their goals and dreams. It also holds you accountable too :),"I would say the only con is selling properties. But that happens with every property management company. Once one is sold, we get another one. That's just how the business goes."
377,Venterra Realty,"Venterra is unlike any other MFI company out there, one who's culture is truly focused on improvement and growth.",2014-10-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The corporate culture is one that encourages employees to develop both professionally and personally.  There is a huge focus on resident satisfaction and Venterra always does the 'right' thing.  In the Multi-Family Industry, there are companies who talk a good game, but Venterra can back it up.  It is refreshing to be able to sleep soundly at night because everyday is spent doing everything I can for my residents and team members to make this the best place to live and the best place to work!",The only Con is that there aren't more Venterra communities across the country.  It's a shame to not offer this living and working experience in more markets.
378,Venterra Realty,This company and its managers were one of the greatest periods of my life!,2014-10-02,5.0,Property Manager,"You are heard by supervisor (s).  You are respected. Your opinions and ideas are valued.  If Venterra was a characteristic, it would be""down to earth"" because of the comfort and openness it strives on in tge workplace. You are taught, not just ""trained"".  Every moment is a teaching moment with them.  Examples of pros are:
As an employee, you will complete Surveys on your managers and they will be deeply analyzed. 
Bonus metrics that make sense with CS
Ranked properties and competitive scores
Entire company kept updated via email, including direct emails of acquisitions from the President. 
Newsletter celebrating bdays & anniversaries each week

379,Venterra Realty,Best company to work with.,2014-09-22,5.0,Maintenance Manager,"Venterra holds high standards and we also hold the same standards. This does not work for everybody. The ones that can work and maintain the high standards love it. Core values , training , compensation and my Venterra Family make it worth it.",I have no cons for Venterra. I was aware of the standards when I took the job.
380,Venterra Realty,"Venterra is the Best Career decision I have ever made, 7 years and looking forward to many more to come...",2014-09-19,5.0,Regional Maintenance Manager,I was hired as a Maintenance Manager in 2007 and Venterra recognized my hard work and dedication and promoted me to Regional Maintenance Manager in 2010.  Venterra is A company that recognizes your efforts and builds on them.  A company that is built on a foundation of Core Values that are non-negotiable.  Venterra works very hard to drive employee satisfaction and creating a Culture/Environment were people enjoy coming to work.,"It is hard to come up with ""Cons"" in speaking about Venterra.  Venterra is a company that has very high standards and that may be difficult for some to adapt to."
381,Venterra Realty,Great company with a unique approach,2014-09-19,5.0,Regional Maintenance Manager,"The best thing I can say about Venterra is that the company cares about it's people and is intent on hiring those that fit with the culture of the company.  The company is in a constant state of improvement and involves every employee in the process.  The focus is on the quality of the product and the quality of the service.  Customer satisfaction is HUGE.  The good thing is, ""customer"" does not just refer to clients and potential clients, ""customer"" also refers to the employees.  Employees that perform are recognized and rewarded.  There is definitely a TEAM atmosphere that pervades throughout Venterra.","The company is definitely not for everyone.  If you are not willing to take ownership of your responsibilities, constantly improve yourself, and search for a better way of doing your job, you might as well look elsewhere.  Though I don't consider it a negative, the search for constant improvement and positive change can be challenging."
382,Venterra Realty,happy to come to work every day,2014-09-19,5.0,Maintenance Manager,Venterra has a lot to offer great benefits and fun things to strive for like wows better living and better way. You can grow within company and need I say more about the team I work with they are the best ever.,like with every multifamily company I have worked for is not enough time in the day to complete task at hand. Would like to see some training that would give maintenance some certifications.
383,Venterra Realty,"Wow, Such a great Company to enjoy a career.",2014-09-19,5.0,Director,"Since I started working for Venterra over 7 years ago, I have repeatedly been promoted, due to hard work and efforts, an now fill a Corporate Level position.

Good Pay and the company really values what employees think. Venterra has a unique way to keep everyone engaged at work. This is a company that promotes within and all hard work is recognize. Richard Roos is the only (COO) I've worked for that takes the time to talk to all employees and see how there doing while touring any of our properties.","Not much for cons. I would be nice to be able to cash vacation time, once 80 hours of vacation are accrued you have to either take time off in a busy time of the year or continue to work without accruing vacation time."
385,Venterra Realty,One of my best career moves!,2014-08-20,5.0,Property Manager,"I enjoy coming to work every day. I love my team and the energy level in our office.  Venterra's core values and expectations have raised my personal level of customer service expectations.  We are expected to deliver the best customer service and always enhance the customer experience, and as employers, Venterra does the same for us.  Venterra promotes a healthy family-work life, and has incentives for people who promote a better way of living.  Vacation, personal days, paid holidays, award ceremonies, bonuses and personal recognition from upper management for a job well done are a part of the Venterra culture.","Compensation does not seem to be as high as other opportunities in the industry, but reasonable and with the other perks, well worth it."
386,Venterra Realty,Customer service inside and out,2014-08-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It is truly a rare instance when a company practices what they preach.  Venterra is one of those companies.  The Multi-Family Real Estate world is full of providers that market customer service as a cornerstone to apartment living, but there are only a few that actually place a strong focus on the effort in terms of programs and awards/support.  The key is to support the effort from the top to the bottom.  Venterra's leaders place a strong focus on providing exceptional customer service to the team members who, in turn, provide the same experience for our residents.  Internal programs are highlighted with awards/prizes and include the Better Way - which offers the opportunity to identify areas for improvement and Better Living - which provides a forum for team members to create personal goals and cheer each other on to achieving personal milestones.  These programs and the backing of senior leadership create a fun and very positive working environment.","Expectations are very high and demands placed on team members are equally challenging.  While the company places a high value on work/life balance, those that do not place high emphasis on time management and personal organization will struggle to take advantage of the work/life opportunities.  Be prepared to get to work!"
387,Venterra Realty,Great customer service...mediocre employee pay compared to work expectations.,2014-08-20,3.0,Leasing Agent,"When you get leases, the commission is great! When it's slow...pay is mediocre to say the least.","Because you can't punch in or out, there is no reliable way to track your time worked. They have you fill out time sheets, but they expect you to open your office at least 15 minutes early and stay at least 15 late on most days without getting paid for that time. You are only allowed to write in 8 hours instead of 8.5. 30 minutes daily adds up to quite a bit over time. 

They will sometimes have you go to other properties to ""help out"" and promise you that they will give you the overtime... but Venterra won't pay the overtime...they will simply put it as straight time on your check. Tell me...how does working up to 110 hours in 2 weeks not justify overtime pay?

As an employee, if you want to live on-site, you only get a 20% discount. But, if you work for the property 30 min-1 hour a week as a ""Cares Team"" employee and wrap some plungers you get 50-75% off your rent. Doesn't make much sense..."
388,Venterra Realty,Love this company!,2014-08-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"They offer very attainable bonus structures, good pay, and outstanding company values.","They are very concerned about customer service, not realizing that the staff has a family life too. The weekends and late evenings does not allow us to spend as much time with our family as we would like."

I am so fortunate to have such a great boss and team to work with at Venterra. It really is like a family.","Venterra is a challenging company, so if you like a good challenge and like to push yourself to the limits, then Venterra is definitely for you.

Sr management invests in me to help me grow as a person and employee. Staff meetings with Sr managements are weekly which are a great time to get one on one time with them.,VERY VERY large work load. The work load and what is expected of staff is much larger than at other companies.
391,Venterra Realty,One of the most unique.,2014-01-12,5.0,Assistant Property Manager,"It's my second family, I enjoy going to work and being appreciated, I absolutely love it, they promote within and recognize everyone. There is an answer for everything and the help they give you when your stuck as far as support, words can not explain how great they are.","Vacation, if we could get a check for vacation and still work, that would be great.

Change can be a good thing! The wonderful people who built this company are brilliant. I believe Venterra has a promising future. I am deeply saddened and wish I could have stayed to be part of it. After living in a Venterra Community, you will not be happy anywhere else.","When an employee has a skill set for higher level position, most voices go unheard. Mostly true when the regional and onsite manager are friends outside of work. Occasionally,  a manager has become complacent in their role, and nothing is done to mediate this, causing unhappy residents and poor online reviews, which could easily be avoided. All properties I have visited are great communities.  Exit interviews are only offered to some, not all."

408,Venterra Realty,"Friendly co-workers, successful company, stagnant jobs, and few growth opportunities",2021-11-29,3.0,Corporate Accountant,"-collegial atmosphere among young coworkers (non-management)

-financially successfully company

-some opportunity to learn about the real estate industry

-good place to work if you're looking for a comfortable, predictable job, performing the same or similar functions in your role

-good place if you're looking to add a job function to your resume for 12-18 months","-Richmond Hill office is the back-office for Accounting and IT/Tech Support, the exciting work and growth happens at the Houston (Ops) office

-long hours (especially at year-end, perhaps this should be expected)

-repetitive work (that should largely be outsourced or automated)

-very few opportunities to move laterally to other teams

-few opportunities for promotion (this and previous comment only occur when massive exits take place - high turnover every 2 to 3 years)

-some managers (now exited) do not fit the spirit of the company and over-worked their teams, resulting in the previously mentioned turnover

-career development plans and pulse surveys are really just checkbox items, not actioned or realized in subsequent weeks, months, years

-not recommended for those searching for internal career development (some of this is also due to the small office size)

-teams work in a siloed fashion, even in the same department

-weak bonus structure, rely only on your base salary, the bonuses are low and also impossible to achieve the top two classifications more than once in a blue moon

-remote office location (not much of a concern with remote/hybrid plans)"

416,Venterra Realty,A Company True To Its Values,2020-07-29,5.0,Office Administrator,"Venterra is a dream-come-true type of company. There is a great emphasis placed on the employee experience/workplace culture, work-life balance, open conversations with supportive leadership on your career goals (many opportunities to grow and develop your skills professionally), and they offer competitive pay. I felt very equipped, secure and confident in being able to stay productive while working from home AND keep my position since the start of COVID. The CEO and Chairman both make it a point to remember your name and make intentional and meaningful conversations with all staff - this is just a small example of how Venterra's core values flow from the top down! If you're looking for a company to grow with in your career, Venterra does a phenomenal job in supporting you every step of the way.",Nothing comes to mind. Venterra is awesome!

420,Venterra Realty,Disposable commodity,2020-03-20,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Good environment, working from home allowed, good people around.","You are disposable commodity and if the company decides to cut cost you will be out without notice. While I have been there for longer than 1 year I saw how people escorted from it in surprise fashion.

I saw new employees let go as well as veterans who has been with the company for years.  
I have been performing well but few times mentioned that expectations are higher because of my high salary.
So after one year and a couple months, I saw that they hired less experienced and obviously less expensive  developers and as I predicted after knowledge transfer  was done I was let go without notice as well.

I am happy as I have better opportunities on the table but people joining Venterra should be aware of how they treat you if they decide to change the course."
421,Venterra Realty,"Challenging, rewarding, second family",2020-01-15,5.0,Manager,"Challenging environment that provides opportunities to constantly get better and raise to the next level.

422,Venterra Realty,Overall great company with great management,2019-09-29,5.0,Business Analyst,Lots of internal promotions and opportunities to climb the latter.,Can't really think of any cons
423,Venterra Realty,"Good culture, TOXIC mid-management",2019-08-24,2.0,Analyst,The business model is great and the leadership team is really good. They encourage forward thinking and respect all levels within the organization,"+ Some of the mid-management staff, like Managers, are extremely insecure about bringing in new ideas.

+ I have had a very toxic and depressive time with such a manager because of her conniving attitude. 

+ Look at the turnover of individual managers and assess what is wrong with their department. Several people who left in quick succession could not be wrong. Maybe the problem is with the manager who is managing people"
424,Venterra Realty,"Excellent Culture, Interesting Business, and Tons of Room for Growth",2019-07-25,5.0,Coordinator,"You work with some incredibly smart people. Leaders are heavily invested in career progression of team members and tons of room for growth in many areas of the business. Everyone is very approachable anytime you have an issue. Collaboration between coworkers is encouraged and proves to be a valuable learning experience almost every time. Very welcoming, sociable, and pleasurable culture backed up by incredibly fun social events.",Nothing I can think of.
425,Venterra Realty,Great Culture and Exciting Work,2019-07-24,5.0,Manager,Great job of matching individuals with work that is challenging and they are interested in. Regular discussions about your career paths  and a plan is mapped out with each employee. Really fun social events. Company does a good job of recognizing individuals for their hard work.,This is not a downside in my experience however there is a fast paced growth environment at Venterra therefore you need to jump on-board with that mindset.
426,Venterra Realty,Be wary of recruiters upselling the role,2019-06-19,2.0,Analyst,"- Some very intelligent people with strong work ethics
- Smart business model run by smart executives ensures company will probably be around for a long time delivering good returns for investors (not that employees are able to participate in the returns in any way, shape or form)
- Opportunity to learn about the real estate investment world (and also how the rich are able to keep getting richer)
- Depending on role, pay can be higher than average 
- Senior leadership tries to put the effort to promote inclusive environment (i.e. social committee, events in cafeteria, etc)","- Please note this is specific to the Richmond Hill Office (where backoffice roles are). 
- Workload can become unmanageable. From the ground level it seems like there is no way to win. You get reprimanded if your work output is deemed insufficient. You then get reprimanded if you try to put in extra hours to increase your work output (because it supposedly reflects poorly on manager if one of their resources seems to consistently be staying late)
- Despite what recruiters may pitch you, the turnover rate is much higher than what they represent (they will tell you turnover is low and that internal promotions happen all the time) - people would be laid off or disappear overnight at times with no broader communication. 
- Management pats itself on the back with skewed employee survey statistics. They are skewed because:
    a) It's generally understood that management will try to pinpoint who gave unfavourable ratings (it's a fairly small office with small teams, so not difficult).  Management will indeed huddle and scrutinize results - from the ground level it seems certain managers attempt to pinpoint which individuals gave low ratings and justify why those ratings should be written off as outliers instead of actually trying to address the root cause of why the rating was so low. During my debrief meeting, manager was actually namedropping who they thought was responsible for the outlier response and grilling them on the spot to justify the rating. Overall there's definitely a sense that employees will receive retribution for giving low ratings
     b) Due to fairly high turnover rate, a good percentage of survey respondents are new recruits who are settling in. 
- Quality of managers greatly varies from one team to the next"
427,Venterra Realty,Great work environment,2016-06-12,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Friendly and supportive colleagues. Nimble and tech-driven business. Innovative ideas are appreciated. Great social committee.,Entry level compensation was not the most competitive though benefits are good.
