0,Venterra Realty,BEST COMPANY EVER!,2021-04-14,5.0,Better Living Consultant,"I have worked for Venterra Realty for 1 Year and this is my first time working in property management and let me tell you this has been the best year of my working life. I am excited to wake up and come to work everyday. I love that Venterra sticks to their core values, helps each employee reach their goals, and that they make sure that every employee feels appreciated. Venterra Realty is hands down the best company I have ever worked for.",There is no cons in my opinion.
1,Venterra Realty,Awesome Culture! Opportunity for growth,2022-03-26,5.0,Better Living Consultant,"I absolutely love my time working for Venterra so far. I have been a leasing consultant here for about 6 months and my entire time here has blown me away. I was shocked by how much the company genuinely seems to care about the employees and set them up for success. The culture is set up to favor team work, cooperation, and genuine care. I have been with companies before that say that they value their employees and they value genuine care, but the way they show it is empty. This is not the case with Venterra. From what I have seen so far, they prove day in and day out that they actually place importance on their values. I haven't met a coworker or manager yet that hasn't been a pleasure to work with or for, and this is thanks to everyone being set up with the tools they need to be successful and to foster team work and comradery. There is also a lot of room for growth, Venterra always tries their best to hire from within and provide opportunities for current employees. Also, Venterra pays a portion of college tuition if you are a student, and has initiatives set up to assist anyone that is interested in learning and growth.","It honestly is hard to think of cons. Of course, nowhere you work will be completely perfect, but Venterra is pretty darn close. I guess one con is that it doesn't always feel like there is enough staff for coverage if there is an unexpected outage. I always feel like I can take scheduled time off if I need to, but if I ever have an emergency on a day where someone else is off it leaves the office understaffed."
2,Venterra Realty,You Live & Learn At Venterra,2022-03-14,3.0,Better Living Manager,"At Venterra, it is better living for residents, it’s appreciated. Residents become family and even with the good and the bad, our hard work is appreciated and residents do love us for it. Celebrations are big with Venterra - birthdays, anniversaries, appreciation days, you’ll never go hungry at a Venterra community. I love that you get a day off for your birthday, reduced rent as an employee that lives on site, great bonuses. My manager was amazing. She cared for her staff and went above and beyond to get all that she could for us as her team. Loved it!","Residents and prospect safety comes before staff unfortunately. We pretty much have to lay down for whatever they ask for or need. Venterra is all about numbers and getting guest cards done. Those come first and the system comes off as pushy, aggressive and bothersome. Venterra tries to Murrow Chick Fil A’s purpose and mission and that is a fail unfortunately. In the case of my office staff, where our community is in the process of being sold, immediately you’re treated less than. Venterra’s actions towards you completely change. You’re treated like a stepchild before you even depart from the company. It’s so sad. Communication with recruiting is very bad, even when you express your passion to move forward with the company and possibly stay with them. Very fake."
3,Venterra Realty,Amazing workplace backed by a great company culture and endless opportunities for growth!,2022-02-22,5.0,Communications Manager,"From the start, Venterra was one of the most welcoming workplaces that I have entered. Each and every colleague that I have interacted with is kind and wants to help whether it be giving you the resources you need or walking you through a new process. 

Collaboration is something that sets the company apart from others, making it truly feel like a family - and with 65+ properties in different locations that can be a hard thing to accomplish! As a remote employee, I am thankful to have opportunities to work with various colleagues throughout the company on a daily basis.

Leadership encourages employee input for improvements, with no ideas too small or large. The company emphasizes personal growth through compensation reviews, management surveys, education stipends, and more. Your career is really what you make of it here.",None that I can think of!
4,Venterra Realty,"Times, they are a changing...",2022-03-03,2.0,Community Manager,"The employees are amazing. All of our properties, in my area, work as a team and help each other out. 
I have had opportunities with Venterra that I never had with other companies. I have had the privilege to work in other departments, like the acquisition team, so broaden my knowledge and understanding of the process.","The employee experience use to be Venterra's number 1 priority, but recently, employee experience has taken a backseat to the bottom line. Decisions are made at the corporate level that deeply impact the onsite team, with no insight from the team members it will be affecting. There has become a disconnect from off-site (corporate) and onsite. The numbers are beginning to mean more than the people. This is in direct contradiction to the company that I have known for years."
5,Venterra Realty,"Love, Love, Love",2022-03-26,5.0,Better Living Consultant,"Amazing work environment, appreciates employees feedback, recognition and praise no matter your position level. Great communication. Great pay, so many different opportunities to make more money. Promotes within.",There is not much I could say here.
6,Venterra Realty,Great Recruiting Experience,2022-03-25,5.0,SR Manager Human Resources,Very friendly employees throughout the recruitment process,Covid impacted timing between steps
7,Venterra Realty,Unhealthy management,2022-02-24,3.0,Better Living Consultant,"- Industry standard pay
- Benefits
- Work life balance","Venterra has some of the worst management I have ever worked for. They are toxic. Employees are frequently belittled by management, forced to do things outside of the scope of their job descriptions, and often take on some of the workload from management. Management is hardly present on the property during the workday.

The cost of living adjustments are atrocious and you are capped on pay, despite not making enough at that pay rate to comfortably lease an apartment from Venterra.

Commission structure for leasing units is well below the market rate. Even if you make Venterra a million dollars, you are barely compensated."
8,Venterra Realty,Lots of politics,2022-02-24,2.0,Assistant Property Manager,Culture is great. They love to keep it fun. Innovative company. Met some really awesome coworkers. Awesome holiday time off and great benefits.,A lot of politics involved. They do yearly leadership surveys that are said to be anonymous and meant for employees to give feedback on their direct managers. But nothing is ever done to address the issues. Regional will tell the managers who said negative comments about them. Don’t speak up. Nothing will get done to correct behavior. You will be black balled and you won’t be promoted.
9,Venterra Realty,Best. Place. To work... EVER!,2022-01-21,5.0,Maintenance Manager,"Venterra takes care of their employees as well as they do their residents. Which is to say- BETTER than anyone else! My only regret is not getting here sooner! The company culture motivates all their employees to be their best, give 101%, go the extra mile, and every other positive cliché ever!","Not a con at all, but this is no place for slackers! If you're not ready to give 101% everyday... this may not be the place for you."
10,Venterra Realty,"Culture, Stability, Proffesionalist",2021-10-19,5.0,Community Manager,"I can honestly say Venterra is an amazing company to work for!

 They truly care about their employees and set the bar high for the apartment industry as a whole. They tend to keep their assets for the long term and do not have quick turn around sales after acquiring properties. Whenever they sell a property they are selling an asset that is 1000x better than when they purchased it. 
Should your property ever be put up for sale you truly do not fear the unknown. They are honest and transparent through these processes and make you feel safe through them. There will always be a place for you at Venterra if you are dedicated and you can rest assured that there is a role for everyone. 
We have plenty of employees that have been at one property during a sale and within a short amount of time they are back with us at a different asset!

If you are looking for a great company that does not see you as just a number and cares about your work, life and family balance look no further than Venterra!",No cons! Great company to establish a life long career with.
11,Venterra Realty,Accept No Substitute,2022-01-18,5.0,Regional Director of Property Management,"Forward thinking, receptive to employee feedback, reviews are actual reviews and not just words on a piece of paper, every employee receives money to put towards life long learning, team celebrations for milestones and birthdays, work anniversaries, no one is stuffy-everyone is on the same team.","fast paced and always changing. If you don't do well with change, Venterra is not the place for you. 

May be time to revisit vacation time in general."
12,Venterra Realty,I love the companyI work for,2022-01-10,5.0,Maintenance Supervisor,Venterra recognizes and rewards my talents. I am not micro managed. My opinion is valued. The culture @ Venterra is second to none. So proud to call Venterra my favorite employer ever. I am compensated well for my experience.,Trying to fill available positions with the right talent. But this has to do with the time we live in and not the company
13,Venterra Realty,I am better because of Venterra.,2021-09-17,5.0,Employee Experience Manager,"Looking back over the time I have spent with Venterra, I can't help but notice the personal and professional growth that has happened while here. Prior to joining Venterra, every place I worked was just ""a job"", but from my first day with Venterra, I knew this place was different. Many places say they are like a family- but with Venterra- it has been true! I am consistently pushed to be the best version of myself by my peers and leaders. I am invited to show up every day to work and leave with a sense of accomplishing something special. You know it is a special company when lifelong friends outside of the business can tell me how proud they are of my growth since joining Venterra. Something like that is so valuable!","This company is not for someone who is looking for 'just a job"". You will be pushed and held to very high standards, but that is who we are!"
14,Venterra Realty,Venterra is the place to go to grow!,2021-12-02,5.0,Area Manager,"You make a difference. Your voice is heard regardless of your title within the organization. Culture and employee benefits are incredible. We make time to have fun! Venterra is innovative and forward-thinking while not losing sight of the most important thing, their employees who work daily to serve others. I started 5.5 years ago with zero experience and have had the opportunity to serve as a Leasing Consultant, Senior Leasing Consultant, Community Manager, Senior Community Manager, and now newly created position Area Manager. If you are ready to grow, Venterra is the place to go!","I love Venterra, I do not have any cons."
15,Venterra Realty,Certified Make Ready,2022-01-18,5.0,Certified Make Ready,Venterra is an awesome company to work for. Very family oriented company. Takes care of their employees always.,"Sometimes the work load can be overwhelming, but we contract out as needed to ensure that the work completes."
16,Venterra Realty,Not a fulfilling workplace,2021-12-21,1.0,Better Living Consultant,They give you good time off but good luck trying to get time off because the managers have ulterior motives. They don't give you time off easily especially when you work hard.,"There are a lot of politics. It's like poison. The regional manager and managers all play politics. The regional manager may not be aware of property managers assigning leases to the assistant manager when she hasn't even worked for it. Plus property managers give time off to assistant managers in the form of sick days despite them not being sick. The company lacks ethics. For example, they claimed they sprayed apartments for covid when they weren't even fully cleaned. You're ultimately a number to get the job done for the investors. You will not have any wealth for retirement. It's for people who like a paycheck and comfort. Zero growth or fulfilment."
17,Venterra Realty,No way,2022-02-23,1.0,Assistant Maintenance Manager,None to mention. Not worth it.,Micromanaging is a thing. They are very judgmental of new employees. They provided almost no training. They do not care about their employees unless you are in tight with the regionals or area managers. One of the worst companies I have ever worked for. Don't fall for their false promises and lies.

21,Venterra Realty,Great Company,2022-01-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,People care about you. Good compensation. Overall pleased.,None that I can think of.
22,Venterra Realty,Great Company,2021-12-22,5.0,Community Manager,Venterra is such a great company to work for. They take care of their employees and really listen to our ideas and any concerns we may have. Very caring company in all aspects. I actually love coming to work!,I actually have no cons!
23,Venterra Realty,My 4 Year Mark,2021-10-22,5.0,Assistant Maintenance Manager,"I have worked for many management companies and private owners over my 10 years in maintenance. This has been the only management company that has treated me with the respect and care that I deserve. They value my opinion. They allow you to make mistakes and grow from them. Every staff member and corporate personnel is down to earth and knowledgeable in their field. I can't say that about too many others. Where people lack in experience, they make up for it by asking questions. It has been great working for Venterra.","This is regionally specific, but it can be hard to move up once you hit certain positions. It isn't so much that they are only looking for people from the outside to lead, but the opportunities for advancement hit a wall if the company hasn't focused as much in acquiring other properties in the region. Sometimes it's the market; sometimes it's a lack of future venture in the region.

If you are a Mentor, you go to different properties to train new people and help them become ""Venterrized"". There aren't many people in each region to do this job, so we may use Microsoft Teams to train them. Teams, while useful in some settings, is not well suited for maintenance personnel training. It also doesn't come with a raise. If the Mentor and Mentee both fill out a survey, the mentor gets a small bonus. But, for a multitude of reasons, the Mentee does not fill out a survey and the Mentor does not receive the bonus. It may be wise to include a raise ($.25, $.50 etc.) for those people that want to go above and beyond the job they originally were hired to do. It isn't much of a con to me, but it does get annoying."
24,Venterra Realty,Great Company to work  for!,2021-12-21,5.0,Community Manager,"Great salary and benefits. Compassionate managers, diverse company where all employees have a voice.",none at this time that does not come along with any job opportunity
25,Venterra Realty,"Culture, Innovation, and Growth Opportunities",2021-08-03,5.0,Sales Manager,"Culture at Venterra isn't ancillary. It's part of the fabric of who we are, which makes it hard for other companies to replicate. From top to bottom, Venterra people live and breathe our culture of caring more about our impact on both our renters and our team members, and their experiences. That's the x-factor for me that makes my job so rewarding, and differentiating compared to our competitors in the same space. Combine that with Venterra's early quest to become a technology company with a constant goal to innovate as well as the growth opportunities presented to all of our team members, it's the ""why"" behind my longevity. I'm a living, breathing example starting as a part-time Leasing Consultant taking college classes 7 years ago.","I'm required to include something here to submit my post. Venterra is fast-paced, constantly growing, and isn't afraid to change to keep ahead of the curve. Those are Pros in my book."

27,Venterra Realty,**4 years later and I still love it here**,2021-02-26,5.0,Property Manager,"I have been with Venterra now for 4 years and I am so thankful to be a part of this team. My direct manager makes me feel valued, gives constant feedback so I always know what is expected of me, and she values my input. One of the things I love most about working here is the lack of cattiness, I know it seems crazy, but if you have ever worked in a negative environment, you really appreciate it when you no longer deal with that. Venterra values their people and when they say ""Team First"" they mean it. The benefits are wonderful, I was recently out on FMLA while having bilateral knee replacement, and my supervisor was super supportive, she never made me fear for my job and often checked in on me asking me to rest and take time to recover. My coworkers, supported me by helping out with my community and my team, I never feared for my job, I knew they had it in hand! I get 3 weeks of paid vacation, life insurance, medical, dental, 401K, vision, discount program through several vendors and retailers, and have 2 vacation sites available to me for free through the company! This is truly a great place to work!","We are a small property management company, and employees are happy and don't leave, this makes it hard to get a promotion.

35,Venterra Realty,"It's like white-water rafting. The question is, do you like white-water rafting?",2021-12-01,4.0,"Vice President, Innovation","When I started with Venterra, what caught my attention was that they were a young startup with tons of growth potential. The first interview I had was by phone with an executive in Canada. My second, another phone interview with a different executive in Canada. By the end of the second call, my curiosity was piqued, as both interviewers were very passionate about the company they were building. At the time, I was in Austin, but to meet with a third person, I needed to drive to a property they had just acquired in Arlington, TX. 

I circled that property three times before deciding that driving off was not an option! Let’s just say the curb appeal wasn’t the best. But I committed to the interview, someone was waiting inside, and I needed to at least see it through, but my head was already back in Austin. Or so I thought. Once again, I was met with passion, and real talk about real problems that Venterra wanted to solve. Venterra's values were impressed on me now for a third time: Honesty and Integrity, Humility, Never-ending Pursuit of Excellence, Candor and Openness, Team First, Unparalleled Service Excellence, and Prudent Cost Management. Now, every company has corporate values, but trust me, few truly live and run their company by them. I knew this first-hand, and Venterra's values aligned with my own. Specifically, I prefer to be honest and candid with people,over playing politics, and I pursue the best in everything I do; both traits which I’ve been known to sometimes exhibit to a fault. 

In the end (of the beginning), what got me to say yes (when I was a hard ""no"") was the people and their passion for what they were building. I wanted in and was hungry to make an impact, but I had no intention of being here still, 17 years later. 

As I reflect on my tenure, I am very much aware of why I have stayed and continue to believe in Venterra: Synergy. Aligned values. Excellent leadership. And the autonomy, tools, and trust to try to make the world a better place every day. It’s more like a long-term, solid friendship than a job. We discuss problems that need to be solved, we get real, we have fun together. We understand that while there will always be challenging times, we are in it together, for the long haul. We are in it to support one another and ensure that everyone is living up to our highest potential. 

I am grateful to have spent the last 17 years with Venterra. I have been exposed to and learned so much from great and smart people, and I am so grateful for the growth, both internally and externally, that we’ve all experienced.","Working for Venterra isn't for everyone, though. It has the heart of a start-up and the mind of the tenured 20-year company that it is. I often say my job is a lot like white-water rafting but in the nude. It's fun and exciting, scary as hell, stressful, and leaves me feeling vulnerable sometimes, but, we get through it, together. If you aren't afraid of hard work, are looking to make an impact, if you’re looking for the real deal, if you're looking for opportunities, and most importantly - this one is a must - if you share our values, come on board!"

-Comradery is a huge factor at play. Everyone has your back. You're protected, and you're mentored. If you make a mistake, the only one ever mad is yourself. Everyone around you will help and guide you.
-You are respected at an unmatched level by superiors and your team. Everyone looks at you as an equal and valuable asset whether you bring an idea, a statement, or an opinion.
-The pay is fantastic. The benefits are fantastic. Education, Health, Dental, Vision, 3rd party packages, etc.

I speak for those around me who've confided their feelings about being on call, I am very passionate and loving of my job and will take the calls all day and night happily. But summer time, and extreme weather events tend to rake in the hours at unusual times making your week on call a very exhausting and stretched out week.

Everyone here genuinely represents the company's values and the leadership team regularly use the values as a North-star for the decisions they're making.
* The service we offer is a home, it's where people live. Every decision made can have a profound effect in someone's life.
* The industry is outdated and going through a critical phase where everyone is trying to catch-up to modern tools, standards, and processes. This provides many opportunities for each employee to have a big impact in the company's success.
* It's just as common to encounter employees that have been with the company since near its inception as it is to encounter new employees. There is strong tenure, people are happy here so they stay.","* Leadership team has embraced change a bit too much and is trying to become the first to adopt unproven technology. The pace at which things are implemented or change can sometimes be overwhelming.
* The expected pace of progress makes it difficult to make objective and empirically-sound decisions. Analytical minds that are not comfortable making decisions based primarily on intuition and experience may feel frustrated at times."

51,Venterra Realty,Getting Better and Better,2021-01-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"They really put a lot of effort into their culture and creating a fair and healthy environment for all employees through compensation reviews, management surveys, company-wide conferences, employee education stipends, flexible hours for personal needs, paid volunteer time, etc. They are constantly working to improve their culture, as opposed to the 'set it and forget it' culture I have seen elsewhere. In the few years I have been here, Venterra has only gotten more collaborative, more caring, and more inclusive, which is pretty impressive given the fact that the company hit its 20 years very recently.","Venterra is always ready for technological adaptation but struggles with adapting to unforeseen (especially personnel) changes. The last few staffing changes in our office were unexpected and created pretty massive waves in the work-life balance and workload of many others in the group, lasting many months after the event. This likely could have been avoided with redundancy planning. This can make their goal setting structure quite difficult to adhere to."

Workstation isn't ergonomic. It's literally painful to sit at my desk daily because of my chair. 
Quarterly Bonuses for BLCs look more like a rounding error than a bonus.
The first week of the month I don't get any days off. It'll switch between working 7 days in a row or 8 days depending on the month. Because of how the pay period works, you don't get any over time. So you're basically working 60 hours in one week but with no overtime to make it worth it."

All of the little things that Venterra does to really prove that the people are so important really snowball into such a wonderful company.

People ask me how I can stay with the same company for so long and I tell them that 13 years feels like it flew by because of the amount of fun and fulfillment this organization brings to my life.,"Still no profit sharing program for employees.  I think we should put more effort into setting up a profit sharing or investment program for employees.  I understand it is complicated but it is worth the effort for our people.  No one matches us on culture or quality of our people and I hope that one day, no other organization can match us on how we give back to the people that work so hard to make this organization great."

92,Venterra Realty,The worst decision I’ve ever made,2020-11-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Sometimes they paid for food,"This is a company that has no idea of the direction they intend to go. This company wants to run in 20 different directions all at once. Not a great place for someone who is a thinker and tends to have innovative and creative ideas. Ideas were constantly shut down by management. You would think they would embrace new ideas given that their whole ppc catalogue was severely flawed. For example, most of the portfolio had keywords and ads that said houses for sale when they ONLY rent out apartments. 
This is not a place you would want to work if you prefer to have some kind of structure. The department is disorganized and chaotic. They do not have a centralized location to manage tasks and communication. Instead they have a ton of excel spreadsheets, Voxer (which wasn’t bad), they have like 40 or more teams channels (when I asked my manager which ones I need to keep up with I was told all of them), they use trello (something I suggested to centralize tasks and communication. I did not expect for it to just be one more thing to keep up with), they used Dropbox, of course they used emails, phone conversations and more. Due to this chaotic system it was easy for management to say they assigned work that was never actually assigned. They can easily say it was discussed on a phone conversation that never took place. It covers them but throws the employee under the bus. 
There’s been times I would need to do my work 2 or 3 times because everyone had edit access to excel and someone would erase my work. This job offers NO training. They expect you to just come in and easily adapt to their disorganized chaos. 
Let’s also talk about meetings! It is not uncommon for the director to announce a mandatory meeting at 4pm to be held at 5pm the same day and last up to 2-3 hours. In a lot of those meetings I had no idea what was even being discussed (hence the lack of any training). When I said I don’t know about any of this stuff, the response would be you’ll get it eventually. Eventually never came. 
This company is the definition of micromanagement. It got to a point where I decided to show them how ridiculous they were being by providing them with a progress report daily. I thought they would have looked at it and realized that I was working hard and that they were being unreasonable in constantly checking on me. I was wrong. Instead it just became a requirement that I provide this report daily. 
The sheer volume of work is ridiculous. I held a job that could have easily been split into 3-4 jobs. I was a ppc specialist, a seo specialist, social media specialist, data analyst, a strategist (all though none of my suggestions were ever appreciated), etc... This may not seem like a lot until you consider that they have over 60 locations and counting. To break this down, their PPC portfolio alone would contain about 50-60 campaigns. Each campaign had at least 3 ads per ad group. Some campaigns had more than one ad group. At any given moment they can say we want to run a new promo and need to change all the ads. That’s 150 - 200 ads that need to be changed right away. Updating that many ads by yourself can easily take a whole work day or 2. Sure they will say they will help. The times that help was offered, they bailed after doing just a few campaigns due to having other work to do. There was a time that I ended up working late to change the ads and even got up at 4am to complete the remaining ads. This extra work and dedication was overlooked and not appreciated at all. 
I worked hard and at one point I was told regularly how good of a job I was doing. I was told “I don’t know what we would do with our you”. Of course all of that was just empty words because not even a month later I was fired and I was told how horrible of an employee I was. I was fired in the middle of a pandemic with a 7 month pregnant wife who was on my insurance along with my kids. I was thrown away like garbage and all the work I did for them didn’t matter anymore. They made it clear that I was nothing to them. No job should make their employees feel that way."

112,Venterra Realty,Fantastic place to live,2020-02-10,5.0,Better Living Manager,I Love the atmosphere. We are a very close-knit family. I also appreciate that they encourage you to put your own family first,"I wish we could wear jeans more frequently, business casual and wish Venetrra paid more or gave a better discount off rent."
113,Venterra Realty,It was great,2020-05-19,5.0,Assistant,They ready care about residents,The pay is not so great
114,Venterra Realty,"Fantastic, Humble Company!",2019-12-17,5.0,Community Manager,"Your voice is heard here. You are not judged for your opinions, but they are actually celebrated and taken into account for making positive changes within the company. The corporate people are extremely involved, not making it feel like I work for some big headquarters that doesn't respect or hear me. I love this company and everything it stands for!",I cannot think of any cons
115,Venterra Realty,Great Company!,2020-01-17,5.0,Better Living Manager,"This a very fun and friendly work environment.  Property management can be stressful in itself, but this company makes it fun to be a part of!  They also care about their residents and their well being.","Very corporate structure.  Sometimes hard with negotiating prices of vendors, etc."
116,Venterra Realty,Best management company I've ever worked for.,2019-10-22,5.0,Assistant Maintenance Manager,"Out of all the programs that this company has (education assistance, paid days off, WOW program, etc.), the only thing that really mattered to me was that I was treated right. Usually maintenance doesn't get treated well or even like a person. Venterra has given me hope that there are companies out there that have some decency and morality when it comes to their employees.",I havent found one yet worth mentioning.
117,Venterra Realty,The best company I have ever worked for!,2020-01-27,5.0,Better Living Manager,"Great benefits, positive work environment, and excellent opportunity for growth and learning.",I honestly do not have any cons working here.
118,Venterra Realty,Leasing Specialist,2020-01-27,5.0,Billing Leasing Specialist,I have been treated with the utmost respect and they understand that my school schedule may interfere with work and they are very flexible.,I have not experienced any downsides
119,Venterra Realty,Great company,2020-02-13,5.0,Assistant Maintenance Manager,Great place to work  great team as management and higher up,No cons great place to work friendly management
120,Venterra Realty,7 years and counting,2019-07-17,5.0,Community Manager,I have been working for the company for 7 years and didn't even notice how fast time went by. I enjoy coming to work for many reasons and the one and most important is my company. The culture is unique and makes you feel and know that you're an important piece of this organization and play and a huge role in its development and growth. Your opinion matters and your suggestions are being taken seriously. This not only makes your job meaningful but also makes you feel appreciated and valued.,Can't think of any major flaws.
121,Venterra Realty,AMAZING place to work,2019-12-06,5.0,Better Living Consultant,"Amazing people, amazing training, best support system",I do not have any
122,Venterra Realty,More than just a job... it is a family!,2018-08-08,5.0,Community Manager,"Venterra is the best company I have had the pleasure of joining. I have an abundance of support, resources, and educational opportunities to perform to the best of my ability! Not only does the company stay progressive with modern innovations, but Venterra really “Cares” about their employees and work hard to maintain a culture of like-minded individuals with a strong work ethic and morals. One of the biggest differences that comes to mind, compared to my previous property management companies, is the contact with corporate superiors, including the CEO and COO. They are easily accessible, personable, get to know you as individuals, (despite the hundreds of employees across different regions) they value your opinions, and provide you with exceptional resources and training to run a property to its fullest potential to create a community where residents feel respected and cared for. I attribute this to the employees feeling respected and cared for, which reflects strongly in everyday operations. I had the option of transferring to another company because my property is selling, but made the easy choice to remain loyal to Venterra! The Dallas Regional Manager is the best I have ever worked with, the  properties in the region function as a team, constantly helping and supporting other locations, lending staff members to aid in heavy work load situations, sharing tips, experiences, etc. - ultimately contributing even more to a GREAT PLACE TO WORK!",Orange is my least favorite color... ;)
123,Venterra Realty,My Favorite Company So Far,2014-10-07,5.0,Leaisng Consultant,"I have been with Venterra for almost 2 years and have loved working for the company. I was new to property management when I started and fell in love with it. I love that we have an opportunity to WOW our residents. Each month, we have an allotted amount of money to do something special for a resident or residents that we see fit that particular month, whether it's someone who had an unfortunate situation come up or that we just wanted to surprise. That has been my favorite part of working for Venterra so far. I feel like an individual that the company cares about, and not just a number, as so many employers look at their employees. I base my life around integrity and would not be able to work for a company who didn't represent strong values and exemplify integrity in their policies. I think we have more than enough opportunities to extend our education and learn from others in the company. Richard, our COO is awesome and actually visits the communities enough so that employees actually get to know him. I think the long interview process shows that they really care about who they hire and about finding the right long term employees. Compensation is fair, although I do wish our raises were higher, but who doesn't want that? Overall, my experience has been very positive and I plan on staying with the company for a long time!",I work in one of the Nashville locations and I do wish there were more properties out here and room to grow with the company in Nashville.
124,Venterra Realty,Regional Manager,2017-07-17,5.0,Regional Manager,"I just hit my 5 year mark and I can tell you the biggest PRO of working for Venterra Realty is the people.  I work for the most amazing, talented, genuine folks in the industry.  There are no hidden agenda's or political games.  It is what it is.   The next Pro is everyone else loves working for Venterra as well.  It's so great to work with other people that love coming to work each day.  There is great energy and an unbelievable work environment.  The leaders have incredible work ethics, (never expecting more out of you than what they would give themselves) and impeccable character.   They manage people the right way.  I've worked for companies that just didn't get it and can honestly say they, we and I....get it.  This company has the ""IT"" of ""they get it""  
Another PRO is we are growing because we are stable.  There is so much opportunity for those that want it.  If you are hungry to grow you can get on a path and move in that direction.  
Lastly, we care about the customer.  We are not just talk.  Venterra has programs in place that reward employees for going out of their way to give back to the customer.  We also have a program to give back to each other.  We have incentives in place to make sure we are treating our customers and fellow employees with the best appreciation/service/ and gratitude on the planet. It just doesn't get better than Venterra Realty.",Any cons I would have are just normal industry cons...not related to Venterra.
125,Venterra Realty,A place of work where my talents are utilized and I feel appreciated everyday I come to work.,2014-10-06,5.0,Leasing Agent,"This company really makes you feel valued and appreciated which is something I've never experienced on the job before. Everyone I've met so far in management is friendly, helpful, positive, and motivational. They really invest in their employees and set them up for success. Even when you make mistakes they are corrected in a positive and upbeat manner. This company also has several initiatives to better the employees lives. For example the better living campaign: Where you post your goals (work related or not, mostly not) and fellow colleagues and management can post words of encouragement and really join in on the process. I find this so conducive to the positive attitude I bring to work. It's nice to know the company I work for is really interested in my happiness. What more could you ask for?","The only Con I have experienced since joining this company in July is the often rude, entitled and disgruntled TENANTS at the property I work at. I often find myself completely drained trying to help someone who is refusing to be helped. I'm learning not to take it so personally. This is not really a Venterra issue, more of a site specific issue for those of us on property. Also the starting pay is a little low, however I do appreciate that you are eligible for a raise every 3 months. <3"
126,Venterra Realty,The sky is the limit with Venterra,2018-05-22,5.0,Community Manager,"I could never imagine working for a company other than Venterra! If you are looking for a company deep-rooted in their Core Values who values YOU on a professional and personal level, look no further! I have been with Venterra for 2 years and the opportunities that I have been given in my short tenure are unbelievable! I do not feel that I am an employee working for a company, I feel that I am part of a family, the Venterra family! We work very hard but ALWAYS make time to have fun! I feel supported on a daily basis and am given the autonomy to make decisions. Venterra has made me a better person. We have education assistance to allow us to continue our journey in our growth and development. We are given the day off to volunteer through Venterra Cares, by helping others and enriching our own lives simultaneously. We have Fun Fridays allowing us to dress up in specified themes and have a blast at work with our team! Birthdays are celebrated with a paid day off, company anniversaries are celebrated, all milestones are celebrated! We have bring your dog to work day! The list goes on and on.... Health benefits, 401K...The money is great! We bonus quarterly and have the opportunity to earn commissions daily! The sky is the limit with Venterra, I believe that with my whole heart!",I didn't find Venterra sooner!
127,Venterra Realty,Finally A Company That Loves Their Employees,2019-08-10,5.0,Better Living Manager,"Benefits, schedule, Life long learning, training, pay and so much more!",Nothing that I can think of.
128,Venterra Realty,Customer service inside and out,2014-08-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It is truly a rare instance when a company practices what they preach.  Venterra is one of those companies.  The Multi-Family Real Estate world is full of providers that market customer service as a cornerstone to apartment living, but there are only a few that actually place a strong focus on the effort in terms of programs and awards/support.  The key is to support the effort from the top to the bottom.  Venterra's leaders place a strong focus on providing exceptional customer service to the team members who, in turn, provide the same experience for our residents.  Internal programs are highlighted with awards/prizes and include the Better Way - which offers the opportunity to identify areas for improvement and Better Living - which provides a forum for team members to create personal goals and cheer each other on to achieving personal milestones.  These programs and the backing of senior leadership create a fun and very positive working environment.","Expectations are very high and demands placed on team members are equally challenging.  While the company places a high value on work/life balance, those that do not place high emphasis on time management and personal organization will struggle to take advantage of the work/life opportunities.  Be prepared to get to work!"
129,Venterra Realty,Changing for the Worst!!,2019-05-13,2.0,Leasing,"Competitive salaries, training, benefits and culture.","There is a growing disconnect between corporate and their existing properties. Company is continuously cutting the budget for things that made Venterra the great company it used to be. They cut down on small things such as welcome gifts, upgrades, hospitality items for prospects, event budget, employee compensation, etc. It may not seem like a big problem from corporate’s point of view but the residents/prospects/employees are noticing and they are turning their eye elsewhere. 

The competitors around are investing into their properties. Meanwhile, we are cutting corners on small things and expecting consultants to step in and produce sells based on personalities alone. The thing is, the new leasing process is a step by step routine that leaves little room for personality. It’s all about the sale. You’re also getting tested on how well you follow the steps. See the issue? 

Lower management is pressured to make due with the budget that they have. It is becoming unrealistic. All of this happens while Venterra buys new property after new property.  It is still a good place to work but I am afraid Venterra is heading down a bad path. This company is losing its core values along with some great people."
