1,Wpromote,SEO account manager,2022-03-16,5.0,SEO Account Manager,great work life balance / great team,some people are too opinionated and it goes a long way with upp management
2,Wpromote,Don’t believe the high rating,2022-02-18,1.0,Manager,Smart coworkers and Interesting clients,"Take the high reviews here lightly, they ask all new employees at 30 days to fill out a review. It’s an Asana task.

Recent meeting they said the employee retention rate is 47%. This is a job that will overwork you and burn out is very real here. There are a handful of people who’ve worked here for years. However, the large majority of employees are less than a year. I noticed a lot of people leaving around the 5/6 month mark. 

They are massively growing, taking on larger clients without the full staff to support. A lot of useless tasks that keep you from actually being able to strategize and optimize well. At this company you’ll be on 2 large clients or 5 smaller ones. The workload is insane. For perspective of workload, at other agencies employees are on 1 large client or 2 smaller ones. 

Required to work on important weekends to the client and holidays because no one pushes back on the clients. Multiple reports due on holidays. Certain clients are required to work weekends if there is an important campaign launch for someone to keep an eye on it or in case the client wants to change spend. Have your clients set an agreed spend amount on campaigns…like every other agency in this business. No one wants to be working a lot of weekends and every other other holiday, contributes to a lot of burnout. 

I heard a lot of my coworkers feel like they couldn’t utilize the unlimited PTO and half day Fridays because of workload and low staffing on teams."
3,Wpromote,Untrustworthy,2022-01-12,2.0,Content Writer,"- the people (two years later, and I still keep in touch with many!)
- the unlimited PTO (though some could say this is a con since some teams are strict with approval and the PTO has no value when you leave)
- the casual office environment","Most of my team and another team were laid off in early, pre-pandemic 2020 after Wpromote lost a huge client. Some employees were given fair notice and moved to different departments. In contrast, my team was suddenly laid off one by one, while our remaining team members were being watched in a meeting and unable to say goodbye. Our emails were disabled before we were officially told the news, and they took their sweet time getting to everyone, so some of us were waiting around for an hour or two. There's no easy way to lay off employees—I get that—but this was an objectively bad way to do it. The company will say they helped us land on our feet by offering outplacement services, but that means very little when other employees were moved internally and had a month or two notice, while my team was taken entirely by surprise. 

While I loved the work I did and the people I met through Wpromote, I wouldn't trust them as an employer. They started explicitly asking new hires to write 5-star Glassdoor reviews in March 2020, so I'd also be cautious of the overly positive reviews you see here."
4,Wpromote,Amazing Experience So Far!,2021-12-09,5.0,Paid Social Manager,"- Challenger Mindset: This is a great place to grow your career in digital marketing. Everyone I have worked with has been very smart and creative, and the clients are high-profile and really interesting. 
- Hybrid Model: Working from the office is also totally optional but if you live in a big city there are happy hours you can attend to actually meet your co-workers. 
- Good work/life balance so far: Unlimited PTO, Half day Fridays and so far I haven't had any experiences working past office hours - as long as you get your work done on time and meet expectations, you're good.
- Benefits are really good and the salaries are very competitive.","- Onboarding virtually is a difficult experience but this is true of any company. WPromote does its best to make it as seamless as possible.
- If you work on e-commerce clients, there is an expectation to be checking in on work and available during major cyber holidays like Black Friday/Cyber Monday or Christmas. But to be fair this is balanced out by unlimited PTO so you can unplug whenever feels right for you!"
5,Wpromote,"Big Company, Big Benefits, Small ""Feel""",2022-01-12,5.0,Technical Account Manager,"Wpromote is quite large (700+ employees) which gives the company the ability to offer many great benefits, an interesting mix of clients (some household names), and plenty of opportunities for growth. However, despite the explosive growth the company has had, every effort is made to keep the company friendly and keep the employees involved, making the employee experience more like that of a smaller company. While the company is well structured with layer of management a separation of departments, it doesn't feel ""corporate"".

There is great value placed on work/life balance, too. I am able to work remotely, be somewhat flexible with my schedule when needed (within reason, as clients have expectations as to when I am available), and I don't worry about being looked down on if I have to call out because my kid is sick.","I honestly can't think of a con worth writing about. Like any job, some weeks are better than others and growth comes with growing pains, but it is well managed."
6,Wpromote,"So far, very good",2021-08-17,5.0,Senior Paid Search Manager,"-The onboarding process is extensive, but there is so much to learn in media. I didn't have access to resources, all in one place, like at Wpromote. 
-The knowledge sharing between team members + teams is really cool. Wpromote isn't siloed; insights for one account are shared with other accounts as possible wins or implementations. 
-The people director/strategy director model they utilize in PPC is really cool. And it seems like they have filled these director roles with people who actually are skilled in that part of the job.
-Most people are extremely smart. They have curated some serious talent.
-They do CEO shoutouts where you write in shoutouts for your co-workers and Michael Mothner (CEO) reads them on a video sent to all employees on Friday. It's a super cool part of the culture.","-If you come in with knowledge on how to do your role, you may have to shift your ""ways of working"" to fit the Wpromote model. This is not a huge con per se since the Wpromote model is an efficient model.
-They ask (I promise it is optional; they went out of their way to say that) that you leave a Glassdoor review after your first 30 days, which is a good strategy for boosting their rating on the platform. I'm not saying it's a bad thing to do, since Glassdoor can be SO negative, and people who are having a good time tend to forget to write these reviews. But to whoever's reading this- it's something to be aware of as you read these."
7,Wpromote,Great place to work,2022-03-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Very Organized
- Transparent review/promotion cycle
- Vocal leadership
- Great hours","- Dealing with clients in an agency setting can be difficult
- No bonuses"
8,Wpromote,"Not just a number, actually feel valued as a person",2022-01-25,5.0,Senior Data Analyst,"-The People — EVERYONE IS SO NICE! I cannot stress this enough. People are all smart and willing to help and they genuinely want to create work friendships. Leadership also gives kudos and shoutouts multiple times a week. The work environment is very uplifting.
-Interesting work — There’s a lot of high profile clients that have really interesting challenges to work on. None of my clients are from the same industry so there’s a lot of variety in the day to day work.
- Work Life Balance — The half day Fridays make it feel like we have 3 day weekends and it’s amazing. They also have about 21 paid holidays that the office is closed on so everyone has them off.  To top it off there’s unlimited PTO, which is usually a bad thing, but this company does not have that “take as little as possible” mentality that usually comes along with it.
— Benefits - The insurance (if just one adult) is AMAZING. They cover 80-95% of insurance premiums.
— Continuing Education — there is not tuition assistance, but they give unlimited access to LinkedIn Learnings, Udemy, Datacamp, and others. There’s also internal learnings as well.","Growing Pains — Wpromote has experienced explosive growth, which is great for job security and company health as a whole, but it means that there’s few experienced people relative to new people. My department is only about a year old and is lacking in training materials. People on the team are working to improve this, but it can be challenging to get started on projects.
Excessive Meetings — It feels like the majority of the work day is dedicated to meetings. Not all of these are important and it does get draining.
Macs — The work computer is a Mac with no USB ports. There’s a lot of extra cables and dongles needed."
9,Wpromote,Love this place,2022-03-10,5.0,Associate Director,Amazing to work for Wpromote I love it here!,Nothing Much to report here at all!

I get to work on bigger clients than I thought I would at this stage of my career. I work with really smart, fun people.","It's an agency, so the hours are long sometimes depending on the clients. But there is a lot of flexibility and half-day Fridays really help."
12,Wpromote,Great place to work,2022-02-20,5.0,Paid Search Coordinator,They really value you’re professional development,Agency life can be a lot of work
13,Wpromote,As good as it seems,2022-01-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great people, transparent and supportive leadership, excellent benefits (18 weeks paid maternity leave, 12 weeks paid paternity), remote friendly, great salary.",Company is HQed in CA so their health benefits for employees outside CA are just OK. Not excellent and not terrible.
14,Wpromote,Amazing work environment,2022-01-12,5.0,Executive Assistant,"Working here is like working with a community, the level of respect and care everyone shows for each other is evident from the top down. We work hard but they also value a work-life balance and to take care of their employees.","It's a fast-growing company and with that comes growing pains, but I believe they still manage to keep that sense of community even with growth."
15,Wpromote,Glad to Leave,2022-01-25,2.0,Senior Paid Media Manager,"- Lots of communication from leadership about what's going on in the company.
- Generous time-off policy is offered.
- Flexible work home policy.
- Lots of clients at different levels so there can be a lot of opportunities to gain experience.
- Lots of company culture groups.","- They boast about generous PTO and half days but the ability to actually take advantage of this was extremely minimal from my position outside. Why? Because work has to still be covered, so as you become a senior person who is involved in important projects, which is inevitable, you have to be present with high regularity. Or you're just dumping that responsibility onto your friends and co-workers who are also at capacity. To that, the main impression I got from working here was that numbers are the most important thing. The higher the number of clients they can say they have, the more, or really larger, clients they cant try to get to make more revenue for the company. So there's a gap between work and workers, again affecting taking advantage of the time-off offerings.

- There's a lot of superficial and artificial praise here. So much so that if you don't submit praise for people, maybe because it's just a normal week and there's not always something extraordinary that happens in work, you will receive company-wide followups to submit.

- I didn't feel like the senior leadership had a solid oversight over some of the paid media.

- To me, there really seems to be one focus here, acquire, acquire, acquire. The more the company has the more it control and that's what it wants to leverage in gaining larger clients and larger clients mean more revenue. There's a good amount of effort to create a positive experience but because of other factors, this really became nothing more than hypocritical comments and showmanship to me. They need to continually exhibit positive reinforcement to create loyalty to help overcome the shortcomings of unrealized promises."

Everyone at this agency is extremely intelligent, supportive, helpful and willing to share knowledge across teams. As my first agency gig, I am exposed to a plethora of platforms which allows me to continue to learn and grow. They also have an amazing rolodex of clients and are still continuing to hire to help support the growth across all business units.","Starting a new job remote can have it's challenges like building working relationships across teams and high-churn on agency side.

I had little to no experience when they hired me, and they are taking the time to train me and give me as much knowledge and experience as possible before I do things on my own.

56,Wpromote,Great Agency So Far,2020-12-02,5.0,"Manager, Paid Social Media","Interesting clients, a lot of cool coworkers to meet via Google Hangouts, HR sent me a desktop for my home office when I requested it.

There's a lot of processes to get used to but it makes you feel informed about what's going on in the agency outside your clients. 

From what I can tell so far, promotions are based on merit/performance rather than agency politics which is a nice change.","Hours can be long, especially in Q4, but if you didn't already know that, you've never worked in an agency before.

I think it's hard to have an interesting corporate culture in a pandemic. People can't see each other, there are no face to face interactions (only hangouts). But these are things that every company is facing so it's not Wpromote's fault.

You can't manage people until you're an associate director, which leaves a lot of people at the manager/senior manager level without that necessary experience for another couple of years. As of right now, that's not a problem for me but it's definitely something I considered when accepting the offer because I won't be actually managing/honing those skills for at least another 2 1/2 years. But that's smart of Wpromote overall because people won't be able to find another job at the same level at a different agency without management skills."
57,Wpromote,Best Onbording Experience I've Ever Had,2021-07-26,5.0,Content Manager,WPromote has had the most comprehensive and organized onboarding process. Everyone is genuinely welcoming and helpful. It has been such an amazing experience thus far.,I honestly can't think of one negative thing to say about my experience so far.

I saw stressed coworkers crying multiple times and it did not feel, to me, that management did much to address concerns, despite anonymous feedback highlighting the issue on a regular basis.

Some of the managers were unprofessional and openly condescending, in my opinion. This opinion does not apply to all of the managers, but I’m sure HR reading this can guess... The atmosphere and politics in general felt like a high school, in my experience."

The company seems like they really care about maintaining a work-life balance compared to other agencies. So far I've felt very welcome and have been given enough resources to make sure I know what's expected of my job. Couldn't be happier to be a new member of such a great team!",So far the only con I can speak to is the fact that there doesn't seem to be many opportunities to earn more income throughout the year (bonuses/profit sharing/etc).

4) Leadership is dedicated to employee growth within the company.","1) As in any fast-paced environment, it can become easy to take too much on and become overwhelmed so time-management and communication with leadership of this is essential. Finding a good work/life balance can be difficult during certain times, but consistently getting in rhythms and finding ways to take breaks and develop this balance is very important and the company provides resources and supports finding this balance.

2) At times, team structures lack account support from the bottom which can tend to make bandwidth tight at times. I wouldn't consider this as much as a con but more an area of opportunity down the road."

92,Wpromote,Be very cautious with this company,2020-02-07,1.0,Content Writer,"Unlimited PTO is a plus

Work/life balance is typically good","Disloyal: The majority of an entire team and 2/3 of another team were laid off during my 10 months of employment there. Higher-ups do not take the time to get to know their employees and they view employees as expendable. Even if you do excellent work, your job is not safe.

Lack of identity: The direction of seemingly every department seemed to consistently waver. Departments rely heavily on only a few clients, making it nearly impossible to adjust if a client opts to change agencies. This negatively effects the bottom line and department stability.

Disorganized: Executives and management in general always give the impression that everything is alright, but it's purely a front. Companies that are in good standing do not undergo downsizing multiple times within a year. Not to mention, there were changes at the director and executive levels, forcing employees to adjust to new visions and strategy overhauls. This company leaves employees in the dark.

Little opportunity for growth: Title promotions are promised in certain departments; however, not granted. Budgeting is also askew and inconsistent to the point where position openings are taken down rather suddenly. If you are lucky enough to get a promotion, your salary increase will be underwhelming.

Don't get hypnotized by the unlimited PTO and benefits. They make room for those perks by sacrificing competitive salaries. Also, certain departments are very strict with PTO despite it being unlimited."

Strong culture - Selfless, compassionate organization filled with passionate people who genuinely care about one another.

Ability to move quickly - Lack of beurocracy enables any motivated employee to excel and grow into leader within organization.

Strong processes - Despite being relatively small organizationally, our operations are excellent.  Streamlined onboarding and training of talent, refined processes to ensure client success is measured and optimized for over time.",- Rapid pace means internal communication can sometimes lag behind changes made.
114,Wpromote,"Excellent for Learning, Growth and Ownership",2020-04-15,5.0,Senior Director,"- Limitless potential and opportunity. If you put in the work and prove yourself as a solid performer, there is so much upward mobility (or cross-mobility, if you want to try something new). A year or two ago, Wpromote recognized the need for more growth opportunities and created additional tiers of positions to allow for consistent growth and upward potential. As you move up, you can find your ""niche"" and to an extent really focus on what you most enjoy/where your strengths lie. Additionally, as Wpromote has grown via both acquisitions and organic growth, many have even created new roles or even departments. 
- Learning and training: One of the biggest advantages of working here is that we have clients of all sizes from all verticals, so you learn a lot, fast. If you have a question, there's almost guaranteed to be someone that can answer it. Especially as we hire at higher levels externally and integrate with our acquired agencies, someone has probably been in your situation or worked with a similar type of client/industry. We also have strong relationships with our external partners and are able to leverage those teams to help with education and learning on an ongoing basis. You are always welcome to join other teams' trainings as well so that you can diversify your knowledge beyond your day-to-day responsibilities. I personally wouldn't leave Wpromote for another agency, because I know this is so rare, but if your goal was to move to the client side you would really be set up for success across the board.  
- Collaboration: Every successful team I've been on at Wpromote has been incredibly collaborative. We communicate and learn, and we tackle challenges together, not in silos. 
- Ownership: As we have grown, we have had to put new processes/controls in place - but ultimately account managers still have incredible control and ownership of their book of business. You don't get that at other agencies. 
- Transparency: The Executive Team is fairly open and transparent about a lot of things, but if you want to know something specific, just ask. I don't know any directors/department heads/upper executives that wouldn't honestly answer your question unless it's related to personnel or something under NDA (like an impending acquisition). 
- I do believe the Executive Team has our best interests in mind and are willing to listen to feedback. Ultimately they need to prioritize serving our clients, but the best way to do so is to have engaged and happy employees. I have had multiple experiences where I have helped to change an approach by providing my perspective. Not always, of course, but I know from experience they are willing to pivot or change their minds when an alternate viewpoint is worth considering. 
- Unlimited PTO. I honestly have no idea if I take more time off than I did before we switched to Unlimited, but I am just so much more relaxed and am able to be really flexible with my personal life. No more trying to maneuver half days or trying to work while on personal trips or juggling family commitments -- I just take the day off.  I will get the work done!
- Similarly, the flexibility to WFA. Even before the COVID pandemic, Wpromote was extremely flexible to work remotely when needed (and just ""needing"" a day at home counts). When it's crazy cold, or there are CTA issues, knowing I can just say home and comfortable on a moment's notice is a huge weight off my shoulders. It also helps me spend more time with my family, who are spread all over the country. 
- Other reviews have said that you have to be in LA to get the ""full"" Wpromote culture. I strongly disagree with that. Each office has its own distinct culture, and I don't think that any one culture is ""more"" Wpromote than others. While it is true that most of our Executive Team sits in LA, every office does have at least 1-2 executive leaders.  FWIW, the Chicago office has a beautiful office with great perks (coffee, snacks, massage chair, common spaces, etc.) that rival LA -- but perks does not = culture.","- Work-life balance can be tough. There is always a lot going on at Wpromote, and of course clients can be demanding. Sometimes it just takes more than 9-5 to ensure you are doing everything to provide the best possible service for our clients. Especially now that we have so many otherwise amazing tools (Slack, Hangouts, Asana etc.) it's really easy to get sucked back into work as you're trying to sign off (or sucked back in if you quickly check in after dinner or on the weekend). The ""downside"" of unlimited PTO and WFA is that it makes it easier/more justifiable to work longer hours or on the weekends. 
- I struggle to consider this a ""con"" but much of Wpromote's growth in the last few years has been via acquisitions (Chicago is the only organically grown office). I believe the acquisitions have been excellent for bringing in new talent and clients, but there are of course operational gaps with trying to merge multiple teams into one large team.  Some of the integrations have been smoother than others, but overall I view integrations as messy and stressful - and can leave lingering differences in POVs, approaches, processes, and even attitudes/culture. 
- Because we have so many talented, motivated and hard-working people that are looking to ""get things done"", we often have too many ""top priorities"" and too many ""important projects."" Things either fall to the wayside, lower priorities supercede client work/more strategic priorities, or people work too much and burn out. Leadership has been extremely open to conversations around prioritization, but many of us do ultimately take on too much and fall into this trap."

120,Wpromote,Great place to work!,2019-08-23,5.0,Digital Marketing Manager,"Wpromote is an established agency within the digital marketing field but still has that small company feel. There are several offices located across the country yet they do a great job of keeping us all connected. The office environment is a huge perk in my opinion, even though we can work remotely if we choose, I really enjoy coming into the office every day. The office is open concept but stays quiet due to us having many private meeting rooms. We have an awesome breakroom stocked with a cereal bar, kombucha and cold brew on tap, as well as many events throughout the week. The work we do is mainly centered around SEO, PPC, and Paid Social although the industry is constantly changing and therefore so are our deliverables.  If you want to work for a fun and innovative company, this is the place to be!",Having the luxury of working remotely and also working with people in other states can bring communication complications depending on the technology used.
121,Wpromote,The benefits outweigh the cons,2020-04-15,4.0,Associate Director,"1. The company does its best to avoid layoffs. I truly believe they have done everything they can to prevent mass layoffs despite COVID-19 concerns. In the event of a large client pulling back significantly, they tried to place as many employees as possible on other teams to minimize layoffs. Some layoffs are unavoidable, but Wpromote treats them as an absolute last resort. You won't find this at many other agencies that get most of their revenue from a few large clients.

2. The company has grown very quickly in the last few years, with multiple acquisitions. Because of this, Wpromote is always in some sort of flux, meaning new ideas are embraced. You can actually make suggestions that are adopted because there is no bureaucracy that gets in the way.

3. They prioritize promoting employees from within. A lot of growth opportunities for employees who are Director and below.

4.  You'll be hard-pressed to find the work balance at Wpromote at another agency. You can actually utilize your unlimited PTO here. I've worked at other agencies who have it, but because it's unlimited, they felt like they could reach out to you any time because ""you can always take more later"". Wpromote treats your time off like time off. 

6. No micro-management. This likely depends on who your boss is, but my experience has been very positive. You are trusted to make your own decisions, and as long as your work gets done, nobody is hovering over your shoulder.

7. Variety of clients of different industries, sizes. Most departments can handle client loss and still operate as usual. You may not get to work on a large client, but job security is enhanced by this.","1. There are negatives to rapid growth. Every year working here is always different than the last and there is a lot of change to manage.

2. You won't get the full Wpromote experience if you don't work in the Los Angeles office. That being said, each office has a unique culture and I really enjoy the Dallas office culture. 

3. A lot of our upper executives got most of their experience from Wpromote. They don't have the perspective you get from working at multiple companies, and that has led to some easily avoidable mistakes. However, they have been bringing in more exec talent from other companies and that has had a positive impact.

4. There have been attitudes that other offices should be paid less due to the cost of living differences, however, other markets are still very competitive and our salaries need to be competitive as well to get and retain top talent. The company has recently come around on this though."
122,Wpromote,"Great People, Great Benefits and Quick Growth With Expected Growing Pains",2020-04-15,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Wpromote has done an amazing job providing some really great benefits to the employees in the company. While many people like to mention the unlimited PTO (which is great), it's more having management support that will encourage you to make sure you are taking time off for yourself. The work can get demanding, but knowing you have support is what really helps the work-life balance. 

The people I work with are smart, hard-working, resilient, and fun. They are always willing to help each other out when some days can be harder than others and I am always learning new perspectives and strategies from them. We challenge each other to be better, which I personally do well in these kinds of work environments. Honestly, I like what I do but the people are what keep me coming into the office with a smile on my face. 

The company is growing fast which is great and opens up opportunities throughout the company, Alot of these opportunities are what you make of them, so don't be expected to be handed anything. Hand-raisers and proactive team members will do well in those opportunities, should you want to go after them. Since there is a lot of growth, if you think if a way to do things more efficiently, people are open to hearing about it, which is cool because you feel like you are a team member and not just ""employee number XX"" on the team.","Because of the quick growth, infrastructure and processes are created as they are seen needed and things are always changing, which can get a bit exhausting at times but is with the intention of helping make things better. If you aren't good with change, this may not be the place for you. Flexibility is a trait that can help you navigate through these changes well."
123,Wpromote,"Lots of Good, Lots of Bad",2020-02-03,3.0,Digital Marketer,"The benefits: Unlimited PTO, flexible WFA, Summer Half-Day Fridays, great health insurance, etc. are all things that make it difficult to want to go anywhere else.
The Coworkers: Everyone, specifically at the entry- to mid-levels are really great. It legitimately feels like you're getting to hang out with your best friends every day.","The company has kind of adopted this attitude of ""we pay you less because your benefits are so great."" Which is true to some extent, but a quick job search will likely return several other companies with many of the same benefits and much more competitive pay.
Remote offices are kind of more like step-siblings. They were all acquisitions, so many of them have mostly continued running how they were before, just with the Wpromote name. Because of this, any of the fun Wpromote culture events and benefits the company loves to promote seem to be begrudgingly forced upon the higher ups. In many cases, it can even feel like they're actively trying to dissuade you from taking part in them. Additionally, the communication between offices is virtually non-existent. If you need to work closely with someone in another office, it can be a struggle. It's almost virtually impossible to move up in the company unless you're in the LA office.
Each department is treated differently seemingly based on how much the company values them. It can feel a bit like the episode of The Office when Sabre starts buying the salesmen nice gifts and allowing them to act however they want. Luckily, my team was one they seemed to view positively, but it was strange seeing/hearing how other teams were treated. As an example (and definitely the most extreme I saw), the company lost a very large client, which directly affected multiple teams. My team received about 2.5 months advance notice, and opportunities to move into other departments. Another team, which dealt with the same client, was promised they were fine for 2 months until one day they came into the office and were all let go. No notice, no goodbyes, no packing their desks. When pressed about why there was such a difference between how the two teams were treated, the C-levels kind of talked their way around it (as they're very good at doing). And at one point, one of them seemed to pat himself on the back for how well they had ""executed the plan."" It was a very uncomfortable meeting.
The company was started by the CEO immediately after graduating college, and he hired all of his best friends to be his execs. And they're still there to this day. I think this can be a positive because it can lead to the atmosphere of everyone feeling like friends, but sometimes there are very simple business decisions that definitely seem like they were made by a guy and his friends who are working their first job."

128,Wpromote,Awesome Culture!,2016-01-12,5.0,Account Strategist,"- Fantastic company culture: While perks like Fine Wine Friday and monthly sponsored team events are great, the real culture comes from the people who work here. Everyone is friendly, respectful and pulls for the success of others! 
- Big opportunities: Despite relative youth, we are given lots of opportunities to prove ourselves and work with some very big clients. It's a great company if you're looking to move up quickly in the business world! 
- Awesome campus: HQ in LA is fantastic - great indoor/outdoor flow, big kitchen, coffee & beer kegs, overall, a really great experience. 
- Transparent management: Management provide insights into the business with quarterly reports, and they provide anonymous feedback tools for all employees (that the COO responds to personally!!)","- IT resources: As a growing company, there are some growing pains we need to work through. One of these is IT resources, and although we have made some recent infrastructure upgrades, the team is very small and focused primarily on firefighting. 
- Interoffice engagement: Although we have a Chicago hub, most activities and interest is focused around the LA office. We see the team in IL occasionally, but it would be great to have more cohesive communication with them!"
129,Wpromote,Too Many Pros To List,2017-03-15,5.0,Senior Account Manager,"There are so many pros it's difficult to list them. Wpromote has taught me so much in so many different areas of account management, client communication, and business development. My team is made up of the most talented, inspiring, supportive people who make coming to work every day a serious joy. As the company has grown, we've been given even more tools to really succeed in the ever-changing world of digital marketing, and I actually believe in the results that our processes produce for our clients. I've always felt that my supervisors have been invested in my personal growth, and they have always been wiling to help shape my Wpro experience around my goals and expectations. I could not have been more lucky to find Wpromote, and can't imagine working anywhere else.","Starting salary isn't as high as many competitors, which at the outset can be discouraging. However, the company has worked tirelessly to increase salaries across the board as we grow, and are very open to talk about compensation anytime throughout the year - you don't have to wait until annual reviews come around."
130,Wpromote,Results-Driven Internet Marketing Company,2014-10-22,5.0,Senior SEO Manager,"Return on Performance: Wpromote evaluates all employee input and recommendations based on performance. If you have an idea on how to improve things and you can present a reasonable case there is a very high likelihood of it being implemented. I have never worked with a more open-minded company that places such a high value on employee feedback. 

People: I love the people here. On my first day I shook 126 peoples hands and I almost know everyone's name. 

Open Format: The company feels so open. Everyone sits in a single workspace with no offices. There are plenty of rooms to have more intimate discussions and client meetings. Wpromote feels like a family.

Management: This company is extremely well managed. There is a crystal clear roadmap and the employees are informed of departmental and company progress on a monthly basis.","Challenge: If you don't enjoy being challenged and made to prove your value then working at Wpromote will be very uncomfortable. There is really no where to hide in the company if you are not willing to improve your knowledge and skills. 

Accountability: Individual employees are reviewed monthly and there is a goal setting session every six months. I was shocked coming from a more lax work environment. 

Pace: The pace of the company can be very intense and I honestly felt challenged to keep up my personal growth."
131,Wpromote,"Positive, innovative company with superb work-life balance",2016-01-11,5.0,SEO Account Manager,"Wpromote is a fun, social company full of happy employees! Wpromote strives to be a leader in digital marketing and succeeds in evolving with technology. This company is ideal for newer marketers looking for agency experience and the opportunity to work on campaigns for a wide variety of companies. Wpromote offers an ultra-flexible schedule including work from home privileges and a dog-friendly campus. They also offer startup perks like free massages, yoga classes, snacks/coffee, games, and happy hour. The office is modern, beautiful, and open plan - each employee is given an Apple Suite and their own desk space. Overall, the management team is transparent and supportive - it's a joy to work here!","Initial salary offers are below the market average, but talented workers are rewarded fairly with raises and a clear path for promotion within the organization. Also, Wpromote hires many employees who are fresh out of college and promotes primarily from within, so this may not be a good culture fit for older workers."
132,Wpromote,Not a Place to Grow or Learn,2012-12-23,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:

Free coffee/tea.
Free bagel Fridays.
Free massages twice a week.
Getting to know some interesting people.","1. Hostile/Toxic Work Environment - This begins with senior management and trickles down to team members.

2. Lack of efficient company training.

3.  Task procedures at times lacked consistency. Various people giving different advice for the same type of task.

4. Blame game culture.

5. Spending a lot of time with CYA activities aka ""Cover Your A**"".

6. Low salary - this includes employees with experience as well.

7.  Over-burdening workload + low salary. 

8. Management is reactionary and handles situations based on personal emotions.

9. Immature, passive-aggressive, rude management.

10. Egos run high in management so either you are in the ""circle"" brown-nosing or a thorn in their side.

11. Account neglect.

12. Boundary issues/favoritism amongst management and team members. 

13. Personally witnessed a team member get covertly bullied by staff. This was the first red flag for me.

14. Management seems to lack experience in managing/employee relations. 

15. Gossipy culture - at times there were moments when people felt that management was talking about them to other team members in a bad way.

16. Lack of growth/learning. The atmosphere can feel as if you are set up to fail.

17. Depressed atmosphere.

18. Employees are overworked & stressed.


In my own personal experience, the cons far outweighed the pros.  Most of the issues begin with current management and how the company operates. Overtime, I got the feeling that the seniors never worked with other employers to experience how companies operate. 

 If you are the type that wants to constantly learn and experiment with new ideas and strategies, Wpromote's atmosphere does not offer it."

134,Wpromote,"Tough work, but great rewards",2015-02-02,4.0,Account Manager,"The company really cares about its employees and subsequently its clients. There are the benefits you can read about on the website like massages (my personal favorite), fine wine Friday, fun events, fresh fruit, bagels, etc., but when it comes down to it, I care more about learning and growing and our management absolutely wants that for us. We have weekly lunch and learns for anyone who wants to participate. The topics come from us. Anyone in the company can request a specific topic. On top of that, it's a client based job, and at the end of the day my name is on the work I do for my clients, so I care a lot of about delivering quality work. Thankfully, management doesn't want fast paced cookie cutter work so they can load us up with high quantities. So far every time I've asked for more resources or support, I've gotten it.","Well, at the end of the day it's still a client based job which comes with all the challenges a client based job comes with. That is less to do with Wpromote though and more to do with the industry itself. When I started with the company the salary was lower than some of the competitors, but in a pretty short period of time I've received a promotions and raises which has put me on par with the competition."
135,Wpromote,Couldn't Ask For A Better Employer,2016-12-20,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Wpromote is an amazing place to work. After 5+ years of working here, I am still challenged everyday and am constantly learning. The benefits and perks are great, but beyond that I am surrounded by colleagues who work hard and love what they do, and feel comfortable to be myself with both my peers and management. With a focus on discovering and utilizing employee's individual strengths, management makes every effort to ensure that you are happy and engaged at work and have the opportunity to make an impact on the company as a whole. There is very little day-to-day micromanagement; employees are trusted to work autonomously. I feel supported by my direct manager and have personally experienced the clear career development and growth that one hopes for from their employer. If you work hard and prove your value to the company, you will be rewarded accordingly. Employee feedback is taken seriously and always met with warm reception. Wpromote also offers great work/life balance, which is something I value greatly.",Title and compensation don't always align with industry standards.
136,Wpromote,Marketing Specialist,2015-04-16,5.0,Marketing Specialist,"In my first week at Wpromote, I felt I had learned more than I had in the previous 5 years.

Meeting with people from each department, sitting in on different department meetings, attending weekly Lunch 'n' Learns, Throwdown Thursdays, etc all offer employees the opportunity to learn about each departments' contribution to the whole process. Exploring all the areas within Wpromote is highly encouraged, and you know it's not just for the good of the company, but for your personal/professional growth. Overall, the atmosphere is awesome, with plenty of perks. Even after only a short time here, I feel like a part of a close-knit unit. It's a great group of people here, and it's clear that they really do want to help you thrive.","At times, it's difficult to know what the expectations are as a new hire and how you should go about making goals from the get-go.

They're constantly asking for feedback on how they can improve, and unlike a lot of companies they actually listen. My onboarding was a breeze, Lizzie is an amazing recruiter!

- Unlimited PTO: Seriously amazing. This perk alone has kept me from turning down jobs that paid much higher. 
- Fun environment: The corporate culture is relaxed, young, fun and modern. From ping pong to fine wine Fridays, WP works hard to make the office an environment you want to be in. 
- Occasional work from home: available in most departments. 
- Great higher-ups: They listen to what you have to say and respond in a timely manner. 
- Maternity/paternity/baby bonding period: I haven't used this personally, but have seen our offerings compared to other company maternity policies and it's pretty great.","If you're in the LA office, you're golden.
